<v Speaker 1>I have some,</v>

8
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>some important subjects that I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>vent about.</v>

9
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>So did you put them on a little note?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 1>I've got a notepad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good about doing homework.</v>

11
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>So I love your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listening through there is craft you</v>

12
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

13
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get on.</v>

14
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Are you got to bring it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>So John Dudley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world famous archery coach.</v>

16
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a TV show.</v>

17
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.280
<v Speaker 1>He's got a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>found out about you because of the TV</v>
<v Speaker 1>show first,</v>

19
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.380
<v Speaker 1>the podcast Sacramento.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became obsessed with.</v>

20
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>If you're in the archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know some of these people that</v>

21
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>are listening to this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get into archery because it sounds</v>

22
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

23
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I need a new hobby.</v>

24
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And then you go down that crazy rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>

25
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I found you,</v>

26
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're down the rabbit hole like a few</v>

27
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>light years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gone,</v>

28
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freaking Johnny Depp.</v>

29
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Then Johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gone.</v>

30
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>You're gone down though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The archery rabbit hole.</v>

31
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea the rabbit hole goes so</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

32
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:05.320
<v Speaker 1>but let's show this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to play this video.</v>

33
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 1>This is before John came up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

34
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Now I just set need to explain how</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult it is just to even hit a</v>

35
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>target at 100 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is at a hundred.</v>

36
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred yards is a football length</v>

37
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>of a football field and I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut that thing off.</v>

38
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It's just shut the volume off there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 yards of length of a football</v>

39
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:30.691
<v Speaker 1>field and for archery is just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to hit something as wide as</v>

40
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>your wingspan at 100 yards for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>average person,</v>

41
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>and so John made this ridiculous shot on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the gorilla kettlebells from</v>

42
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>onnit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

43
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>this was a solo play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This here,</v>

44
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got Joe Rogan's favorite workout</v>

45
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 2>tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got an onnit kettle,</v>

46
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>primal and Kong is going to have to make</v>

47
00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 2>a decision whether he's going to let</v>
<v Speaker 2>this era pass or not.</v>

48
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to put an Arrow through</v>
<v Speaker 2>that two inch handle right there and</v>

49
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:10.671
<v Speaker 2>actually at this distance of a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>yards and the angle that arrows to come</v>

50
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's even smaller.</v>

51
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be an unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>

52
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Definitely going to have to defy the</v>
<v Speaker 2>odds,</v>

53
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 2>my ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is right here on this shelf and</v>

54
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:27.171
<v Speaker 2>I've got a curtain right behind so</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it'll stop the Arrow but also</v>

55
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 2>let it do its thing so that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>capture all this on tape right at dark.</v>

56
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put an Arrow through a two</v>
<v Speaker 2>inch gap and the handle if calm lets it</v>

57
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:41.934
<v Speaker 2>pass.</v>

58
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>

59
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Just so ridiculous</v>

60
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 2>that that actually went in that little</v>
<v Speaker 2>hole at 100 yards.</v>

61
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to try more than one</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt at.</v>

62
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.610
<v Speaker 2>This was actually my first shot with</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything set up because I had to do a</v>

63
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 2>little bit of homework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I did was I knew I couldn't see the</v>

64
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>hole in the handle good enough to aim at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

65
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.280
<v Speaker 2>so I actually cited my bow into where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit four and a half inches high from</v>

66
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Kong's face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I literally aimed right at Kong shiny</v>

67
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 2>face and I had my both cited in to hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>four and a half inches high to make it</v>

68
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 2>through the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

69
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Spellman right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sharon was running the iphone but I had</v>

71
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 2>four cameras out so we can get some cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>angles and stuff and I wanted to wait</v>

72
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 2>till night so that that lighted nock</v>
<v Speaker 2>could give a little bit more.</v>

73
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:55.021
<v Speaker 2>Wow factor for everyone watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a ridiculous shot,</v>

74
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 2>but this is a hundred yards thanks to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audit people to for that was awesome</v>

75
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 2>and getting that thing look at that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty crazy.</v>

76
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 2>There you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

77
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 2>How awesome is that?</v>

78
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.750
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you guys watch that on Youtube.</v>

79
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>It just went off on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the knock on archery.</v>

80
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

81
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys put it up to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll put a link up.</v>

82
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie just put you,</v>

83
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>if you can tweet it and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll retweet it when we get a chance.</v>

84
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>That is insanely hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

85
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never did any archery whatsoever until</v>

86
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 1>about three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

87
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe I might've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I might've done it in the boy</v>

88
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Everyone says that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's funny is every person</v>

90
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>that finds out one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in disbelief that there's</v>

91
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>actually like professional archers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they say,</v>

92
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried archery like back in school on</v>

93
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>time and Jim and I loved it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then everyone says,</v>

94
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>but I hit my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

95
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Remember that they tried it once and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they loved it,</v>

96
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:57.190
<v Speaker 1>but they hit their arm.</v>

97
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what they always say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought you had to wear those</v>

99
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things.</v>

100
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Like when I would see people that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting bows without those risks</v>

101
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:06.170
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

102
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 1>they're like riding a motorcycle without</v>
<v Speaker 1>a helmet.</v>

103
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 1>These people are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're loose people.</v>

104
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way some people shoot it is like</v>

105
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:15.170
<v Speaker 1>riding a bike without a helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appeal some skin off.</v>

106
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Speaker 1>You do it the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've been going into over</v>
<v Speaker 1>these last couple of days with you and</v>

108
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>this one more more fascinating aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

109
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to call it a sport because</v>

110
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>I think archery is a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

111
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a discipline for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in when it's done correctly in lot</v>

112
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:35.850
<v Speaker 1>of ways it's almost like a martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like learning.</v>

113
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Art,</v>

114
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>like in martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone do something,</v>

115
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>like if someone's like really good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>judo or something like that,</v>

116
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>like when they execute throw and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just perfect position and perfect</v>

117
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>

118
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

119
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>this is like a beauty to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

120
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>And when you see an an archer like I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you about that this when I</v>

121
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>was watching and trying to get it in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

122
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.470
<v Speaker 1>this sort of follow that you have in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do and it's super similar in a</v>

123
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways and something that I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't predict.</v>

124
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess I just always assumed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of know what something is.</v>

125
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.680
<v Speaker 1>If it seems pretty straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

126
00:06:13.681 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pull the string back and then you</v>

127
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:18.010
<v Speaker 1>let the Arrow fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty straightforward,</v>

128
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>like I think that's most people's idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what archery is,</v>

129
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.310
<v Speaker 1>but then when you really pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the technical aspects of all the</v>

130
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:31.510
<v Speaker 1>different stuff that's going on and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different things you think about and</v>

131
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>how you literally can not have anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your mind other than all the</v>

132
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>technique involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your foot placement,</v>

133
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>your technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and standing,</v>

134
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>your breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're drawing it back,</v>

135
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>the position of your front shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the position of your rear elbow,</v>

136
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.410
<v Speaker 1>how you're pulling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it,</v>

137
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

138
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>how do you respond after the hour was</v>
<v Speaker 1>released?</v>

139
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.910
<v Speaker 1>There's so much going on that like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put it all together like it,</v>

140
00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>it has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It leaves no room for homework.</v>

141
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

142
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no room in there.</v>

143
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to make a nice shot like</v>

144
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I guarantee you,</v>

145
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:10.931
<v Speaker 1>if we can have a brain scan of your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second you release that Arrow at a</v>

146
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>hundred yards to go in that two inch</v>
<v Speaker 1>gap,</v>

147
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 1>there would be nothing in there other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than what you did.</v>

148
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>It would be no other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No other cells would be fired up.</v>

149
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

150
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.180
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing.</v>

151
00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:24.970
<v Speaker 2>And actually like yesterday when we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting</v>

152
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.863
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

153
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to the point where you almost,</v>

154
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.410
<v Speaker 2>your mind was clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like for me,</v>

155
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your family came home,</v>

156
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.380
<v Speaker 2>like things are winding down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You knew that like work was over and we.</v>

157
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.780
<v Speaker 2>It was like right before dark and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

158
00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I love shooting at first light and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>lasts light because it seems like that's</v>

159
00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:50.580
<v Speaker 2>what I'm not really worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone texting me or calling me.</v>

160
00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about problem at home</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I shoot with a clear mind and I am</v>

161
00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:59.700
<v Speaker 2>way more efficient in my practice and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a form of meditation.</v>

162
00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you said,</v>

163
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:06.150
<v Speaker 2>it's an art and if you're clouded than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

164
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 2>it will reflect that on the target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like if your arrows are in</v>

165
00:08:11.341 --> 00:08:14.550
<v Speaker 2>one spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know you have a single focus</v>

166
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.550
<v Speaker 2>and it's almost like the more those</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows are spread,</v>

167
00:08:17.551 --> 00:08:22.551
<v Speaker 2>that's a representation of how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>other thoughts and distractions you have</v>

168
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.030
<v Speaker 2>going in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

169
00:08:24.031 --> 00:08:29.031
<v Speaker 2>and I look at it that way when I shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to narrow everything down to</v>

170
00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:32.910
<v Speaker 2>just a movement and you look at good</v>
<v Speaker 2>golfers,</v>

171
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.410
<v Speaker 2>the ones that swing easy and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally looks like flow.</v>

172
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.120
<v Speaker 2>There's such good strikers and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much more efficient when you see</v>

173
00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.290
<v Speaker 2>people that are trying to be robotic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

174
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.400
<v Speaker 2>and almost like hack something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's like too systematic.</v>

175
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see someone like that does</v>

176
00:08:51.841 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Speaker 2>professional karate or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're in a forums competition,</v>

177
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>if they're like</v>

178
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 1>real rigid going around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not what it's meant to be.</v>

179
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's supposed to be a dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be like literally a</v>

180
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:08.691
<v Speaker 1>mental musical that's plan and if your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is clear then it's,</v>

181
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of meditation really is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>question about it.</v>

182
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:18.771
<v Speaker 1>And that same state of total complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration exists in a bunch of</v>

183
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:21.980
<v Speaker 1>different disciplines and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>finding it in archery now rec or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should say recognizing it,</v>

185
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I definitely haven't hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But finding that,</v>

186
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.160
<v Speaker 1>seeing it and recognizing that sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>super high level flow that comes into</v>

187
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 1>play when someone's excellent at what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

188
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that in pool.</v>

189
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that watching professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool players like perfect example of</v>

190
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 1>what you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>striking the ball really hard as a</v>

191
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:50.600
<v Speaker 1>golfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Francisco Bustamante</v>

192
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.450
<v Speaker 1>is one of the best pool players in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and he's from the Philippines and</v>

193
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:59.451
<v Speaker 1>Francisco Bustamante has the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous break you would think if you</v>

194
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:03.990
<v Speaker 1>watch his break shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he weighs 400 pounds and has arms</v>

195
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 1>like tree trunks.</v>

196
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.180
<v Speaker 1>You watch that break just blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

197
00:10:07.181 --> 00:10:10.310
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all just the triangle.</v>

198
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 1>If you watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just watch the speed of the ball and</v>

199
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 1>it's effortless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way he does it,</v>

200
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has this perfect amount of timing and</v>

201
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>flow here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see him do it here.</v>

202
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>This isn't him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a different guy.</v>

203
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:27.010
<v Speaker 1>It just look up a Bustamante Francisco</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bustamante breaking.</v>

204
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says that there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely not him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a some overweight gentlemen.</v>

206
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 1>What if it gained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

207
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.463
<v Speaker 1>that is him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

208
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 1>He was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird.</v>

209
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.110
<v Speaker 1>He's in a weird pose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

210
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a weird pose.</v>

211
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I thought when he was bent over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was his whole body.</v>

212
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's loading,</v>

213
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 1>but he's a tiny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you see him physically.</v>

214
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he.</v>

215
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 1>It might weigh like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's a little fat now he's getting</v>

216
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he was young he probably</v>

217
00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:55.470
<v Speaker 1>weighed like 140 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>

218
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness.</v>

219
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Those balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go flying everywhere.</v>

220
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 1>No one's like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jihad dog.</v>

221
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.000
<v Speaker 1>He's excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just one on the break or</v>

222
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen him make six balls on the</v>

223
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:11.160
<v Speaker 1>brake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's playing nine ball.</v>

224
00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 1>He make six balls in the break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got three balls to run out.</v>

225
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just insanely good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just a devastating player all</v>

226
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:21.360
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things when you watch him</v>

227
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Speaker 1>play and a lot of the Filipinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filipinos are so good.</v>

228
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.850
<v Speaker 1>There's so many really good Filipino</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool players,</v>

229
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>but they have this gentle flow to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

230
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Like everything is like a ballet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like effortless.</v>

231
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Deloitte of the q does like all the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything looks like it looks like</v>

232
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:42.290
<v Speaker 1>so flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a dance,</v>

233
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>like a dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

234
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that's so cool about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the one thing I'm really proud of</v>

235
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 1>is an archer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I've got to the point where I</v>

236
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>have a platform to get people involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was</v>

237
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 2>when I found out that you really liked</v>
<v Speaker 2>my podcasts,</v>

238
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:02.191
<v Speaker 2>which the podcasts are totally geared</v>
<v Speaker 2>around education and learning.</v>

239
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what that I got to a platform to</v>

240
00:12:04.981 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 2>where I could help people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now there's people like you that are</v>

241
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 2>coming in that never really have</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered that whole world.</v>

242
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>And they come in and I look at people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>

243
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to the YMC A,</v>

244
00:12:16.321 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 2>they want to take like touchy or they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to take yoga.</v>

245
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.850
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for a stress free type</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hobby.</v>

246
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.490
<v Speaker 2>And archery is a great sport for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's growing so much.</v>

247
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean Hollywood's embracing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously with a lot of the movies,</v>

248
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.160
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not portraying it as an art</v>

249
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:39.370
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that movie the hell's it called,</v>

250
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.580
<v Speaker 2>where's the girl who go hungry again</v>

251
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 1>when she started becoming more famous or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie rather became popular.</v>

252
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Archery took off.</v>

253
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people got involved.</v>

254
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:51.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

255
00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:52.550
<v Speaker 2>you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

256
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 2>you look at the avengers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at hunger games,</v>

257
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually so many,</v>

258
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:00.620
<v Speaker 2>even a lot of the sitcoms now p,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 2>obviously crossbows are popular because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the walking dead,</v>

260
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:08.460
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to like true archery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just see a lot more archers coming</v>

261
00:13:08.461 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord of the rings,</v>

262
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:11.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legless was so popular because of,</v>

263
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 2>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really such a cool sport.</v>

264
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an Olympic sport and we've.</v>

265
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.450
<v Speaker 2>We've actually have a phenomenal Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 2>team here in the US.</v>

266
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Our men's team is definitely going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>contenders for another metal.</v>

267
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:29.170
<v Speaker 2>They were silver medalist last year and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you were saying that compound bows</v>

268
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:30.910
<v Speaker 2>are not in the Olympics and the recurve</v>
<v Speaker 2>bows,</v>

269
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:36.270
<v Speaker 2>it's recurve bows and that's kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition and honestly it's a different</v>

270
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:39.790
<v Speaker 2>style of art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's super graceful to.</v>

271
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I think it's everyone has</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they like to do.</v>

272
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Some people like the simplicity of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>

273
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's people that go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to only have a long bow or they</v>

274
00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 2>don't want sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want the zen part of trying to</v>

275
00:13:56.291 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 2>pull back with with no sites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's also people like us</v>

276
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 2>that want to see how finite and accurate</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can become.</v>

277
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.790
<v Speaker 2>So they liked the techie side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where compound bows come in and</v>

278
00:14:08.791 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 2>they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're much more efficient and</v>

279
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:16.051
<v Speaker 2>obviously the accuracy as we seen is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is almost mindblowing mindblowing</v>

280
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.520
<v Speaker 1>guy like me because I'm a gadget dork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it combines both things.</v>

281
00:14:23.191 --> 00:14:28.110
<v Speaker 1>It combines the zen aspect of complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>and total discipline and focus and</v>

282
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.980
<v Speaker 1>looking at one task and be drowning out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world,</v>

283
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but it also has like geeky stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like different kinds of sites and this</v>

284
00:14:36.961 --> 00:14:40.080
<v Speaker 1>is a new cam that they just came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with and these are different kinds of</v>

285
00:14:40.081 --> 00:14:43.470
<v Speaker 1>strings and when you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes this better and this is so</v>

286
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:44.550
<v Speaker 1>much going on with it.</v>

287
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

288
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I look back at the bose I started</v>

289
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 2>with and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only been shooting since 97,</v>

290
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 2>so 19 years I guess it seemed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting old now,</v>

291
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.830
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a long time.</v>

292
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 2>The bose that I use then that are at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

293
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 2>You wonder how in the heck he shot that</v>
<v Speaker 2>good with.</v>

294
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually,</v>

295
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two months ago I was at the Olympic</v>

296
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 2>headquarters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Olympic Museum.</v>

297
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.490
<v Speaker 2>So they have all these awesome Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 2>artifacts of like swim trunks,</v>

298
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:18.460
<v Speaker 2>people oil or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 2>the javelin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to see the original recurve bow,</v>

300
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 2>like Jay bars was actually on display</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they constantly change them.</v>

301
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 2>So if you're visiting the museum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing the same things all</v>

302
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you look at those pieces of</v>

303
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 2>equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bikes,</v>

304
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.770
<v Speaker 2>the bikes that people wrote in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympic Games,</v>

305
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy cow,</v>

306
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:39.380
<v Speaker 2>how are they that efficient?</v>

307
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.650
<v Speaker 2>It's almost more impressive because now</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've gotten so advanced in our</v>

308
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:49.640
<v Speaker 2>equipment that it's easier to be at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

309
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I think than 20 years ago because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment just wasn't there.</v>

310
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost wonder if those people didn't</v>

311
00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:03.371
<v Speaker 2>have to put in two or three times the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and be just that much more elegant</v>

312
00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:09.530
<v Speaker 2>at what they did because their equipment</v>
<v Speaker 2>was almost a handicap back then.</v>

313
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Could they perform the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>feats?</v>

314
00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Like could someone shoot an Arrow like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

315
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Like was it a common thing to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot what you did 100 yards and</v>

316
00:16:17.841 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 2>shooting through that two inch opening</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the Kettlebell handle?</v>

317
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are people that were,</v>

318
00:16:23.781 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a lot of people in</v>

319
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 2>archery now that are pushing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>envelope.</v>

320
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long distance shooting is becoming super</v>

321
00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:36.071
<v Speaker 2>popular and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a lot of the real target archers that</v>

322
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:38.480
<v Speaker 2>are out there that are listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

323
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we go to a full feed of tournament,</v>

324
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 2>we shoot 30 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fetus stand for um,</v>

325
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 2>well now it's world archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a world archery event.</v>

326
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 2>If you shot a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a full target round,</v>

327
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.380
<v Speaker 2>you would shoot arrows at 30 or 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>meters,</v>

328
00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 2>50 meters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 meters and 90 meters.</v>

329
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.190
<v Speaker 2>So I found out from you that 90 meters</v>
<v Speaker 2>is 99 yards.</v>

330
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the easiest metric</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversions that do.</v>

331
00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 2>You take the first number and you add it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the second.</v>

332
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:10.820
<v Speaker 2>So if you've got 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the floor and added behind the 40,</v>

333
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.100
<v Speaker 2>you got 44 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's 40 meters.</v>

334
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:16.040
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the one metric system that</v>

335
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I never forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm so 99 yards is where we would</v>

336
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:23.360
<v Speaker 2>stand on the line and shoot at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:26.960
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I told you that back in 2005,</v>

338
00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:31.961
<v Speaker 2>I was really focused on shooting well</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the u s team when I was on the</v>

339
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:35.330
<v Speaker 2>compound team and there were several</v>
<v Speaker 2>tournaments that I was really focused</v>

340
00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

341
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I knew that I was going to be shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a national championship and in</v>

342
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Britain and in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to be going.</v>

343
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I think I shot one in Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

344
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.320
<v Speaker 2>had won one or two here in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

345
00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 2>in that year I think I logged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I shot two,</v>

346
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$400 a day and 90 meters for me,</v>

347
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 2>the further you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like putting a bigger microscope on</v>

348
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.130
<v Speaker 2>things that you're doing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

349
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like an art or um,</v>

350
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.770
<v Speaker 2>if you look at a golfer that's making</v>
<v Speaker 2>long putts,</v>

351
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's magnifying mistakes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're swinging or golfers that are</v>

352
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:16.800
<v Speaker 2>drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

353
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:20.400
<v Speaker 2>people that really are just sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>there trying to be accurate at the long</v>

354
00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:22.230
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It magnifies mistakes.</v>

355
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 2>So I really like shooting at longer</v>
<v Speaker 2>distances.</v>

356
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:29.721
<v Speaker 2>I know you do too because it magnifies a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake and you can correct it easier</v>

357
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 2>and it really helps bring things</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

358
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:38.090
<v Speaker 2>But that year I shot well over 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows at 99 yards during steering</v>

359
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.240
<v Speaker 2>training things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

360
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's professional archers,</v>

361
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 2>there's archery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's archers right now somewhere</v>

362
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:50.400
<v Speaker 2>that's preparing for a world cup event</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

363
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.550
<v Speaker 2>And there's people that literally have</v>
<v Speaker 2>calluses thicker and most weightlifters</v>

364
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.070
<v Speaker 2>just from grabbing a hold of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>release or you know,</v>

365
00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I remember looking at an Olympic recurve</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooters fingers one time,</v>

366
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember his,</v>

367
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.060
<v Speaker 2>his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his three fingers that he grabs a string</v>

368
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked like a frog hand because the</v>

369
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 2>tips were so big from pulling blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he,</v>

370
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.800
<v Speaker 2>and I mean these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the people that are like the</v>

371
00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Olympic training centers that are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

372
00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:25.680
<v Speaker 2>they get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go eat and then they shoot until</v>

373
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:29.880
<v Speaker 2>five or six at night and they eat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they go and do a weight training</v>

374
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:30.714
<v Speaker 2>session.</v>

375
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I bet you there's people that do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand errors a day.</v>

376
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can build up some stamina.</v>

377
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really impressive.</v>

378
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in saying that,</v>

379
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I think with archery it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

380
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.380
<v Speaker 2>you know that I'm really big into</v>
<v Speaker 2>fitness as well.</v>

381
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:54.381
<v Speaker 2>I credit my fitness and my story is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete prior to being an archer as part</v>

382
00:19:57.091 --> 00:20:02.010
<v Speaker 2>of what's helped me be successful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big difference between</v>

383
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.280
<v Speaker 2>quantity and quality and a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the mistake I think with any sport</v>

384
00:20:08.761 --> 00:20:13.500
<v Speaker 2>of just trying to practice more or train</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

385
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.140
<v Speaker 2>And even weightlifters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:20.490
<v Speaker 2>I see people that I go in the gym and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like on one exercise and then</v>

387
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:25.491
<v Speaker 2>when I leave the gym in 50 minutes or an</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour were like maybe done two different</v>

388
00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:28.950
<v Speaker 2>types of exercise and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not efficient,</v>

389
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people as athletes</v>

390
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:36.230
<v Speaker 2>sometimes miss the boat of quality over</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the quantity in.</v>

391
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:42.130
<v Speaker 2>And I was always that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's days where I go practice and I</v>

392
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.960
<v Speaker 2>may only make 100 shots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once I started realizing that I'm</v>

393
00:20:45.961 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 2>breaking down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know to step away.</v>

394
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.890
<v Speaker 2>You don't try to push through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

395
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 2>And I told you that yesterday too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a time where I said,</v>

396
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

397
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 2>if we're just out here getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>repetition,</v>

398
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we really don't need to do that.</v>

399
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Aiming at a target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a really good point too about</v>

400
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:09.090
<v Speaker 2>those bad shots and bad repetitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotta get those out of</v>

401
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:11.980
<v Speaker 2>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just that you made a bad</v>

402
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:14.020
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to make a bunch of good</v>

403
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 2>shots to try to get away with you from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effect of the bad shot.</v>

404
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not as simple as the one bad shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

405
00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>it's imprinting.</v>

406
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an imprint and I think with any</v>

407
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:26.590
<v Speaker 2>type of athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

408
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 2>and it's probably that way with</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>

409
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:33.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure too if you get someone that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just really in a rhythm and a flow,</v>

410
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:38.560
<v Speaker 2>if also when they start making a mistake</v>
<v Speaker 2>or doing something bad as a coach,</v>

411
00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:43.561
<v Speaker 2>he try to get them back into that rhythm</v>
<v Speaker 2>again so that you can weed out that</v>

412
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.190
<v Speaker 2>imprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

413
00:21:45.191 --> 00:21:47.290
<v Speaker 2>and that's tough as an athlete sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 2>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure for fighters,</v>

415
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at people that come out and</v>

416
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 2>have a disappointing loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like that's an imprint.</v>

417
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.380
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why that statement and you're</v>

418
00:21:56.381 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 2>only as good as your last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so disturbing to fighters.</v>

419
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and that's one thing,</v>

420
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:07.290
<v Speaker 2>one of the most important things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned as a competitive archer and I</v>

421
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:12.850
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a temper when I first started as a</v>

422
00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 2>pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I made a bad shot,</v>

423
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda like when you kind of put one in</v>

424
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:22.270
<v Speaker 2>the pool</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you put one of the pool and you</v>

425
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:23.710
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frigate,</v>

426
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 2>you are pissed off.</v>

427
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I would be on a,</v>

428
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a tournament,</v>

429
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would freak and ran my stabilizer</v>

430
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:35.740
<v Speaker 2>under the ground so hard that I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>crack it in my mind problem was.</v>

431
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:39.760
<v Speaker 2>And that just did it once I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really complicated,</v>

432
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Geeky sort of an explanation folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a certain type of release</v>

433
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.050
<v Speaker 2>where it's attention based release and</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we're practicing with and difference</v>

434
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:49.990
<v Speaker 2>between pulling a trigger and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing the tension,</v>

435
00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:52.450
<v Speaker 2>but you have to hold the safety while</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull it back.</v>

436
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise the Arrow just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just fly.</v>

437
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It means it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it's going to shoot</v>

438
00:22:57.821 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going really slow,</v>

439
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:04.290
<v Speaker 2>but it logs in a very embarrassing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just very disappointing when this book</v>

440
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:07.180
<v Speaker 2>comes off your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you're pulling the bow back,</v>

441
00:23:07.181 --> 00:23:09.730
<v Speaker 2>it goes blank and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

442
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it three times,</v>

443
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.040
<v Speaker 2>did it yesterday and today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super.</v>

444
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.140
<v Speaker 2>It's super embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

445
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:17.921
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

446
00:23:17.921 --> 00:23:20.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was definitely annoyed myself.</v>

447
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I would make something like that,</v>

448
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:26.950
<v Speaker 2>that would really trigger me into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed off realm,</v>

449
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I would let one mistake affect</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else after that.</v>

450
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really good athletes that I</v>

451
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:41.320
<v Speaker 2>watch and any sport tennis players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>golfers,</v>

452
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:46.650
<v Speaker 2>the key is when you have a negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment to not let it affect what hasn't</v>

453
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 2>happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a guy came up to me one time</v>

454
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:55.640
<v Speaker 2>after I made a bad shot and he could</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell I was getting hot and he looked at</v>

455
00:23:55.641 --> 00:23:57.200
<v Speaker 2>me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

456
00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 2>the only arrows you have control on</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now are the ones that are still in</v>

457
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:04.610
<v Speaker 2>that quiver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me that,</v>

458
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:09.611
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it completely changed my outcome as a</v>

459
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 2>professional archer.</v>

460
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've brought so much of what archery has</v>

461
00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:20.141
<v Speaker 2>done to me as an athlete into my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's times were you just</v>

462
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.040
<v Speaker 2>something really torques you off and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to just like look at,</v>

463
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I do from here on out is the</v>

464
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:32.990
<v Speaker 2>only thing I have control on because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's history.</v>

465
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't figured out a way.</v>

466
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Once that released,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glows playing to actually grab that</v>

467
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Arrow and pull it back and stick it back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the quiver or put it back on the</v>

468
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.260
<v Speaker 2>string.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a perfect representation of</v>

469
00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make a decision.</v>

470
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.920
<v Speaker 2>If it was shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to reset and say,</v>

471
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 2>what do I need to do with myself to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>back on track in life?</v>

472
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:04.660
<v Speaker 2>We make bad decisions at times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do we make a good decision to</v>

473
00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 2>get back on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back online?</v>

474
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:06.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

475
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:09.550
<v Speaker 1>it's management of the mind in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

476
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that I also</v>

477
00:25:11.951 --> 00:25:15.970
<v Speaker 1>like about our true love about archery</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's absolute like you,</v>

478
00:25:15.971 --> 00:25:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't pull that Arrow back like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying through the air.</v>

479
00:25:19.781 --> 00:25:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And either it hits the Bullseye or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>missed.</v>

480
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't care about where you live.</v>

481
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't care who your uncle is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't care how much money you make</v>

482
00:25:30.181 --> 00:25:32.320
<v Speaker 1>you here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't care like the the arrows</v>

483
00:25:32.321 --> 00:25:35.530
<v Speaker 1>going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolute discipline and I think</v>

484
00:25:35.531 --> 00:25:39.320
<v Speaker 1>you coming from professionals or coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>from sports or other sports background,</v>

485
00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.540
<v Speaker 1>we played a lot of football</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you play sports,</v>

486
00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:46.360
<v Speaker 1>but especially insanely competitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports,</v>

487
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.480
<v Speaker 1>you learn where all the edges are to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

488
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.720
<v Speaker 1>You learn with all the edges are to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>had as far as technique,</v>

489
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.300
<v Speaker 1>as far as conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it all the different things you have</v>

490
00:25:55.301 --> 00:25:57.400
<v Speaker 1>to do in order to be successful and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>

491
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.210
<v Speaker 1>And everyone knows that in most sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the physical sport like</v>

492
00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:03.490
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking lot of work involved.</v>

493
00:26:03.491 --> 00:26:07.090
<v Speaker 1>There's not a single person who jumps</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the bench who doesn't have any</v>

494
00:26:07.091 --> 00:26:09.370
<v Speaker 1>training whatsoever and kicks ass and</v>
<v Speaker 1>football.</v>

495
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.670
<v Speaker 1>You just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta learn and you have to learn</v>

496
00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:16.210
<v Speaker 1>how to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn all the different</v>

497
00:26:16.211 --> 00:26:17.440
<v Speaker 1>plays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn.</v>

498
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Technique involved in different aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the sport and I think coming from a</v>

499
00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:26.410
<v Speaker 1>competitive background in athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've kind of translated that</v>

500
00:26:26.411 --> 00:26:31.411
<v Speaker 1>understanding of where all the problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in archery because there's a lot of</v>

501
00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:35.350
<v Speaker 1>people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have good coaching and so</v>

502
00:26:35.351 --> 00:26:39.250
<v Speaker 1>they start off with a lot of really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>habits and then they have to figure out</v>

503
00:26:39.251 --> 00:26:42.190
<v Speaker 1>a way to either break those habits or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live with those habits and then</v>

504
00:26:42.191 --> 00:26:47.191
<v Speaker 1>they do the best they with this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited path that they've carved in and</v>

505
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:49.140
<v Speaker 1>they seem to not be able to escape.</v>

506
00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 1>The same thing exists in martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the hardest things for me when I</v>

507
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:58.161
<v Speaker 1>used to teach was teaching people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>already had a bad technique imprinted in</v>

508
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:01.770
<v Speaker 1>their brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would have one way of throwing</v>

509
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 1>a kick or something like that and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to go,</v>

510
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:06.420
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to figure out a way to break this</v>

511
00:27:06.421 --> 00:27:07.860
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have this thing.</v>

512
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as he gets tired or as</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as he panics,</v>

513
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.390
<v Speaker 1>the Nigos down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foot goes up.</v>

514
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 1>It loses all the power of the hips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't engage.</v>

515
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I could take a kid like a five</v>

516
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 1>year old kid and show them that from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

517
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 1>their instinct would be to throw it</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

518
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:25.380
<v Speaker 1>The instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when tired knee comes up,</v>

519
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:30.410
<v Speaker 1>hip turns over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>body extends full power and those things</v>

520
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:35.280
<v Speaker 1>are so hard to unlearn once you get like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad path.</v>

521
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.480
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do think that archery and a lot</v>

522
00:27:39.481 --> 00:27:41.010
<v Speaker 1>of ways is a martial art.</v>

523
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

524
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Well you look at the whole Asian culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've said time and time again,</v>

525
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I've coached all over the world and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

526
00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:56.340
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda what I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of coaching that most people</v>

527
00:27:56.341 --> 00:28:01.341
<v Speaker 2>don't even know about with teams that</v>
<v Speaker 2>just would rather have confidentiality</v>

528
00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:05.610
<v Speaker 2>and whether or not they're working with</v>
<v Speaker 2>an outside source,</v>

529
00:28:05.611 --> 00:28:07.080
<v Speaker 2>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I,</v>

530
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 2>the probably the best place I ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>taught was when I went to India because</v>

531
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I actually taught those a Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to have 16 archers.</v>

532
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Once I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was about 140.</v>

533
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was unbelievable the anyone they</v>

534
00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 2>thought could be a potential winner for</v>
<v Speaker 2>their team was there and there was so</v>

535
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:33.690
<v Speaker 2>many kids and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adults that were there and I remember I</v>

536
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:38.430
<v Speaker 2>took several members of the team that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a bad habit of punching the trigger</v>

537
00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 2>and anticipating the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a big negative in our tree and</v>

538
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I gave them a device.</v>

539
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Same one I gave you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave him a release that forces them to</v>

540
00:28:49.141 --> 00:28:53.760
<v Speaker 2>not think about actually aiming the</v>
<v Speaker 2>front side of the boat.</v>

541
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a device that makes them focus on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movement of archery,</v>

542
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Speaker 2>pulling through the bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting the front arm go for the back</v>

543
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:06.540
<v Speaker 2>arm to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember I gave him string and</v>

544
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:08.910
<v Speaker 2>that release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took all their bones away and locked</v>

545
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:09.471
<v Speaker 2>him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

546
00:29:09.471 --> 00:29:11.550
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you can do this,</v>

547
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.410
<v Speaker 2>we're not going any further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I took those eight and I had them do</v>

548
00:29:16.411 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 2>that to the side and then I came over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started trying to work on all</v>

549
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:23.160
<v Speaker 2>these other people and there was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person needed their boat,</v>

550
00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:26.430
<v Speaker 2>worked on this person needed to watch me</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot this,</v>

551
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:27.860
<v Speaker 2>people want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

552
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.210
<v Speaker 2>to take pictures or video of me</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting.</v>

553
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Then we went to lunch.</v>

554
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Then the whole thing started over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when it came to dinnertime,</v>

555
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys all go ahead.</v>

556
00:29:40.471 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pack up my gear.</v>

557
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the whole big crowd left,</v>

558
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:50.190
<v Speaker 2>those same eight kids were still over</v>
<v Speaker 2>there with strings pulling on that</v>

559
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:56.470
<v Speaker 2>release and almost every one of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>were damn near bloody in their hand from</v>

560
00:29:56.471 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 2>just executing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I came over.</v>

561
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my goodness.</v>

562
00:30:01.001 --> 00:30:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys been here the whole day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>

563
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is like,</v>

564
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:11.070
<v Speaker 2>there's there that culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just no wonder to me why.</v>

565
00:30:11.261 --> 00:30:16.261
<v Speaker 2>Like martial arts is such a discipline</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that culture teaches discipline</v>

566
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.940
<v Speaker 2>and hard work within that art better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything.</v>

567
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.650
<v Speaker 2>And I think that archery coming out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

568
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 2>out of Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all the like the Korean team are</v>

569
00:30:31.241 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 2>so strong because of their disciplines</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure with the martial arts it's</v>

570
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:37.390
<v Speaker 2>exact same thing.</v>

571
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:42.930
<v Speaker 2>They're not afraid to take what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coach says and just do it until the</v>

572
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:48.511
<v Speaker 2>coach Says No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people here in any sport</v>

573
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.620
<v Speaker 2>are looking for the shortcut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People at the gym,</v>

574
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.130
<v Speaker 2>they want the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

575
00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:01.350
<v Speaker 2>they want to shake that melts fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to be able to go in and get</v>

576
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 2>the machine that does four minute abs or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

577
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:10.171
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment and you have to have</v>

578
00:31:10.271 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 2>discipline in anything in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise if you don't,</v>

579
00:31:14.861 --> 00:31:17.980
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to be another person</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitching about while someone else has</v>

580
00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 2>something you don't because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to put the effort in for it.</v>

581
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other hand,</v>

582
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good idea to cut your hands</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the.</v>

583
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.720
<v Speaker 1>You take some time off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids</v>

584
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.960
<v Speaker 1>get slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow down.</v>

585
00:31:30.961 --> 00:31:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't be afraid to raise your hand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

586
00:31:32.461 --> 00:31:34.440
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we take a break here?</v>

587
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.720
<v Speaker 1>And then I pointed out to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that,</v>

588
00:31:36.721 --> 00:31:37.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

589
00:31:37.681 --> 00:31:40.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get involved in anything like archery</v>

590
00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:42.300
<v Speaker 1>that I'm interested in it because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like,</v>

591
00:31:42.301 --> 00:31:44.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to hunt,</v>

592
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.590
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be a bow hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

593
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in that.</v>

594
00:31:47.251 --> 00:31:50.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if even if you don't have to be</v>

595
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:53.370
<v Speaker 1>interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is the furthest end of the</v>

596
00:31:53.371 --> 00:31:55.200
<v Speaker 1>extreme spectrum when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery.</v>

597
00:31:55.201 --> 00:31:58.350
<v Speaker 1>You could enjoy archery with just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>yard,</v>

598
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.540
<v Speaker 1>a yard and a target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

599
00:32:00.541 --> 00:32:02.370
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to shoot anything other</v>

600
00:32:02.371 --> 00:32:04.320
<v Speaker 1>than a target to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get like,</v>

601
00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and today we're just shooting</v>

602
00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:08.970
<v Speaker 1>targets and very fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super fulfilling.</v>

603
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Like at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.890
<v Speaker 1>especially because yesterday made a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of progress.</v>

605
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.510
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

606
00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:16.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feels great.</v>

607
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Cleansing.</v>

608
00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.170
<v Speaker 2>You've made a dramatic improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

609
00:32:21.171 --> 00:32:23.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really pumped with how you are,</v>

610
00:32:23.001 --> 00:32:28.001
<v Speaker 2>but what I love about archery is</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully you can't hear that they can.</v>

611
00:32:28.011 --> 00:32:30.050
<v Speaker 2>This is Dang good by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

612
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.810
<v Speaker 2>when?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Joe does his commercials,</v>

613
00:32:32.811 --> 00:32:35.270
<v Speaker 2>which actually it's the only thing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>

614
00:32:35.271 --> 00:32:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't fast forward through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials because I love how you do</v>

615
00:32:38.421 --> 00:32:40.520
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he talks about the butter</v>

616
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take his advice on it.</v>

617
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've enjoyed it.</v>

618
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get some good coffee,</v>

619
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.170
<v Speaker 2>good grass fed butter and mct oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was lined it all up.</v>

620
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.100
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

621
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.520
<v Speaker 2>it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what's so cool about archery too</v>

622
00:32:55.610 --> 00:33:00.610
<v Speaker 2>is it's not a sport that is limited by</v>
<v Speaker 2>your age and for that matter,</v>

623
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 2>it's not totally limited by your</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical physique.</v>

624
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about that guy that has no arms?</v>

625
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

626
00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:10.910
<v Speaker 2>is that believable and credible?</v>

627
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Stutzman is.</v>

628
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean he should be Matt studs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minis.</v>

629
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean the armless archer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so inspiring.</v>

630
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean is kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His nickname is it's inspirational</v>

631
00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:26.111
<v Speaker 2>archer and he's definitely just that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to be able to shoot with their</v>

632
00:33:26.391 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 2>legs is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Actually Matt,</v>

633
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:33.710
<v Speaker 2>we haven't talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but matt and another pair archer here</v>

634
00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:37.460
<v Speaker 2>from the u s named Jeff February that</v>
<v Speaker 2>she eats with his mouth.</v>

635
00:33:37.461 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 2>He was in a motorcycle accident and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a pair of archer.</v>

636
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Matt Stutzman right there.</v>

637
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.730
<v Speaker 2>So how does Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He holds the ball with his right foot</v>

638
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:50.870
<v Speaker 2>and then his left foot's on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how does he release the bow?</v>

639
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.190
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

640
00:33:52.191 --> 00:33:54.150
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually um,</v>

641
00:33:54.151 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 2>design jeff favor is next I think two on</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the right.</v>

642
00:33:57.651 --> 00:34:01.730
<v Speaker 2>But so he's developed a release to where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually able to push on it with</v>

643
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 2>his chin and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually activates from back tension.</v>

644
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Now they've designed a release for where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can hook on and he slowly starts to</v>

645
00:34:10.761 --> 00:34:15.110
<v Speaker 2>continue to move back until it triggers</v>
<v Speaker 2>the string to fire them as he moves</v>

646
00:34:15.111 --> 00:34:16.880
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's still looking through his peep</v>

647
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:17.990
<v Speaker 2>site?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

648
00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a small movement.</v>

649
00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:21.740
<v Speaker 2>You know how small the movement is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

650
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:24.320
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about that movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very finite.</v>

651
00:34:24.321 --> 00:34:27.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of an inch or two that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's jeff right there.</v>

652
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Jeff Avery.</v>

653
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.500
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I did,</v>

654
00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:33.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last year when I had to have my</v>

655
00:34:33.501 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 2>shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my shoulder redone,</v>

656
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:41.110
<v Speaker 2>I did not want to miss archery season</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just really took it as a personal</v>

657
00:34:41.211 --> 00:34:46.211
<v Speaker 2>challenge to not put my head down and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned to shoot.</v>

658
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:49.760
<v Speaker 2>It was actually my bow arm was the one I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had worked on,</v>

659
00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:54.761
<v Speaker 2>so I had to learn to shoot with my mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>using my opposite arm in my,</v>

660
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:59.330
<v Speaker 2>in my non dominant eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

661
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm thankful for it.</v>

662
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.260
<v Speaker 2>People always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

663
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:07.880
<v Speaker 2>people ask me all the time if I regret</v>
<v Speaker 2>this or if I would do that different and</v>

664
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 2>screw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

665
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:11.330
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The past is the past.</v>

666
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I just want to look forward on</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

667
00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:15.950
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I messed up my shoulder,</v>

668
00:35:15.951 --> 00:35:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I was bummed about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in all fairness,</v>

669
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a really good challenge</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at a sport that I love from a</v>

670
00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 2>new direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at the technique involved.</v>

671
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:28.551
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

672
00:35:28.551 --> 00:35:29.384
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

673
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.470
<v Speaker 2>someone said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it was that one of the best</v>

674
00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 2>ways to get good at something is to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it with your opposite hand</v>

675
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 1>and that not just doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if like you,</v>

676
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you're boxing and you're working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

677
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:44.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

678
00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 1>your straight right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times when you do your straight</v>

679
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:53.160
<v Speaker 1>lefthand and actually improves your</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight right hand because in learning</v>

680
00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:57.120
<v Speaker 1>how to do it in an awkward way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is sort of programming</v>

681
00:35:57.121 --> 00:36:00.000
<v Speaker 1>into your mind the critical aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technique.</v>

682
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 1>How to throw the hips in window to</v>
<v Speaker 1>plant.</v>

683
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And then when you go over to your more</v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinated side,</v>

684
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 1>it's just like super tuned in to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical aspects of the movement.</v>

685
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.550
<v Speaker 1>So then when you throw a left hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he switched over to your right</v>

686
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:15.230
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

687
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.063
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

688
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.730
<v Speaker 1>it's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even faster.</v>

689
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It's even cleaner and I think that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably makes sense to the archery as</v>

690
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:23.430
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a lot of people would probably</v>

691
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.350
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's not a traditional thing to</v>

692
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:27.490
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably benefit from having both a</v>

693
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.810
<v Speaker 1>lefthanded bow and a right hand and ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning how to shoot lefthanded</v>

694
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at how many skateboarders get</v>

695
00:36:32.631 --> 00:36:34.640
<v Speaker 2>better when they learn to skate goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

696
00:36:34.641 --> 00:36:39.641
<v Speaker 2>if they learn to skate with the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot back back when I was a skater,</v>

697
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either skated like straight footer.</v>

698
00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:47.660
<v Speaker 2>He skated Goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then people didn't really switch</v>

699
00:36:47.661 --> 00:36:51.830
<v Speaker 2>back and forth a lot at that time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>less like the freestyle skaters did back</v>

700
00:36:51.831 --> 00:36:55.160
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when I got away from skating</v>

701
00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.460
<v Speaker 2>and started playing football for awhile</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then archery and then all of a</v>

702
00:36:58.461 --> 00:37:01.100
<v Speaker 2>sudden you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the x games happen and you start seeing</v>

703
00:37:01.101 --> 00:37:05.960
<v Speaker 2>guys like Tony Hawk or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You realize that the whole skating world</v>

704
00:37:05.961 --> 00:37:10.460
<v Speaker 2>just completely went to like with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>freestyle skaters were and just being</v>

705
00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:15.461
<v Speaker 2>able to switch either way and still</v>
<v Speaker 2>perform the exact same tricks.</v>

706
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:19.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think any athlete that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>

707
00:37:19.311 --> 00:37:23.270
<v Speaker 2>and you know what's funny is sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen you say,</v>

708
00:37:23.271 --> 00:37:23.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

709
00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about hunting today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of your listeners might get</v>

710
00:37:26.241 --> 00:37:27.140
<v Speaker 2>pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever,</v>

711
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.590
<v Speaker 2>because some people just want UFC or</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people don't like to hear the kid.</v>

712
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Never worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

713
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:36.710
<v Speaker 2>But what's super important is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to take some of these</v>

714
00:37:36.711 --> 00:37:41.630
<v Speaker 2>elements and apply them to their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I really believe is when I get</v>

715
00:37:41.631 --> 00:37:45.680
<v Speaker 2>better as an athlete is when I recognize</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever my biggest weakness is,</v>

716
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.560
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I focus on making my</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>

717
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.490
<v Speaker 2>I call it selective cycling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work on this with a lot of my</v>

718
00:37:52.491 --> 00:37:54.680
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll literally take the one thing that</v>

719
00:37:54.681 --> 00:37:59.681
<v Speaker 2>they do the worst and that's all I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to do for almost a month because a</v>

720
00:38:01.491 --> 00:38:05.150
<v Speaker 2>lot of psychology has shown that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a negative habit,</v>

721
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:10.180
<v Speaker 2>it normally takes about 21 days to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreate a positive habit,</v>

722
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:15.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be able to take your</v>

723
00:38:15.261 --> 00:38:20.261
<v Speaker 2>weakness and mentally be tough enough as</v>
<v Speaker 2>an athlete to be willing to make that</v>

724
00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:25.340
<v Speaker 2>your strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've had several things in my career</v>

725
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.900
<v Speaker 2>that were my weakness that are now my</v>
<v Speaker 2>strongest aspect.</v>

726
00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Field archery was my biggest weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

727
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.950
<v Speaker 2>my biggest strength is the difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>between feel archery.</v>

728
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not on flat ground,</v>

729
00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start changing angles and once</v>

730
00:38:41.771 --> 00:38:45.070
<v Speaker 2>you start having to make shots and</v>
<v Speaker 2>canyons you have to learn.</v>

731
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:48.760
<v Speaker 2>When do you have to learn trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So field archery is,</v>

732
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 2>you have like a course that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>run and it's all outdoors in the woods.</v>

733
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be outdoors.</v>

734
00:38:55.631 --> 00:38:56.710
<v Speaker 2>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

735
00:38:56.711 --> 00:39:01.150
<v Speaker 2>the really difficult field courses are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like throughout like cliffs and</v>

736
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:03.620
<v Speaker 2>mountainous areas to where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

737
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:08.060
<v Speaker 2>you have shots where they're straight up</v>
<v Speaker 2>way over your shoulder where you're</v>

738
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.190
<v Speaker 2>aiming non,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

739
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.430
<v Speaker 2>50 degree angles and then you're aiming</v>
<v Speaker 2>down or somewhere.</v>

740
00:39:12.431 --> 00:39:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I've even had to aim straight down</v>
<v Speaker 2>between my legs.</v>

741
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those types of things are extremely</v>

742
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 2>technical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

743
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:24.220
<v Speaker 2>if you had golfers that had to play in</v>
<v Speaker 2>really difficult terrain,</v>

744
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:28.930
<v Speaker 2>obviously they have to start learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>draws and fades and they have to start</v>

745
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:31.780
<v Speaker 2>learning clubs that play differently in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wind.</v>

746
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:35.860
<v Speaker 2>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be the same thing it pointed</v>

747
00:39:35.861 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like when we shoot at longer</v>

748
00:39:37.961 --> 00:39:39.670
<v Speaker 2>distances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I mean you were,</v>

749
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.580
<v Speaker 2>you were shooting amazing at eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>

750
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.320
<v Speaker 2>80 yards on your rubber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear you rubber l key call it,</v>

751
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.260
<v Speaker 2>he's laughing the rubber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

752
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are shooting amazing and then you</v>

753
00:39:53.201 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 2>would have one shot where something</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't right,</v>

754
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.630
<v Speaker 2>but it would show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what field archery did to me.</v>

755
00:39:58.631 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 2>It really started to open up my</v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses.</v>

756
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Speaker 2>And for me as an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always so competitive that I want to</v>

757
00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:11.200
<v Speaker 2>know what I suck at because I think if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really going to master something,</v>

758
00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:16.090
<v Speaker 2>regardless of the craft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be so well rounded.</v>

759
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.970
<v Speaker 2>And I mean the UFC is that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even as a spectator.</v>

760
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like a fight specialist by any</v>

761
00:40:21.431 --> 00:40:22.264
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

762
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I've always loved watching the UFC and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how the people who won the</v>

763
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:33.150
<v Speaker 2>early ufc vs how rounded you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>now to when you can't afford to have a</v>

764
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 2>weakness.</v>

765
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.430
<v Speaker 2>So ignoring it isn't doing you any</v>
<v Speaker 2>favors.</v>

766
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different world now,</v>

767
00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 2>completely different world and he also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much like we were talking about before</v>

768
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 2>in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to pretty much</v>

769
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:49.810
<v Speaker 2>execute from both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that someone only has</v>

770
00:40:49.811 --> 00:40:51.990
<v Speaker 2>like a good right kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.770
<v Speaker 2>you have to learn how to kick with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left side too.</v>

772
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.950
<v Speaker 2>But in Jujitsu that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exists as well.</v>

773
00:40:55.951 --> 00:40:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of guys that have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong side,</v>

774
00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.130
<v Speaker 2>like the only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the past to the left or they don't</v>

775
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:02.920
<v Speaker 2>want it to pass through the ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only submit guys off the right arm.</v>

776
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:06.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's real common to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>side where you're really good at it.</v>

777
00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:07.893
<v Speaker 2>What really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

778
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.800
<v Speaker 2>one thing you said that the other day</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were sitting there talking and</v>

779
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:15.810
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about setting up moves</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Jujitsu and how evolving it is,</v>

780
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:21.210
<v Speaker 2>how it continually evolves and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden a new move we'll get invented and</v>

781
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:26.230
<v Speaker 2>you'll be practicing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then someone just notices like,</v>

782
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.650
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big weakness right there,</v>

783
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.830
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've kind of eliminated someone</v>

784
00:41:33.831 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 2>getting</v>

785
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.720
<v Speaker 1>that moved done on you and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

786
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.400
<v Speaker 1>holy crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

787
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 1>so how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we actually combat that?</v>

788
00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a continual chess game.</v>

789
00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

790
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And the body can move and so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>

791
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:50.360
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the more interesting aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Jujitsu's.</v>

792
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.120
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different ways the body</v>
<v Speaker 1>can move.</v>

793
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.210
<v Speaker 1>So when two people are engaged in each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

794
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 1>where there's the possibilities of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks and counterattacks are near</v>

795
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

796
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:05.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a spectacular example of like an</v>

797
00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:10.541
<v Speaker 1>extreme discipline and was something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes just for a lot of people,</v>

798
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.100
<v Speaker 1>becomes a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive obsession.</v>

799
00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 1>You see the Anthony Bourdain thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do through tournament.</v>

800
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Bourdain starts Jujitsu at 58</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

801
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

802
00:42:22.821 --> 00:42:23.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

803
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I think he had quit smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't smoking anymore because he</v>

804
00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 1>stopped smoking when his daughter was</v>
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>

805
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:29.084
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

806
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.490
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still was hitting the booze,</v>

807
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still wasn't eating healthy.</v>

808
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:37.580
<v Speaker 1>He was on statens for his blood pressure</v>
<v Speaker 1>or cholesterol,</v>

809
00:42:37.581 --> 00:42:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I guess he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

810
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.850
<v Speaker 1>just wasn't healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

811
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Gets into Jujitsu because of his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His wife is a maniac.</v>

812
00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 1>She loves Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets into it,</v>

813
00:42:46.821 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 1>and now he's obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trains every day,</v>

814
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.070
<v Speaker 1>often twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just wanted you to,</v>

815
00:42:51.071 --> 00:42:53.500
<v Speaker 1>to tournament as a blue belt at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

816
00:42:53.501 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Fifty nine or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking incredible.</v>

817
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Fifty nine year old Anthony Bourdain</v>
<v Speaker 1>took home the goal that is first Jujitsu</v>

818
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:00.380
<v Speaker 1>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

819
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.880
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

820
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 1>As someone who loves Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just blown away.</v>

821
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just love seeing a guy like him who is</v>

822
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 1>a madman man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many different things.</v>

823
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:18.610
<v Speaker 1>And also a guy who was an artist and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his art being culinary,</v>

824
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.373
<v Speaker 1>being a chef.</v>

825
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:25.580
<v Speaker 1>I learned from watching his show that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an art form.</v>

826
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really consider it before I</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched.</v>

827
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no reservations is old show.</v>

828
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I watched him interact with all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooks and the like,</v>

829
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 1>a light bulb went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

830
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:36.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking is art.</v>

831
00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like,</v>

832
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:41.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy now has a cook.</v>

833
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.230
<v Speaker 1>This guy makes some good this and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy cooked some good that,</v>

834
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.750
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't think of it in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

835
00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I look at like a maybe a guy who was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing sculptor.</v>

836
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about it that way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I realized that when I watched a</v>

837
00:43:53.581 --> 00:43:54.670
<v Speaker 1>show it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

838
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.550
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never did.</v>

839
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.600
<v Speaker 1>I was just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

840
00:43:56.601 --> 00:43:58.010
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a good kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

841
00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:01.460
<v Speaker 1>this guy knows how to make sausages or</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's really good at Lasagna or</v>

842
00:44:01.461 --> 00:44:02.000
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

843
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.350
<v Speaker 1>it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

844
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:05.510
<v Speaker 1>didn't seem like an art.</v>

845
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:09.770
<v Speaker 1>So seeing him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who highlighted that there is an</v>

846
00:44:09.771 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 1>art and cooking food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then become obsessed with this art of</v>

847
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think in a lot of ways,</v>

848
00:44:17.511 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 1>like we were saying about archery</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery,</v>

849
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:21.830
<v Speaker 1>there's parallels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

850
00:44:21.831 --> 00:44:24.770
<v Speaker 1>people think of Kendo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a Japanese sword fighting art</v>

851
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 1>that's unquestionably a martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then so is our strike archery and we</v>

852
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:29.780
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kendall is a martial art,</v>

853
00:44:29.781 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 1>so his archery 100 percent because</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery involves a weapon involved,</v>

854
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's so much more than that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much more than that.</v>

855
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:42.561
<v Speaker 1>At some weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy moving meditation that I feel like</v>

856
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.280
<v Speaker 1>when it goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yesterday when we shot really well</v>

857
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 1>and we shot like tight groups at 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>yards.</v>

858
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Well after it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like physically,</v>

859
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like charged up,</v>

860
00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.270
<v Speaker 1>you feel elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel better than if you did nothing.</v>

861
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like if you could take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug that makes you feel the way you</v>

862
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:08.250
<v Speaker 1>feel when you hit a perfect acts at 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>yards like that,</v>

863
00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.410
<v Speaker 1>like you'd take that drug all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

864
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.320
<v Speaker 1>That was a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

865
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:19.850
<v Speaker 2>and high on both side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been pounded,</v>

866
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.680
<v Speaker 2>pounded that crap all lit up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Skin's Tingley.</v>

867
00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>

868
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.140
<v Speaker 2>I guess discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a martial art discipline,</v>

869
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.790
<v Speaker 2>but I think almost labeling these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any other way than just calling them</v>

870
00:45:34.791 --> 00:45:35.900
<v Speaker 2>what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is just.</v>

871
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:37.910
<v Speaker 2>It is archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you put them in</v>

872
00:45:37.911 --> 00:45:40.220
<v Speaker 2>categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you categorize things as this is a</v>

873
00:45:40.221 --> 00:45:45.221
<v Speaker 2>sport or this is a hobby or this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It almost trivializes the benefits,</v>

874
00:45:45.531 --> 00:45:48.680
<v Speaker 2>the positive benefits of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny that you say that because now</v>

875
00:45:48.681 --> 00:45:53.681
<v Speaker 2>I know I could never pull you away</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I love as an athlete to step</v>

876
00:45:56.121 --> 00:46:01.121
<v Speaker 2>away with perfection and you would shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>a group that was like perfect and I knew</v>

877
00:46:04.101 --> 00:46:06.950
<v Speaker 2>that we were close to being done for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day and I'd be like,</v>

878
00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.480
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's end on that.</v>

879
00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.130
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way dude,</v>

880
00:46:10.131 --> 00:46:12.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then.</v>

881
00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.500
<v Speaker 2>But then if you make one negative shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that group,</v>

882
00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.740
<v Speaker 2>you were pissed again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I can understand too because I'm</v>

883
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.570
<v Speaker 2>so competitive that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also love that feeling that you're</v>

884
00:46:23.571 --> 00:46:28.040
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome sometimes to have that and</v>

885
00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.690
<v Speaker 2>it's important and that's what I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to like work with you on is it</v>

886
00:46:32.691 --> 00:46:34.940
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get better than what you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

887
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.060
<v Speaker 2>You're on a high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

888
00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I want you to like step away thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your trip all night.</v>

889
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.790
<v Speaker 2>So tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

890
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:49.220
<v Speaker 2>you visualize it long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the way I think is tomorrow you're</v>

891
00:46:49.221 --> 00:46:54.221
<v Speaker 2>more likely to be able to duplicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to go.</v>

892
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever like to go to bed on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>

893
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's actually what I was trying to</v>

894
00:47:01.731 --> 00:47:03.710
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

895
00:47:03.711 --> 00:47:05.600
<v Speaker 2>we're not good enough friends where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be like,</v>

896
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:07.220
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me your.</v>

897
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.911
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

898
00:47:07.911 --> 00:47:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I guess I did take some stuff away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably some of the releases that I was</v>

899
00:47:12.441 --> 00:47:15.840
<v Speaker 2>using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won't let me use in house.</v>

900
00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very geeky stuff.</v>

901
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.010
<v Speaker 2>So for people that are listening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

902
00:47:19.011 --> 00:47:22.940
<v Speaker 2>they didn't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because there's so many different</v>

903
00:47:22.941 --> 00:47:26.030
<v Speaker 2>aspects of archery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's where you're standing,</v>

904
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.130
<v Speaker 2>what your posture is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you're,</v>

905
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 2>how you're focusing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're looking</v>

906
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.540
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your concentrating on.</v>

907
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

908
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:39.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a tendency to anticipate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot and it becomes sort of overwhelming</v>

909
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:41.050
<v Speaker 1>because you're managing all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

910
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:46.350
<v Speaker 1>So what a lot of people try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate now in the world of archery</v>

911
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 1>is getting what you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a surprise shot.</v>

912
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that this is just for the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>at home,</v>

913
00:47:50.831 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 1>obviously not for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that when you pull back,</v>

914
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:59.140
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you concentrating on is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just focusing on the target.</v>

915
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:04.530
<v Speaker 1>All of your technique as far as keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bulb balanced and level and keeping</v>

916
00:48:04.661 --> 00:48:08.230
<v Speaker 1>it onto all that stuff is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already worked on.</v>

917
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:11.890
<v Speaker 1>All you're working on now is pulling</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the shot so you don't think</v>

918
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:16.330
<v Speaker 1>about executing the shot like ready go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you think of that ready go that</v>

919
00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 1>pressing that button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a tendency or possibility of</v>

920
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.360
<v Speaker 1>punching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hitting it wrong,</v>

921
00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:25.480
<v Speaker 1>of tweaking and twisting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we talked about that today because</v>

922
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it's in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fight.</v>

923
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.090
<v Speaker 1>You know that when a fighter trains for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fight,</v>

924
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.420
<v Speaker 1>you're training for something that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a moment that's like months</v>

925
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:40.330
<v Speaker 1>away from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of this work and effort then</v>

926
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 1>comes to fruition in this one moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fighter number one,</v>

927
00:48:42.971 --> 00:48:44.410
<v Speaker 1>are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fire number two.</v>

928
00:48:44.411 --> 00:48:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ready.</v>

929
00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

930
00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening,</v>

931
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.040
<v Speaker 1>but at least in a fight you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

932
00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:54.580
<v Speaker 1>you've got a few rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of settle in after the</v>

933
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 1>first minute or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can relax and get into the groove of</v>

934
00:48:57.131 --> 00:49:02.131
<v Speaker 1>everything in archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes that all that training and</v>

935
00:49:02.141 --> 00:49:04.120
<v Speaker 1>preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's for a tournament or even</v>

936
00:49:04.121 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 1>more critically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're hunting,</v>

937
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:10.900
<v Speaker 1>it comes down to that one moment in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment sometimes can be completely</v>

938
00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:15.901
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming because that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although your practice has been constant</v>

939
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:20.050
<v Speaker 1>and diligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that moment is entirely alien.</v>

940
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 1>This moment didn't exist during any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practice.</v>

941
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.750
<v Speaker 1>There was never the elevated heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never the freakout.</v>

942
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 1>There's never the massive consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make an error,</v>

943
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:31.720
<v Speaker 1>everything has to be in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>

944
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:36.310
<v Speaker 1>those things are what make a discipline</v>
<v Speaker 1>so rewarding.</v>

945
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:41.410
<v Speaker 1>When you actually pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those things like knowing that</v>

946
00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:45.460
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different factors</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved and then this alien moment,</v>

947
00:49:45.461 --> 00:49:48.310
<v Speaker 1>so those factors involve all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline factors.</v>

948
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:52.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to drill them into a point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they become a part of you.</v>

949
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.540
<v Speaker 1>They become like ingrained in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics.</v>

950
00:49:55.770 --> 00:50:00.770
<v Speaker 1>They become a part of your DNA so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that one insane heart pounding</v>

951
00:50:02.201 --> 00:50:04.900
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can execute it flawlessly and the</v>

952
00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:07.210
<v Speaker 1>best way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm learning from you,</v>

953
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.060
<v Speaker 1>is by figuring out how to do it with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise shot.</v>

954
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:14.260
<v Speaker 1>So that way you take out that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipation aspect of it.</v>

955
00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less you think about it,</v>

956
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:19.450
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is for things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

957
00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:24.830
<v Speaker 1>you know you have to be so focused on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process that the prize happens</v>

958
00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:27.860
<v Speaker 1>without your expectation.</v>

959
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:33.460
<v Speaker 2>The really interesting part about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned as a competitive archer is</v>

960
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:40.270
<v Speaker 2>it's the fastest buzz kill of any sport</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever had,</v>

961
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:45.730
<v Speaker 2>and what I mean by that is there's times</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're standing on the line,</v>

962
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.860
<v Speaker 2>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

963
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:51.140
<v Speaker 2>archer number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one Arrow,</v>

964
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.921
<v Speaker 2>archer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number two,</v>

965
00:50:51.921 --> 00:50:55.070
<v Speaker 2>one Arrow closest to center decides the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gold medal match.</v>

966
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:59.420
<v Speaker 2>You literally let go and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

967
00:50:59.421 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know shit and pickles.</v>

968
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Your heart rate's beaten out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your neck.</v>

969
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.940
<v Speaker 2>You know you're trying not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had this,</v>

970
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I've had this feeling go both ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you let that Arrow go and you,</v>

971
00:51:13.251 --> 00:51:18.251
<v Speaker 2>you have so much adrenaline that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely manage it and then you're,</v>

972
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 2>you shoot and you see the shadow of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow hit out like out of the gold to</v>

973
00:51:25.281 --> 00:51:30.170
<v Speaker 2>where you know you lost and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly gone.</v>

974
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.680
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not nervous,</v>

975
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.140
<v Speaker 2>you're sweating or shaking.</v>

976
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:41.030
<v Speaker 2>You just knew you blew it and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiped so fast.</v>

977
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really strange that the release of one</v>

978
00:51:45.801 --> 00:51:50.801
<v Speaker 2>product of an art form can just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you instantly know that you screwed up</v>

979
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.500
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've been that way as a hunter too,</v>

980
00:51:57.501 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 2>where you get nervous and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden that shot happens and then you</v>

981
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 2>almost can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

982
00:52:04.101 --> 00:52:07.670
<v Speaker 2>for some people they make the shot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they get like that.</v>

983
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:13.360
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes you make that shot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how fast it's just gone and</v>

984
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:19.450
<v Speaker 2>it's such a rewarding thing when you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>take that ball of just emotion and just</v>

985
00:52:24.321 --> 00:52:27.680
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this and you fricking clamped down</v>

986
00:52:27.681 --> 00:52:32.681
<v Speaker 2>on it and then you see that Arrow going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the gold and it's just like,</v>

987
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.280
<v Speaker 2>it's such a reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for me,</v>

988
00:52:37.281 --> 00:52:40.280
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think for you and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality,</v>

989
00:52:40.281 --> 00:52:44.060
<v Speaker 2>me and mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get so much reward for that.</v>

990
00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.120
<v Speaker 2>That for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really worried about it.</v>

991
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I never worried about a trophy or metal</v>
<v Speaker 2>or for that matter than checks never</v>

992
00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 2>really mattered either when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger I needed them.</v>

993
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just came to the realization that,</v>

994
00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:00.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every trophy I have at home is</v>

995
00:53:00.501 --> 00:53:01.520
<v Speaker 2>tarnished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

996
00:53:01.521 --> 00:53:03.110
<v Speaker 2>they need cleaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

997
00:53:03.111 --> 00:53:08.111
<v Speaker 2>they just wilt away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what imprints I have in my mind of</v>

998
00:53:08.121 --> 00:53:13.121
<v Speaker 2>moments like that's what pulls me</v>
<v Speaker 2>through as a person and it's positive or</v>

999
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:17.690
<v Speaker 2>that I can reflect on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1000
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:22.900
<v Speaker 2>I know that what's satisfying to me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel so content with life is these</v>

1001
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:27.930
<v Speaker 2>small little goals and accomplishments</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've had where I've controlled</v>

1002
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.870
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the situation.</v>

1003
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I was in a gold medal match in Poland</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1004
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.410
<v Speaker 2>they had the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gold medal match in this square,</v>

1005
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.460
<v Speaker 2>like in the square of the main town.</v>

1006
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:45.710
<v Speaker 2>You're shooting from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the beach into the main square of</v>

1007
00:53:45.711 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 2>the town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our match was first and I was the</v>

1008
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:50.760
<v Speaker 2>first archer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I stepped up.</v>

1009
00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:54.510
<v Speaker 2>We were in a team round and there was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people.</v>

1010
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I raised my bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled back,</v>

1011
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I was going into my shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I'm looking through my scope at</v>

1012
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:07.500
<v Speaker 2>the target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about four people's heads come,</v>

1013
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:12.501
<v Speaker 2>like looking in like this because there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are people lined all the way down and</v>

1014
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:18.360
<v Speaker 2>this is 70 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's evidently was shuffling to</v>

1015
00:54:18.361 --> 00:54:22.290
<v Speaker 2>try to get to see the archer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Realizing in like,</v>

1016
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:24.510
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an arrow going over your head.</v>

1017
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:28.650
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going from like mentally having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sight picture that I'm not nervous about</v>

1018
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:32.430
<v Speaker 2>to all of a sudden thinking if I shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in the face,</v>

1019
00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to spend the rest of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1020
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:34.980
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poland,</v>

1021
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Polish prison and I remember like</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like keep cleaning the line,</v>

1022
00:54:39.631 --> 00:54:40.830
<v Speaker 2>getting the people to back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1023
00:54:40.831 --> 00:54:43.320
<v Speaker 2>it was just like they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they really thought that</v>

1024
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:46.610
<v Speaker 2>people were going to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember I drew back and I was so,</v>

1025
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've seen me shoot in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>element.</v>

1026
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:52.860
<v Speaker 2>It's very smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then all of a sudden there was like,</v>

1027
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.080
<v Speaker 2>my front arm was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1028
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:57.180
<v Speaker 2>I got into that tremor mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1029
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:59.940
<v Speaker 2>you know what you have when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the anxiety sets in.</v>

1030
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 2>And I remember I shot and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1031
00:55:02.971 --> 00:55:07.680
<v Speaker 2>they called 10 and I came off the line</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my other teammate that was with me,</v>

1032
00:55:07.681 --> 00:55:09.540
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell,</v>

1033
00:55:09.541 --> 00:55:11.820
<v Speaker 2>dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you shaking so bad?</v>

1034
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.810
<v Speaker 2>If he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell,</v>

1035
00:55:12.811 --> 00:55:14.460
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you almost miss what's up with you,</v>

1036
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:17.040
<v Speaker 2>like as we're passing one another and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1037
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:21.480
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a fricken pulls back and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1038
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.130
<v Speaker 2>what the f?</v>

1039
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.950
<v Speaker 2>So that next round my gift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking people out of the way,</v>

1040
00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:33.360
<v Speaker 2>like I had people's faces in my scope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a youtube video waiting to</v>

1041
00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:35.880
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody catching one of the temple</v>

1042
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:38.720
<v Speaker 2>leaning into the path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just so ridiculous.</v>

1043
00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Don't want one to 10 if anybody doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1044
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.140
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're looking through a site</v>

1045
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1046
00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on archer and oboe,</v>

1047
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.740
<v Speaker 2>archery sites have very small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're looking at a very narrow</v>

1048
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for these people to actually be in</v>

1049
00:55:52.081 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 2>your site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to be extremely close to the</v>

1050
00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:56.210
<v Speaker 2>path of the era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a one.</v>

1051
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Arrow was arguing over there melon,</v>

1052
00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:03.530
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were between me and the</v>

1053
00:56:03.631 --> 00:56:05.430
<v Speaker 2>target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So crazy though.</v>

1054
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.860
<v Speaker 2>It was very crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1055
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1056
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.680
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did what I did at the pool today?</v>

1057
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Throwing</v>
<v Speaker 2>safety of that.</v>

1058
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy when you're concentrating all</v>

1059
00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:19.440
<v Speaker 2>the other things you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It weirds me out.</v>

1060
00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I've been at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been at places where I'm practicing</v>

1061
00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:25.870
<v Speaker 2>and you're like shooting and someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>else's at this club and you like go down</v>

1062
00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:28.300
<v Speaker 2>to pull your Arrow and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden you're like sitting there like</v>

1063

<v Speaker 2>how many Joe Rogan pool shots I've seen</v>

1069
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I might</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be on the receiving end of that</v>

1070
00:56:43.211 --> 00:56:44.980
<v Speaker 1>certainly can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1071
00:56:44.981 --> 00:56:47.320
<v Speaker 1>what you've got set up is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really cool.</v>

1072
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:52.321
<v Speaker 1>That giant long range at your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could practice like in your yard</v>

1073
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:54.400
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a video that you put up.</v>

1074
00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:58.110
<v Speaker 1>John set up my bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this bowl from hoyt.</v>

1075
00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:01.870
<v Speaker 1>John set it up perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he took these crazy shots and one of</v>

1076
00:57:01.871 --> 00:57:05.590
<v Speaker 1>them we took was 122 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1077
00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.780
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to do that and to have like</v>

1078
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:10.750
<v Speaker 1>this big open space like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your yard,</v>

1079
00:57:10.751 --> 00:57:12.900
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weak.</v>

1080
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:13.731
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1081
00:57:13.731 --> 00:57:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1082
00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:18.830
<v Speaker 2>when we bought my house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife Sharon,</v>

1083
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.760
<v Speaker 2>she knew that we wanted to move out to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm because we're.</v>

1084
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.830
<v Speaker 2>When I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before I moved to Iowa</v>

1085
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.020
<v Speaker 1>so that could get more deer tags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You laugh about that.</v>

1086
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:32.130
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck moves to a state so they can get</v>

1087
00:57:32.131 --> 00:57:34.660
<v Speaker 1>more deer tags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get an extra dear.</v>

1088
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee you right now.</v>

1089
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Campaigns could get to elk tags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he crossed the state line,</v>

1090
00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll guarantee it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would do it.</v>

1091
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He loves Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He travels a lot.</v>

1092
00:57:45.511 --> 00:57:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might see I get three buck tags.</v>

1093
00:57:48.451 --> 00:57:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Actually three different situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1094
00:57:51.451 --> 00:57:54.420
<v Speaker 1>like a white tail hunting and I was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>so different.</v>

1095
00:57:54.421 --> 00:57:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And plus it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is for folks who aren't aware if it's</v>

1096
00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:01.530
<v Speaker 1>like a tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1097
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.930
<v Speaker 1>it's an American thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a white tail.</v>

1098
00:58:03.931 --> 00:58:08.931
<v Speaker 1>Hunting is probably the biggest hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastime in America.</v>

1099
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:13.140
<v Speaker 1>More people hunt white tails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people spend more time hunting,</v>

1100
00:58:13.141 --> 00:58:17.490
<v Speaker 1>white tails than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also like probably some of the</v>

1101
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:20.100
<v Speaker 1>best meat you're ever going to eat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

1102
00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been crushing mind.</v>

1103
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1104
00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was so surprised when you</v>

1105
00:58:28.261 --> 00:58:30.690
<v Speaker 1>said you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't see like cooking as an art.</v>

1106
00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I actually went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go someplace nice,</v>

1107
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:35.783
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1108
00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I take pictures of my food because to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it that way.</v>

1109
00:58:39.181 --> 00:58:44.070
<v Speaker 2>And actually I cook some backstraps the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other night and you know,</v>

1110
00:58:44.071 --> 00:58:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I cook some backstrap so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1111
00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Cook some vegetables and like a coconut</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil or something and then,</v>

1112
00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like slice through that tenderloin and</v>

1113
00:58:53.551 --> 00:58:58.140
<v Speaker 2>like kind of folded them all down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then like stacked my little half strap</v>

1114
00:58:58.141 --> 00:59:01.590
<v Speaker 2>up and Kinda lean them against there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like looking at it like</v>

1115
00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:06.510
<v Speaker 2>why would people not want to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would people not want to be</v>

1116
00:59:06.511 --> 00:59:10.650
<v Speaker 2>able to do this for themselves to make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice meal and make a nice meal.</v>

1117
00:59:10.651 --> 00:59:12.210
<v Speaker 2>And obviously it's something that</v>

1118
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:15.820
<v Speaker 1>is a reward of hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work</v>

1119
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.890
<v Speaker 2>and dedication that I've put in through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year.</v>

1120
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:19.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my saying,</v>

1121
00:59:19.121 --> 00:59:24.121
<v Speaker 2>one saying that I made on my TV during</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first few seasons is I'm,</v>

1122
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm in target archery to become a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunter and I'm a better hunter because</v>

1123
00:59:29.331 --> 00:59:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm a target archer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got into professional archery 100</v>

1124
00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:39.161
<v Speaker 2>percent because I wanted to be more</v>
<v Speaker 2>proficient and ethical knowing that I</v>

1125
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:46.480
<v Speaker 2>was a bow hunter and I kind of had the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually the same type of feeling.</v>

1126
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was only 10 but it or I mean when I</v>

1127
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.910
<v Speaker 2>started competing I started hunting when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 10,</v>

1128
00:59:52.911 --> 00:59:56.600
<v Speaker 2>so there was like six or seven years</v>
<v Speaker 2>there where I wasn't competing.</v>

1129
00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:02.410
<v Speaker 2>But I remember having one hunt where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt so much anxiety and I like blue is</v>

1130
01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:07.580
<v Speaker 2>shot and I just completely missed and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't explain why.</v>

1131
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.220
<v Speaker 2>And it was at that moment that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1132
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be able to be ethical at it.</v>

1133
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.440
<v Speaker 2>So at that point I was kind of looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a way to become better.</v>

1134
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:24.950
<v Speaker 2>And I was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was right before I was supposed to</v>

1135
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:27.650
<v Speaker 2>leave for my first football camps or</v>
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>

1136
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.300
<v Speaker 2>I was driving down a road and there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sign on the road that said,</v>

1137
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three d archery shoots and it was just</v>

1138
01:00:35.691 --> 01:00:40.691
<v Speaker 2>an Arrow pointing down and I pulled in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had like my hunting bow in the back of</v>

1139
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 2>my truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1140
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:46.370
<v Speaker 2>kind of drive in and I see all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like shooting on this practice</v>

1141
01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:48.710
<v Speaker 2>range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I see like groups of four going</v>

1142
01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:53.711
<v Speaker 2>into this course to like shoot and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was all foam animal targets with scoring</v>

1143
01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:57.830
<v Speaker 2>rings on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you step up to the line,</v>

1144
01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you look at the target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to figure out how far it is</v>

1145
01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:02.810
<v Speaker 2>without having a range finder.</v>

1146
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.530
<v Speaker 2>And then you make a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And depending on,</v>

1147
01:01:06.531 --> 01:01:09.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the scoring is within the ethical</v>

1148
01:01:09.261 --> 01:01:14.261
<v Speaker 2>kill zone of the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after I think,</v>

1149
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 15 targets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a 40 target course after 15</v>

1150
01:01:20.001 --> 01:01:22.580
<v Speaker 2>targets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a single Arrow left in my</v>

1151
01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:25.910
<v Speaker 2>quiver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had lost all of them and it was like a</v>

1152
01:01:25.911 --> 01:01:30.260
<v Speaker 2>wake up call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time that I had ever</v>

1153
01:01:30.261 --> 01:01:35.240
<v Speaker 2>felt defeated at something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time that I had a very</v>

1154
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:40.720
<v Speaker 2>clear wakeup call of maybe you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>good enough to be doing this,</v>

1155
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for me that was a trigger as a</v>

1156
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:49.250
<v Speaker 2>competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the standout athletes in any</v>

1157
01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:54.251
<v Speaker 2>sport are the ones that take those</v>
<v Speaker 2>moments very personal and change the</v>

1158
01:01:55.421 --> 01:02:00.421
<v Speaker 2>direction to make it their best or</v>
<v Speaker 2>either realized I'm either going to be</v>

1159
01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:05.180
<v Speaker 2>good at this or I need to find something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else to be good at,</v>

1160
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:07.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to focus all your energy to.</v>

1161
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:12.890
<v Speaker 2>And one thing led to another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to an archery shop were I saw a</v>

1162
01:02:12.891 --> 01:02:16.340
<v Speaker 2>lot of guys with shirts on that said</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the name of a shop.</v>

1163
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:20.970
<v Speaker 2>So I knew they were like kind of local</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooters representing this store.</v>

1164
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:25.230
<v Speaker 2>So the next day I was in that store and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1165
01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.880
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get better.</v>

1166
01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of guys here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're shooting and a lot of those guys</v>

1167
01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:32.790
<v Speaker 2>were in the range and I just started</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking questions.</v>

1168
01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:37.380
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people didn't want to help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I really want to help the</v>

1169
01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 2>archery world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my way of giving back because there</v>

1170
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:44.991
<v Speaker 2>were people that didn't want to help me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I remember the guy came in and</v>

1171
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:47.550
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are my arrows done?</v>

1172
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:50.670
<v Speaker 2>And the guy behind the counter said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me check in the back,</v>

1173
01:02:50.671 --> 01:02:52.380
<v Speaker 2>and he kind of walked past me and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1174
01:02:52.381 --> 01:02:53.214
<v Speaker 2>come here kid.</v>

1175
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.710
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had hung out in that store for</v>

1176
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:57.870
<v Speaker 2>about four days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of watching and looking</v>

1177
01:02:57.871 --> 01:03:00.690
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really have any importance.</v>

1178
01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.320
<v Speaker 2>So he takes me in the back room and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1179
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:09.420
<v Speaker 2>you got to build these guys arrows for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me because I forgot to do them.</v>

1180
01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.460
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to build arrows.</v>

1181
01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:12.290
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1182
01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:14.550
<v Speaker 2>you take this feather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put it in this clamp,</v>

1183
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.130
<v Speaker 2>put glue right down this feather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

1184
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Put the Arrow in this Jig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You push down on it.</v>

1185
01:03:20.161 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Then you turn the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the next Arrow after you get to</v>

1186
01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:24.720
<v Speaker 2>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the clamp off,</v>

1187
01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:25.930
<v Speaker 2>put another feather in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1188
01:03:25.931 --> 01:03:29.190
<v Speaker 2>and he literally gave me the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was in there like trying to figure</v>

1189
01:03:29.191 --> 01:03:31.410
<v Speaker 2>out how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even work there.</v>

1190
01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:33.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there like,</v>

1191
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:35.700
<v Speaker 2>like literally stalking people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>range.</v>

1192
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I was like the weird guy in the corner</v>
<v Speaker 2>with like the hunting bow that was</v>

1193
01:03:38.911 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 2>probably my dad's hand me down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like stocking all the shooters and</v>

1194
01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>about an hour later I came out with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1195
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.420
<v Speaker 2>this guy's arrows that he probably paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 bucks for and some like snot nosed</v>

1196
01:03:50.421 --> 01:03:53.100
<v Speaker 2>kid that had never even built them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>built them for the guy.</v>

1197
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.650
<v Speaker 2>And so he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1198
01:03:55.651 --> 01:03:56.880
<v Speaker 2>good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes here,</v>

1199
01:03:56.910 --> 01:04:01.910
<v Speaker 2>now go do these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And two weeks later I remember telling</v>

1200
01:04:01.981 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1201
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:04.950
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1202
01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The football thing.</v>

1203
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:09.120
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

1204
01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got offered a job at this archery</v>

1205
01:04:13.171 --> 01:04:14.220
<v Speaker 2>shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it.</v>

1206
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.770
<v Speaker 2>And my dad's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're not going to play college</v>

1207
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:19.590
<v Speaker 2>football and get a get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1208
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 2>an education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to work at an archery shop.</v>

1209
01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:23.630
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this archery shop pay?</v>

1210
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 10 an hour.</v>

1211
01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my dad's been so good.</v>

1212
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:34.530
<v Speaker 2>My both my parents have been so</v>
<v Speaker 2>supportive on everything in life.</v>

1213
01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:37.530
<v Speaker 2>But that was the one time where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked me in the face and just said,</v>

1214
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.160
<v Speaker 2>this is a really stupid decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Hey,</v>

1215
01:04:43.291 --> 01:04:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1216
01:04:44.311 --> 01:04:48.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's a great story because</v>

1217
01:04:48.661 --> 01:04:52.530
<v Speaker 2>it shows that if someone's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>commit to a dream,</v>

1218
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:58.610
<v Speaker 2>then as long as you're able to put in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work and stay focused on it,</v>

1219
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people that make</v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses out of dreams are,</v>

1220
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>careers out of sports that you would</v>

1221
01:05:05.371 --> 01:05:09.030
<v Speaker 2>never even consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just think of that story.</v>

1222
01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Now you're traveling all over the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>coaching international teams and</v>

1223
01:05:12.961 --> 01:05:14.280
<v Speaker 2>archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1224
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.040
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really stop.</v>

1225
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some very.</v>

<v Speaker 2>successful according to the business</v>

1228

<v Speaker 2>those people and then they're</v>

<v Speaker 2>And all you have to do is get up every</v>

1253
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:42.360
<v Speaker 2>morning when the alarm goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine goes off pretty early and then just</v>

1254
01:06:42.551 --> 01:06:44.380
<v Speaker 2>put in the work and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1255
01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's so cool to know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's opportunity like that and</v>

1256
01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a different path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a path that maybe perhaps other people</v>

1257
01:06:52.061 --> 01:06:52.750
<v Speaker 2>hadn't considered.</v>

1258
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1259
01:06:53.711 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1260
01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:00.420
<v Speaker 2>it's such a great country to live in to</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the states because you can take</v>

1261
01:07:00.701 --> 01:07:03.880
<v Speaker 2>something that no one really might not</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in yourself.</v>

1262
01:07:03.881 --> 01:07:06.970
<v Speaker 2>And if you apply the work to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make it happen.</v>

1263
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:11.770
<v Speaker 2>And in traveling through all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the world that I've</v>

1264
01:07:11.771 --> 01:07:14.680
<v Speaker 2>traveled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone to places where you just,</v>

1265
01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really wish you could give some of</v>

1266
01:07:17.921 --> 01:07:22.630
<v Speaker 2>those people a chance because you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell that they have such heart and such</v>

1267
01:07:22.631 --> 01:07:25.150
<v Speaker 2>desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have opportunity.</v>

1268
01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's sad to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1269
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:31.210
<v Speaker 2>that's really sad that there's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity everywhere.</v>

1270
01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:36.420
<v Speaker 2>And then you come here and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that has potential or</v>

1271
01:07:37.271 --> 01:07:40.990
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're lazy and they won't put in</v>

1272
01:07:40.991 --> 01:07:43.780
<v Speaker 2>the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the desperation,</v>

1273
01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.300
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the drive,</v>

1274
01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:46.660
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

1275
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.580
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1276
01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of times for some people</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're young,</v>

1277
01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:55.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not enforced early on that when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>work hard at something,</v>

1278
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:58.240
<v Speaker 2>it's really rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's over and it's difficult to</v>

1279
01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.610
<v Speaker 2>work hard at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to get your ass out of</v>

1280
01:08:00.611 --> 01:08:02.650
<v Speaker 2>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to force yourself to get</v>

1281
01:08:02.651 --> 01:08:04.200
<v Speaker 2>up off the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult,</v>

1282
01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.970
<v Speaker 2>but once you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always good.</v>

1283
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.810
<v Speaker 2>It always feels good and even if you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and it doesn't work out well,</v>

1284
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.690
<v Speaker 2>like even if you are practicing archery</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the shots,</v>

1285
01:08:13.691 --> 01:08:14.880
<v Speaker 2>don't go well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's silly.</v>

1286
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>You're involved</v>

1287
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>in the discipline has given you</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to concentrate on and that'll</v>

1288
01:08:19.191 --> 01:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>translate that energy and momentum will</v>
<v Speaker 1>translate to the rest of your life.</v>

1289
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:24.770
<v Speaker 1>If you're working to improve at</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1290
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:29.360
<v Speaker 1>whether it's archery or Jujitsu or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything when you working to improve,</v>

1291
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 1>improve on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I firmly believe that that motivation</v>

1292
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:37.850
<v Speaker 1>and that momentum of improvement applies</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the rest of your life and it's one of</v>

1293
01:08:37.851 --> 01:08:42.030
<v Speaker 1>the things that people love about any</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular discipline is the,</v>

1294
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>the aspects of it and the qualities of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that sort of transfer onto your</v>

1295
01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:47.534
<v Speaker 1>everyday life.</v>

1296
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:51.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because until you and I</v>

1297
01:08:52.190 --> 01:08:57.110
<v Speaker 2>communicated some on the phone when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked for an archery company and I was</v>

1298
01:08:57.111 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 2>just a sales guy making calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got to see faces.</v>

1299
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:03.980
<v Speaker 2>All ever heard was voices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So voices for me are always triggers</v>

1300
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:09.010
<v Speaker 2>because for 10 years I was just making</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls when you and I first talked on the</v>

1301
01:09:09.801 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 2>phone and I like heard your voice</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly.</v>

1302
01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Like from my device I actually realized</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't even told you this,</v>

1303
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:24.281
<v Speaker 2>but I when I work out or when I shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of times when I'm just working</v>

1304
01:09:26.271 --> 01:09:31.271
<v Speaker 2>in my building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've comprised like about five hours of</v>

1305
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 2>a MP3.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing but motivational sayings</v>

1306
01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.960
<v Speaker 2>that I've heard someone say whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1307
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:47.020
<v Speaker 2>that's all I play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my ambient sound and you are on</v>

1308
01:09:47.181 --> 01:09:52.181
<v Speaker 2>there twice about just almost like what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just talked about,</v>

1309
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:55.010
<v Speaker 2>just a positive.</v>

1310
01:09:55.610 --> 01:10:00.610
<v Speaker 2>It was just a positive rant that you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all people have to do is make a</v>

1311
01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:05.030
<v Speaker 2>step in a direction and you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might look in the mirror one time</v>

1312
01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.920
<v Speaker 2>and you don't like what's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1313
01:10:06.921 --> 01:10:11.360
<v Speaker 2>you have the opportunity to turn around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go a different way.</v>

1314
01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:16.420
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that I really try to drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people because there's times you talk</v>

1315
01:10:16.801 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 2>to someone and you know that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>down in the dumps.</v>

1316
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any one thing I tell people is,</v>

1317
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation gets you going.</v>

1318
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Commitment keeps you going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1319
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:33.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no different than the new year's</v>

1320
01:10:33.891 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 2>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fricking hate that.</v>

1321
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I hate if there's any time a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to the gym.</v>

1322
01:10:41.061 --> 01:10:46.061
<v Speaker 2>It's two weeks after New Year's because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this swarm of people and all</v>

1323
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:50.090
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people in there were like,</v>

1324
01:10:50.091 --> 01:10:51.200
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for them.</v>

1325
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.963
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1326
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:56.030
<v Speaker 2>they're not in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for them to come here.</v>

1327
01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:01.750
<v Speaker 2>But then it's so disappointing when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two days and they're gone.</v>

1328
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.233
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1329
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.070
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1330
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 2>if you're at that stage and you're at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where you're like,</v>

1331
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:12.620
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to change myself physically.</v>

1332
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 2>It's funny how many</v>

1333
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 1>people won't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how many people are going to</v>

1334
01:11:18.991 --> 01:11:23.730
<v Speaker 1>the gym to work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll circle the gym parking lot</v>

1335
01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:29.150
<v Speaker 1>like 10 times because they want the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first row to open up.</v>

1336
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Your work is far away from the front</v>
<v Speaker 1>door as you can and warm up by walking.</v>

1337
01:11:35.451 --> 01:11:37.830
<v Speaker 1>You skip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skip to the loo.</v>

1338
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people need a life</v>

1339
01:11:41.851 --> 01:11:44.760
<v Speaker 1>coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is what I'm the conclusion.</v>

1340
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.820
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I'm coming to in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is that,</v>

1341
01:11:47.821 --> 01:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people need to either find a way to</v>

1342
01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:56.070
<v Speaker 1>motivate themselves through all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different stuff that's available online.</v>

1343
01:11:56.071 --> 01:11:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a million different websites and</v>

1344
01:11:57.661 --> 01:12:01.310
<v Speaker 1>instagram pages and lots of youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos that show some motivation and</v>

1345
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 1>they can help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>

1346
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.440
<v Speaker 1>human beings learn from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think most of the cultures in the</v>

1347
01:12:09.691 --> 01:12:13.080
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not trying to glorify the past and say</v>

1348
01:12:13.081 --> 01:12:15.840
<v Speaker 1>they had it nailed and we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of them were entitled knit</v>

1349
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:20.730
<v Speaker 1>groups and the emulated the behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patterns of the successful members</v>

1350
01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:21.420
<v Speaker 1>of that group.</v>

1351
01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:26.420
<v Speaker 1>The leaders of that tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where traditions and came from.</v>

1352
01:12:26.821 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 1>That's where skills were passed on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where ethics and that's where</v>

1353
01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:35.010
<v Speaker 1>certain philosophies were passed down</v>
<v Speaker 1>from generation to generation.</v>

1354
01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.040
<v Speaker 1>These were the most beneficial to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community as a whole to the individual,</v>

1355
01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:43.230
<v Speaker 1>to the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the whatever it is.</v>

1356
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:49.050
<v Speaker 1>This world that we're living in today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're almost in a lot of ways,</v>

1357
01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:53.670
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with so much opportunity but to</v>

1358
01:12:53.671 --> 01:12:56.370
<v Speaker 1>lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're almost in a lot of ways just</v>

1359
01:12:56.371 --> 01:13:01.371
<v Speaker 1>lacking in a pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a correct pattern and a coach or a</v>

1360
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.880
<v Speaker 1>mentor or a person who is ahead of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but honest like ahead of you as far as</v>

1361
01:13:09.661 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 1>like maybe been alive longer or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>had more experiences,</v>

1362
01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:16.440
<v Speaker 1>but very honest about the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between you and them.</v>

1363
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of people think that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see some.</v>

1364
01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Like we're talking about today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a ridiculous analogy,</v>

1365
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:28.350
<v Speaker 1>but when I was on MTV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about downtown Julie Brown</v>

1366
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:33.090
<v Speaker 1>because I was singing on the line and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember thinking while you were saying</v>

1367
01:13:33.091 --> 01:13:33.730
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

1368
01:13:33.730 --> 01:13:37.710
<v Speaker 1>you go downtown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Julie Brown was probably on MTV back</v>

1369
01:13:37.711 --> 01:13:39.600
<v Speaker 1>when you were unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1370
01:13:39.601 --> 01:13:41.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was a peon.</v>

1371
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Like she wouldn't know who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on one of,</v>

1372
01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x amount of Comedians on the MTV half</v>

1373
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.780
<v Speaker 1>hour comedy hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't probably couldn't even</v>

1374
01:13:48.781 --> 01:13:50.340
<v Speaker 1>talk to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say hi to her.</v>

1375
01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:55.730
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember thinking like I put</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself in that state of mind that I had</v>

1376
01:13:56.071 --> 01:14:00.330
<v Speaker 1>back when I was 23 or whatever I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was on that show and I felt like</v>

1377
01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.540
<v Speaker 1>insignificant and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's downtown Julie Brown.</v>

1378
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:08.130
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized like now that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

1379
01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Like now I know that's nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my head thinking about that time</v>

1380
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I did when I was 23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That like,</v>

1381
01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was your first reply.</v>

1382
01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:19.991
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1383
01:14:19.991 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 1>but I was just a p on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>

1384
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I think once you thought about first few</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds you're like,</v>

1385
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:26.810
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>f that,</v>

1386
01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:31.270
<v Speaker 1>well it's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I did think that way back then.</v>

1387
01:14:31.271 --> 01:14:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of other people think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way now.</v>

1388
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whether it's a someone who's an</v>

1389
01:14:36.311 --> 01:14:39.880
<v Speaker 1>aspiring archer that looks at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments and then looks at you</v>

1390
01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:43.020
<v Speaker 1>back when you were this stalker kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging around a bowshot yeah.</v>

1391
01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>In comparison to how they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a big,</v>

1392
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:51.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a big help to people to hear a</v>
<v Speaker 1>story like that and to know that now you</v>

1393
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:56.761
<v Speaker 1>travel all over the world and you coach</v>
<v Speaker 1>international teams and to see someone</v>

1394
01:14:58.090 --> 01:15:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it admit that I think is very important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see someone discussed that I think is</v>

1395
01:15:01.961 --> 01:15:05.800
<v Speaker 1>very important to a lot of us because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really.</v>

1396
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't have fucking mentors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most people aren't even involved in</v>

1397
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:13.090
<v Speaker 1>like a discipline that tests them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that manner.</v>

1398
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:15.100
<v Speaker 1>We're involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are involved in</v>

1399
01:15:15.101 --> 01:15:16.090
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1400
01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.920
<v Speaker 1>You go through high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to college,</v>

1401
01:15:17.921 --> 01:15:19.040
<v Speaker 1>get a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're studying,</v>

1402
01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:22.330
<v Speaker 1>you're practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how much of that what you're doing</v>

1403
01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:27.331
<v Speaker 1>has the aspects of the obsession with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline like archery or like Jujitsu</v>

1404
01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:31.750
<v Speaker 1>or something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not getting the same intensity</v>

1405
01:15:31.751 --> 01:15:34.240
<v Speaker 1>and focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're reluctant to do the work.</v>

1406
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:37.000
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it because you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you got to get a degree because</v>

1407
01:15:37.001 --> 01:15:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you got to get a job because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be a loser and so you're</v>

1408
01:15:39.761 --> 01:15:43.600
<v Speaker 1>pursuing these things with a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>passion and then you enter into the</v>

1409
01:15:43.601 --> 01:15:46.600
<v Speaker 1>workforce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you're doing what you love.</v>

1410
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time people are not.</v>

1411
01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time people are doing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think is a good job that they can</v>

1412
01:15:50.981 --> 01:15:55.981
<v Speaker 1>get by with and so they're committed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this path of not being excited,</v>

1413
01:15:56.801 --> 01:15:59.890
<v Speaker 1>not being obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then not challenging themselves and</v>

1414
01:15:59.891 --> 01:16:04.891
<v Speaker 1>not rising above and not gathering up</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the possible lessons that you</v>

1415
01:16:05.441 --> 01:16:08.800
<v Speaker 1>can and it could be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be anything.</v>

1416
01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:12.610
<v Speaker 1>If you want to make knives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you love making jackets,</v>

1417
01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:14.680
<v Speaker 1>if you like painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

1418
01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:18.910
<v Speaker 1>There's no one particular thing that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be for you.</v>

1419
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.600
<v Speaker 1>You just have to find out whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts that spark in you.</v>

1420
01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.790
<v Speaker 1>For you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was archery.</v>

1421
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:25.180
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was standup comedy,</v>

1422
01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or martial arts,</v>

1423
01:16:26.951 --> 01:16:27.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

1424
01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.420
<v Speaker 1>it could really be anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we need things like that.</v>

1425
01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:35.150
<v Speaker 1>If people don't have things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they just work and then they go home</v>

1426
01:16:35.151 --> 01:16:37.480
<v Speaker 1>and they watch TV and they work and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>go home and watch tv,</v>

1427
01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:41.710
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not fucking living life at level</v>

1428
01:16:41.711 --> 01:16:43.510
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hit it.</v>

1429
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:45.460
<v Speaker 1>You're never gonna feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying you're gonna be at</v>

1430
01:16:45.461 --> 01:16:48.130
<v Speaker 1>level 10 every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be some moments</v>

1431
01:16:48.131 --> 01:16:49.660
<v Speaker 1>like when you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1432
01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:51.550
<v Speaker 1>being on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1433
01:16:51.551 --> 01:16:55.030
<v Speaker 1>wha to archers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the for one shot,</v>

1434
01:16:55.031 --> 01:16:59.260
<v Speaker 1>for the gold medal and alert that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling,</v>

1435
01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:03.460
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those feelings are integral to being a</v>

1436
01:17:03.461 --> 01:17:06.310
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feelings of being challenged and of</v>

1437
01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 1>learning what you're capable of and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not capable of through</v>

1438
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:12.080
<v Speaker 2>those challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1439
01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:15.710
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able,</v>

1440
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 2>when you've made that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next thing that you should come to</v>

1441
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:22.370
<v Speaker 2>terms with is say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1442
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to push myself further and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever pushed myself and I know damn</v>

1443
01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:29.510
<v Speaker 2>good and well there's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>block.</v>

1444
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:33.020
<v Speaker 2>There's gonna be resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard in a podcast for me long ago,</v>

1445
01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:36.110
<v Speaker 2>you talked about the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war of art.</v>

1446
01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:38.060
<v Speaker 2>I bought it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven Pressfield.</v>

1447
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1448
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.220
<v Speaker 2>it talks about resistance and actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1449
01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:46.490
<v Speaker 2>with you learning this new release for</v>
<v Speaker 2>your archery,</v>

1450
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I told you before you even made your</v>
<v Speaker 2>first shot,</v>

1451
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:54.710
<v Speaker 2>there is going to be a point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to like this and you</v>

1452
01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:57.680
<v Speaker 2>need to know right now that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to push through it.</v>

1453
01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:02.510
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of times when people make that</v>
<v Speaker 2>determination and that decision in life,</v>

1454
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.261
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1455
01:18:03.261 --> 01:18:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get ready.</v>

1456
01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:10.010
<v Speaker 2>You need to also think you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be.</v>

1457
01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a voice in my head</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to tell me this is too hard</v>

1458
01:18:13.401 --> 01:18:15.380
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to have a point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance,</v>

1459
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling myself right now when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get that,</v>

1460
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:22.310
<v Speaker 2>that's my opportunity to go further than</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever had in the past.</v>

1461
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I know right now that when I get to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am pushing through it.</v>

1462
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:33.630
<v Speaker 2>If you're only focused on one particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>goal and not seeing the obvious</v>

1463
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.870
<v Speaker 2>distractions or things that are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1464
01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.380
<v Speaker 2>that you know are going to be in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>path and mentally build,</v>

1465
01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:46.060
<v Speaker 2>build up yourself to know when I get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that resistance,</v>

1466
01:18:46.061 --> 01:18:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I am driving through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1467
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I listen to that podcast with Steve</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and he talked about.</v>

1468
01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:55.620
<v Speaker 2>He knew he was ready to beat his habits</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when he was in there and they're</v>

1469
01:18:58.091 --> 01:19:00.370
<v Speaker 2>like telling him that he should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

1470
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:01.390
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1471
01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1472
01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.090
<v Speaker 2>he probably knew deep down inside that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he left,</v>

1473
01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:08.230
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1474
01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.750
<v Speaker 2>it was gonna be an opportunity for him</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fail.</v>

1475
01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.650
<v Speaker 2>So he had already made up his mind that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going through that.</v>

1476
01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:20.340
<v Speaker 2>And so many people in life just don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>push that one time and then they never</v>

1477
01:19:22.601 --> 01:19:26.000
<v Speaker 2>really see how far they can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1478
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I heard like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1479
01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:30.460
<v Speaker 2>one time I heard Les Brown say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1480
01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather go through life?</v>

1481
01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm aiming too high and miss or aiming</v>
<v Speaker 2>too low and hit.</v>

1482
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would rather aim high and fall short</v>

1483
01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:50.681
<v Speaker 2>and still be further ahead then aiming</v>
<v Speaker 2>too low and hitting exactly a low goal.</v>

1484
01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:57.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to be willing to fail</v>

1485
01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:01.010
<v Speaker 2>and get good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost way more tournaments than I've</v>

1486
01:20:01.011 --> 01:20:04.190
<v Speaker 2>ever won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the people that like</v>

1487
01:20:04.191 --> 01:20:06.910
<v Speaker 2>question why I'm at where I'm at in</v>
<v Speaker 2>archery that are,</v>

1488
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we never won that much.</v>

1489
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:10.320
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably lost more than anybody.</v>

1490
01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:13.890
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I dang sure know that it made me a</v>

1491
01:20:13.891 --> 01:20:16.470
<v Speaker 2>better person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I lost,</v>

1492
01:20:16.471 --> 01:20:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I was at the tournament the next week</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that I worked on whatever it</v>

1493
01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:23.520
<v Speaker 2>was that caused me to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1494
01:20:23.521 --> 01:20:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I think I remember a guy one time</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1495
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't really figured out how to</v>

1496
01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:32.520
<v Speaker 2>win yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1497
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.410
<v Speaker 2>and that's critical for an athlete.</v>

1498
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's critical that that moment that</v>

1499
01:20:36.961 --> 01:20:41.490
<v Speaker 1>happens in any competition where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about the event,</v>

1500
01:20:41.491 --> 01:20:46.491
<v Speaker 1>you're worried about the outcome and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that worry can overwhelm your abilities.</v>

1501
01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1502
01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1503
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:52.220
<v Speaker 2>And when you get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be willing to dig deep down</v>

1504
01:20:52.221 --> 01:20:53.210
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1505
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:57.170
<v Speaker 2>This is what I've worked for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew this was coming.</v>

1506
01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it,</v>

1507
01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:04.330
<v Speaker 2>if there wasn't nervousness and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of defeat or victory,</v>

1508
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:11.360
<v Speaker 2>then there probably wouldn't be any</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of inner accomplishment to it.</v>

1509
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:14.720
<v Speaker 2>You've literally done everything you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to that moment.</v>

1510
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:18.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a defining moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So which way are you going to go,</v>

1511
01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:20.060
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have a decision to make.</v>

1512
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:25.510
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my victories were so much sweeter</v>

1513
01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:31.540
<v Speaker 2>because I had failed a lot before that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it got to the point where I remember</v>

1514
01:21:31.851 --> 01:21:36.851
<v Speaker 2>being in a match one time and I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken like several second thirds leading</v>

1515
01:21:37.401 --> 01:21:40.220
<v Speaker 2>up to that and I remember getting there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just,</v>

1516
01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I closed my eyes on that last Arrow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just am like,</v>

1517
01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm freaking sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have blown it,</v>

1518
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:51.020
<v Speaker 2>screw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it again.</v>

1519
01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a good shot.</v>

1520
01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Visual rocky movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1521
01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

1522
01:21:58.261 --> 01:22:02.170
<v Speaker 1>So I just closed my eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and made</v>

1523
01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:04.630
<v Speaker 2>the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I made it,</v>

1524
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:10.090
<v Speaker 2>the victory seems so much sweeter</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had pushed through adversity</v>

1525
01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.550
<v Speaker 2>to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1526
01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I love about archery is</v>

1527
01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.581
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1528
01:22:15.581 --> 01:22:18.610
<v Speaker 2>one day you're so good and then the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>day you know,</v>

1529
01:22:18.611 --> 01:22:20.530
<v Speaker 2>you see flaws and you see mistake.</v>

1530
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:24.640
<v Speaker 1>What's a long rabbit hole too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the weirdest thing about archery.</v>

1531
01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.590
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't think it's such a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbit hole.</v>

1532
01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:29.230
<v Speaker 1>There's so much to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many different places to go.</v>

1533
01:22:29.231 --> 01:22:30.670
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many people that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>

1534
01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you watch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1535
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I've taken to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch hunting shows much to the</v>

1536
01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Chagrin of my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Hilarious,</v>

1537
01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:41.080
<v Speaker 1>but some of them are so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so,</v>

1538
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:44.080
<v Speaker 1>they're such bad production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to learn bad</v>

1539
01:22:44.081 --> 01:22:45.760
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you're a person out there</v>

1540
01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:48.850
<v Speaker 1>that's aspiring to do a TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

1541
01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.990
<v Speaker 1>there's some hunting shows out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that look like they were made by blind</v>

1542
01:22:52.991 --> 01:22:57.520
<v Speaker 1>people that were drunk and the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

1543
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:58.363
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1544
01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.810
<v Speaker 1>especially the archery shows they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking miss more than they hit them.</v>

1545
01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean if someone from like if wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make an argument against the ethical use</v>

1546
01:23:08.561 --> 01:23:12.000
<v Speaker 1>of archery for hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they need to do and where to go</v>

1547
01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:15.420
<v Speaker 1>watch some of those fucking shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's this.</v>

1548
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1549
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:21.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a difficult thing to do and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people kind of half asset and some of</v>

1550
01:23:21.191 --> 01:23:23.770
<v Speaker 1>those people that do have acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on television.</v>

1551
01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that brings up a really good point</v>

1552
01:23:26.241 --> 01:23:30.290
<v Speaker 2>because I know a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably are listening that you either</v>

1553
01:23:30.291 --> 01:23:34.190
<v Speaker 2>know myself or know that you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting advocate and a conservationist</v>

1554
01:23:34.191 --> 01:23:39.191
<v Speaker 2>like myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We owe it to ourselves as an art,</v>

1555
01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:42.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a hunting community to realize that</v>

1556
01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:47.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a big opposition pushing back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have a responsibility to</v>

1557
01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:54.640
<v Speaker 2>represent ourselves ethically and also</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate other people's feelings and</v>

1558
01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:59.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate that there are people that</v>

1559
01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:04.240
<v Speaker 2>might not like it and you really have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to either do something</v>

1560
01:24:04.401 --> 01:24:08.600
<v Speaker 2>that's going to really piss them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if you're going to maybe do something</v>

1561
01:24:08.601 --> 01:24:11.480
<v Speaker 2>to where it'll at least let them keep an</v>
<v Speaker 2>open mind.</v>

1562
01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:12.314
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1563
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to do that I think is have</v>

1564
01:24:14.621 --> 01:24:16.090
<v Speaker 1>conversations about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1565
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how many facebook</v>

1566
01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:20.740
<v Speaker 1>messages and twitter messages I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten from people that have told me</v>

1567
01:24:20.741 --> 01:24:24.940
<v Speaker 1>that they had a particular view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a negative view about hunting and until</v>

1568
01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:28.960
<v Speaker 1>they listen to like maybe a podcast with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella or Cameron Hanes or Jim</v>

1569
01:24:28.961 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 1>shockey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they realize like,</v>

1570
01:24:30.851 --> 01:24:33.010
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not what I think it is.</v>

1571
01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it not what I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must do something to control these</v>

1572
01:24:38.921 --> 01:24:41.350
<v Speaker 1>animal populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing,</v>

1573
01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I've said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna.</v>

1574
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Say it again to anybody that thinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to ever kill wild</v>

1575
01:24:46.391 --> 01:24:48.670
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two words for you.</v>

1576
01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Feral pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1577
01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:54.550
<v Speaker 1>You better do something because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do something,</v>

1578
01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:58.600
<v Speaker 1>they will fucking overwhelmed the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about people?</v>

1579
01:24:58.690 --> 01:25:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are overwhelming.</v>

1580
01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.840

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1581
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I like people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have sex with them,</v>

1582
01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you can talk to them and you go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies with them.</v>

1583
01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:09.100
<v Speaker 1>They make cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of Pete,</v>

1584
01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:13.070
<v Speaker 2>except people that make parking lots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're making some narrow parking.</v>

1585
01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:22.660
<v Speaker 2>whoever was working for like American</v>
<v Speaker 2>and United Airlines that made economy</v>

1589
01:25:22.941 --> 01:25:27.941
<v Speaker 2>plus and then took the big dump on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular economy seats for someone</v>

1590
01:25:28.401 --> 01:25:32.480
<v Speaker 2>finally fired those people and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>started designing parking lots because</v>

1591
01:25:32.481 --> 01:25:35.330
<v Speaker 2>fricking you can't park your junk in</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything anymore.</v>

1592
01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:39.320
<v Speaker 2>They never have an obvious way to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the Strip mall.</v>

1593
01:25:39.321 --> 01:25:42.750
<v Speaker 2>That's right next door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make you like exit the Fricken Pac</v>

1594
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:46.430
<v Speaker 2>man exit or like you have to go around</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the ghosts and shit to like finally</v>

1595
01:25:46.431 --> 01:25:50.510
<v Speaker 2>get to the one way to get out and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn and go down to get into the next</v>

1596
01:25:50.511 --> 01:25:52.100
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they definitely try to shove</v>

1597
01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:55.490
<v Speaker 1>too many spots in places like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1598
01:25:55.491 --> 01:25:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I was somewhere recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Santa Barbara where it's real nice,</v>

1599
01:25:59.481 --> 01:26:02.210
<v Speaker 1>but there's not that many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I noticed when I</v>

1600
01:26:02.211 --> 01:26:02.781
<v Speaker 1>was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1601
01:26:02.781 --> 01:26:07.520
<v Speaker 1>well how the parking spots are the nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wide because they're not overwhelmed</v>

1602
01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:11.540
<v Speaker 1>by the same amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only like a 100,000 people in</v>

1603
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:14.880
<v Speaker 1>all of Santa Barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an easier way to get around</v>

1604
01:26:14.881 --> 01:26:15.650
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1605
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Like that Cam and there's too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

1606
01:26:18.031 --> 01:26:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to remember.</v>

1607
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:22.040
<v Speaker 1>You ready to move Jamie's thumbs up from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1608
01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.230
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're moving to Santa Barbara.</v>

1609
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do that.</v>

1610
01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you need a person to like you need a</v>
<v Speaker 1>full time range manager?</v>

1611
01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.490
<v Speaker 1>They need to build a range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the next step.</v>

1612
01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.550
<v Speaker 1>If I get deeper and deeper with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of open up an archery shop.</v>

1613
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I think so for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1614
01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an archery school would be the way to</v>

1615
01:26:41.421 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

1616
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I really think that there were a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different martial arts schools and I've</v>

1617
01:26:45.891 --> 01:26:49.530
<v Speaker 1>been involved in a bunch of them and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that a teaching martial arts is</v>

1618
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:52.250
<v Speaker 1>gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that's a problem</v>

1619
01:26:52.251 --> 01:26:56.930
<v Speaker 1>with archery and most particularly with</v>
<v Speaker 1>bow hunting is the learning curve is</v>

1620
01:26:56.931 --> 01:27:00.230
<v Speaker 1>extremely steep and it's not obvious at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all as to where to start.</v>

1621
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:04.760
<v Speaker 1>The learning curve to start archery is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go to an archery store,</v>

1622
01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.830
<v Speaker 1>go to a shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1623
01:27:06.831 --> 01:27:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I've had experience with shops that</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what they were doing and</v>

1624
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:13.160
<v Speaker 1>went there and I got bad advice from</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and I saw people that really didn't</v>

1625
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:15.200
<v Speaker 1>exactly know what they were doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were telling me,</v>

1626
01:27:15.201 --> 01:27:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need that.</v>

1627
01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh you don't need this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many people out there</v>

1628
01:27:21.651 --> 01:27:25.880
<v Speaker 1>that probably would be interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in archery.</v>

1629
01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.370
<v Speaker 1>And I know there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are interested in hunting as well.</v>

1630
01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:33.170
<v Speaker 1>They just don't know where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think having like classes in a</v>

1631
01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:36.740
<v Speaker 1>liquor shop is probably a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea and probably something I'm going to</v>

1632
01:27:36.741 --> 01:27:39.650
<v Speaker 1>get into in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I want to see that.</v>

1633
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no I wouldn't let them in,</v>

1634
01:27:41.690 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 1>but I would have to a grand open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright man you're in.</v>

1635
01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:48.770
<v Speaker 1>But I would have to most certainly have</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were there that were really</v>

1636
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.200
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could teach classes and teach</v>

1637
01:27:51.201 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 1>people how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1638
01:27:52.521 --> 01:27:55.850
<v Speaker 1>like we were showing you show me the</v>
<v Speaker 1>video of your son hunting alligators.</v>

1639
01:27:56.210 --> 01:27:58.340
<v Speaker 1>And I said it right as you were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1640
01:27:58.341 --> 01:28:01.520
<v Speaker 1>look at his form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your kid is like,</v>

1641
01:28:01.521 --> 01:28:04.130
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect form like a world champion</v>
<v Speaker 1>archer,</v>

1642
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:09.310
<v Speaker 1>like the ways God has his posture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he released and when you know</v>

1643
01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:10.470
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1644
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:11.570
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're watching that.</v>

1645
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.991
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1646
01:28:11.991 --> 01:28:16.730
<v Speaker 1>here's a kid that has learned from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning how to do it correctly.</v>

1647
01:28:16.731 --> 01:28:20.510
<v Speaker 1>So when you look at him as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that picture that you sent me of the</v>

1648
01:28:20.511 --> 01:28:22.610
<v Speaker 1>archer that's on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a,</v>

1649
01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an arrow that he's pulling back his</v>

1650
01:28:25.281 --> 01:28:28.730
<v Speaker 1>string is deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tucked into his face were for sure.</v>

1651
01:28:28.731 --> 01:28:32.300
<v Speaker 1>When you're pulling your string back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's digging into your face,</v>

1652
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pressure of your face on that string</v>

1653
01:28:35.271 --> 01:28:37.970
<v Speaker 1>is going to change the path of the hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should never supposed to dig it into</v>

1654
01:28:37.971 --> 01:28:39.170
<v Speaker 1>your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy has it.</v>

1655
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Then you look down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his Arrow is not even attached to the</v>

1656
01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:45.680
<v Speaker 1>string.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like hanging off and he doesn't</v>

1657
01:28:45.681 --> 01:28:47.450
<v Speaker 1>even know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the most.</v>

1658
01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.090
<v Speaker 1>And this guy is on television and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking picture was used for an ad.</v>

1659
01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:54.770
<v Speaker 1>The picture was on an ad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they took the picture,</v>

1660
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:58.730
<v Speaker 1>somebody looked at it and they were so</v>
<v Speaker 1>careless that they weren't good enough.</v>

1661
01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got it,</v>

1662
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.930
<v Speaker 1>nailed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they took that and they put it on</v>

1663
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.360
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ordered to put it in a magazine or</v>

1664
01:29:06.361 --> 01:29:09.300
<v Speaker 1>what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you see someone who started</v>

1665
01:29:09.301 --> 01:29:11.650
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your son with perfect form it.</v>

1666
01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.290
<v Speaker 1>How old was he in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At like 10.</v>

1667
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started when he was nine.</v>

1668
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.600
<v Speaker 1>So in that picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would that video with the alligator</v>

1669
01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:21.150
<v Speaker 1>tab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see that as opposed to someone</v>

1670
01:29:21.151 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>who's been doing it wrong their whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1671
01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:26.760
<v Speaker 1>You realize the importance of original</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>

1672
01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:29.490
<v Speaker 1>like having it like the original</v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons.</v>

1673
01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 1>The first lesson is you get imprinting</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>

1674
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.810
<v Speaker 2>yo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1675
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big part of what I'm doing.</v>

1676
01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Can I plug the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1677
01:29:37.730 --> 01:29:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well your,</v>

1678
01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.210
<v Speaker 2>your show,</v>

1679
01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:42.230
<v Speaker 1>which is called knock on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on a sport.</v>

1680
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:45.120
<v Speaker 1>What's not departments channel</v>
<v Speaker 1>sportsmans channel.</v>

1681
01:29:45.121 --> 01:29:46.650
<v Speaker 1>And they're both owned by the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1682
01:29:46.651 --> 01:29:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Now the outdoor channel and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sportsman channel are both owned by the</v>

1683
01:29:49.921 --> 01:29:50.290
<v Speaker 1>same people.</v>

1684
01:29:50.290 --> 01:29:51.300
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1685
01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:53.320
<v Speaker 2>the youtube site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock on archery,</v>

1686
01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.960
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go through there and if you're</v>

1687
01:29:55.961 --> 01:29:59.020
<v Speaker 2>not a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then move past that because there's a</v>

1688
01:29:59.021 --> 01:30:02.800
<v Speaker 2>lot of how to stuff and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction that I'm really going to be</v>

1689
01:30:02.801 --> 01:30:05.140
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole focus on this brand.</v>

1690
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock on which I think I had,</v>

1691
01:30:07.150 --> 01:30:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a hat on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1692
01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:10.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1693
01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:15.120
<v Speaker 2>it was a brand intended for people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't really necessarily wanting to say</v>

1694
01:30:16.721 --> 01:30:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm an archer and so much of what</v>

1695
01:30:19.961 --> 01:30:24.961
<v Speaker 2>this show is geared around and it took a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time for me to convince the network</v>

1696
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:28.000
<v Speaker 2>for me to dedicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1697
01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:30.220
<v Speaker 2>right now I have three segments that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1698
01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:34.210
<v Speaker 2>how to be better with your form when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead center segment.</v>

1699
01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Then the field recon segment is how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be better in the field as an hunter,</v>

1700
01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:40.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some type of a technique.</v>

1701
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:43.750
<v Speaker 2>And then I have the third segment called</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked and ready to rock,</v>

1702
01:30:43.751 --> 01:30:48.751
<v Speaker 2>which last year was literally how to buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bow and completely set up the boat,</v>

1703
01:30:48.961 --> 01:30:50.390
<v Speaker 2>start to finish throughout the whole.</v>

1704
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 1>And there's a video of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1705
01:30:51.871 --> 01:30:54.280
<v Speaker 1>it's over an hour long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on Youtube,</v>

1706
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:59.310
<v Speaker 1>which is a very difficult time consuming</v>
<v Speaker 1>and involved process.</v>

1707
01:30:59.381 --> 01:30:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1708
01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:03.800
<v Speaker 2>And then this year the knocked and ready</v>
<v Speaker 2>to rock segment is all about learning to</v>

1709
01:31:03.801 --> 01:31:07.640
<v Speaker 2>build your own arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as I move forward through the</v>

1710
01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:10.130
<v Speaker 2>seasons and through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the Youtube Channel,</v>

1711
01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to continue to try to work on</v>
<v Speaker 2>building all these fundamentals to</v>

1712
01:31:14.391 --> 01:31:18.950
<v Speaker 2>become a good shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Harry and my wife,</v>

1713
01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:22.100
<v Speaker 2>they both started out with no experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

1714
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:27.080
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny how if you show the basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals and you're taught right</v>

1715
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:32.090
<v Speaker 2>from the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how easy you can get to perfect form.</v>

1716
01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:35.930
<v Speaker 2>It's when you go into it with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1717
01:31:35.931 --> 01:31:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I always say women and kids are way</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to teach.</v>

1718
01:31:38.371 --> 01:31:41.300
<v Speaker 2>And then guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's not the macho factor,</v>

1719
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:42.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are like,</v>

1720
01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Shit Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how to grab care.</v>

1721
01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Give me that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you how to do it.</v>

1722
01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Also do being a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1723
01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Whereas</v>

1724
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.730
<v Speaker 1>people who are not worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1725
01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.170
<v Speaker 1>if I fuck this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn dude,</v>

1726
01:31:55.171 --> 01:31:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm a loser in this cause of winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people that don't</v>

1727
01:31:58.081 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 1>like learning things because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to fuck</v>

1728
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.150
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1729
01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.140
<v Speaker 2>and I think when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you teach a,</v>

1730
01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:07.420
<v Speaker 2>a woman or a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have less ego.</v>

1731
01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 2>They don't think of themselves as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit yet.</v>

1732
01:32:10.410 --> 01:32:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there were women don't just say,</v>

1733
01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.890
<v Speaker 2>just don't have as many ego problems has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been do in that regard.</v>

1734
01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Well there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two t,</v>

1735
01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1736
01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've looked a lot into sports psychology</v>

1737
01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.320
<v Speaker 2>and I won the first time I talked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1738
01:32:23.321 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 2>One of the things where I was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping you could help me with and if</v>

1739
01:32:26.381 --> 01:32:29.380
<v Speaker 2>anyone's listening out there that's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sports psychologist.</v>

1740
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>

1741
01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I have a big add problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very.</v>

1742
01:32:36.010 --> 01:32:41.010
<v Speaker 2>But it also has been a huge part of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>success as an archer because I zone</v>

1743
01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:44.500
<v Speaker 2>things out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's times where I've been in</v>

1744
01:32:44.501 --> 01:32:46.360
<v Speaker 2>competitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people come up to me and say,</v>

1745
01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.021
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1746
01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I bumped you with the camera or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1747
01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:51.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I like,</v>

1748
01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so tunnel visioned on stuff.</v>

1749
01:32:54.791 --> 01:32:56.740
<v Speaker 2>So you see heads in those tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:32:56.741 --> 01:32:59.740
<v Speaker 2>The head's kind of was a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my adderall.</v>

1751
01:32:59.741 --> 01:33:01.060
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1752
01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I've really wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1753
01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:07.030
<v Speaker 2>is is a d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d or You know that.</v>

1754
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Is that like an asset to get in the zone</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster?</v>

1755
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:12.650
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about that and my,</v>

1756
01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:16.810
<v Speaker 2>my issue is what is add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1757
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure that everyone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>has add is really has a disorder,</v>

1758
01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.190
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1759
01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of is a style of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>or way of thinking.</v>

1760
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:32.710
<v Speaker 2>You know right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my dad's a psychologist and it's</v>

1761
01:33:32.711 --> 01:33:36.730
<v Speaker 2>amazing to me how many people will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1762
01:33:36.731 --> 01:33:39.580
<v Speaker 2>I've got friends that will like go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shrink for a 30 minute session.</v>

1763
01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1764
01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:41.140
<v Speaker 2>I got some adderall.</v>

1765
01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Do to get add really bad when I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got diagnosed with mine,</v>

1766
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:50.620
<v Speaker 2>I went for three different days and</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost did like a psychological</v>

1767
01:33:50.621 --> 01:33:53.380
<v Speaker 2>evaluation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like questioning,</v>

1768
01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:54.850
<v Speaker 2>questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>questioning,</v>

1769
01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:58.110
<v Speaker 2>and I remember like reading through this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that,</v>

1770
01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:01.150
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a true psychologist did to diagnose</v>

1771
01:34:01.151 --> 01:34:03.970
<v Speaker 2>what I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember one of the lines said it</v>

1772
01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:07.900
<v Speaker 2>was like one of the beginning lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like John has always been a fairly</v>

1773
01:34:07.901 --> 01:34:11.830
<v Speaker 2>normal boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never had a problem soiling his</v>

1774
01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.770
<v Speaker 2>linens or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1775
01:34:13.771 --> 01:34:17.230
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like someone became a serial</v>
<v Speaker 2>killer.</v>

1776
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:20.920
<v Speaker 2>John has always been a normal boy until</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found the one hand sticking out of</v>

1777
01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:23.060
<v Speaker 2>the dirt in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never suspected anything.</v>

1778
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:24.940
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1779
01:34:25.210 --> 01:34:29.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's a d and D is add recognized a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent.</v>

1780
01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Like is it a universally recognized?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's an issue with add?</v>

1781
01:34:33.670 --> 01:34:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they argue,</v>

1782
01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.140
<v Speaker 2>they argue that it's the case against</v>
<v Speaker 2>add.</v>

1783
01:34:38.141 --> 01:34:41.800
<v Speaker 2>How about that Google that they shot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They argue that there's more,</v>

1784
01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:44.930
<v Speaker 2>there's more people coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1785
01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:49.870
<v Speaker 2>that are saying they have add and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think because doctors are so quick to</v>

1786
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:52.130
<v Speaker 2>prescribe nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does it,</v>

1787
01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:54.220
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means attention deficit disorder.</v>

1788
01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:56.370
<v Speaker 2>So what is exactly that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1789
01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.770
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes</v>

1790
01:34:58.490 --> 01:35:01.460
<v Speaker 1>people are talking to maybe when I'm so</v>
<v Speaker 1>zoned out on something else,</v>

1791
01:35:01.461 --> 01:35:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I never hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1792
01:35:02.541 --> 01:35:06.200
<v Speaker 1>there's just constant distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's constant distraction.</v>

1793
01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:11.240
<v Speaker 1>If I'm tuned into you then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times like,</v>

1794
01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be focused on something and my wife</v>

1795
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:19.340
<v Speaker 1>like has to snap at me like a dog see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that to me is not attention deficit</v>

1796
01:35:19.341 --> 01:35:21.170
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not attention deficit it.</v>

1797
01:35:21.171 --> 01:35:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's extreme attention on one thing.</v>

1798
01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Just an unwillingness to engage with</v>
<v Speaker 1>distractions,</v>

1799
01:35:28.281 --> 01:35:31.850
<v Speaker 1>but then there's times what's weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it is then there's times where</v>

1800
01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:36.851
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to focus on something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like every stimuli comes into play.</v>

1801
01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.720
<v Speaker 1>One of those things that you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to focus on,</v>

1802
01:35:41.721 --> 01:35:45.260
<v Speaker 1>is it ever anything that you're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in or is it just some shit</v>

1803
01:35:45.261 --> 01:35:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fix a pipe or you know,</v>

1804
01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:51.650
<v Speaker 1>certainly there's times where people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you and you really don't want</v>

1805
01:35:51.651 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 1>to listen to them.</v>

1806
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:55.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling that's what attention</v>

1807
01:35:55.101 --> 01:36:00.101
<v Speaker 1>deficit disorder is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are bored as fuck or that is what</v>

1808
01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:05.420
<v Speaker 1>every casino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this wide range of the way</v>

1809
01:36:05.421 --> 01:36:10.010
<v Speaker 1>people think and the way people address</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations like you couldn't even see it</v>

1810
01:36:10.011 --> 01:36:13.670
<v Speaker 1>in your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like have my middle child is very</v>

1811
01:36:13.671 --> 01:36:17.930
<v Speaker 1>outgoing and very loud and silly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll talk to anybody but my youngest</v>

1812
01:36:17.931 --> 01:36:18.631
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she.</v>

1813
01:36:18.631 --> 01:36:21.290
<v Speaker 1>If she doesn't know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she ain't saying shit.</v>

1814
01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say Hi to her and she was like,</v>

1815
01:36:22.941 --> 01:36:24.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll hide behind me.</v>

1816
01:36:24.621 --> 01:36:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I can talk to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she just has her own style of</v>

1817
01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:32.980
<v Speaker 1>engaging with people and they both also</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their own very distinct likes and</v>

1818
01:36:34.611 --> 01:36:36.890
<v Speaker 1>dislikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as like the kind of TV shows they</v>

1819
01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:40.760
<v Speaker 1>like or the kind of toys they like or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of art that they do and I just</v>

1820
01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:45.761
<v Speaker 1>think that that same variety applies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people are interested in and</v>

1821
01:36:47.751 --> 01:36:49.310
<v Speaker 1>not interested in in life.</v>

1822
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:52.850
<v Speaker 1>And we take these fucking kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1823
01:36:52.851 --> 01:36:55.970
<v Speaker 1>and this is a big part of the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with education.</v>

1824
01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:00.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different jobs out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and the path for a guy who wants</v>

1825
01:37:00.411 --> 01:37:04.040
<v Speaker 1>to be a professional archer versus the</v>
<v Speaker 1>path for a guy wants to be an audio</v>

1826
01:37:04.041 --> 01:37:06.410
<v Speaker 1>engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are very different paths and they</v>

1827
01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:09.230
<v Speaker 1>involve very different amounts of data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

1828
01:37:09.231 --> 01:37:11.420
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different stimuli.</v>

1829
01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.600
<v Speaker 1>And we take people and especially when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're young,</v>

1830
01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:18.830
<v Speaker 1>we make them pay attention to shit they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give a fuck about and I don't</v>

1831
01:37:18.831 --> 01:37:21.530
<v Speaker 1>think it's good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we see like when I was in</v>

1832
01:37:21.531 --> 01:37:22.341
<v Speaker 1>high school they always said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1833
01:37:22.341 --> 01:37:23.650
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got no pr.</v>

1834
01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Put something in front of me that I care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and that's all I pay attention to.</v>

1835
01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that I'm a fucking Ne'er do</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1836
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:33.380
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make me feel like I am made me feel</v>

1837
01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:37.550
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a loser because I don't give a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck about math or Spanish history.</v>

1838
01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not ringing my 13 year old head.</v>

1839
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about tits right now and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have time for Spanish history.</v>

1840
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might talk to me about pirates</v>

1841
01:37:46.011 --> 01:37:49.850
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden for whatever reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>that spark gets lead and now I'm</v>

1842
01:37:49.851 --> 01:37:52.940
<v Speaker 1>interested and now I'm obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirates and I want to read books about</v>

1843
01:37:52.941 --> 01:37:57.240
<v Speaker 1>pirates and I want to talk about pirates</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sorts of different things that people</v>

1844
01:37:57.241 --> 01:38:00.660
<v Speaker 1>get excited about and interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem I think,</v>

1845
01:38:00.661 --> 01:38:05.661
<v Speaker 1>or one of the problems with formalized</v>
<v Speaker 1>education and are some for some strange</v>

1846
01:38:06.241 --> 01:38:09.570
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our need to diagnose certain styles of</v>

1847
01:38:09.571 --> 01:38:14.571
<v Speaker 1>thinking and certain styles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching life as problematic as add</v>

1848
01:38:15.570 --> 01:38:16.610
<v Speaker 1>or he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1849
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.490
<v Speaker 1>he's got adhd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1850
01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:19.950
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't stop.</v>

1851
01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:23.700
<v Speaker 1>He's in a fucking classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're teaching nonsense.</v>

1852
01:38:23.701 --> 01:38:25.170
<v Speaker 1>He's sitting on a plastic chair.</v>

1853
01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:26.940
<v Speaker 1>He wants to run through the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

1854
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:28.650
<v Speaker 1>It's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do,</v>

1855
01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I have a neighbor and sometimes it's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>corners me,</v>

1856
01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:33.150
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'll tell me some stupid shit about</v>

1857
01:38:33.151 --> 01:38:37.080
<v Speaker 1>his son's basketball game or some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and I literally want to run up a</v>

1858
01:38:37.081 --> 01:38:40.800
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to and I don't have add.</v>

1859
01:38:40.801 --> 01:38:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not unwilling Adhd,</v>

1860
01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking bored man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're kidnapping me with this</v>

1861
01:38:46.681 --> 01:38:49.750
<v Speaker 1>stupid goddamn conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like Yay,</v>

1862
01:38:49.770 --> 01:38:50.760
<v Speaker 1>look at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to go.</v>

1863
01:38:50.761 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 1>So I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1864
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:54.030
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to get some time on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bench.</v>

1865
01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I felt when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1866
01:38:57.781 --> 01:39:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I felt a lot of that in school and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that that's a lot of what's going</v>

1867
01:39:01.261 --> 01:39:03.930
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all interested in different shit</v>

1868
01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:07.950
<v Speaker 1>and formalized education in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>circles and a lot of schools.</v>

1869
01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just too limited for some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids in class.</v>

1870
01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:13.410
<v Speaker 2>I remember Harry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his first football team,</v>

1871
01:39:13.411 --> 01:39:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking he was like nine or 10 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the kid shows up with like a big</v>

1872
01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:21.180
<v Speaker 2>can of monster and he's drinking it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1873
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:25.680
<v Speaker 2>And we were trying to control the kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went over to mom and I said like,</v>

1874
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:27.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was every day,</v>

1875
01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:29.760
<v Speaker 2>how old is this kid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 10.</v>

1876
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:33.690
<v Speaker 2>All My.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember going over and the mom</v>

1877
01:39:33.691 --> 01:39:35.010
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mom goes,</v>

1878
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:37.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just have such a problem control.</v>

1879
01:39:37.951 --> 01:39:42.030
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is it was eight in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning for a football game.</v>

1880
01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:43.530
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>

1881
01:39:43.730 --> 01:39:47.400
<v Speaker 2>he just never listened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the doctor says he has add and</v>

1882
01:39:47.401 --> 01:39:50.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just gave him a green monster at</v>

1883
01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:53.640
<v Speaker 2>eight in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 10 and he had like a double can of</v>

1884
01:39:53.641 --> 01:39:55.740
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking the big ones.</v>

1885
01:39:56.550 --> 01:40:00.720
<v Speaker 2>How much do you think he weighed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hundred pounds.</v>

1886
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Cheeses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1887
01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's more than two adult size</v>

1888
01:40:08.741 --> 01:40:12.040
<v Speaker 1>servings could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I know the problem.</v>

1889
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be your kids on crank.</v>

1890
01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's crank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like extreme doses of caffeine</v>

1891
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:22.060
<v Speaker 1>and sugar and sugar in those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't even know what else.</v>

1892
01:40:22.061 --> 01:40:22.661
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1893
01:40:22.661 --> 01:40:25.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gotta stop selling you some Shit</v>

1894
01:40:25.991 --> 01:40:30.340
<v Speaker 1>and saying it's more than one serving</v>
<v Speaker 1>five that you can't do that anymore.</v>

1895
01:40:30.341 --> 01:40:33.400
<v Speaker 1>You got to stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's in one package and it's like a</v>

1896
01:40:33.401 --> 01:40:35.890
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking serving.</v>

1897
01:40:35.891 --> 01:40:36.724
<v Speaker 1>Stop saying it</v>

1898
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:37.630
<v Speaker 2>to servant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1899
01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Unless it's like a box of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1900
01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:46.070
<v Speaker 2>You know that you're going to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a box that's multiple surveys,</v>

1901
01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.420
<v Speaker 2>don't tell me this bottle of waters to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking service.</v>

1902
01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Well that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1904
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:55.810
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no.</v>

1905
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:59.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no negative consequences and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking a bottle of water.</v>

1906
01:40:59.231 --> 01:41:02.460
<v Speaker 1>It's universally agreed that an eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>ounce bottle of water or it's not going</v>

1907
01:41:02.461 --> 01:41:05.410
<v Speaker 1>to hurt anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of those fucking monster energy</v>

1908

<v Speaker 1>drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or my trainer had a protein bar the</v>

1909
01:41:09.971 --> 01:41:12.040
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1926
01:41:37.011 --> 01:41:40.250
<v Speaker 2>I coached that with teams actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when I competed,</v>

1927
01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:43.220
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that I think was that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>found really,</v>

1928
01:41:43.221 --> 01:41:48.221
<v Speaker 2>really helpful is to be able to travel</v>
<v Speaker 2>and keep yourself in your same daily</v>

1929
01:41:49.431 --> 01:41:54.431
<v Speaker 2>routine with your rest and your diet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more importantly your garbage intake</v>

1930
01:41:55.790 --> 01:42:00.790
<v Speaker 2>because people will go to a tournament</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll pop in and they'll grab</v>

1931
01:42:00.891 --> 01:42:02.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1932
01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:04.760
<v Speaker 2>a power bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1933
01:42:04.761 --> 01:42:07.610
<v Speaker 2>like the chocolate covered power bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they go to a tournament and</v>

1934
01:42:07.611 --> 01:42:10.970
<v Speaker 2>they're like having a snack and then all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden like two targets that either</v>

1935
01:42:10.971 --> 01:42:12.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's up,</v>

1936
01:42:12.411 --> 01:42:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of like bouncing all over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>place and I'm thinking,</v>

1937
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:17.870
<v Speaker 2>you're on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just had 40 grams of sugar.</v>

1938
01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when?</v>

1939
01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.031
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1940
01:42:20.031 --> 01:42:21.340
<v Speaker 2>you just say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1941
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:23.390
<v Speaker 2>marathon bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1942
01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:26.960
<v Speaker 2>19 grams of sugar per serving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1943
01:42:26.961 --> 01:42:28.030
<v Speaker 2>double it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1944
01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.670
<v Speaker 2>you just like totally had a full blown</v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin drop,</v>

1945
01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:32.533
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1946
01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.610
<v Speaker 1>And you do have one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1947
01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I've been on this crazy diet now for two</v>
<v Speaker 1>months and I stepped off of the other</v>

1948
01:42:38.241 --> 01:42:40.490
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a cheeseburger and a chocolate</v>

1949
01:42:40.491 --> 01:42:42.080
<v Speaker 1>shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1950
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:44.200
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't worth it.</v>

1951
01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.620
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

1952
01:42:45.710 --> 01:42:47.720
<v Speaker 1>it was worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was worth something.</v>

1953
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:49.340
<v Speaker 1>It was worth something while I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating it.</v>

1954
01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:51.770
<v Speaker 1>It was glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a wonderful cheeseburger with</v>

1955
01:42:51.771 --> 01:42:54.020
<v Speaker 1>blue cheese and bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very good.</v>

1956
01:42:54.021 --> 01:42:56.330
<v Speaker 1>And the chocolate shake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty God damn good.</v>

1957
01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And the chocolate shake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a chocolate malt.</v>

1958
01:42:58.461 --> 01:43:02.360
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty God damn good but good Lord</v>

1959
01:43:02.361 --> 01:43:06.800
<v Speaker 1>because I haven't been eating that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crash after it was over,</v>

1960
01:43:06.801 --> 01:43:09.920
<v Speaker 1>it was devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I could barely stay awake an hour</v>

1961
01:43:09.921 --> 01:43:13.970
<v Speaker 1>later because my insulin level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just my whole body was just like,</v>

1962
01:43:13.971 --> 01:43:18.560
<v Speaker 1>what did you do after months?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two months of eating clean.</v>

1963
01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:24.760
<v Speaker 1>You just took a shit in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I recognized that that had probably</v>

1964
01:43:25.491 --> 01:43:29.300
<v Speaker 1>been been in normal thing for me for</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my life.</v>

1965
01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:34.850
<v Speaker 1>If I'd eaten a cheeseburger and a shake</v>
<v Speaker 1>within an hour afterwards,</v>

1966
01:43:34.851 --> 01:43:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I just was crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just done.</v>

1967
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:40.160
<v Speaker 1>But that's most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they eat all the time,</v>

1968
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:42.320
<v Speaker 1>they just get used to that terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>

1969
01:43:42.730 --> 01:43:44.740
<v Speaker 2>When I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I give seminars,</v>

1970
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:46.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you have a lunch break</v>

1971
01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:52.020
<v Speaker 2>and I pay attention to the people when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hit the lunch break.</v>

1972
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:56.090
<v Speaker 2>I pay attention to like what some people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are eating because you can tell a lot by</v>

1973
01:43:56.091 --> 01:43:57.860
<v Speaker 2>a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by what they're throwing.</v>

1974
01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:01.910
<v Speaker 2>If you've got an option of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>good or something crap.</v>

1975
01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:05.360
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that just like go</v>
<v Speaker 2>right for the crap.</v>

1976
01:44:05.361 --> 01:44:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Then there's some people that go for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>good stuff.</v>

1977
01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:10.250
<v Speaker 2>As soon as like your session starts back</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1978
01:44:10.251 --> 01:44:15.251
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you've done this where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>give like speeches or seminars after</v>

1979
01:44:15.381 --> 01:44:18.470
<v Speaker 2>meals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always like for people that are</v>

1980
01:44:18.471 --> 01:44:21.750
<v Speaker 2>like out and they can't help it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1981
01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Because they ate a bunch of garbage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had this huge insulin dump and you</v>

1982
01:44:28.671 --> 01:44:30.830
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've their bodies like trying to</v>

1983
01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:35.831
<v Speaker 2>fight off all that and then they crash</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of times I'll like wake people</v>

1984
01:44:36.111 --> 01:44:37.520
<v Speaker 2>up and I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1985
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I was waiting for that to happen because</v>
<v Speaker 2>now is what I want to talk about the</v>

1986
01:44:41.661 --> 01:44:46.661
<v Speaker 2>importance of nutrition during</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance because the reason several</v>

1987
01:44:47.091 --> 01:44:50.750
<v Speaker 2>people in here can't stay awake right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now is because of what they did during</v>

1988
01:44:50.751 --> 01:44:51.620
<v Speaker 2>their lunch break.</v>

1989
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:55.190
<v Speaker 2>A lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of events,</v>

1990
01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:58.280
<v Speaker 2>sports related events that are like all</v>
<v Speaker 2>day events.</v>

1991
01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:01.730
<v Speaker 2>They have breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Archery always had a break at noon.</v>

1992
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:05.870
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to be hungry at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

1993
01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I tried to continually pick and hydrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the whole event just like I</v>

1994
01:45:11.991 --> 01:45:15.470
<v Speaker 2>do at home during the day so that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't starving.</v>

1995
01:45:15.471 --> 01:45:19.580
<v Speaker 2>You see competitors that are leading the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pack and they run to the fricking</v>

1996
01:45:19.581 --> 01:45:23.480
<v Speaker 2>concession stand and they want to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>pound two or three burgers because they</v>

1997
01:45:23.481 --> 01:45:26.660
<v Speaker 2>know that they're not going to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat til 5:00 and then all of a sudden</v>

1998
01:45:26.661 --> 01:45:31.661
<v Speaker 2>their scores just start to peter out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start making mistakes and then all</v>

1999
01:45:31.881 --> 01:45:35.710
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden towards the end they come</v>
<v Speaker 2>back again and they're saying like,</v>

2000
01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had that fricking though several</v>

2001
01:45:38.061 --> 01:45:39.860
<v Speaker 2>ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just struggled and it's like,</v>

2002
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:41.990
<v Speaker 2>how do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:45:42.110 --> 01:45:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time I wasn't like telling all my</v>

2004
01:45:44.361 --> 01:45:46.710
<v Speaker 2>competitors online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that cover</v>

2005
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:51.830
<v Speaker 1>well until you try to live clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you try to eat clean and you don't</v>

2006
01:45:52.231 --> 01:45:55.770
<v Speaker 1>eat cheeseburgers and shakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand how much of an</v>

2007
01:45:55.771 --> 01:45:59.850
<v Speaker 1>impact it really has because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>people associate how they feel with just</v>

2008
01:45:59.851 --> 01:46:01.320
<v Speaker 1>normalcy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that,</v>

2009
01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:02.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just what happens.</v>

2010
01:46:02.370 --> 01:46:03.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

2011
01:46:03.211 --> 01:46:03.841
<v Speaker 1>I get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2012
01:46:03.841 --> 01:46:07.410
<v Speaker 1>I need naps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started drawing this primal diet,</v>

2013
01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:11.160
<v Speaker 1>the MERC system diet and I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought my body into a state of</v>

2014
01:46:11.161 --> 01:46:12.230
<v Speaker 1>ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2015
01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Was the first time ever that in between</v>
<v Speaker 1>meals.</v>

2016
01:46:14.791 --> 01:46:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't feel terrible where like I</v>

2017
01:46:18.841 --> 01:46:22.050
<v Speaker 1>could go six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven hours and not feel bad at all</v>

2018
01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.020
<v Speaker 1>because your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it hits that state is starting to</v>

2019
01:46:25.021 --> 01:46:28.890
<v Speaker 1>burn off the fat and so your body has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>supply of fat,</v>

2020
01:46:28.891 --> 01:46:32.070
<v Speaker 1>so it just starts converting the fat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body to energy.</v>

2021
01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:37.140
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that so few people eat and</v>

2022
01:46:37.141 --> 01:46:38.070
<v Speaker 1>live like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2023
01:46:38.071 --> 01:46:38.904
<v Speaker 1>That was a.</v>

2024
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.090
<v Speaker 2>That was really interesting because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing I asked you was I said,</v>

2025
01:46:43.110 --> 01:46:45.900
<v Speaker 2>what's really the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and the Adkins?</v>

2026
01:46:46.050 --> 01:46:48.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More fats and that was,</v>

2027
01:46:48.210 --> 01:46:49.140
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it made.</v>

2028
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:50.221
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2029
01:46:50.221 --> 01:46:52.500
<v Speaker 2>where the Atkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more focused on the</v>

2030
01:46:52.501 --> 01:46:54.510
<v Speaker 2>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2031
01:46:54.511 --> 01:46:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I get people that are uneducated on</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating clean,</v>

2032
01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:58.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at what we,</v>

2033
01:46:58.950 --> 01:47:02.820
<v Speaker 2>you and I just ate for lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we like knocked back and avocado,</v>

2034
01:47:02.821 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 2>like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are afraid of anomaly ocado</v>

2035
01:47:05.490 --> 01:47:09.330
<v Speaker 2>because they say it's fattening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean talk about not knowing what's up.</v>

2036
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2037
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:14.910
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand what dietary fats</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the importance of certain amounts of</v>

2038
01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:20.350
<v Speaker 1>healthy fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of getting the amount of oils and fats</v>

2039
01:47:20.351 --> 01:47:23.680
<v Speaker 1>that your body needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Healthy oils super important and avocado</v>

2040
01:47:23.681 --> 01:47:27.010
<v Speaker 1>oil and Avocados in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most healthy fats you can</v>

2041
01:47:27.011 --> 01:47:28.330
<v Speaker 1>consume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>

2042
01:47:28.331 --> 01:47:29.900
<v Speaker 1>super good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2043
01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:34.920
<v Speaker 1>and getting the right amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients in your body has just such a</v>

2044
01:47:35.771 --> 01:47:39.250
<v Speaker 1>massive effect on how the whole goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing works.</v>

2045
01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go back to the mentor thing and the</v>

2046
01:47:42.821 --> 01:47:47.821
<v Speaker 1>life coach thing because until you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to someone that you trust that</v>

2047
01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.440
<v Speaker 1>that's done it and is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2048
01:47:50.441 --> 01:47:54.850
<v Speaker 1>until you know some guy who's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive marathon or something like</v>

2049
01:47:54.851 --> 01:47:55.511
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

2050
01:47:55.511 --> 01:47:56.710
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2051
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:59.410
<v Speaker 1>if you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body will work better.</v>

2052
01:47:59.411 --> 01:48:02.470
<v Speaker 1>You got to trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to trust me and try to clean up</v>

2053
01:48:02.471 --> 01:48:03.880
<v Speaker 1>your diet and try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2054
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.110
<v Speaker 1>just if most people just cut out just</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing at a time,</v>

2055
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:09.760
<v Speaker 1>they would see a big difference.</v>

2056
01:48:09.930 --> 01:48:12.210
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a thing that I call</v>
<v Speaker 2>having,</v>

2057
01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:16.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a ton of success stories of</v>

2058
01:48:16.051 --> 01:48:21.051
<v Speaker 2>hunters that were motivated by posts</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I made with like food or,</v>

2059
01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just see a post that I do and</v>

2060
01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:24.330
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

2061
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm just tired of where I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As,</v>

2062
01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:29.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billy bob the bow hunter or you know,</v>

2063
01:48:29.191 --> 01:48:31.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm at archery.</v>

2064
01:48:31.141 --> 01:48:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I've never been in it 10 years and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>never made progress.</v>

2065
01:48:34.231 --> 01:48:35.910
<v Speaker 2>What do I need to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2066
01:48:35.911 --> 01:48:38.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll get some photos of them in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times I notice that they're out</v>

2067
01:48:38.971 --> 01:48:40.350
<v Speaker 2>of shape and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2068
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:45.060
<v Speaker 2>if you're shooting on a line and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look down and you can't see your feet</v>

2069
01:48:45.061 --> 01:48:45.481
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2070
01:48:45.481 --> 01:48:50.481
<v Speaker 2>a big part of my shot routine is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the first step is really your feet.</v>

2071
01:48:51.631 --> 01:48:52.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stance.</v>

2072
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean like imagine martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2073
01:48:55.101 --> 01:48:56.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to talk someone about</v>

2074
01:48:56.521 --> 01:48:58.230
<v Speaker 2>their stance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even see their feet.</v>

2075
01:48:58.231 --> 01:48:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Well it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2076
01:48:59.071 --> 01:49:01.410
<v Speaker 2>well we need to address another problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>

2077
01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:03.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not want to hear this but we</v>

2078
01:49:03.751 --> 01:49:07.800
<v Speaker 2>need to address this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me when I started down that</v>

2079
01:49:07.801 --> 01:49:09.720
<v Speaker 2>path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had about three years of my</v>

2080
01:49:09.721 --> 01:49:11.160
<v Speaker 2>life where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2081
01:49:11.161 --> 01:49:15.660
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how when it comes to like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>path of an Arrow or the path of life,</v>

2082
01:49:16.110 --> 01:49:21.110
<v Speaker 2>all it takes is the smallest movement to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get you going a certain direction and</v>

2083
01:49:22.231 --> 01:49:26.040
<v Speaker 2>then all sudden before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like so far off the course and</v>

2084
01:49:26.041 --> 01:49:27.750
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the hell did I get here?</v>

2085
01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:30.280
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had a point in my career,</v>

2086
01:49:30.281 --> 01:49:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I was that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2087
01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:32.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2088
01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:36.360
<v Speaker 2>I remember I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put on like a pair of 38 underwear and</v>

2089
01:49:36.361 --> 01:49:38.790
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

2090
01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:41.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to wear like 30,</v>

2091
01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:43.850
<v Speaker 2>38 pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm in a 38 freaking.</v>

2092
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:46.470
<v Speaker 2>And then I look at my legs because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2093
01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I've got a good story about big bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always like,</v>

2094
01:49:49.721 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 2>I've got big bird legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2095
01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:55.180
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking frick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how round my waist is,</v>

2096
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:58.900
<v Speaker 2>as long as that fricking leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how big around I am.</v>

2097
01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:04.290
<v Speaker 2>So what I started doing was just having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every time I ordered my normal meal</v>

2098
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:08.560
<v Speaker 2>at a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it comes out and there's a burger,</v>

2099
01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:12.640
<v Speaker 2>I took half the bun and I just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then half the fries fricking slit</v>

2100
01:50:12.641 --> 01:50:14.320
<v Speaker 2>them off and I gave them to the lady and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2101
01:50:14.321 --> 01:50:18.490
<v Speaker 2>can you take that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would literally eat half the carbs</v>

2102
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:22.000
<v Speaker 2>that was on my plate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have everything as soon as it</v>

2103
01:50:22.001 --> 01:50:25.360
<v Speaker 2>came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was in my normal routine in life.</v>

2104
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:30.250
<v Speaker 2>If Sharon and I went to applebee's or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and I ordered my normal little</v>

2105
01:50:30.251 --> 01:50:33.010
<v Speaker 2>meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was a carb or junk,</v>

2106
01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:36.070
<v Speaker 2>whatever they gave me as a portion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I halved it.</v>

2107
01:50:36.490 --> 01:50:41.490
<v Speaker 2>And I mean just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then getting rid of like soda and</v>

2108
01:50:42.821 --> 01:50:45.970
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden it was just like zoom in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a matter of months.</v>

2109
01:50:45.971 --> 01:50:50.971
<v Speaker 2>You've just completely like change your</v>
<v Speaker 2>directional path and once you've done</v>

2110
01:50:51.041 --> 01:50:54.460
<v Speaker 2>the amount of calories and once you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that point,</v>

2111
01:50:54.850 --> 01:50:58.990
<v Speaker 2>you're motivated by what you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>

2112
01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like normally I'm used to having this,</v>

2113
01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2114
01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:08.200
<v Speaker 2>there's times where I might feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>bread,</v>

2115
01:51:08.230 --> 01:51:11.050
<v Speaker 2>like I told you that for the most part I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like,</v>

2116
01:51:11.070 --> 01:51:13.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel really good when I'm not eating</v>

2117
01:51:13.121 --> 01:51:16.060
<v Speaker 2>starch or carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel way better that way.</v>

2118
01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:19.840
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain carbs or I think really critical</v>

2119
01:51:19.841 --> 01:51:21.400
<v Speaker 2>for times where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2120
01:51:21.401 --> 01:51:25.870
<v Speaker 2>there's times where I'm needing to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I'm needing to speak and I kinda just</v>

2121
01:51:25.871 --> 01:51:29.050
<v Speaker 2>feel fuzzy in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me it sometimes I think it's</v>

2122
01:51:29.051 --> 01:51:33.730
<v Speaker 2>like your cognitive is like craving some</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain foods so we should try some</v>

2123
01:51:33.731 --> 01:51:35.660
<v Speaker 2>ketones to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get you some exemptions.</v>

2124
01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Ketones for digging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying your,</v>

2125
01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:40.130
<v Speaker 2>your dietary routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2126
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:42.800
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exonerations ketones have a big effect</v>

2127
01:51:42.801 --> 01:51:45.530
<v Speaker 1>on mental function is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very healthy for you too.</v>

2128
01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.670
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2129
01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:48.860
<v Speaker 1>not junk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not stimulants,</v>

2130
01:51:48.890 --> 01:51:50.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just healthy foods.</v>

2131
01:51:51.170 --> 01:51:52.003
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>

2132
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:53.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2133
01:51:53.071 --> 01:51:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I got to know Cameron Hanes is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

2134
01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:01.400
<v Speaker 1>in being on a few hunts and going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountains and experiencing what it's</v>

2135
01:52:01.401 --> 01:52:06.260
<v Speaker 1>like just to hike at high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just really underestimated the amount of</v>

2136
01:52:06.261 --> 01:52:10.040
<v Speaker 1>stress that it takes on your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how difficult it is to do.</v>

2137
01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And so then I started researching</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitness and fitness and hunting.</v>

2138
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be someone out there</v>

2139
01:52:17.121 --> 01:52:18.800
<v Speaker 1>that's like really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I found cam,</v>

2140
01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:22.940
<v Speaker 1>just a fitness fucking nut does ultra</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathons and all that jazz.</v>

2141
01:52:22.941 --> 01:52:26.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's how cam and I became friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>is by looking at his,</v>

2142
01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:29.990
<v Speaker 1>his sort of style of getting ready for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountains.</v>

2143
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Like pretty much all of what he does</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his weight training,</v>

2144
01:52:33.531 --> 01:52:35.240
<v Speaker 1>whether it's just running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running mountains.</v>

2145
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:37.910
<v Speaker 1>It's preparing him to be a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter.</v>

2146
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:43.010
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think many people that view</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting considered that they think of</v>

2147
01:52:43.011 --> 01:52:47.300
<v Speaker 1>hunting as being a fat guy who's beer</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for a deer to pass by so he</v>

2148
01:52:47.301 --> 01:52:48.920
<v Speaker 1>could shoot it in the Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2149
01:52:48.921 --> 01:52:49.754
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2150
01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:52.400
<v Speaker 1>That's how a lot of people look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

2151
01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:56.330
<v Speaker 1>They look at as a bunch of cruel</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes or that dentist guy who goes</v>

2152
01:52:56.331 --> 01:52:58.400
<v Speaker 1>over to Africa and shoots a line and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucks it up.</v>

2153
01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:01.880
<v Speaker 1>That's how a lot of people look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and that's one of the reasons</v>

2154
01:53:01.881 --> 01:53:06.881
<v Speaker 1>why hunting has a bad rap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in terms of its benefit and</v>

2155
01:53:07.530 --> 01:53:11.750
<v Speaker 1>as a tool for conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will say,</v>

2156
01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:12.584
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2157
01:53:12.730 --> 01:53:15.570
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why people call it a</v>

2158
01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.530
<v Speaker 1>conservation tool because it gives them</v>
<v Speaker 1>an excuse to kill animals.</v>

2159
01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Most of the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the money to preserve wetlands,</v>

2160
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:26.510
<v Speaker 1>to preserve wildlife habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of that money is a direct result of</v>

2161
01:53:26.511 --> 01:53:28.620
<v Speaker 1>hunting mostly lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

2162
01:53:28.630 --> 01:53:30.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an undeniable fact.</v>

2163
01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So all these people out there that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling themselves conservationists that</v>

2164
01:53:33.531 --> 01:53:37.340
<v Speaker 1>never donate and then they'll say</v>
<v Speaker 1>something mean and rude about hunting</v>

2165
01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:39.680
<v Speaker 1>and even eat a cheeseburger after they</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>

2166
01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual dishonesty out there when</v>

2167
01:53:44.151 --> 01:53:49.151
<v Speaker 1>it comes to this subject and also in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of what we should or shouldn't do</v>

2168
01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:51.440
<v Speaker 1>in terms of being the stewards of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

2169
01:53:51.441 --> 01:53:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about like wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs.</v>

2170
01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:56.960
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think that we should do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to control the population of</v>

2171
01:53:56.961 --> 01:53:59.120
<v Speaker 1>wild pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you've never been around</v>

2172
01:53:59.121 --> 01:54:01.250
<v Speaker 1>wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have two,</v>

2173
01:54:01.251 --> 01:54:04.250
<v Speaker 1>three litters a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll have three or four babies every</v>

2174
01:54:04.251 --> 01:54:07.100
<v Speaker 1>litter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>litter and they fucking keep going and</v>

2175
01:54:07.101 --> 01:54:09.350
<v Speaker 1>get more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you they get and what is it</v>

2176
01:54:09.351 --> 01:54:10.130
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey eggs,</v>

2177
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing seven to 10 in the litter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how many liters a year?</v>

2178
01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:16.173
<v Speaker 1>At least two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2179
01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

2180
01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.740
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every three months I can chuck them out.</v>

2181
01:54:20.770 --> 01:54:21.071
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>

2182
01:54:21.071 --> 01:54:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Chuck went out and six months after</v>
<v Speaker 2>being born,</v>

2183
01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.550
<v Speaker 2>which is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2184
01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:25.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>

2185
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:27.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2186
01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:32.460
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how one or two pigs turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>into an absolute problem really fast and</v>

2187
01:54:33.521 --> 01:54:35.290
<v Speaker 2>even even at your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2188
01:54:35.291 --> 01:54:37.960
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that give me slack if I,</v>

2189
01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted that video of that coyote I</v>

2190
01:54:40.151 --> 01:54:43.510
<v Speaker 2>shot and then you know about the wolf</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2191
01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:46.300
<v Speaker 2>but people have a problem with that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2192
01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:49.390
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in your yard and your wife comes</v>

2193
01:54:49.391 --> 01:54:52.330
<v Speaker 2>out and there's like two Qa to coyotes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the yard,</v>

2194
01:54:52.331 --> 01:54:55.840
<v Speaker 2>like scoping out your chicken house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when she took the kids to</v>

2195
01:54:55.841 --> 01:54:57.010
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she ends up telling us,</v>

2196
01:54:57.011 --> 01:54:58.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a coyote running down the road</v>

2197
01:54:58.631 --> 01:55:00.520
<v Speaker 2>with the fricking rooster hanging out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mouth.</v>

2198
01:55:00.570 --> 01:55:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're common.</v>

2199
01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2200
01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:06.460
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to control some of that.</v>

2201
01:55:06.461 --> 01:55:09.550
<v Speaker 2>And I have to control Predator</v>
<v Speaker 2>populations because nothing else does.</v>

2202
01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:11.230
<v Speaker 2>And white tails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

2203
01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm frank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zane,</v>

2204
01:55:13.301 --> 01:55:18.301
<v Speaker 2>he was a three time Mr Olympia frank</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to do are you still does?</v>

2205
01:55:18.311 --> 01:55:21.130
<v Speaker 2>He still does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but frank and arnold used to do archery</v>

2206
01:55:21.131 --> 01:55:23.710
<v Speaker 2>as kind of an rnr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2207
01:55:23.890 --> 01:55:26.390
<v Speaker 2>from their bodybuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of there.</v>

2208
01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:29.980
<v Speaker 2>There's in their stress relief was</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting and um,</v>

2209
01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:35.220
<v Speaker 2>when I went to the Arnold and competed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>frank and Anne frank and Arnold ended up</v>

2210
01:55:36.761 --> 01:55:39.850
<v Speaker 2>coming in to have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old cow,</v>

2211
01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:42.280
<v Speaker 2>like a competition like from the old</v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

2212
01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:46.200
<v Speaker 2>so they into the hall to like each of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them shoot.</v>

2213
01:55:46.230 --> 01:55:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Arnold didn't know was frank was so</v>

2214
01:55:50.431 --> 01:55:55.431
<v Speaker 2>competitive that frank actually talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the coordinator of the event and he</v>

2215
01:55:57.541 --> 01:56:02.220
<v Speaker 2>called her and said who are there any</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good archers coming that can</v>

2216
01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:03.054
<v Speaker 2>coach.</v>

2217
01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:07.110
<v Speaker 2>So she asked around and ended up</v>
<v Speaker 2>connecting frank to me.</v>

2218
01:56:07.111 --> 01:56:11.610
<v Speaker 2>So when frank and I talked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like a big fan of them because I</v>

2219
01:56:11.611 --> 01:56:16.611
<v Speaker 2>was a fitness guy for my stress relief</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted coaching because he goes,</v>

2220
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:19.950
<v Speaker 2>when Arnold Nice shoot together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to think that I've</v>

2221
01:56:19.951 --> 01:56:21.900
<v Speaker 2>practiced but I want to fricking beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2222
01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:26.640
<v Speaker 2>So I actually like worked with them a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and he did end up,</v>

2223
01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ended up shooting and then frank and</v>

2224
01:56:29.731 --> 01:56:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I became friends and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2225
01:56:32.041 --> 01:56:35.670
<v Speaker 2>he's an animal he's from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's down from San Francisco,</v>

2226
01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:37.440
<v Speaker 2>South San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2227
01:56:38.130 --> 01:56:42.690
<v Speaker 2>and he never really talked negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>about me when he knew that I was a</v>

2228
01:56:42.691 --> 01:56:46.320
<v Speaker 2>hunter and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could tell it wasn't necessarily</v>

2229
01:56:46.321 --> 01:56:48.220
<v Speaker 2>something that he favored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I</v>

2230
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:51.280
<v Speaker 2>will absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

2231
01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:54.000
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't like dead set against it.</v>

2232
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I think he just isn't interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2233
01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.280
<v Speaker 2>So I pick them up at the airport and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're driving back and he said,</v>

2234
01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:03.780
<v Speaker 2>so do you like hunt deer all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2235
01:57:03.781 --> 01:57:04.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have them all the time.</v>

2236
01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.600
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2237
01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:07.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Kinda,</v>

2238
01:57:07.410 --> 01:57:09.990
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about it?</v>

2239
01:57:09.991 --> 01:57:12.420
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do it.</v>

2240
01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:13.800
<v Speaker 2>And he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2241
01:57:14.190 --> 01:57:18.090
<v Speaker 2>And he never said anything negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember we were three miles from</v>

2242
01:57:18.091 --> 01:57:23.070
<v Speaker 2>my house in a fricking deer comes across</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road and we're like in my little</v>

<v Speaker 2>that was a freaking deal.</v>

2249
01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:39.300
<v Speaker 2>We just hit a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2250
01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:44.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if 850,000 people in the state</v>

2251
01:57:44.701 --> 01:57:49.270
<v Speaker 2>of Wisconsin weren't out hunting a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight hundred and $50,000.</v>

2252
01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Is that how many?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2253
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:53.680
<v Speaker 1>between Bowen gun owners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look it up.</v>

2254
01:57:53.690 --> 01:57:56.650
<v Speaker 1>I was in Wisconsin for opening season</v>
<v Speaker 1>not last year,</v>

2255
01:57:56.651 --> 01:58:01.060
<v Speaker 1>but the year before last and the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>light is like a war just started.</v>

2256
01:58:02.770 --> 01:58:05.080
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when we used to watch like</v>

2257
01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:07.720
<v Speaker 1>shocking all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when the shock and all happen.</v>

2258
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:09.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what it sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2259
01:58:09.370 --> 01:58:13.840
<v Speaker 1>we talked about Michigan on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that in last year or every year,</v>

2260
01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:19.140
<v Speaker 1>50,000 car accidents involving deer a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year just in Michigan alone.</v>

2261
01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:22.180
<v Speaker 1>And so people that think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2262
01:58:22.181 --> 01:58:23.470
<v Speaker 1>there's no other way to take care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2263
01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:26.290
<v Speaker 1>This is what people have to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want to bring in wolves and</v>

2264
01:58:26.291 --> 01:58:27.700
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to bring in wolves,</v>

2265
01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:30.940
<v Speaker 1>wolves in your neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to look that in the face.</v>

2266
01:58:30.941 --> 01:58:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you did.</v>

2267
01:58:32.210 --> 01:58:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2268
01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I've talked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That story's crazy.</v>

2269
01:58:34.931 --> 01:58:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I was telling a friend of mine about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2270
01:58:37.751 --> 01:58:38.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of you,</v>

2271
01:58:38.861 --> 01:58:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you were in Alberta and you shot elk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these wolves</v>

2272
01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:44.430
<v Speaker 2>circled the elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>

2273
01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:47.140
<v Speaker 2>how many wolves were there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2274
01:58:47.141 --> 01:58:52.141
<v Speaker 2>at first there was just the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one came in and you know,</v>

2275
01:58:52.541 --> 01:58:55.300
<v Speaker 2>the one came in on us and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2276
01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:57.730
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I do want to say off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

2277
01:58:57.731 --> 01:59:02.731
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I always do as a hunter</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I always buy or Predator tag if it's</v>

2278
01:59:03.161 --> 01:59:07.030
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I know that I can get that I can buy</v>

2279
01:59:07.031 --> 01:59:10.900
<v Speaker 2>a tag for coyotes or wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always have one in my pocket because</v>

2280
01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:12.580
<v Speaker 2>you do see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2281
01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:15.790
<v Speaker 2>they're out there and they're out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more now and this.</v>

2282
01:59:15.970 --> 01:59:20.970
<v Speaker 2>And this is an exact reason why he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it because literally we had an elk</v>

2283
01:59:21.370 --> 01:59:24.760
<v Speaker 2>down and next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're out there kind of,</v>

2284
01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:26.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting it ready to like,</v>

2285
01:59:26.530 --> 01:59:29.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cut it up and stuff and get it out of</v>

2286
01:59:29.891 --> 01:59:32.720
<v Speaker 2>there and all sudden this big wolf comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

2287
01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in.</v>

2288
01:59:33.610 --> 01:59:36.550
<v Speaker 2>And I had spotted it and we weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really being noisy,</v>

2289
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
<v Speaker 2>so I ended up shooting that wolf and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of went off and you know,</v>

2290
01:59:42.161 --> 01:59:47.161
<v Speaker 2>with a bow there's no noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we didn't realize was there was</v>

2291
01:59:47.351 --> 01:59:49.870
<v Speaker 2>a pack there and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was actually,</v>

2292
01:59:49.871 --> 01:59:53.110
<v Speaker 2>it was an Alpha female is because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>size of it.</v>

2293
01:59:53.111 --> 01:59:58.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean you saw the size of it is as big</v>
<v Speaker 2>as me and it actually went off and then</v>

2294
02:00:00.010 --> 02:00:00.930
<v Speaker 2>we kinda thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2295
02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:02.140
<v Speaker 2>was freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freaky will.</v>

2296
02:00:02.141 --> 02:00:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Then about 20 minutes later all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden we see another one and we see</v>

2297
02:00:06.581 --> 02:00:09.370
<v Speaker 2>another one and we're kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy crap.</v>

2298
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:14.910
<v Speaker 2>So we start moving into this draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them was like making a noise,</v>

2299
02:00:15.251 --> 02:00:18.610
<v Speaker 2>almost like it was injured or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was whimpering.</v>

2300
02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:20.050
<v Speaker 2>So we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the deal?</v>

2301
02:00:20.051 --> 02:00:24.670
<v Speaker 2>So we were on high ground with the elk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we started moving down into</v>

2302
02:00:24.671 --> 02:00:28.240
<v Speaker 2>this ravine because we saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolves down in there.</v>

2303
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:33.280
<v Speaker 2>And next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get down in there and I start looking</v>

2304
02:00:33.281 --> 02:00:35.860
<v Speaker 2>around and there's like hair on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trees.</v>

2305
02:00:35.861 --> 02:00:37.000
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2306
02:00:37.090 --> 02:00:39.970
<v Speaker 2>it looked like that movie into the gray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gray,</v>

2307
02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:42.730
<v Speaker 2>the gray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it looked like.</v>

2308
02:00:42.731 --> 02:00:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Liam Neeson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was like frick and Harry turds</v>

2309
02:00:45.641 --> 02:00:47.080
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

2310
02:00:47.081 --> 02:00:50.380
<v Speaker 2>there was like beds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was hair rubbed on the trees and I</v>

2311
02:00:50.381 --> 02:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>start looking around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like holes dug in and I'm like,</v>

2312
02:00:54.130 --> 02:00:59.130
<v Speaker 2>I literally look at my two buddies that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there with me and I said right in</v>

2313
02:00:59.321 --> 02:01:01.240
<v Speaker 2>their fricking den,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2314
02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:03.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we had that elk was not too</v>

2315
02:01:03.791 --> 02:01:04.590
<v Speaker 2>far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2316
02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:08.640
<v Speaker 2>our elk wasn't too far when you shot an</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk that they probably thought of as</v>

2317
02:01:08.641 --> 02:01:10.960
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh they definitely thought of it was</v>

2318
02:01:10.961 --> 02:01:11.770
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2319
02:01:11.770 --> 02:01:13.960
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely thought that was theirs.</v>

2320
02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:18.640
<v Speaker 2>So then once we're down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden we hear this.</v>

2321
02:01:18.730 --> 02:01:21.210
<v Speaker 2>How were like down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hear this how,</v>

2322
02:01:21.211 --> 02:01:25.270
<v Speaker 2>and it was definitely an Alpha because</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Alphas the how.</v>

2323
02:01:25.570 --> 02:01:30.570
<v Speaker 2>It literally turns your blood instantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold if you're right in on a true wolf</v>

2324
02:01:32.021 --> 02:01:32.860
<v Speaker 2>howl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2325
02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like so freaking low and</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep and it's just like chills your</v>

2326
02:01:38.231 --> 02:01:39.380
<v Speaker 2>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you realize.</v>

2327
02:01:39.381 --> 02:01:40.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2328
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Then I realized I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in their fricking Dan and you</v>

2329
02:01:43.341 --> 02:01:44.360
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of looking down.</v>

2330
02:01:44.361 --> 02:01:44.961
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2331
02:01:44.961 --> 02:01:47.060
<v Speaker 2>well I shot an elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I shot that.</v>

2332
02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I've got two arrows left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2333
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:52.880
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both my guides kind of had,</v>

2334
02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:54.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once we said,</v>

2335
02:01:54.170 --> 02:01:56.030
<v Speaker 2>oh there's wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like grabbed a gun.</v>

2336
02:01:56.031 --> 02:01:58.250
<v Speaker 2>We kind of went down in there to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was up.</v>

2337
02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Well now this happens and next thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that Alpha sounded off,</v>

2338
02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:03.553
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

2339
02:02:07.150 --> 02:02:09.560
<v Speaker 2>and I mean 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 12,</v>

2340
02:02:09.561 --> 02:02:12.680
<v Speaker 2>sounded off all the way around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a,</v>

2341
02:02:12.710 --> 02:02:14.240
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're literally down.</v>

2342
02:02:14.241 --> 02:02:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who's been in Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2343
02:02:15.981 --> 02:02:20.150
<v Speaker 2>that the farm land is level and then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>falls into the river system.</v>

2344
02:02:20.151 --> 02:02:23.420
<v Speaker 2>So we're literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the high ground,</v>

2345
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:26.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a dozen wolves and we're in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle and we're like,</v>

2346
02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:28.300
<v Speaker 2>what the crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>

2347
02:02:28.301 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like get you back to a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we kinda all spin around and we're</v>

2348
02:02:32.151 --> 02:02:37.151
<v Speaker 2>sitting there and next thing you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>here comes to dogs on a full blown.</v>

2349
02:02:37.251 --> 02:02:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking like full blown like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

2350
02:02:40.881 --> 02:02:45.881
<v Speaker 2>coming and I mean it turned into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was like bullets flying.</v>

2351
02:02:46.281 --> 02:02:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's freaking arrows skipping</v>
<v Speaker 2>off junk.</v>

2352
02:02:48.711 --> 02:02:53.711
<v Speaker 2>And we ended up shooting both of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves dead and there's a few gunfire</v>

2353
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:59.010
<v Speaker 2>going off while I'm down to like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow left and I told the guy,</v>

2354
02:02:59.011 --> 02:03:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I said how many bullets you got?</v>

2355
02:03:00.770 --> 02:03:03.740
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I didn't,</v>

2356
02:03:03.790 --> 02:03:04.161
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2357
02:03:04.161 --> 02:03:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I just grabbed the gun to a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullets.</v>

2358
02:03:06.471 --> 02:03:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't know where this was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>going down.</v>

2359
02:03:09.171 --> 02:03:11.990
<v Speaker 2>So count,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of like we need to get out of</v>

2360
02:03:11.991 --> 02:03:14.120
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we started backing up and next thing</v>

2361
02:03:14.121 --> 02:03:14.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2362
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:19.810
<v Speaker 2>the Alpha sounded off again and they all</v>
<v Speaker 2>reported this time there's only two or</v>

2363
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:25.100
<v Speaker 2>two less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So next thing I know,</v>

2364
02:03:25.101 --> 02:03:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm like kind of we're trying to back</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2365
02:03:27.051 --> 02:03:28.180
<v Speaker 2>So when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second,</v>

2366
02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.230
<v Speaker 2>you say they reported there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

2367
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:32.710
<v Speaker 2>they know that two were dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2368
02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.070
<v Speaker 2>So all of them are howling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certain that the first.</v>

2369
02:03:37.071 --> 02:03:42.071
<v Speaker 2>How was the Alpha male pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying in is everyone in position</v>

2370
02:03:45.170 --> 02:03:47.000
<v Speaker 2>because then they all like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2371
02:03:47.001 --> 02:03:48.590
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the way around.</v>

2372
02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden the to come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all hell breaks loose.</v>

2373
02:03:53.630 --> 02:03:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Then we're like the alpha sounds again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's in a different location.</v>

2374

2415
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:05.900
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing people underestimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>about hunters is our respect for</v>

<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

<v Speaker 2>my boy might listen.</v>

2426
02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Remember I drew back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2427
02:06:34.371 --> 02:06:39.371
<v Speaker 2>like I literally drew back and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>anchored and that came into my peep and</v>

2428
02:06:41.230 --> 02:06:44.190
<v Speaker 2>means for people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a little circle that you</v>

2429
02:06:44.191 --> 02:06:47.160
<v Speaker 2>look at through the string.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We line lining up with the site.</v>

2430
02:06:47.161 --> 02:06:52.161
<v Speaker 2>So I was literally lining up the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lining up the shot and as soon as I kind</v>

2431
02:06:52.190 --> 02:06:55.320
<v Speaker 2>of brought my shot down to where that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf was,</v>

2432
02:06:55.410 --> 02:06:57.510
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bolted.</v>

2433
02:06:57.560 --> 02:06:58.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2434
02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:00.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Ninja.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>

2437
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:11.440
<v Speaker 1>We had to have known that you killed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elk and they had to have known that you</v>

2438
02:07:11.441 --> 02:07:13.030
<v Speaker 1>killed those other two wolves which</v>
<v Speaker 1>chased you.</v>

2439
02:07:13.150 --> 02:07:15.040
<v Speaker 2>That went after this to try and get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ELC.</v>

2440
02:07:15.070 --> 02:07:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I think he came in to to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2441
02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:21.430
<v Speaker 2>we've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You called a fight.</v>

2442
02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:26.500
<v Speaker 2>We responded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's like sizing up.</v>

2443
02:07:26.501 --> 02:07:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost.</v>

2444
02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I've lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what I'm going against.</v>

2445
02:07:33.011 --> 02:07:35.500
<v Speaker 2>He kinda came in and he freaking looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all</v>

2446
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:40.250
<v Speaker 1>and then that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good thing they can count for you.</v>

2447
02:07:40.251 --> 02:07:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Who you only had two hours left here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2448
02:07:43.590 --> 02:07:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two bullets.</v>

2449
02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy pick up and picked up.</v>

2450
02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bone chilling.</v>

2451
02:07:48.450 --> 02:07:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have,</v>

2452
02:07:49.930 --> 02:07:54.550
<v Speaker 1>you and I both have friends that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies cats.</v>

2453
02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:57.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats are notorious for stocking hunters</v>

2454
02:07:57.161 --> 02:07:59.260
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I mean they are the ultimate</v>

2455
02:07:59.261 --> 02:08:03.250
<v Speaker 1>hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but grizzlies and wolves,</v>

2456
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean there you have to be on guard</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2457
02:08:06.271 --> 02:08:08.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's places now we're,</v>

2458
02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:13.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies are strongly becoming such a</v>

2459
02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:15.910
<v Speaker 1>problem when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2460
02:08:15.911 --> 02:08:18.580
<v Speaker 1>they have to be controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just starting to get to be too</v>

2461
02:08:18.581 --> 02:08:20.680
<v Speaker 1>many for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for the food source.</v>

2462
02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Well there's people that worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>them being wiped out and I read this</v>

2463
02:08:25.091 --> 02:08:28.750
<v Speaker 1>article about it recently and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so filled with misunderstanding or</v>

2464
02:08:28.751 --> 02:08:31.960
<v Speaker 1>misinformation and we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>wiping out grizzlies that if they did</v>

2465
02:08:31.961 --> 02:08:34.840
<v Speaker 1>open up back to grizzlies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies back to hunting again,</v>

2466
02:08:34.841 --> 02:08:35.740
<v Speaker 1>they will be wiped out.</v>

2467
02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:39.100
<v Speaker 1>People don't understand how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot meant a certain amount of</v>

2468
02:08:39.101 --> 02:08:44.101
<v Speaker 1>tags that get distributed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife biologist deemed that there's</v>

2469
02:08:44.201 --> 02:08:48.400
<v Speaker 1>too many of them and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic for all the other animals</v>

2470
02:08:48.401 --> 02:08:51.010
<v Speaker 1>that live in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand like when they</v>

2471
02:08:51.011 --> 02:08:53.950
<v Speaker 1>try to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they put tag limits on white tail</v>

2472
02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:56.410
<v Speaker 1>deer or would they put tag limits on</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves?</v>

2473
02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:00.760
<v Speaker 1>They do it because they've deemed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue and there's obviously</v>

2474
02:09:00.761 --> 02:09:04.330
<v Speaker 1>people want to hunt deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also an issue,</v>

2475
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about the state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania.</v>

2476
02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.140
<v Speaker 1>There's some areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's still the case,</v>

2477
02:09:08.141 --> 02:09:11.080
<v Speaker 1>but there were some areas in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania where they brought in</v>

2478
02:09:11.090 --> 02:09:14.050
<v Speaker 1>hunter's year round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no tag limits.</v>

2479
02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:16.890
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just please come on down and shoot.</v>

2480
02:09:16.930 --> 02:09:19.230
<v Speaker 1>And it was on Michael Waddell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2481
02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.440
<v Speaker 1>his show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2482
02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:22.090
<v Speaker 1>T bone was there.</v>

2483
02:09:22.090 --> 02:09:25.630
<v Speaker 1>There was a shot like three or four deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a day and it was in the middle of</v>

2484
02:09:25.631 --> 02:09:27.670
<v Speaker 1>summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just went down there and shot deer</v>

2485
02:09:27.671 --> 02:09:30.250
<v Speaker 1>because there's just so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were shooting them in like a</v>

2486
02:09:30.251 --> 02:09:33.430
<v Speaker 1>residential area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were in a tree stand in like this</v>

2487

<v Speaker 1>I met a guy that was literally begging</v>

2489
02:09:41.081 --> 02:09:43.720
<v Speaker 1>me to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said there's a deer season in the</v>

2490
02:09:43.721 --> 02:09:48.721
<v Speaker 1>residential areas I think in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said there's like so many deer in</v>

2491
02:09:48.821 --> 02:09:53.440
<v Speaker 1>people's backyards and the timber.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're not bear barriers.</v>

2527
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:35.760
<v Speaker 2>What a lot of people don't realize too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I every year I go up,</v>

2528
02:11:35.790 --> 02:11:36.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always catch,</v>

2529
02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:40.800
<v Speaker 2>you catch flack for being a bear hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I go up to British Columbia every</v>

2530
02:11:40.801 --> 02:11:45.801
<v Speaker 2>year and bear hunt and during and it's</v>

<v Speaker 2>I remember one year I saw 82 bears on a</v>

2533
02:11:57.241 --> 02:11:59.250
<v Speaker 2>six day hunt.</v>

<v Speaker 2>see twice,</v>

2535
02:12:02.970 --> 02:12:05.850
<v Speaker 2>but there was so many barriers and it's</v>

<v Speaker 2>Otherwise this happens and you want to</v>

2538
02:12:11.341 --> 02:12:12.960

2557
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:18.990
<v Speaker 1>They didn't exist and they were in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

2558
02:13:18.991 --> 02:13:21.840
<v Speaker 1>They would be a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be some based living in the woods.</v>

<v Speaker 1>When they pull them out and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally catch a deer that's giving</v>

<v Speaker 2>They eat cubs on a regular basis.</v>

2563
02:13:35.341 --> 02:13:38.110
<v Speaker 2>There's so much cannibalism and the bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

2564
02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:42.260
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>

2565
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:44.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they equal rights.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the cabin.</v>

02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just the sheer power.</v>

02:13:58.650 --> 02:14:03.650
<v Speaker 2>He's up up there where I hunt and BC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has stories of the wilderness.</v>

2572
02:14:03.810 --> 02:14:07.620
<v Speaker 2>He'd be the ultimate character for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have on and he's like a real life.</v>

2573
02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Grizzly Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got stories,</v>

2574
02:14:09.931 --> 02:14:14.931
<v Speaker 2>but there was a bear that kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying the camps and the cabins.</v>

2575
02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:18.090
<v Speaker 2>They ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ended up like just kind of calling</v>

2576
02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:23.100
<v Speaker 2>the bear earl big earl or something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would come to the camps.</v>

2577
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.990
<v Speaker 2>He would come in and they would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a huge big door,</v>

2578
02:14:28.170 --> 02:14:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would nail in,</v>

2579
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:30.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

2580
02:14:30.511 --> 02:14:35.190
<v Speaker 2>10 inch spikes through the doorframe in</v>
<v Speaker 2>three spots down the sides.</v>

2581
02:14:35.190 --> 02:14:38.430
<v Speaker 2>And then through the top they'd nail 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>inch spikes,</v>

2582
02:14:38.431 --> 02:14:42.700
<v Speaker 2>pound them through the logs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a log home to hold the doorframe</v>

2583
02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:43.620
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2584
02:14:43.621 --> 02:14:47.160
<v Speaker 2>they came to camp and they figured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is going to keep him out</v>

2585
02:14:47.161 --> 02:14:49.440
<v Speaker 2>because he was blowing through all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>windows.</v>

2586
02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Every year he'd blow through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>windows,</v>

2587
02:14:51.421 --> 02:14:54.480
<v Speaker 2>so they boarded the windows up and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had this door.</v>

2588
02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:57.690
<v Speaker 2>So evidently he got mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could see where he was really mad</v>

2589
02:14:57.691 --> 02:15:00.090
<v Speaker 2>about how they boarded the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the windows up.</v>

2590
02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:05.480
<v Speaker 2>So he literally grabbed the door and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole door and we'll.</v>

2591
02:15:05.911 --> 02:15:10.590
<v Speaker 2>The whole frame with the door was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking laying off to the side of the</v>

2592
02:15:10.591 --> 02:15:15.591
<v Speaker 2>cabin with 10 inch spikes bent on 90</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree angles and there was one claw</v>

2593
02:15:19.051 --> 02:15:22.140
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had evidently reached in with two</v>

2594
02:15:22.141 --> 02:15:27.141
<v Speaker 2>claws and freaking hook the backside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doorframe and ripped a fricken door</v>

2595
02:15:28.170 --> 02:15:32.070
<v Speaker 2>out of a log home and pulled one of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>own closet and pulled his claw.</v>

2596
02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:35.340
<v Speaker 2>That's how they knew they got the bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they ended up getting a permit</v>

2597
02:15:35.341 --> 02:15:38.750
<v Speaker 2>to get the bear and he had nine clause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2598
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:44.030
<v Speaker 2>So he fricking through that to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When in the cabin he licked the fricken</v>

2599
02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:49.740
<v Speaker 2>oven clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he could still smell that there's</v>

2600
02:15:49.741 --> 02:15:53.400
<v Speaker 2>like Greece somewhere inside there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he like wanted to get to.</v>

2601
02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000
<v Speaker 2>So the whole fricken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole stove was smashed about this</v>

2602
02:16:00.211 --> 02:16:03.510
<v Speaker 2>high off the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a couple inches a couple inches off</v>

2603
02:16:03.511 --> 02:16:06.480
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He literally just got on it and squish</v>

2604
02:16:06.481 --> 02:16:11.481
<v Speaker 2>that fricking a fullblown stove just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we would a pop can under our foot</v>

2605
02:16:13.590 --> 02:16:17.940
<v Speaker 2>to like squirt some extra grease up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of that big Oreo cookie that he</v>

2606
02:16:17.941 --> 02:16:20.130
<v Speaker 2>thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my and licked it clean,</v>

2607
02:16:20.131 --> 02:16:25.131
<v Speaker 2>we'll it gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was curtains over the sink and</v>

2608
02:16:25.831 --> 02:16:29.380
<v Speaker 2>the Cabinet and the curtains were all</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

2609
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:31.060
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2610
02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:34.300
<v Speaker 2>the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was like there was two big</v>

2611
02:16:34.301 --> 02:16:37.630
<v Speaker 2>five gallon things of like cooking oil</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were in the camp.</v>

2612
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:43.230
<v Speaker 2>So burt told me that there was like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>claw mark in the cooking oil and then</v>

2613
02:16:43.421 --> 02:16:46.140
<v Speaker 2>the fricken things like a Capri Sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had freaked out,</v>

2614
02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:48.480
<v Speaker 2>popped a hole in these five gallon</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2615
02:16:48.490 --> 02:16:52.210
<v Speaker 2>a cooking oil and freaking squirt them</v>
<v Speaker 2>dry like a,</v>

2616
02:16:52.330 --> 02:16:55.830
<v Speaker 2>like an old capri sun through those to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the side we'll,</v>

2617
02:16:55.831 --> 02:17:00.831
<v Speaker 2>the curtains were gone to because burt</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks because of cooking,</v>

2618
02:17:01.450 --> 02:17:04.630
<v Speaker 2>like the grease and crap that got on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>curtains.</v>

2619
02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:07.960
<v Speaker 2>He liked freaking they were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2620
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Well at the time they didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

2621
02:17:09.970 --> 02:17:12.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm his wife Mary Jane was like,</v>

2622
02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:16.600
<v Speaker 2>What happened to the curtains?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like I have no idea.</v>

2623
02:17:16.601 --> 02:17:20.110
<v Speaker 2>But he had lived in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean he had like piled the couch up</v>

2624
02:17:20.111 --> 02:17:22.030
<v Speaker 2>and I mean he like lived in that cabin.</v>

2625
02:17:22.570 --> 02:17:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Will there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bear did a full blown 10 foot</v>

2626
02:17:25.930 --> 02:17:30.930
<v Speaker 2>fricking grizzly mountain grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then they went down to the next camp</v>

2627
02:17:31.481 --> 02:17:34.210
<v Speaker 2>which was 20 miles away and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you this part,</v>

2628
02:17:34.570 --> 02:17:38.980
<v Speaker 2>so they get in there and it's just an</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute freaking wreck.</v>

2629
02:17:38.981 --> 02:17:43.981
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a life size mouse home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just crap everywhere.</v>

2630
02:17:46.210 --> 02:17:50.470
<v Speaker 2>So Mary Jane's like cut a snow shovel</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's like scooping all this</v>

2631
02:17:50.471 --> 02:17:54.760
<v Speaker 2>freaking shit off the ground and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was all these like material</v>

2632
02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:59.800
<v Speaker 2>dingleberry's in and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are those dingleberry things?</v>

2633
02:18:00.221 --> 02:18:03.670
<v Speaker 2>And burt goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all the balls off the curtains</v>

2634
02:18:03.671 --> 02:18:07.360
<v Speaker 2>from Griz camp the frick and buried like</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>

2635
02:18:07.361 --> 02:18:09.720
<v Speaker 2>The curtains in the other camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once he destroyed,</v>

2636
02:18:09.730 --> 02:18:13.750
<v Speaker 2>he kept walking down the road 20 miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the next brick and cabin.</v>

2637
02:18:14.470 --> 02:18:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Destroyed that one and freaking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only miles.</v>

2638
02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2639
02:18:18.901 --> 02:18:20.560
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the king of the mountain.</v>

2640
02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a huge range,</v>

2641
02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:23.620
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he like,</v>

2642
02:18:23.810 --> 02:18:28.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking slung dingleberry juice and 10</v>

2643
02:18:28.451 --> 02:18:31.060
<v Speaker 2>gallons of fricking oil all across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next can.</v>

2644
02:18:31.061 --> 02:18:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Just to prove a point might have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of diarrhea.</v>

2645
02:18:33.310 --> 02:18:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Bear gets after 10 gallons of oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just drink oil and eat curtains was</v>

2646
02:18:38.831 --> 02:18:42.670
<v Speaker 2>probably about the same kind I get after</v>
<v Speaker 2>like six chicken mcnuggets.</v>

2647
02:18:43.090 --> 02:18:45.460
<v Speaker 2>It's hard out there for a bear to hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2648
02:18:45.490 --> 02:18:47.530
<v Speaker 2>It is this a crazy animal.</v>

2649
02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:51.680
<v Speaker 1>It's such a majestic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're super lucky that they're alive.</v>

2650
02:18:51.681 --> 02:18:55.520
<v Speaker 1>We're super lucky that they're around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the difference between,</v>

2651
02:18:55.850 --> 02:18:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2652
02:18:57.350 --> 02:19:02.350
<v Speaker 1>people who were like really hardcore</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal rights activists and people who</v>

2653
02:19:03.111 --> 02:19:05.900
<v Speaker 1>are wildlife biologists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservationists.</v>

2654
02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:10.340
<v Speaker 1>They both agree that bears are amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where I think that these</v>

2655
02:19:10.341 --> 02:19:12.860
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a misconception.</v>

2656
02:19:12.861 --> 02:19:15.850
<v Speaker 1>They think that hunter's want to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and they're,</v>

2657
02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:19.880
<v Speaker 1>they're vicious and they're mean and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel and they have little dicks and uh,</v>

2658
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:21.380
<v Speaker 1>some of them do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2659
02:19:21.470 --> 02:19:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure someone small for you if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted that well,</v>

2660
02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:27.590
<v Speaker 1>like small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're a giant guy like six,</v>

2661
02:19:27.610 --> 02:19:28.730
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>

2662
02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:31.100
<v Speaker 1>That could be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just small compared to</v>

2663
02:19:31.101 --> 02:19:33.020
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

2664
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I hope so too for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2665
02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you got to admit your problem if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to move on,</v>

2666
02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:38.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2667
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:41.270
<v Speaker 1>So you get better at archery is how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get better at dealing with your Dick.</v>

2668
02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:46.550
<v Speaker 1>But this but both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point was that like both love bears.</v>

2669
02:19:46.940 --> 02:19:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

2670
02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:50.930
<v Speaker 1>they just don't want them to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2671
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:53.540
<v Speaker 1>So when you're looking at what this bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

2672
02:19:53.541 --> 02:19:57.370
<v Speaker 1>that cabin you said Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cam is in his name.</v>

2673
02:19:57.430 --> 02:19:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nothing's his neighborhood.</v>

2674
02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:02.570
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said it that it's all.</v>

2675
02:20:02.571 --> 02:20:05.510
<v Speaker 1>If people live out there and the bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in their house,</v>

2676
02:20:05.511 --> 02:20:08.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not that the bear came into his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

2677
02:20:08.350 --> 02:20:11.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking person's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't think that way then</v>

2678
02:20:11.651 --> 02:20:12.830
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a problem.</v>

2679
02:20:12.850 --> 02:20:16.250
<v Speaker 1>You're your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bears are fucking bears.</v>

2680
02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:18.710
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't differentiate the</v>

2681
02:20:18.711 --> 02:20:19.750
<v Speaker 1>difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2682
02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:24.020
<v Speaker 1>the value of a person and controlling</v>
<v Speaker 1>populations of bear,</v>

2683
02:20:24.021 --> 02:20:25.880
<v Speaker 1>well you're a ridiculous person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2684
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:27.500
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not looking at this thing</v>

2685
02:20:27.501 --> 02:20:28.280
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

2686
02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.260
<v Speaker 1>No one saying the bear should be wiped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2687
02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:32.480
<v Speaker 1>But when you talk about an animal that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

2688
02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:34.880
<v Speaker 1>from a stove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flatness,</v>

2689
02:20:34.881 --> 02:20:39.881
<v Speaker 1>stove and pull a door out of the frame</v>
<v Speaker 1>with nine foot long spikes surround,</v>

2690
02:20:41.981 --> 02:20:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean nine inch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine inch,</v>

2691
02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:45.690
<v Speaker 1>nine foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy that some kind of nails,</v>

2692
02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:47.910
<v Speaker 1>nails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nails as big as the band,</v>

2693
02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:51.380
<v Speaker 1>nine inch long spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about an insane animal</v>

2694
02:20:51.381 --> 02:20:53.600
<v Speaker 1>that if you don't control their</v>
<v Speaker 1>populations,</v>

2695
02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:55.580
<v Speaker 1>they're going to decimate everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna.</v>

2696
02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:58.520
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's saving them is</v>

2697
02:20:58.521 --> 02:21:00.350
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>them eating cubs.</v>

2698
02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:02.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing that controls the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population of them.</v>

2699
02:21:02.601 --> 02:21:03.520
<v Speaker 1>If they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're no.</v>

2700
02:21:03.521 --> 02:21:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2701
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing controlling the</v>

2702
02:21:05.261 --> 02:21:07.770
<v Speaker 2>population is the food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2703
02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I told you this the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2704
02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I feel like as a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love what I've got to witness as a</v>

2705
02:21:16.181 --> 02:21:21.181
<v Speaker 2>hunter because I feel like I've spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spent way more time enjoying the</v>

2706
02:21:22.511 --> 02:21:26.080
<v Speaker 2>creations of the wild because I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there</v>

2707
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:27.690
<v Speaker 1>really out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2708
02:21:27.691 --> 02:21:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how else would you have gotten a chance</v>

2709
02:21:29.731 --> 02:21:32.430
<v Speaker 1>to see wolves in that environment that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw them?</v>

2710
02:21:32.431 --> 02:21:34.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a confrontational.</v>

2711
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2712
02:21:35.210 --> 02:21:36.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2713
02:21:36.391 --> 02:21:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't prefer to be in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a freaking wolf attack to see them,</v>

2714
02:21:40.770 --> 02:21:44.160
<v Speaker 2>but you see things like I told you the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time we're like,</v>

2715
02:21:44.490 --> 02:21:47.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the time were a freaking bull</v>

2716
02:21:47.371 --> 02:21:49.830
<v Speaker 2>moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like probably about the size of the one</v>

2717
02:21:49.831 --> 02:21:52.170
<v Speaker 2>that you've got over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2718
02:21:52.171 --> 02:21:57.150
<v Speaker 2>literally watched this fricking grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 2>square off to this bull Moose and hit</v>

2719
02:21:57.151 --> 02:21:59.640
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The grizzly literally just hit the</v>

2720
02:21:59.641 --> 02:22:03.690
<v Speaker 2>fricken top back part of a full blown</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mousse and just broke it.</v>

2721
02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:06.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's like dinnertime snapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's back.</v>

2722
02:22:06.690 --> 02:22:07.523
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snapped it.</v>

2723
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:09.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the sheer power.</v>

2724
02:22:09.001 --> 02:22:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where was this up in BC.</v>

2725
02:22:11.310 --> 02:22:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2726
02:22:12.900 --> 02:22:15.090
<v Speaker 2>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far away was it from you?</v>

2727
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:17.100
<v Speaker 2>It was a ways off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2728
02:22:17.101 --> 02:22:20.520
<v Speaker 2>it was like a binocular watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still there's things like that.</v>

2729
02:22:20.970 --> 02:22:22.700
<v Speaker 2>There's things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2730
02:22:23.130 --> 02:22:27.840
<v Speaker 2>you talked about how um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rivets up in Alberta where they have</v>

2731
02:22:27.841 --> 02:22:28.950
<v Speaker 2>the bear camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2732
02:22:28.951 --> 02:22:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you saw like a boar.</v>

2733
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they were telling you the story I</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw bore and the south fighting.</v>

2734
02:22:34.531 --> 02:22:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going at it.</v>

2735
02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2736
02:22:36.391 --> 02:22:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I told you this and I actually,</v>

2737
02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I shot the bore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I spotted a big bear and a field and</v>

2738
02:22:46.681 --> 02:22:51.681
<v Speaker 2>I was hunting and it was spot and stalk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as I'm starting to stock all sudden</v>

2739
02:22:52.561 --> 02:22:56.880
<v Speaker 2>the sow comes out and starts freaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>like posture and to the,</v>

2740
02:22:57.180 --> 02:23:01.920
<v Speaker 2>to the mail and then all heck broke</v>
<v Speaker 2>loose just like that.</v>

2741
02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:04.830
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I'm within 100 yards of it.</v>

2742
02:23:04.831 --> 02:23:09.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's ferociously loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after they like break up,</v>

2743
02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:14.250
<v Speaker 2>the board goes running to this huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen the timber up there,</v>

2744
02:23:14.251 --> 02:23:16.800
<v Speaker 2>the timbers gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then a couple stories,</v>

2745
02:23:16.801 --> 02:23:21.801
<v Speaker 2>high fricking jumps on this tree and</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts going and I mean I'm talking like</v>

2746
02:23:21.931 --> 02:23:23.340
<v Speaker 2>full speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full speed.</v>

2747
02:23:23.610 --> 02:23:27.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like if it's an incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>chase and fight,</v>

2748
02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:32.670
<v Speaker 2>he freaking hits this tree and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking going up at like bark is just</v>

2749
02:23:32.671 --> 02:23:37.410
<v Speaker 2>ripping out and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the black female is going right behind</v>

2750
02:23:37.411 --> 02:23:39.480
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the time I still didn't realize</v>

2751
02:23:39.481 --> 02:23:43.350
<v Speaker 2>what's up until I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>until he gets almost to the top and I</v>

2752
02:23:43.351 --> 02:23:47.040
<v Speaker 2>see two colored cubs up there and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>

2753
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean like branches or coming off like</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing is stopping.</v>

2754
02:23:50.881 --> 02:23:54.600
<v Speaker 2>This dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fricking going and right before he</v>

2755
02:23:54.601 --> 02:23:59.130
<v Speaker 2>gets to the cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frick and female launches and grabs</v>

2756
02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:04.280
<v Speaker 2>the ham hock and just let's go the tree</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just fricking let's both of them and</v>

2757
02:24:06.181 --> 02:24:10.270
<v Speaker 2>let's the weight frick and bring them</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and just Ooh,</v>

2758
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:15.150
<v Speaker 2>you hear like boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all heck breaks loose.</v>

2759
02:24:15.210 --> 02:24:17.580
<v Speaker 2>They go up into the timber and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2760
02:24:17.610 --> 02:24:19.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crazy fight.</v>

2761
02:24:20.130 --> 02:24:24.330
<v Speaker 2>We were in a similar situation when</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a mother with her cubs and</v>

2762
02:24:24.331 --> 02:24:27.420
<v Speaker 2>then the board came in looking to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eat the cubs.</v>

2763
02:24:27.450 --> 02:24:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2764
02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we talked about there's argument to</v>

2765
02:24:30.481 --> 02:24:33.580
<v Speaker 2>why I haven't seen the evidence on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2766
02:24:33.610 --> 02:24:38.610
<v Speaker 2>you feel like it's just was Rinella said</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's recent evidence that shows</v>

2767
02:24:39.151 --> 02:24:43.590
<v Speaker 2>that these bears are looking to eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things like almost immediately</v>

2768
02:24:43.591 --> 02:24:46.230
<v Speaker 2>when they come out of hibernate because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ease of riot.</v>

2769
02:24:46.290 --> 02:24:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're just food I've,</v>

2770
02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I personally think because they always</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to be more aggressive on the cubs</v>

2771
02:24:52.651 --> 02:24:57.651
<v Speaker 2>from what I've experienced the further</v>
<v Speaker 2>into may then the rug,</v>

2772
02:24:58.490 --> 02:25:00.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The closer you get to run,</v>

2773
02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:02.070
<v Speaker 2>the more likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2774
02:25:02.071 --> 02:25:05.340
<v Speaker 2>I kinda think those boards might have</v>
<v Speaker 2>bred one or two styles.</v>

2775
02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:10.260
<v Speaker 2>They're Horny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean so horny and then they,</v>

2776
02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:15.090
<v Speaker 2>they're wanting another one and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that's the only thing that's going</v>

2777
02:25:15.091 --> 02:25:18.540
<v Speaker 2>to trigger to for them to come back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

2778
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:22.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that fight broke up in the sow,</v>

2779
02:25:22.850 --> 02:25:25.690
<v Speaker 2>she ended up standing guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She kind of called her cubs down and</v>

2780
02:25:25.691 --> 02:25:30.190
<v Speaker 2>they hauled will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that big bore ended up coming out and he</v>

2781
02:25:30.191 --> 02:25:30.780
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2782
02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:35.260
<v Speaker 2>it was like a seven foot chocolate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one I got,</v>

2783
02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:36.543
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2784
02:25:37.620 --> 02:25:38.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people might be like,</v>

2785
02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:40.780
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to kill the babies and</v>

2786
02:25:40.781 --> 02:25:42.760
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next thing you know,</v>

2787
02:25:42.761 --> 02:25:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of feel like I did babies.</v>

2788
02:25:47.370 --> 02:25:50.180
<v Speaker 2>You're constantly definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservationists in that</v>

2789
02:25:50.420 --> 02:25:53.270
<v Speaker 1>and that people also don't realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat bears too.</v>

2790
02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:55.670
<v Speaker 1>People have been eating bears forever</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it tastes good.</v>

2791
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2792
02:25:56.570 --> 02:25:59.570
<v Speaker 1>they think the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only eat deer and elk and everything</v>

2793
02:25:59.571 --> 02:26:01.070
<v Speaker 1>else is trophy hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2794
02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:02.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2795
02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:05.050
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me the,</v>

2796
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.943
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2797
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:08.170
<v Speaker 2>just the beauties that I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

2798
02:26:08.290 --> 02:26:10.600
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love sitting in a white tail stand and</v>

2799
02:26:10.601 --> 02:26:15.601
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time in a white tail</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand just sitting quiet and you know,</v>

2800
02:26:16.451 --> 02:26:20.950
<v Speaker 2>for me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like meditation because it is so</v>

2801
02:26:20.951 --> 02:26:24.040
<v Speaker 2>quiet at times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like sometimes I've heard like</v>

2802
02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:28.810
<v Speaker 2>birds and noises where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've literally never ever hurt.</v>

2803
02:26:28.811 --> 02:26:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've never heard that.</v>

2804
02:26:31.571 --> 02:26:34.090
<v Speaker 2>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the coolest things that I've</v>

2805
02:26:34.091 --> 02:26:39.091
<v Speaker 2>experienced is I've been in the timber</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the fall or there's just colors,</v>

2806
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:42.310
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a painting,</v>

2807
02:26:42.580 --> 02:26:43.720
<v Speaker 2>just colors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2808
02:26:43.721 --> 02:26:48.721
<v Speaker 2>you know how it is in the Midwest and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's days when like the first fall</v>

2809
02:26:49.181 --> 02:26:54.181
<v Speaker 2>snap really happens when I believe trees</v>
<v Speaker 2>just decided to let go.</v>

2810
02:26:57.390 --> 02:26:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever watched any of the Harry</v>

2811
02:26:59.650 --> 02:27:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Potter movies you ever see that move?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That tree that just like fricking cleans</v>

2812
02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:06.400
<v Speaker 2>itself off and then all of a sudden he</v>
<v Speaker 2>just decides,</v>

2813
02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:09.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the timber where it was</v>

2814
02:27:09.671 --> 02:27:14.290
<v Speaker 2>like the trees are almost communicating</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone just said let go.</v>

2815
02:27:14.291 --> 02:27:18.730
<v Speaker 2>And literally the like someone just</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved a fresh canvas,</v>

2816
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:24.030
<v Speaker 2>just all the colors of fall just let go</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you literally watched the whole</v>

2817
02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:29.200
<v Speaker 2>color of fall go to the ground and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>bare</v>

2818
02:27:30.270 --> 02:27:32.760
<v Speaker 1>who can say they've seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty rare.</v>

2819
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:36.810
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing to see these cycles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

2820
02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:39.660
<v Speaker 1>the see them in person and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that a lot of</v>

2821
02:27:39.661 --> 02:27:43.830
<v Speaker 1>people are missing by living in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of really cool shit that</v>

2822
02:27:43.831 --> 02:27:46.740
<v Speaker 1>you could see out in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much.</v>

2823
02:27:46.770 --> 02:27:51.770
<v Speaker 1>So much of it is just like inherently</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating or like it appeals to us</v>

2824
02:27:52.890 --> 02:27:56.220
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a primal way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that Squirrel I sent you</v>

2825
02:27:56.221 --> 02:27:57.380
<v Speaker 1>the other day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2826
02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>

2827
02:27:59.570 --> 02:28:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was crazy.</v>

2828
02:28:00.591 --> 02:28:04.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out for a little walk and I came</v>

2829
02:28:04.761 --> 02:28:08.150
<v Speaker 2>across a really nice buck and awesome</v>
<v Speaker 2>buck,</v>

2830
02:28:08.370 --> 02:28:13.370
<v Speaker 2>literally dead and eaten by coyotes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a deer that I know was,</v>

2831
02:28:15.290 --> 02:28:17.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd seen earlier in the season and it</v>

2832
02:28:17.211 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 2>was perfectly healthy and next thing I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know a month later here it is dead.</v>

2833
02:28:22.490 --> 02:28:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Just a decade carcass eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happened?</v>

2834
02:28:25.611 --> 02:28:28.820
<v Speaker 2>You think the coyote is captured it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you tired from the Rut?</v>

2835
02:28:28.850 --> 02:28:30.380
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2836
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:33.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with any type of animal,</v>

2837
02:28:33.201 --> 02:28:37.700
<v Speaker 2>especially when the males have such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited time to breed,</v>

2838
02:28:37.701 --> 02:28:40.190
<v Speaker 2>they've really exert themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>

2839
02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:44.300
<v Speaker 2>it's like looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen books that literally look</v>

2840
02:28:44.301 --> 02:28:45.134
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2841
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:47.870
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got that fighter that fought Kimbo</v>

2842
02:28:47.871 --> 02:28:48.740
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2843
02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:51.140
<v Speaker 2>$5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally seen them,</v>

2844
02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them walking in there like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking fully skins Zombie just because</v>

2845
02:28:59.211 --> 02:29:01.730
<v Speaker 2>they've just been running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came too much.</v>

2846
02:29:01.770 --> 02:29:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2847
02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:05.340
<v Speaker 2>They don't look like that a few times I</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard</v>

2848
02:29:07.090 --> 02:29:08.080
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

2849
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:09.163
<v Speaker 2>you get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2850
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when they get that run down,</v>

2851
02:29:12.771 --> 02:29:15.170
<v Speaker 2>it's no different than me when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling a lot,</v>

2852
02:29:15.171 --> 02:29:19.670
<v Speaker 2>especially when I'm skipping time zones</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really have a hard time getting</v>

2853
02:29:19.671 --> 02:29:22.280
<v Speaker 2>into a sleep pattern and a recovery</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern.</v>

2854
02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:25.070
<v Speaker 2>You just get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the flu,</v>

2855
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:26.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the flu,</v>

2856
02:29:26.361 --> 02:29:30.230
<v Speaker 2>you get some fricking stupid little bug</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on an airplane from some guy like</v>

2857
02:29:30.231 --> 02:29:32.540
<v Speaker 2>three seats over that's coughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2858
02:29:32.541 --> 02:29:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I think he just where your immune system</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and you're vulnerable.</v>

2859
02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:41.000
<v Speaker 2>And then when winter comes in and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fricking,</v>

2860
02:29:41.230 --> 02:29:42.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough on.</v>

2861
02:29:42.321 --> 02:29:45.080
<v Speaker 2>So they don't eat for days sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2862
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it after it.</v>

2863
02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I saw a book one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just,</v>

2864
02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean I see him like as far as I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>see with the binoculars over here.</v>

2865
02:29:54.561 --> 02:29:55.420
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2866
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:58.820
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes later it seem as far as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could see with binoculars go through</v>

2867
02:29:58.821 --> 02:30:02.810
<v Speaker 2>this creek bottom in this creek bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was actually sitting on this like</v>

2868
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Pond Dam and about 11 in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here he comes.</v>

2869
02:30:08.061 --> 02:30:09.140
<v Speaker 2>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking,</v>

2870
02:30:09.350 --> 02:30:14.350
<v Speaker 2>he's just walking with the Zombie walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's trying to find a scent trail</v>

2871
02:30:14.601 --> 02:30:19.220
<v Speaker 2>of a dough that's in estrus and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just been breeding for weeks and I</v>

2872
02:30:19.221 --> 02:30:24.110
<v Speaker 2>remember he was just freaking comment in</v>

<v Speaker 2>pond like with just as head sitting out</v>

2874
02:30:30.530 --> 02:30:35.530
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he comes up out and he's just</v>

2875
02:30:38.231 --> 02:30:39.280
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes like</v>

2876
02:30:43.890 --> 02:30:47.010
<v Speaker 2>shakes and he's gone again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's part of what ramps them all</v>

<v Speaker 2>but that buck that day and then</v>

2885
02:31:09.630 --> 02:31:12.060
<v Speaker 2>two minutes later I'm walking through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the forest like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge supporter to the boone and</v>

2905
02:32:03.481 --> 02:32:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Crockett club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2906
02:32:04.770 --> 02:32:06.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've uh,</v>

2907
02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:08.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really tried to become,</v>

2908
02:32:08.850 --> 02:32:09.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2909
02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I've done what it takes to become a</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional member now of the Boone and</v>

2910
02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Crockett club and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really focused on trying to give</v>

2911
02:32:18.541 --> 02:32:23.220
<v Speaker 2>more back on the conservation side</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are so many important</v>

2912
02:32:23.221 --> 02:32:28.170
<v Speaker 2>things that these organizations do for</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife.</v>

2913
02:32:28.171 --> 02:32:30.480
<v Speaker 2>As much as people want to say they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2914
02:32:31.620 --> 02:32:32.291
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2915
02:32:32.291 --> 02:32:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I've just never seen an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an anti hunting community</v>

2916
02:32:38.970 --> 02:32:43.970
<v Speaker 2>come anywhere where I'm at and put in</v>
<v Speaker 2>time establishing habitat and actually</v>

2917
02:32:46.561 --> 02:32:50.850
<v Speaker 2>doing things that grow the population</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2918
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I plant food and I probably leave 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks a year worth of food in my dirt to</v>

2919
02:32:56.881 --> 02:33:01.580
<v Speaker 2>like help grow deer and like help my</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear,</v>

2920
02:33:01.980 --> 02:33:03.430
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think though that there's a</v>

2921
02:33:03.431 --> 02:33:06.370
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that have opinions about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2922
02:33:06.371 --> 02:33:11.290
<v Speaker 1>about animals and about wildlife that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really spend very little time with</v>

2923
02:33:11.291 --> 02:33:15.610
<v Speaker 1>animals and in wildlife they have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>very convenient idea.</v>

2924
02:33:15.770 --> 02:33:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I,</v>

2925
02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I told a friend of mine the number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more we discussed on the podcast</v>

2926
02:33:20.291 --> 02:33:24.460
<v Speaker 1>earlier about Michigan having 50,000 car</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents a year and he was like,</v>

2927
02:33:24.461 --> 02:33:25.630
<v Speaker 1>you're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2928
02:33:25.690 --> 02:33:26.560
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google it.</v>

2929
02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:30.030
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at it and he just sat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally looked at his phone and</v>

2930
02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:31.450
<v Speaker 1>sat like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plop down.</v>

2931
02:33:31.451 --> 02:33:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2932
02:33:33.250 --> 02:33:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're there you would know like</v>

2933
02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:39.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's overwhelming because his opinion or</v>

2934
02:33:39.641 --> 02:33:43.360
<v Speaker 1>his point of view was that these hunters</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just these people that are just</v>

2935
02:33:43.361 --> 02:33:47.950
<v Speaker 1>assholes that liked to shoot animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they do need to do this,</v>

2936
02:33:48.010 --> 02:33:51.340
<v Speaker 1>like they need to do this and you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not think it,</v>

2937
02:33:51.700 --> 02:33:53.080
<v Speaker 1>but you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

2938
02:33:53.081 --> 02:33:56.620
<v Speaker 1>You have a survey of the whole world or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole country.</v>

2939
02:33:56.621 --> 02:33:58.330
<v Speaker 1>You just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you did,</v>

2940
02:33:58.331 --> 02:33:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I bet you'd have a different pace.</v>

2941
02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen some of the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what allstate insurance posts about</v>

2942
02:34:03.301 --> 02:34:08.301
<v Speaker 2>how many vehicle deaths and like dollars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vehicle collisions are,</v>

2943
02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:14.610
<v Speaker 2>are just with white tail deer with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance company?</v>

2944
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:16.740

<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet if Michigan has 50,000.</v>

2949
02:34:28.021 --> 02:34:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2950
02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:32.560
<v Speaker 2>mind blowing the even the number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>deaths would is</v>

2951
02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:35.980
<v Speaker 1>well in campaigns is hometown.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Or the guy behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy hit a deer when flying through</v>

<v Speaker 1>the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>175 to 200 fatalities every year and</v>

2955
02:34:47.141 --> 02:34:50.950
<v Speaker 1>10,000 injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's approximately one point 5</v>

2956
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:53.230
<v Speaker 1>million deer related car accidents</v>
<v Speaker 1>annually.</v>

2957

<v Speaker 1>There are one point 5 million deer</v>

2958
02:34:58.511 --> 02:35:02.950

<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2967
02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:29.430
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people don't know that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>continent is large and that.</v>

2968
02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:31.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>

2969
02:35:31.711 --> 02:35:32.880
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

2970
02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:37.650
<v Speaker 2>people whine and cry about how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance goes up.</v>

2971
02:35:38.370 --> 02:35:41.570
<v Speaker 2>How much do you think it would go up if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't help that?</v>

2972
02:35:42.570 --> 02:35:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Well also</v>

2973
02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:47.280
<v Speaker 1>does that have about health insurance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it ticks and lyme lyme disease.</v>

2974
02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this end.</v>

2975
02:35:48.821 --> 02:35:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Just your injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More people going in for hitting one.</v>

2976
02:35:51.611 --> 02:35:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2977
02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:55.060
<v Speaker 2>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad actually,</v>

2978
02:35:55.450 --> 02:35:59.350
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always wanted to have his teeth</v>

2979
02:35:59.410 --> 02:36:04.410
<v Speaker 2>perfect and I remember he wore braces</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time to get his teeth fixed</v>

2980
02:36:07.390 --> 02:36:12.390
<v Speaker 2>and like no sooner than he had them done</v>
<v Speaker 2>and was wearing a retainer and my dad's</v>

2981
02:36:13.481 --> 02:36:15.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a truck at home,</v>

2982
02:36:15.341 --> 02:36:17.770
<v Speaker 2>like a big truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he never drives it because he</v>

2983
02:36:17.771 --> 02:36:18.670
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he liked,</v>

2984
02:36:18.671 --> 02:36:22.060
<v Speaker 2>drove a little bitty Honda and fricking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit a deer.</v>

2985
02:36:22.061 --> 02:36:27.061
<v Speaker 2>He hit a buck like a month after getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>like finally the dentist saying,</v>

2986
02:36:27.721 --> 02:36:31.090
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to wear your retainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit a buck.</v>

2987
02:36:31.630 --> 02:36:36.630
<v Speaker 2>The horns stuck through his windshield</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the horn stopped on a steering wheel</v>

2988
02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:41.050
<v Speaker 2>and the body came in and hit him in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

2989
02:36:41.170 --> 02:36:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had to like get.</v>

2990
02:36:43.570 --> 02:36:47.350
<v Speaker 2>He literally is fake teeth in the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2991
02:36:47.700 --> 02:36:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2992
02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2993
02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea that one point $5 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you.</v>

2994
02:36:57.330 --> 02:37:00.310
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a way better statistic.</v>

2995
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:01.810
<v Speaker 2>50,000 in Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:37:01.811 --> 02:37:03.430
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2997
02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well wow,</v>

2998
02:37:04.571 --> 02:37:07.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>

2999
02:37:07.001 --> 02:37:09.940
<v Speaker 2>But in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the whole scheme of things,</v>

3000
02:37:09.941 --> 02:37:10.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

3001
02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:13.910
<v Speaker 2>my wife's from Rangeland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3002
02:37:14.170 --> 02:37:17.990
<v Speaker 2>and she had never hunted her family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never have.</v>

3003
02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:18.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>

3004
02:37:18.711 --> 02:37:20.780
<v Speaker 2>they have no idea about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3005
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:21.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3006
02:37:21.610 --> 02:37:23.870
<v Speaker 2>they have no relation to hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3007
02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:27.680
<v Speaker 2>So when she came over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

3008
02:37:28.150 --> 02:37:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knew I hunted and she was open</v>

3009
02:37:30.441 --> 02:37:33.860
<v Speaker 2>minded to it because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed her numbers like this.</v>

3010
02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3011
02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I understand you don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's talk about some of this stuff.</v>

3012
02:37:39.741 --> 02:37:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Do you realize this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that at our house if you</v>

3013
02:37:43.851 --> 02:37:46.880
<v Speaker 2>drive around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna see a deer from your car,</v>

3014
02:37:46.881 --> 02:37:51.881
<v Speaker 2>like almost anytime you're driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>around our area after dark or waiting to</v>

3015
02:37:52.570 --> 02:37:55.730
<v Speaker 2>see how many dead deer on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road during the first three weeks in</v>

3016
02:37:55.731 --> 02:37:58.010
<v Speaker 2>November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving down the highway in Iowa.</v>

3017
02:37:58.100 --> 02:38:01.910
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she kept an open mind and she</v>

3018
02:38:01.911 --> 02:38:05.450
<v Speaker 2>realized really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't grow a garden,</v>

3019
02:38:06.130 --> 02:38:08.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Wisconsin,</v>

3020
02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:10.580
<v Speaker 2>they were like eaten us all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3021
02:38:10.581 --> 02:38:12.740
<v Speaker 2>they were everywhere and she's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3022
02:38:12.741 --> 02:38:13.940
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

3023
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I never saw this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see this much stuff in in</v>

3024
02:38:18.570 --> 02:38:20.060
<v Speaker 2>England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have it.</v>

3025
02:38:20.061 --> 02:38:24.410
<v Speaker 2>That's why we weren't hunting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not because people aren't</v>

3026
02:38:24.411 --> 02:38:29.150
<v Speaker 2>necessarily hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't in some areas it isn't a</v>

3027
02:38:29.151 --> 02:38:33.380
<v Speaker 2>needed conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is here.</v>

3028
02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:34.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the reality.</v>

3029
02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you could see all one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>$5 million car accidents in like a scene</v>

3030
02:38:41.430 --> 02:38:43.050
<v Speaker 1>one after the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3031
02:38:43.350 --> 02:38:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3032
02:38:44.010 --> 02:38:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

3033
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Because you've got to think there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and 65 days.</v>

3034
02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Use Twenty four days in a 24 hours in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3035
02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:54.710
<v Speaker 1>So if you could look at all the footage</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's accumulated every year in one</v>

3036
02:38:56.191 --> 02:38:59.850
<v Speaker 1>giant loop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highlight reel of car accidents,</v>

3037
02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:02.040
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't watch it in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you couldn't.</v>

3038
02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Well you would watch two people die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two or 200 people die too,</v>

3039
02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:09.840
<v Speaker 1>but just the sheer volume would kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake people up.</v>

3040
02:39:10.110 --> 02:39:15.110
<v Speaker 1>If you could watch the sheer volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they put together a movie that was</v>

3041
02:39:15.181 --> 02:39:18.600
<v Speaker 1>three hours long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just all the car accidents in</v>

3042
02:39:18.601 --> 02:39:21.210
<v Speaker 1>the last six months with deere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would go,</v>

3043
02:39:21.270 --> 02:39:22.680
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at war.</v>

3044
02:39:22.890 --> 02:39:24.690
<v Speaker 1>We're at war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're attacking cars.</v>

3045
02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:29.010
<v Speaker 1>They're literally suicide bombing cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>to jumping out in the street and taking</v>

3046
02:39:29.011 --> 02:39:29.750
<v Speaker 1>out drivers.</v>

3047
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for over three hours you would see</v>

3048
02:39:31.731 --> 02:39:33.700
<v Speaker 2>someone die every minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3049
02:39:33.890 --> 02:39:34.770
<v Speaker 2>In that compile.</v>

3050
02:39:35.170 --> 02:39:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just see boom,</v>

3051
