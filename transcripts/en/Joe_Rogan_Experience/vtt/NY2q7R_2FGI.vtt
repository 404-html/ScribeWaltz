<v Speaker 1>And it's</v>

23
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.153
<v Speaker 1>quite fine</v>

24
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>while the than the beginning.</v>

25

<v Speaker 1>There's no visual for the first five minutes or you can cool.</v>

26
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.643
<v Speaker 1>There</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Anybody would say no to her shoulder rubbing her.</v>

30
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:10.674
<v Speaker 1>Nashville</v>

31
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>particularly shifts for this.</v>

32

<v Speaker 1>This interview ends with my wife under the table.</v>

34
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

35
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>that's considered a failure.</v>

36
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather it not happen.</v>

37
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>It's going to stay friends here.</v>

38
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I've been marked already today.</v>

39
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>So markets,</v>

40
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.623
<v Speaker 1>Marvin,</v>

41
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>you know a lot about that.</v>

42
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>And what was your first experience that was unethical for you?</v>

43
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like what substance?</v>

44
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

46
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.723
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>the first experience I had with anything outside of the norm was Mbma.</v>

48
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>That was the first like,</v>

49
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

50
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this was available.</v>

51
00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 1>that was her first like introduction to the idea of consciousness altering</v>

53
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>experiences and then the next one was suicide.</v>

54
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And then they first ineffable experience where you realized,</v>

55
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

56
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I am connected directly to the device.</v>

57
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:15.791
<v Speaker 1>So sign.</v>

58
00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>But pretty much the,</v>

59
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.643
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.860
<v Speaker 1>the MDA experience was just a realization how insecure I was and how insecure in</v>

61
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>general are in our interactions with each other.</v>

62
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>How much of our interactions with each other are sort of dependent upon our</v>

63
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 1>perceptions about people are gonna react to us and we have this wall.</v>

64
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>And that wall completely went away on MDM.</v>

65
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>And I found that fascinating,</v>

66
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't know that that state was available,</v>

68
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.470
<v Speaker 1>but then the psilocybin experience was one where I just sort of kind of</v>

69
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>understood that that was the first time I'd ever really wrapped my head around</v>

70
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:57.491
<v Speaker 1>the fact that this is not the top of the ground and you're not standing on</v>

71
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>something and there's not an above you,</v>

72
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>but that you're sort of in the middle of everything.</v>

73
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I have never really had it in my,</v>

74
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>my own head before.</v>

75
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>That was the first time where I just sort of really dawned on me and I have</v>

76
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:12.200
<v Speaker 1>watched cosmos documentaries.</v>

77
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I had seen a bunch of different,</v>

78
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>things on astronomy where I sort of kind of got the idea that we're at the</v>

80
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>outside edge of the galaxy and this galaxy swimming in these galaxies.</v>

81
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>But it never really sunk in until the one mushroom trip where I'm like,</v>

82
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>you should really sort of wrap your head around like that.</v>

85
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>It goes that way forever.</v>

86
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.280
<v Speaker 1>It and that way forever.</v>

87
00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

88
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird,</v>

90
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>it's turtles all the way down.</v>

91
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>The DMT one was,</v>

92
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I always described Dmt as mushrooms,</v>

93
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:43.980
<v Speaker 1>times a million plus aliens,</v>

94
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.990
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

95
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.823
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

96
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>have you had much experience with Iowasca?</v>

97
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

98
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

99
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

100
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.741
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

101
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:51.574
<v Speaker 1>It's all been</v>

102
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>my business partner.</v>

103
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>The guy who makes the onyx stuff,</v>

104
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:04.280
<v Speaker 1>he's gone twice down to Peru now for seven,</v>

105
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.340
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

106
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>He was seven days of the time between three and four experiences.</v>

107
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:10.594
<v Speaker 1>It was seven days.</v>

108
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.810
<v Speaker 1>You've gone to Machu Picchu and too many times.</v>

109
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.953
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

110
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.803
<v Speaker 1>Have you been there?</v>

111
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.571
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

112
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got to see up.</v>

113
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Ever been.</v>

114
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.011
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>

115
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:21.844
<v Speaker 1>It's teaching</v>

116
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.870
<v Speaker 1>ancient ruins that I've ever been to.</v>

117
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.193
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>you're ahead of me there.</v>

119
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:27.761
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

120
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:31.970
<v Speaker 1>for some reason I never been to the Miami really,</v>

121
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>but I've been to the Inca ruins like probably six or seven times just because I</v>

122
00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>go down there so much.</v>

123
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of stuff down,</v>

124
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125

<v Speaker 1>both research and teaching and all that.</v>

127
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So what is your take on,</v>

128
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129

136
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>And fit it in the unusual like jigsaw puzzles spaces.</v>

137
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>They do that.</v>

138
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

139
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>What's your town?</v>

140

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know my,</v>

145
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>my opinion of,</v>

146
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean the other place you see that is sex,</v>

147
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.770
<v Speaker 1>a line item,</v>

148
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>which is the ruins complex outside Cusco.</v>

149
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Similar thing,</v>

150
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:17.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>rocks half the size of this room that had been moved around.</v>

152
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to take to it,</v>

153
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>but I will tell you one thing.</v>

154
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>A EMS bell,</v>

155
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Graham Hancock's work,</v>

156
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

157
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.231
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

158
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:30.380
<v Speaker 1>we've had him on the podcast,</v>

159
00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:31.214
<v Speaker 1>k he,</v>

160
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.360
<v Speaker 1>his writing so completely changed my perspective on that whole thing because I</v>

161
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>think he's right.</v>

162
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that the ink is,</v>

163
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>could not possibly have built,</v>

164
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of this in a hundred years,</v>

165
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.491
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

167
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:53.491
<v Speaker 1>the height of the Inca empire was basically from 1450 to 1515 and they say</v>

168
00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 1>before that there wasn't much,</v>

169
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>but I don't buy it.</v>

171
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

172
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:04.031
<v Speaker 1>his postulate is that the Incas didn't create all this money metal architecture.</v>

173
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>They sort of moved in that this came from a much more ancient civilization.</v>

174
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Possibly us back as far back as 15,000 years.</v>

175
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

176
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>not all of the ruins,</v>

177
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but some of them like,</v>

178
00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

180
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.460
<v Speaker 1>the sun gates at Lake Titicaca too,</v>

181
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.490
<v Speaker 1>when not go and talks about how if you look at it,</v>

182
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>it's astronomical orientations and all that.</v>

183
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>It's aligned with the,</v>

184
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.641
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

185
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>equal nautical points,</v>

187
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>as they were 15,000 years ago.</v>

190
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>I think his,</v>

191
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I think fingerprints of the gods,</v>

192
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>which I'm only about halfway through.</v>

193
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fascinating book.</v>

194
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:46.154
<v Speaker 1>You read it,</v>

195
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 1>it just throws the whole picture of archeology and to,</v>

196
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.670
<v Speaker 1>into question of you.</v>

198
00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>He's not a crazy remedied person.</v>

199
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>He's presenting evidence like these maps giving talks about in the first</v>

200
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:01.694
<v Speaker 1>chapter.</v>

201
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>This is not stuff that he's dreamed on.</v>

202
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>We'll also the geological evidence on the spanx.</v>

203
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.540
<v Speaker 1>That's another one I'll see a lodging company brings up the,</v>

204
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:10.721
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

205
00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:15.721
<v Speaker 1>the more recent studies have shown that there's a layer about at about 12,000</v>

206
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:22.091
<v Speaker 1>years where they repeatedly fine this glass that exists from nuclear explosions</v>

207
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>when they blow up nuclear bombs or from asteroidal impacts.</v>

208
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.281
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

209
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that a 12,000 years ago we were probably hit by a devastating meteor</v>

210
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 1>shower.</v>

211
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>They found that in the same level all across the world.</v>

213
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:34.214
<v Speaker 1>They found this.</v>

214
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 1>So it was like a global catastrophe and about 12,000 years.</v>

215
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:39.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's confirmed.</v>

216
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.820
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>

217
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>they've been finding this over and over and over again.</v>

218
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

219
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:47.261
<v Speaker 1>it only stands to reason that if we do have all these ancient tales of</v>

220
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic events and civilizations wiped out,</v>

221
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>that there must have been something and most likely we are,</v>

222
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:56.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

224
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:01.031
<v Speaker 1>we build and we fall in building astronomical events or global volcanic</v>

225
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>eruptions that that changed everything.</v>

226
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

227
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not implausible.</v>

228
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:07.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

229
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:08.331
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>

230
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

231
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to invoke miracles.</v>

232
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

233
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.360
<v Speaker 1>it's something that happened,</v>

234
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 1>but then somehow we,</v>

235
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

236
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why,</v>

237
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

238
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>archeology is another one of these things.</v>

239
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 1>It's in denial about this stuff.</v>

240
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.063
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

242
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

243
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 1>did you hear what they found about cheese?</v>

244
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.950
<v Speaker 1>They found that the more recent studies have shown that the,</v>

245
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:31.071
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

246
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>the oldest,</v>

247
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

248
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.130
<v Speaker 1>the carbon dating that are getting back from these,</v>

249
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.260
<v Speaker 1>cheesemaking,</v>

251
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.593
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are,</v>

252
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>pottery or whatever the fuck it is,</v>

253
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 1>7,000 years,</v>

254
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 1>they're making cheese 7,000 years ago.</v>

256
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>That's how it is.</v>

257
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.031
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

258
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:44.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

259
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

260
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>that's advanced stuff.</v>

261
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.450
<v Speaker 1>And when you add that to the,</v>

262
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.293
<v Speaker 1>the of the,</v>

263
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 1>the need previous notion has LX 6,000 years ago,</v>

264
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:54.450
<v Speaker 1>like Sumac,</v>

265
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>that was probably oldest thing we know.</v>

266
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Then they find,</v>

267
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.210
<v Speaker 1>go back to the topic,</v>

268
00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

269
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>As they're uncovering that and they don't for sure.</v>

270
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:02.150
<v Speaker 1>That's at least 14,000,</v>

271
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 1>14,000.</v>

272
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

273
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's entirely plausible.</v>

274
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not that far fetched to think that there may have been some,</v>

275
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

276
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Some contact with some extra terrestrials civilization.</v>

277
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

278
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you find this myth.</v>

279
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:21.980
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

280
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

281
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:22.561
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

282
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 2>everything that you're talking about necessarily,</v>

283
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure how you jumped from civilizations are older than we thought</v>

284
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.580
<v Speaker 2>to sexiness.</v>

285
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Other than that.</v>

286
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 1>But they all have this,</v>

288
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 1>this myth of [inaudible] and the Incas and the new world.</v>

289
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:40.470
<v Speaker 1>It's very culture,</v>

290
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

291
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

292
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
<v Speaker 1>of a superior being who puruse historically critical juncture and basically</v>

293
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.240
<v Speaker 1>civil license.</v>

294
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it possible that that superior being is some dude who grew up on the other</v>

295
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:55.860
<v Speaker 1>part of the world that had the mushrooms,</v>

296
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.830
<v Speaker 1>their whole culture evolves to a,</v>

297
00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 1>are radically higher level and then they get an boats and come over to these</v>

298
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 1>eight white people.</v>

299
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>They're still throwing sticks.</v>

300
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

301
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

302
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Shock my bag and my shows and go catch a cast and a couple of decades</v>

303
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.650
<v Speaker 1>work it out yourself.</v>

304
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

305
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.340
<v Speaker 1>They came back to the Incas slaughtering people know like,</v>

306
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.531
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

307
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you guys are doing it wrong.</v>

308
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

309
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.353
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

310
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

311
00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:24.241
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

312
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:29.230
<v Speaker 1>This is why we need to admit time travel so we can actually go back and verify</v>

313
00:10:29.231 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 1>it with just what the fuck was going on.</v>

314
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said something once,</v>

315
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:35.560
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the most I may may have been correct.</v>

316
00:10:35.561 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

317
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who it was,</v>

318
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:41.661
<v Speaker 1>but he said that one day the they're going to get to a point where computer</v>

319
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:47.181
<v Speaker 1>processing power is so incredible that you were going to be able to take you on</v>

320
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:52.401
<v Speaker 1>all of the data on all the variables of life and circumstances on this planet</v>

321
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.860
<v Speaker 1>and calculate those and go back in time based on what we have today and knowing</v>

322
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:00.870
<v Speaker 1>how fast cars are,</v>

323
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:02.670
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to burn gasoline,</v>

324
00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:05.940
<v Speaker 1>but all of these massive,</v>

325
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:10.941
<v Speaker 1>insane amount of data and literally be able to extrapolate what what happened in</v>

326
00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:13.620
<v Speaker 1>the past through some sort of a mathematical equation.</v>

327
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible for us to wrap our heads around now because we're just not there</v>

328
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:18.361
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

329
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:21.070
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it is establishing your from now 5,000 years to run,</v>

330
00:11:21.071 --> 00:11:26.071
<v Speaker 1>they literally will be able to at least go back in time and information way.</v>

331
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:27.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

332
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 1>this sounds,</v>

333
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.360
<v Speaker 1>this is similar to,</v>

334
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.053
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

335
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.030
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to say</v>

336
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.400
<v Speaker 1>it's the physics of your mortality or actually I was bragging to your formation.</v>

337
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.120
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

338
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 2>foundations like based on that idea,</v>

339
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:43.110
<v Speaker 2>except they use demographic to calculate what will happen.</v>

340
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

341
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm planning for our society,</v>

342
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

343
00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Based on these incredibly complex computer algorithms about here's the</v>

344
00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>demographics who see you count on next year's though social,</v>

345
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>we can</v>

346
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 1>predict what will happen,</v>

347
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 1>what will happen,</v>

348
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>but find this level of detail.</v>

349
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

350
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

351
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

352
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 1>frank ticklers work the physics of evil or chatting with Wifi.</v>

353
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:04.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

354
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.120
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>

355
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the name of that book.</v>

356
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

357
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.260
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

358
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

359
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had this idea that,</v>

360
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:10.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 1>computing power,</v>

362
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:13.340
<v Speaker 1>like he says like Chris,</v>

363
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>while computing power is exponentially increasing and that at some point it will</v>

364
00:12:20.091 --> 00:12:25.091
<v Speaker 1>be possible to simulate heaven and that you know,</v>

365
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

366
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 1>it will be essentially possible too.</v>

367
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:31.763
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

368
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.173
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

369
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:34.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

370
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.840
<v Speaker 1>to enter a simulated world,</v>

371
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

372
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.130
<v Speaker 1>that is the,</v>

373
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.790
<v Speaker 1>the world beyond death.</v>

374
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 1>That is the vision by the world's major religions.</v>

375
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.373
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

376
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:46.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

377
00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:51.600
<v Speaker 1>when at the end of time we will in fact all be resurrected into this says</v>

378
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:54.030
<v Speaker 1>computer simulations of ourselves.</v>

379
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Are you familiar with this?</v>

380
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Most recent,</v>

381
00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.440
<v Speaker 1>the idea of computer simulation theory,</v>

382
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.690
<v Speaker 1>but they have actually found this self repairing computer software.</v>

383
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>We coho repairing mathematical code and a,</v>

384
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.760
<v Speaker 1>the equations of a,</v>

385
00:13:10.761 --> 00:13:11.594
<v Speaker 1>a strength area</v>

386
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.013
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

387
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

388
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.380
<v Speaker 1>this guy was with the Neil degrasse Tyson had this,</v>

389
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:18.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

390
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.380
<v Speaker 1>interview with this physicist that's trying to explain it,</v>

391
00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:26.381
<v Speaker 1>but it was a type of self correcting computer code that they discovered in 1940</v>

392
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>or was invented and created in 1940.</v>

393
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Let me pull this up because I don't want you this</v>

394
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.730
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

395
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:53.910
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
