00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience I said on on on camera,</v>

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:08.541
<v Speaker 1>we had an email from somebody who said that his master could point pressure so</v>

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>they could knock you out.</v>

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I got a great story about Tulsa with Amir.</v>

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.441
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

6
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I looked into the camera.</v>

7
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.791
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

8
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

9
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>anybody in America you're watching right now,</v>

10
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>if you have a person who gets,</v>

11
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>who says that he can knock me out with a punch like it just pressing somewhere.</v>

12
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>We invite them,</v>

13
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>we pay him,</v>

14
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>we pay his trip.</v>

15
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>He can come on to show he can do it on camera on me.</v>

16
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>He can knock me out.</v>

17
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.851
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

18
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a no lose situation for me because if it works,</v>

19
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm signing up to do that stuff.</v>

20
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.361
<v Speaker 1>But I tell you,</v>

21
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna work.</v>

22
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.251
<v Speaker 1>We had this guy,</v>

23
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

24
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>a mirror progressive,</v>

26
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>mostly where my buddy,</v>

28
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

29
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>we see these guys on stage and the touch guys,</v>

30
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>So one guy goes this thick,</v>

32
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.903
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>

33
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>they just fall back.</v>

34
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy said,</v>

35
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>did you see his eyes roll back in his skill?</v>

36
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>That means you was for real.</v>

37
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>So I go to America,</v>

38
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be fun much this.</v>

39
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>So these guys,</v>

40
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>they come walking down after the.</v>

41
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.561
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

42
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:07.801
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

43
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>dude did to me.</v>

44
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do it to me.</v>

45
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

46
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.213
<v Speaker 1>God said,</v>

47
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>are you sure about that?</v>

48
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I show it to me.</v>

49
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:15.001
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

50
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:15.151
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

51
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to know how to feel it.</v>

53
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.161
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

54
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:17.581
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

55
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:18.414
<v Speaker 1>I could actually,</v>

56
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I got something better.</v>

57
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>So we already steered away from it,</v>

58
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.433
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>

60
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>let me show you this.</v>

61
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>And he walks over to his body,</v>

62
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>they start talking to each other and then he walks away and in the corner he</v>

63
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:31.434
<v Speaker 1>stands like this,</v>

64
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>like I mean crazy hiney run to his friend and he goes like this in emit air.</v>

65
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.510
<v Speaker 1>He stops and he flies on the ground.</v>

66
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>So he threw like Kung Fu forehands I didn't touch him.</v>

67
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.543
<v Speaker 1>Does it touch him?</v>

68
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.131
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

69
00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:51.964
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

70
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm sold.</v>

71
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.580

73
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take you right now.</v>

74
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.910
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to the corner.</v>

75
00:01:57.911 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

76
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

77
00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:00.640
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be a really angry.</v>

78
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

79
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.321
<v Speaker 1>excuse me?</v>

80
00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

81
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.011
<v Speaker 1>really angry.</v>

82
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it won't work.</v>

83
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I say your friend just did it right?</v>

84
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.371
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

85
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

86
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I think I can better egg then your friend.</v>

87
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.561
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>

88
00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in the zone.</v>

89
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Nobody will.</v>

90
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.661
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

91
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:10.791
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

92
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

93
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>because if it,</v>

94
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're not real angry,</v>

95
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.501
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>

96
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be that balance.</v>

97
00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>So I knew it was his way out.</v>

98
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.210
<v Speaker 1>So I walked over to him and I'm standing like this.</v>

99
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I say kick me into pills.</v>

100
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

101
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.670
<v Speaker 1>give me the.</v>

103
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I say I'm really fucking pissed.</v>

104
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.880
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to do it.</v>

105
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:28.714
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>

106
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

107
00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:32.290
<v Speaker 1>but they're idiots that truly believe that is true.</v>

108
00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>When</v>

109
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 2>you stop and think about what an actual football player today,</v>

110
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.130
<v Speaker 2>310 pound man who can run like,</v>

111
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 2>like literally like a track star of the 19 thirties,</v>

112
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 2>when you stop and think about the kind of damage they can do and you sort of</v>

114
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:52.460
<v Speaker 2>look towards the future and extrapolate a thousand years from now,</v>

115
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 2>2000 years now actually when this drastic changes happening just the last 50,</v>

116
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:56.781
<v Speaker 2>60 years,</v>

117
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:57.640
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelief.</v>

118
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the guys were a third larger</v>

119
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 3>than they used to be ingested 50 years,</v>

120
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 3>so you extrapolate that out.</v>

121
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.511
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

122
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 3>and of course there's genetic and physical limitations,</v>

123
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.720
<v Speaker 3>but as Jeanette,</v>

124
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.071
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

125
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 3>as nutrition improves and science improves and genetic engineering proves you're</v>

126
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 3>gonna wind up in the future pro sports a couple of centuries now.</v>

127
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Pro Sport you're not.</v>

128
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're not even going to look human.</v>

129
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna look like a different species.</v>

130
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.630
<v Speaker 3>That's how I came up with the idea for the book is I used to be.</v>

131
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 3>I used to do little stuff where espn when I was in college,</v>

132
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.080
<v Speaker 3>like manage the teams coming off the field or hold the dish and that kind of a</v>

133
00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

134
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 3>And I had was 126 pounds and Michigan,</v>

135
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Michigan State's at giant football game every year.</v>

136
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.653
<v Speaker 3>It's huge.</v>

137
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 3>ESPN is there and my producer,</v>

138
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Al Kilian,</v>

139
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the headset with him and he's gotten me bringing the teams out of the,</v>

140
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 3>out of their dressing room and then he starts screwing with me because I'm 19.</v>

141
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know any better and he's in my ears.</v>

142
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 3>And listen,</v>

143
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 3>if they don't come out at the right time,</v>

144
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 3>espn is going to lose $5,000,000 of advertising and that's gonna be on you.</v>

145
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.513
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

146
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 3>he was fucking with me because he could because I didn't know any better and I'm</v>

147
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:58.920
<v Speaker 3>like so stressed out and then let Michigan state out of the locker room at the</v>

148
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 3>point in time and all these giant human beings are coming out.</v>

149
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 3>And then as they're coming out,</v>

150
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.211
<v Speaker 3>they're running,</v>

151
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 3>walking by the door to the Michigan locker room,</v>

152
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.801
<v Speaker 3>Michigan.</v>

153
00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:09.720
<v Speaker 3>The door lock room door opens up and standing in the door.</v>

154
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:10.570

155
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 3>You ever heard of him?</v>

156
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

157
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.131
<v Speaker 3>He was six,</v>

158
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

159
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.233
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

160
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.060
<v Speaker 3>three 60.</v>

161

<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

162
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.203
<v Speaker 3>He was an,</v>

163
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.150
<v Speaker 3>it was a giant,</v>

164
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:16.984
<v Speaker 3>giant man.</v>

165
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Plus he's got all the gear on and I'm on and I'm like.</v>

166
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

167
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little tiny thing.</v>

168
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:21.971
<v Speaker 3>I'm freaking out.</v>

169
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

170
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.591
<v Speaker 3>Oh hell,</v>

171
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Michigan is going to come out.</v>

172
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

173
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 3>you don't let them come out of that locker room.</v>

174
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what you have to do.</v>

175
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 3>And so I.</v>

176
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 3>he's a giant.</v>

177
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 3>He's six foot eight.</v>

178
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm five eight.</v>

179
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm 125 pounds and I and he goes to step out and I just put my hand right right</v>

180
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 3>on the sternum.</v>

181
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 3>I just stiff arm and what stopped right there.</v>

182
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 3>You guys can't come out of that locker room yet and just</v>

183
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 3>he looked confused was like,</v>

184
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 3>who is this little person?</v>

185
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 3>And he managed to wait and all the guys were behind him and he mans wait just</v>

186
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 3>long enough for Michigan state to come out and then I got out of the way and</v>

187
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:56.014
<v Speaker 3>they came out,</v>

188
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 3>but I had.</v>

189
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I wrote the whole concept of the book and that one moment,</v>

190
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:01.940
<v Speaker 3>the whole gfl series I had my hand on this guy's here.</v>

191
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 3>My nose came up to his sternum and I remember thinking it's like he's a</v>

192
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 3>completely different species than me and that was an after that I went home and</v>

193
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 3>started writing that book.</v>

194
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Like what if we have different species playing football?</v>

195
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:12.701
<v Speaker 3>And the whole thing blew up.</v>

196
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:13.534
<v Speaker 3>From there.</v>

197
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.490
<v Speaker 3>People</v>

198
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.260
<v Speaker 4>feel about you taking off,</v>

199
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 4>going to America to let everybody know about them and then flying back again.</v>

200
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:21.420
<v Speaker 4>It means this.</v>

201
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.250
<v Speaker 4>This must be so bizarre for them.</v>

202
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

203
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what's crazy at first.</v>

204
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.230
<v Speaker 4>Every other night,</v>

205
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.590
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

206
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.580
<v Speaker 4>I've been to more than nine,</v>

207
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Speaker 4>but the last time I went I went to nine different tribes and of pygmies,</v>

208
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 4>a little nine villages.</v>

209
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.710
<v Speaker 4>Each one of them never seen a white dude before.</v>

210
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

211
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.140
<v Speaker 4>so that scares them.</v>

212
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.441
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

213
00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:42.450
<v Speaker 4>there'd be times that it would take an hour,</v>

214
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.430
<v Speaker 4>maybe even sometimes a little over an hour before someone in that tribe.</v>

215
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.360
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time it was always women or children that would finally come up to</v>

216
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:54.770
<v Speaker 4>me and touch me to make sure they don't go through me like I was a spirit or a</v>

217
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:55.770
<v Speaker 4>ghost of some sort.</v>

218
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

219
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 4>and then one person felt me and I'd play a game with them or something like</v>

220
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

221
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Then more would,</v>

222
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally come out from hiding behind trees,</v>

223
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.713
<v Speaker 4>come out from,</v>

224
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.831
<v Speaker 4>from the forest.</v>

225
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:07.431
<v Speaker 4>Whenever I come in,</v>

226
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they would flee,</v>

227
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:08.811
<v Speaker 4>run,</v>

228
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 4>cry kids like flailing on the ground,</v>

229
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

230
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 4>just freaked out by me.</v>

231
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

232
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 4>but whenever I'd make friends with them,</v>

233
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

234
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.540
<v Speaker 4>then they would ask me one thing every place that I want.</v>

235
00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 4>No nine tribes.</v>

236
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.091
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

237
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 4>they asked me will I help them have a voice?</v>

238
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.351
<v Speaker 4>That was the thing.</v>

239
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:24.621
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

240
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 4>we have no voice here.</v>

241
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 4>They're the only tribe not allowed to have their citizenship.</v>

242
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

243
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.090
<v Speaker 4>in Congo and like,</v>

244
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 4>so they have zero voice.</v>

245
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.613
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

246
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.620
<v Speaker 4>What a strange turn your life has taken that this is a,</v>

247
00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 4>you've gone from being on the house and the ultimate fighter,</v>

248
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

249
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 4>competing in the heavyweight version of the show to now live in a grass hut in</v>

250
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 4>the Congo.</v>

251
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.951
<v Speaker 4>What a,</v>

252
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:52.680
<v Speaker 4>that's a stranger alif hot rather strange journey.</v>

253
00:06:52.681 --> 00:06:53.031
<v Speaker 4>You're on,</v>

254
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:53.864
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

255
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

256
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.783
<v Speaker 4>To be honest,</v>

257
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't change it.</v>

258
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.041
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>

259
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>

260
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 5>booze was my savior because I was hanging out with a lot of dudes were doing</v>

261
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.374
<v Speaker 5>some serious,</v>

262
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 5>serious drugs,</v>

263
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.683
<v Speaker 5>bad drugs,</v>

264
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.300
<v Speaker 5>and my whole thing was I don't want to be 60 years old and not.</v>

265
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 5>So I always have this idyllic sort of retirement,</v>

266
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 5>which I'm trying to get to sooner rather than later.</v>

267
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 5>Now it's just like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He grew up in America,</v>

294
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:55.370

297
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 5>So he goes back to Greece to this little island in the middle of nowhere and he</v>

298
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 5>has to walk up this hill every day.</v>

299
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 5>He goes to talk to his buddies,</v>

300
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:04.791
<v Speaker 5>drinking the wine,</v>

301
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:08.120

<v Speaker 5>not even six weeks to live.</v>

307
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

308
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 5>and they said,</v>

309

<v Speaker 5>and there's no stress.</v>

318
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.770
<v Speaker 5>And he's walking up the hill every day and he's,</v>

319
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.640
<v Speaker 5>he's drinking wine with his buddies and he's eating the food from the,</v>

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sitting out there and I'm just blissing out unreality now.</v>

329
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 5>That's why I didn't get hooked to heroin.</v>

330
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 5>That's why I didn't get hooked to fucking crack.</v>

00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 5>That's why I didn't get hooked all the shit to my boys got hooked too.</v>

332
00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 5>Because I always thought to myself,</v>

333
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 5>if I fucking get hooked to this shit,</v>
