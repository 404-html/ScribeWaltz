00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.863
<v Speaker 1>Hello</v>

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.610
<v Speaker 2>bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.121
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad.</v>

4
00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Dad is a real sweeping brush that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from both sides like to use,</v>

5
00:00:07.781 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people in the right,</v>

6
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:09.784
<v Speaker 2>like do you use it on the liberals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The liberals like to use it on </v>

7
00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:12.694
<v Speaker 2>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like to paint people like real </v>

8
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put up,</v>

9
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in a box,</v>

10
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.390
<v Speaker 2>make sure we can categorize them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.313
<v Speaker 2>So mean.</v>

12
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I swear I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

13
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I got,</v>

14
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.333
<v Speaker 1>I think I might have accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>started a little bit of it because I </v>

15
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:25.464
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

16
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.423
<v Speaker 1>all you have to realize is there's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a disenfranchised part of America that </v>

17
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>feels like they're not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented.</v>

18
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>And then immediately I think Sarah got </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped on me and she was like,</v>

19
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the racist?</v>

20
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

21
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that I voted.</v>

22
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm not now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

23
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:41.394
<v Speaker 1>I voted for fucking Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just seconding what ha what I'm </v>

24
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>noticing out of an election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

25
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.951
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.784
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was good of her to stand </v>

27
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.314
<v Speaker 1>her ground and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to whole end just say her point and </v>

28
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>not tried to back pedal and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

29
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

30
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.034
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.923
<v Speaker 2>problem is the problem with that saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anybody that voted for trump is a </v>

32
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:00.021
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real,</v>

33
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:00.854
<v Speaker 2>the real problem with that is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only other alternative is Hillary </v>

34
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 2>and Hillary was very flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just the way it is.</v>

35
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

36
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.473
<v Speaker 2>it's not an anti woman thing to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone who has all the ties to </v>

37
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:13.784
<v Speaker 2>corruption that she apparently does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can go into it all day long </v>

38
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:17.264
<v Speaker 2>if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to like look at the Clinton </v>

39
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.443
<v Speaker 2>Foundation or any of the other crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that those people are involved </v>

40
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:23.540
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of legal,</v>

41
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.450
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really breaking any laws.</v>

42
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.280
<v Speaker 2>So like you can get away with doing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff,</v>

43
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 2>but all of it is learned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

44
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.313
<v Speaker 2>deleted emails and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why did you doing like what is </v>

45
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:34.870
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

46
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

47
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:36.994
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a large portion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America who just didn't want to share </v>

48
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:41.680
<v Speaker 1>their opinion cause they didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be called a name.</v>

49
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.030
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

50
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.790
<v Speaker 2>there's real concerns too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people don't want to say this.</v>

51
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 2>There's real concerns about her health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

52
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 2>She hurt her head in 2012 because she </v>
<v Speaker 2>blacked out.</v>

53
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she blacked out,</v>

54
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.610
<v Speaker 2>fell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fainted,</v>

55
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 2>and hit her head really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really bad.</v>

56
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.863
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently she was fucked up for like </v>

57
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:04.930
<v Speaker 2>six months and this was 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's only four years ago,</v>

58
00:02:04.931 --> 00:02:05.764
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really significant head </v>

59
00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:08.434
<v Speaker 2>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was very eloquent and the </v>

60
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:12.370
<v Speaker 2>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's really articulate.</v>

61
00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I thought she kicked his ass and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>debates,</v>

62
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I honestly did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought she came off smoother,</v>

63
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.643
<v Speaker 2>especially that second one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he would say some crazy shit and </v>

64
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:20.374
<v Speaker 2>she would smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought she handled it great and she </v>

65
00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 2>was so much more eloquent and so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

66
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.670
<v Speaker 2>so much more so much better economy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

67
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just,</v>

68
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.993
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to trust that she's telling you the </v>

69
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:35.344
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

70
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.303
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just too many things that she's </v>

71
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 2>been like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference between that Komi Guy,</v>

72
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:39.994
<v Speaker 2>what he said she had done with her email</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what she said she had done and you </v>

73
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:43.774
<v Speaker 2>play them back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen the video when they do </v>

74
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty shocking.</v>

75
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 2>You know what he says is very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>than her descriptions of what he says.</v>

76
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.963
<v Speaker 2>You know what he says is like she </v>
<v Speaker 2>violated some laws and what most people </v>

77
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 2>thought in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently in the FBI,</v>

78
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.473
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that people got </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset Komi apparently from this article </v>

79
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:01.384
<v Speaker 2>I read at least they were saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people in the FBI were very </v>

80
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 2>disappointed because they thought that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he should have pressed charges.</v>

81
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.253
<v Speaker 2>They thought that when they looked at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the evidence and all the stuff that </v>

82
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.004
<v Speaker 2>he talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he admitted that she had done that </v>

83
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it with classified data.</v>

84
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 2>She had violated all these laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you were a regular person,</v>

85
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.143
<v Speaker 2>if you were real regular enlisted person</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you violated those same amount of </v>

86
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:22.871
<v Speaker 2>loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

87
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 2>you'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would be fucked fill.</v>

88
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>They'll really puts you in a Goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>

89
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 2>100% looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this sounds silly,</v>

90
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 2>but she just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

91
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:32.051
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd like to see her emails,</v>

92
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 2>and then she just got rid of them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She deleted them all.</v>

93
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 2>She deleted 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>emails and she did it after a subpoena.</v>

94
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 2>At least some of them have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know it was after a subpoena to</v>

95
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 2>see how many find out how many emails </v>
<v Speaker 2>she deleted after the subpoena.</v>

96
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the absolute specifics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

97
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.294
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my point is it wasn't like she was </v>

98
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 2>this awesome alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.294
<v Speaker 2>so people that wanted change and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt like what Hillary represented is a </v>

100
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 2>part of that big system as well as she </v>
<v Speaker 2>says her words and is a stately,</v>

101
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:07.924
<v Speaker 2>she is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's a much better representative </v>

102
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 2>of America in some ways than he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's just too tied to corruption.</v>

103
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Like all of this stuff that she's done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the,</v>

104
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience she has in government,</v>

105
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 2>all that should be on her favor in her </v>
<v Speaker 2>favor.</v>

106
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.303
<v Speaker 2>But for a lot of people it wasn't this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time for a lot of people that would </v>

107
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:27.644
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this government is just too intertwined </v>

108
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 2>with these businesses that support it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pay it money and they,</v>

109
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.663
<v Speaker 2>they're going to all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign countries and getting paid </v>

110
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:36.904
<v Speaker 2>exorbitant sums of money to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Bill Clinton was getting like </v>

111
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 2>a half a million dollars to fly to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that are all these like,</v>

112
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.140
<v Speaker 2>like serious like civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>violations on,</v>

113
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 2>on their people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 2>There was like some thing that Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 2>had done.</v>

115
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.183
<v Speaker 2>We kept trying to push this one through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if he could find that there's this </v>

116
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:01.800
<v Speaker 2>one like dictatorship that he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go into it.</v>

117
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to go and do speeches and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

133
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 2>did you see that the Canadian website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the immigration website broke.</v>

134
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.430
<v Speaker 2>It crashed.</v>

138
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warm blankets like Seattle.</v>

139
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>It's basically just</v>

140
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>like Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seattle.</v>

141
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.780
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like weather wise is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>

142
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Probably identical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was something different about,</v>

143
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>about Vancouver that Seattle doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

144
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>What's that like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost like this,</v>

145
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like colonial,</v>

146
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>like richness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this European richness that,</v>

147
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:16.244
<v Speaker 1>do you know that bridge driving into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver was kind of big lions and </v>

<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

149
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:21.890

<v Speaker 1>this just looks like Lord of the Rings.</v>

150
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:24.590

<v Speaker 1>it looks like it could be in Germany and</v>

151
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>that everything's a little more lush or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little more overgrown.</v>

152
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see I like sad.</v>

153
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll love Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the downtown's look similar,</v>

154
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>but even still like the downtowns in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver,</v>

155
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>the food's always seems just a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit better than Seattle.</v>

211
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 2>gave his speech last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like the bully saying stop</v>

00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 2>hitting yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop hitting yourself.</v>

215
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 2>been like super inclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden he's like,</v>

252
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.230
<v Speaker 2>standup on unquestionably good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unquestionably good in every way.</v>

253
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

255
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good because he's going to do some </v>

256
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 2>goofy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to say some ridiculous things</v>

257
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 2>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it right now.</v>

258
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.760
<v Speaker 2>If someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you said something like,</v>

259
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I like to go up and grab them by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>posies,</v>

260
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 2>everyone would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

261
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 2>that has to be acceptable because half </v>
<v Speaker 2>of America is not offended by that.</v>

262
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 2>You seat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a believer in that.</v>

263
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.263
<v Speaker 2>The president in a lot of ways shapes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mindset of the country because it's </v>

264
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:07.530
<v Speaker 2>just a natural thing that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribes.</v>

265
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.723
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have one fierce tribal leader in </v>

266
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:11.844
<v Speaker 2>a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantee you the warriors that are in </v>

267
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:16.490
<v Speaker 2>that tribe will also be fierce because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll be under the guidance of the,</v>

268
00:11:16.491 --> 00:11:19.170
<v Speaker 2>the one wild fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

269
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:20.520
<v Speaker 2>that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

270
00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:22.680
<v Speaker 2>that's how like fierce armies get put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

271
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a bad ass fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

272
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when your president is this guy who </v>

273
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:31.530
<v Speaker 2>rarely gets riled up about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not emotional at all.</v>

274
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 2>He's super articulate and really well </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoken and he's a great orator.</v>

275
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.120
<v Speaker 2>That's Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

276
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you would think of when you </v>

277
00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:39.594
<v Speaker 2>think of like a presidential person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's probably the most presidential guy </v>

278
00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Speaker 2>we've ever had as president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you go with trump,</v>

279
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 2>like he's not doing that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>

280
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:52.020
<v Speaker 2>he's just rocking it at a totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>

281
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>100% yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's</v>

282
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 1>doing it like a businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fuck with him.</v>

283
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna fuck with you back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

284
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 1>you fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Stewart,</v>

285
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:04.861
<v Speaker 1>you pussy to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real name is Lima was one 30 in the</v>

286
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:06.004
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the kind of guy that can </v>

287
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking finance campaign for president </v>
<v Speaker 1>all on his own and when,</v>

288
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

289
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 1>A month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

290
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.463
<v Speaker 1>forget about whether you think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing for the country or bad thing </v>

291
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.313
<v Speaker 1>for the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be the greatest success story </v>

292
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.303
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be like the greatest upset of </v>

293
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 1>any contest ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

294
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no bigger upset ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

295
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you think the odds were </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Donald Trump first entered the race</v>

296
00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:35.944
<v Speaker 1>in Vegas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he would eventually become </v>

297
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 1>president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the odds were?</v>

298
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

299
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Seth Meyers State of the Union address </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

300
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:43.654
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump's here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump said he's voting as he's </v>

301
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 1>running as a Republican.</v>

302
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was running as a joke and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled over and I thought,</v>

303
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

304
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an idiot.</v>

305
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Hilde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could never be pres.</v>

306
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I literally thought he could never be </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

307
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>And then to think that that's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

308
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

309
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Has any celebrity other than um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Ronald Reagan,</v>

310
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan's one I was curious about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they said that,</v>

311
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was too young,</v>

312
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 1>but they were saying that despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that he had already been governor,</v>

313
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 1>cause that was like kind of like he who </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had been an office,</v>

314
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 1>they were shocked that anyone would vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Reagan.</v>

315
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 1>They thought he was a fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dude,</v>

316
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:27.094
<v Speaker 1>he destroyed Mondale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I look at those county by county </v>

317
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 1>polls where they show you what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>counties voted.</v>

318
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.140
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucking interesting cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

319
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Speaker 1>look at Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all red,</v>

320
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 1>but Cleveland's blue and like Columbus </v>
<v Speaker 1>is blue and Toledo's blue.</v>

321
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.440
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

322
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just outside the city,</v>

323
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 1>everyone's voting for trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the city,</v>

324
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 1>people are voting for the brewing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrat.</v>

325
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.590
<v Speaker 1>But you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Reagan's,</v>

326
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally it's all fucking red.</v>

327
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
