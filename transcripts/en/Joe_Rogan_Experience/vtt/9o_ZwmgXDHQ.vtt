<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you why.</v>

48
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.233
<v Speaker 1>When he was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was poor and he had to do manual </v>

49
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to work construction.</v>

50
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>He had to do everything with his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now that he has money,</v>

51
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>it reminds him of one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you asked him to do shit,</v>

52
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.113
<v Speaker 1>if you ask him to help you with a table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reminds him of when he was poor and </v>

53
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:14.064
<v Speaker 1>how awful it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a book once on power </v>

54
00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that they suggested is</v>

55
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>getting a manual labor job.</v>

56
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>That's when you have to move furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>When you got to carry couches upstairs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That'll never saw that.</v>

59
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.613
<v Speaker 1>I never saw anybody actually recommend </v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone do that in order to get </v>

60
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>my friend who we wrestled and played </v>
<v Speaker 1>football at a high level,</v>

63
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>they used to work the farm and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

64
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.253
<v Speaker 1>there was a thing where you would take </v>
<v Speaker 1>hay and you would run after the truck </v>

65
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.303
<v Speaker 1>trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll you take the hay and you throw it </v>

66
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>off and I guess you'd just doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

67
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 1>you can crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked construction one summer in,</v>

69
00:02:57.041 --> 00:02:57.874
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Washington dc in the 95 degree heat </v>

70
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>and I had to dig a foundation for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>building for a house,</v>

71
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.460
<v Speaker 1>just dig into the ground all day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we had to,</v>

72
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>we had to demolish a house and take that</v>
<v Speaker 1>debris,</v>

73
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.723
<v Speaker 1>put it into a truck and then drive it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a landfill called lot and I think and </v>

74
00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>then we would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we take it off the truck.</v>

75
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.943
<v Speaker 1>So that movement of digging and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the demolition and digging and </v>

76
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>piling it in a truck and then piling it </v>
<v Speaker 1>off a truck.</v>

77
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>You're too exhausted to do a goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

78
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.444
<v Speaker 1>You're not working out after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do work out and you get used to </v>

79
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:37.024
<v Speaker 1>it though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the idea is that your </v>

80
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>body becomes way more resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was saying.</v>

81
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.733
<v Speaker 1>If you could get a job because a mason </v>
<v Speaker 1>or some sort of manual labor on a </v>

82
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:46.060

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>He's a funny dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

120
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he was really funny on kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>

121
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>They did a kill Tony episode and Sinbad </v>
<v Speaker 1>side end is one of the um,</v>

122
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 1>the guest judges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.003
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a new guest every week and </v>

124
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.463
<v Speaker 1>they said he was killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to do to have been doing it for </v>

125
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got some tricks up their sleeve.</v>

126
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a real comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been around forever.</v>

127
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Been communicating with an audience for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time,</v>

128
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's just nice to meet him in it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that he's a nice guy.</v>

129
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys.</v>

130
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>You ever met anybody who was not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice?</v>

131
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.510
<v Speaker 1>If I did the wrong way maybe five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

132
00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I would have told you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.250
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

134
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.143
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why bring heat on someone from some </v>

135
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>weird moment that I probably could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done myself if I was true.</v>

136
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>If you've run into someone and you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong head space,</v>

137
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.033
<v Speaker 1>maybe you just got done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody yelled at you and maybe you </v>

138
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>have a business deal that went bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you got cut off on the highway.</v>

139
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>You never know when you're running into </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

140
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just we vary so much liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would like to encourage each other to</v>

141
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:05.624
<v Speaker 1>be on a good track all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we need a little bit more </v>

142
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness when someone does something </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

143
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call my next special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think bipolar ape because that is what</v>

144
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:15.854
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>

145
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.723
<v Speaker 1>We are men and if you stop and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>freeze frame on somebody when they're </v>

146
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.004
<v Speaker 1>having a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can catch them in any like that </v>

147
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:25.874
<v Speaker 1>whole spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human spectrum center in St and </v>

148
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:28.484
<v Speaker 1>anything in between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can catch them in a terrible moment </v>

149
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:31.424
<v Speaker 1>or a great moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't decide that that's what </v>

150
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 1>they are all the time and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing.</v>

151
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get to that.</v>

152
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>We quantify certain things that are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb,</v>

153
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain things you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

154
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>you're just not going to bounce back </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Rachel Dolezal thing,</v>

155
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.320
<v Speaker 1>which she pretended she was black but </v>
<v Speaker 1>trialist and black much.</v>

156
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.553
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's like those things where it </v>

157
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>becomes a nationwide thing and I bet </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a lovely lady.</v>

158
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

159
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.813
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be empathy gone wild or that </v>

160
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 1>might be sort of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

161
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.124
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of times everybody wants </v>

162
00:06:58.761 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 1>to be an individual.</v>

163
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.253
<v Speaker 1>They want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always been a problem with the </v>

164
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:02.151
<v Speaker 1>human condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be,</v>

166
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>you want to be unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all do,</v>

167
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though we all believe in equality,</v>

168
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.194
<v Speaker 1>we all want to be not equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to be a little better than the </v>

169
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 1>next guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least unique.</v>

170
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's maybe where competition comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from itself.</v>

171
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>But I think sometimes people negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that issue and that problem with a,</v>

172
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>with a very clumsy apparatus with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really weird way of doing it.</v>

173
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be trans racial or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>

174
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wear dishes in my ears and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

175
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>and literally cover my whole face with </v>
<v Speaker 1>tattoos.</v>

176
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Common.</v>

177
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:33.861
<v Speaker 1>There might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 1>That might be a better way to negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

179
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.470
<v Speaker 1>that problem you're having because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

180
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.733
<v Speaker 1>it's still pretty surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a look at the Hashtag face </v>

181
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>tattoo on instagram.</v>

182
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

183
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people get in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>face tattooed like it's like what?</v>

184
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow down.</v>

185
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to wanting to be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

186
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying makes a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sense in terms of like people wanting</v>

187
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.454
<v Speaker 1>to belong to a group that seems cool and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like black people seem like overall a </v>

188
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 1>cool group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

189
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you have good music behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a funny way of talking.</v>

190
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>They have all these amazing pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>

191
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:10.994
<v Speaker 1>They have a totally different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and you identify with that </v>

192
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Speaker 1>culture but you can't get in because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a white girl.</v>

193
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:16.094
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

194
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.953
<v Speaker 1>It's also something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think also there's a romance to when </v>

195
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you're on the outside looking in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>

196
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.423
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm being having been oppressed and </v>

197
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet you yet you triumph,</v>

198
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>yet you find a way to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet you find a way to be colorful,</v>

199
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 1>yet you find a way to be artistic.</v>

200
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Rap came from from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the South Bronx.</v>

201
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 1>While it was literally on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.900
<v Speaker 1>And rap is just one aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

203
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:42.734
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the very best stand up </v>

204
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the very best musicians.</v>

205
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Speaker 1>And we think of the percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population that's black,</v>

206
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:56.050
<v Speaker 1>12 percent the percentage that become </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite professional athletes mean what is</v>

207
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of NBA players that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>black?</v>

208
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It's something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it's also just.</v>

209
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 1>What is it you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

210
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:06.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean 69 personally.</v>

211
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Probably something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I said that number.</v>

212
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.683
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you a lot of it might be just also </v>

213
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:12.324
<v Speaker 1>that there are two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two avenues open to you in a </v>

214
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>lot of black communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least it's changing,</v>

215
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 1>but you know it was sports and music for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

216
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

217
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 1>That probably plays a part in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it,</v>

218
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:23.903
<v Speaker 1>but it's also there's a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary number of professional </v>

219
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:30.620
<v Speaker 1>athletes like elite athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 1>That just happened to be black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is that though?</v>

221
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Is it genetic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

222
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>is it the environment that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

223
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.144
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating thing to be explored </v>

224
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:44.910
<v Speaker 1>because for all this talk of racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just want to be really honest,</v>

225
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.243
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of African Americans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some pretty phenomenal genetic </v>

226
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>traits like fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Carl,</v>

227
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.430
<v Speaker 1>like think of like who's like Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was like the biggest freak all time?</v>

228
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:00.853
<v Speaker 1>A athlete basketball player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be probably the Bron Jim Bron </v>

229
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:04.630
<v Speaker 1>James Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

230
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.890
<v Speaker 1>And then you have Michael Jordan is </v>
<v Speaker 1>another freak athlete,</v>

231
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.753
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many of those guys like that </v>

232
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.393
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people would argue like Larry </v>

233
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a phenomenal shooter,</v>

234
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't the kind of freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>

235
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Lebron is Dr Jay Jordan would use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally fly,</v>

236
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:24.203
<v Speaker 1>fly through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a couple of guys that can do </v>

237
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:28.050
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have the overall.</v>

238
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

239
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you look at,</v>

240
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a book called the sports gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>that talks about this.</v>

241
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

242
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the most genetically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most genetically diverse part of the</v>

243
00:10:42.451 --> 00:10:43.284
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

244
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.153
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Africans from the bar for coast are </v>

245
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 1>totally different in the Africans from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from say the highlands of Kenya,</v>

246
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Africans from the Sudan,</v>

247
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>the Dinka and the new attend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost seven,</v>

248
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.270
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

249
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.223
<v Speaker 1>Certainly seven feet is not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncommon in many people don't realize </v>

250
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive Africa very much so.</v>

251
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Tunisia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morocco,</v>

252
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:06.290
<v Speaker 1>that's more Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

253
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.513
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

254
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 1>but then you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

255
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:09.680
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really,</v>

256
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's go to Ethiopia,</v>

257
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grow to an average height,</v>

258
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.210
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful people.</v>

259
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of trade and that side </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

260
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:17.950
<v Speaker 1>the Eritrea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dead.</v>

261
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Speaker 1>They've been renowned for their beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just step over the border,</v>

262
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.280
<v Speaker 1>just just go right to just one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one south or one north.</v>

263
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.680
<v Speaker 1>You are going into Sudan and south </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sudan,</v>

264
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 1>tallest people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talls people in the world.</v>

265
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.743
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them can be like a fist off at </v>

266
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:33.684
<v Speaker 1>eight feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where like new bowl and those </v>

267
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 1>people came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

268
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.260
<v Speaker 1>if you go just another country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one more country east,</v>

269
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.390
<v Speaker 1>now you're in the Congo and that's home </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the pygmy.</v>

270
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.210
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the shortest people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world in one country and then just cross</v>

271
00:11:46.211 --> 00:11:47.044
<v Speaker 1>the border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the tallest in the world in that </v>

272
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:50.880
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Africa is insanely diverse.</v>

273
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the athletes with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most explosive power,</v>

274
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.113
<v Speaker 1>and if you like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that includes the fast people in the </v>

275
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:59.000
<v Speaker 1>world who are in Jamaica and who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

276
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>

277
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.620
<v Speaker 1>genetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can trace them back to a very primal</v>

278
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 1>marilee.</v>

279
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.303
<v Speaker 1>You can trace them back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small part of Africa according to </v>

280
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 1>this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sports gene,</v>

281
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.920
<v Speaker 1>which is the Africa most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

282
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 1>and so that is where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you'll see the fastest,</v>

283
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 1>most explosive people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

284
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear it deion sanders talking,</v>

285
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 1>watching this white running back 215 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

286
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 1>He ran a four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

287
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>5:40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

288
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't say this on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can run,</v>

289
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>

290
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.313
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

291
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>And it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

292
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 1>you haven't seen a white guy run a four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

293
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 1>five in forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty rare.</v>

294
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be some Viking genes </v>
<v Speaker 1>floating room.</v>

295
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.013
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>

296
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.863
<v Speaker 1>there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any black </v>

297
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.350
<v Speaker 1>quarterbacks in the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarterbacks cornerbacks.</v>

298
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.273
<v Speaker 1>It's just fascinating when you stop and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about just the sheer number of </v>

299
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 1>people involved in professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletics,</v>

300
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 1>the sheer number of people that make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>living playing a game with their body.</v>

301
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if that kind of </v>

302
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 1>athleticism helps you become a champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>in tennis.</v>

303
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different.</v>

304
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Depends on the sport and sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific.</v>

305
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:04.481
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

306
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:05.314
<v Speaker 1>I mean first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people historically have not been </v>

307
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 1>into tennis because they didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

308
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:10.294
<v Speaker 1>It's Arthur Ashe was obviously Athena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Arthur Ashe was like way before </v>

309
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:16.001
<v Speaker 1>they're telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

310
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:19.420
<v Speaker 1>So he was like the groundbreaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how many mean now?</v>

311
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of kids growing up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice communities,</v>

312
00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 1>they have tennis clubs and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

313
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.390
<v Speaker 1>African American kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's less a thing of that culture.</v>

314
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 1>The thing like there's not a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian American tennis players either.</v>

315
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my people don't play tennis,</v>

316
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.860
<v Speaker 1>they don't get into tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an economic thing.</v>

317
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:40.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just a cultural of the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.330
<v Speaker 1>So when you see all these like world </v>
<v Speaker 1>class tennis players,</v>

319
00:13:43.331 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 1>it just happened to be of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.830
<v Speaker 1>rich upper crease coach.</v>

321
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 1>You need a lot of stuff with tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

322
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.583
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot going on at tennis plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody gives a shit until you're really </v>

323
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

324
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:56.820
<v Speaker 1>like if you're kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a chance,</v>

325
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 1>holy plays a Semipro ball for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh maybe we'll get into the big leagues,</v>

326
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't,</v>

327
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 1>if you like obviously my pro tennis </v>
<v Speaker 1>player get a fucking job,</v>

328
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

329
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 1>You playing tennis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time.</v>

330
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I used to know this dude who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional racquetball player and that</v>

331
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>was the grind nerdiest of all grinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I was 19 I recognize like,</v>

332
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:17.643
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude done painted himself into a </v>

333
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a world champion.</v>

334
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:23.940
<v Speaker 1>It's something nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cares dude.</v>

335
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people would treat him like,</v>

336
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor guy.</v>

337
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Like that was part of it.</v>

338
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.463
<v Speaker 1>It was like he's awesome but poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I feel like way when I watched the </v>

339
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:35.860
<v Speaker 1>biathlon picks and shit or curling or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

340
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:36.694
<v Speaker 1>the sports will curling is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't talk shit about curling in </v>

341
00:14:38.731 --> 00:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Newfoundland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go up there and Canada,</v>

342
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 1>they get fucking angry at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

343
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.893
<v Speaker 1>They get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't care that you replayed the </v>

344
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 1>curling move in slow motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't miss it in regular motion.</v>

345
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just certain sports.</v>

346
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think their skills are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

347
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

348
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.383
<v Speaker 1>how to races,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to racist deal with the fact that </v>

349
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 1>there's so many elite black athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

350
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Because you just look at it and how do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see white superiority in that many.</v>

351
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard guys in New York,</v>

352
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:15.950
<v Speaker 1>white guys would always say this about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about I'd hear white dudes in there talk</v>

353
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>about black and white athletes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

354
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.080
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's brother.</v>

355
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.890
<v Speaker 1>So obviously he's going to be faster and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

356
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:22.724
<v Speaker 1>but this kid over here has got heart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got smarts and then so like guys </v>

357
00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Speaker 1>who apparently got heart brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the black guy only has muscle.</v>

358
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:32.150
<v Speaker 1>It was a clear indication that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

359
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 1>it was such a racist kind of way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>delineating,</v>

360
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:35.834
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's also delusional because people </v>

361
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:40.250
<v Speaker 1>want to assume that because someone has </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical attributes,</v>

362
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:42.620
<v Speaker 1>they don't have mental attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always want to say that.</v>

363
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.633
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's true because </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when you have physical </v>

364
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 1>attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is easier for you and you get soft.</v>

365
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.053
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to work as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the more impressive guys in </v>

366
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:53.924
<v Speaker 1>the UFC for me has always been Frankie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Edgar because that guy's just a product </v>

367
00:15:57.381 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 1>of hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never been a knockout puncher.</v>

368
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.060
<v Speaker 1>He's not the biggest guys always in </v>
<v Speaker 1>small for whatever division.</v>

369
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.730
<v Speaker 1>He's in a small 55 and he's pretty small</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 45 in comparison to some guys like,</v>

370
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ortega,</v>

371
00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:10.280
<v Speaker 1>we fought this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

372
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Brian's much bigger than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taller,</v>

373
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:12.884
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just all heart and will and </v>

374
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:16.094
<v Speaker 1>toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

375
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.163
<v Speaker 1>and I love that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's an admirable thing </v>

376
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 1>and I think you can get out a lot at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington guy like that,</v>

377
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:22.963
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that a guy can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that mindset and also have some </v>

378
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.800
<v Speaker 1>fucking ray Lewis body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well man,</v>

379
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.080
<v Speaker 1>it's my turn was the example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody and coby Brian was saying,</v>

380
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.060
<v Speaker 1>nobody works harder and that's why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

381
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 1>they love to win in the almost psychotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

382
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Extreme winters are that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

383
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.553
<v Speaker 1>That whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that extreme winters is why we're here </v>

384
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:46.160
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why it's so compelling.</v>

385
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

386
00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:47.904
<v Speaker 1>you had to have some godly resolve to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get through the Mongol era and the </v>

387
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:53.414
<v Speaker 1>fucking caveman era and think about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different shit that's happened in </v>

388
00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:57.710
<v Speaker 1>between it.</v>

389
00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Just think about the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonized this country.</v>

390
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.343
<v Speaker 1>We were so far removed from people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived here and rode wagons across the </v>

391
00:17:07.041 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 1>country just 200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that just happened.</v>

392
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.040
<v Speaker 1>They did this study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

393
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:12.913
<v Speaker 1>Camille Paglia was talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why were most of the people that </v>

394
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:18.610
<v Speaker 1>revolutionized the human condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>

395
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.240
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

396
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.133
<v Speaker 1>the printing press and Einstein and </v>
<v Speaker 1>copernicus and Galileo and Kepler and </v>

397
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 1>all these people that Kinda like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

398
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why,</v>

399
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:31.330
<v Speaker 1>why so few women and so a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic circles will.</v>

400
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.253
<v Speaker 1>The only single variable answer is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>women were kept down by the Patriarchy </v>

401
00:17:36.591 --> 00:17:38.780
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be very condescending though if</v>

402
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:39.614
<v Speaker 1>you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that would suggest that women </v>

403
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:41.960
<v Speaker 1>didn't find their way through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cracks.</v>

404
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:42.794
<v Speaker 1>Some of them did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part and then there's </v>

405
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>some truth to that.</v>

406
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:45.883
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another really interesting </v>

407
00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 1>theory that men have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men and women tend to have two different</v>

408
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 1>kinds of brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've evolved that do different.</v>

409
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:52.404
<v Speaker 1>Brian's because women have to watch out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for children and pay attention to the </v>

410
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:56.964
<v Speaker 1>minutia and keep them away from death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas men have the kind of brand that </v>

411
00:18:00.171 --> 00:18:01.004
<v Speaker 1>can obsess over just one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it doesn't really bare any </v>

412
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:04.434
<v Speaker 1>relation to the material world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can think about whether time </v>

413
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:10.510
<v Speaker 1>bends or whether they the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between time and matter and</v>

414
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

415
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.223
<v Speaker 1>and they'll just delta zero in on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and obsessed over that problem </v>

416
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 1>and you have those extreme winners that </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally to the exclusion of everything</v>

417
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:22.050
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including their family,</v>

418
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:23.230
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 1>other people focused on just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in a lot of ways,</v>

420
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.910
<v Speaker 1>thank God we had that aberration because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what revolutionizes,</v>

421
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:32.783
<v Speaker 1>that is what changes a lot about how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>live a little explosions that make this </v>

422
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:37.110
<v Speaker 1>thing move quicker there.</v>

423
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 1>The combustion inside the engine that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>human civilization.</v>

424
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then you get someone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just is an outlier.</v>

425
00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:43.524
<v Speaker 1>So Elon musk characters drilling holes </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the Los Angeles and building </v>

426
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:48.600
<v Speaker 1>fucking power stations from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for solar power.</v>

427
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 1>For People's houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

428
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Make it fucking cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's never going to work.</v>

429
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.570
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to work.</v>

430
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

431
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.440
<v Speaker 1>He's just so much smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We let them drill under the city.</v>

432
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Will it go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing.</v>

433
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.343
<v Speaker 1>Everybody just lets him do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine if like a regular person </v>

434
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.910
<v Speaker 1>wanted to drill underneath the cities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make tubes and put,</v>

435
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 1>they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the dumbest idea ever.</v>

436
00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.613
<v Speaker 1>And it dropped down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A car is going to go on a train and the </v>

437
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 1>train is going to go really fast with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car underground.</v>

438
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should have this guy,</v>

439
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Keenan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast.</v>

440
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.133
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called how to fix the </v>

441
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:21.024
<v Speaker 1>future and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a book called the Internet's not </v>

442
00:19:23.551 --> 00:19:24.560
<v Speaker 1>the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

443
00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.870
<v Speaker 1>and another book called the call to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amateur and kind of like in the culture,</v>

444
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 1>the Amatory Lichens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

445
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infinite monkey metaphor.</v>

446
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

447
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

448
00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:34.314
<v Speaker 1>So if you had an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys just banging away at a </v>

449
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.810
<v Speaker 1>typewriter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually one of them would,</v>

450
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.190
<v Speaker 1>would type out a masterpiece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shakespearian play or something.</v>

451
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Just randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just randomly.</v>

452
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:43.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you know,</v>

453
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 1>if that was real and it would end </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically,</v>

454
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you can prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it mathematically,</v>

455
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:50.130
<v Speaker 1>but I still call bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

456
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

457
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.573
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the odds that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>randomly this monkey on just accident </v>

458
00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.423
<v Speaker 1>put the periods in the right place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spaces in the right place and the </v>

459
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:03.180
<v Speaker 1>commas in the right place?</v>

460
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

461
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is part of the last chance.</v>

462
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Last chance can suck a fat dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it.</v>

463
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.723
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it before by people far </v>

464
00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:15.330
<v Speaker 1>smarter than me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

465
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.283
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's zero chance raises an amazing </v>

466
00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:19.734
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

467
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing is it's like human beings</v>

468
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.420
<v Speaker 1>can actually reach beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they can measure human beings.</v>

469
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just what you can see and </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure.</v>

470
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.600
<v Speaker 1>It's actually what you can imagine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you can imagine actually is real.</v>

471
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of reality and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

472
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said that these infinite monkeys,</v>

473
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.140
<v Speaker 1>that's basically what youtube and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet has ushered in.</v>

474
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But long story short,</v>

475
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about Elon Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about how in his book</v>

476
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.843
<v Speaker 2>had a fixed future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nine tech billionaires of the nine </v>

477
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:52.564
<v Speaker 2>tech billionaires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they own more wealth than one point 8 </v>

478
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:57.963
<v Speaker 2>billion people on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've actually never seen this kind of </v>

479
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:01.260
<v Speaker 2>concentration of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

480
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Luckily guys like Jeff Bezos who he </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows really well and uh,</v>

481
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these other guys like Mark Zuckerberg </v>

482
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>are kind of aware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have some historical perspective of</v>

483
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:13.294
<v Speaker 2>where they stand and for the most part </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing their best to try to </v>

484
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:19.390
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to be responsible with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this wealth.</v>

485
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 2>There's also the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from a tech background,</v>

486
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 2>which has historically been really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking smart people.</v>

487
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the innovators.</v>

488
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 2>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more left leaning.</v>

489
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is probably for what,</v>

490
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.310
<v Speaker 2>it's just the whole tech community is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more left leaning.</v>

491
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why any,</v>

492
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 2>anything that deviates from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of punished.</v>

493
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.503
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem though is that now you have </v>

494
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 2>the four riders of the apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>

495
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:48.730
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon,</v>

496
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.490
<v Speaker 2>and apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much that,</v>

497
00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of co they have,</v>

498
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.400
<v Speaker 2>they had access to all your data and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the maps.</v>

499
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 2>So it does kind of go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of go,</v>

500
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your left leaning,</v>

501
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:03.790
<v Speaker 2>but there has never been this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration of power.</v>

502
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:04.923
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not doing anything with the </v>

503
00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:06.964
<v Speaker 2>power that we know of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would they do have is tremendous </v>

504
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:12.760
<v Speaker 2>wealth like off the charts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous wealth at apple,</v>

505
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:13.743
<v Speaker 2>at Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just have tremendous amount </v>

506
00:22:15.881 --> 00:22:19.480
<v Speaker 2>of influence and I think when you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of money,</v>

507
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.373
<v Speaker 2>like idealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippie leftwing dreamers are way better </v>

508
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:23.674
<v Speaker 2>off like throwing that money around then</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really gangster globalists that </v>

509
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:29.740
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

510
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.573
<v Speaker 2>pro war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really enthusiastic about right wing </v>

511
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:35.530
<v Speaker 2>politics like that will be way scarier </v>
<v Speaker 2>if all that money,</v>

512
00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:36.364
<v Speaker 2>the billions of dollars was in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cristiana cult that thought that the </v>

513
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.600
<v Speaker 2>second coming was going to happen in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerusalem.</v>

514
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 2>So it was very important to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel,</v>

515
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.323
<v Speaker 2>which is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people in this country </v>

516
00:22:45.611 --> 00:22:46.444
<v Speaker 2>that want to protect Israel because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's where Jesus is pit stop </v>

517
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:50.300
<v Speaker 2>when it comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

518
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.910
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do worry about.</v>

519
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:52.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should worry about very religious </v>

520
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with,</v>

521
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.120
<v Speaker 2>with a messianic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

522
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real thing today.</v>

523
00:22:58.811 --> 00:23:03.811
<v Speaker 2>So I think like secular tended reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>based techno freaks who I might disagree</v>

524
00:23:04.361 --> 00:23:05.194
<v Speaker 2>with them on some of the most ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>asks a ridiculous aspects of </v>

525
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.053
<v Speaker 2>progressivism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just go so far off the charts </v>

526
00:23:12.611 --> 00:23:13.444
<v Speaker 2>and it's so common now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is getting so hysterical about </v>

527
00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know Christina Hoff sommers is.</v>

528
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.210
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's great.</v>

529
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:20.044
<v Speaker 2>She's got love her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got literally shouted down </v>

530
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:23.110
<v Speaker 2>offstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They interrupted her speech,</v>

531
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:25.410
<v Speaker 2>they put up signs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't let her talk through.</v>

532
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 2>We're calling her a fascist where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound really confident in their point of</v>

533
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:28.730
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

534
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:29.563
<v Speaker 2>It's just so pleased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they don't engage somebody in ideas </v>

535
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.300
<v Speaker 2>a shout them down because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified.</v>

536
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing also is they're </v>

537
00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:36.514
<v Speaker 2>getting on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's all these videos of them </v>

538
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.830
<v Speaker 2>being woke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag woke expressing their wokeness.</v>

539
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard that expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you have.</v>

540
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just talking about it.</v>

541
00:23:45.081 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a gross</v>

542
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.903
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it comes down to what I was </v>

543
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.033
<v Speaker 1>amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm amazed at is I've talked to </v>

544
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:53.210
<v Speaker 1>some of these far left ideologues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

545
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.673
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially the people that would </v>

546
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:57.730
<v Speaker 1>shout down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christine Summers,</v>

547
00:23:57.731 --> 00:23:58.564
<v Speaker 1>who is such a reason voice in such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important voice to smart and let her </v>

548
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:06.130
<v Speaker 1>talk and then if you disagree with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a conversation with you.</v>

549
00:24:06.131 --> 00:24:06.964
<v Speaker 1>Are they typically do a q and a at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of these speeches that's just rude </v>

550
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.600
<v Speaker 1>to her with your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's a feminist for fucking podcast</v>

551
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 1>is called progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actual feminist.</v>

552
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.223
<v Speaker 1>That's what her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her thing is her video series that she </v>

553
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 1>does now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's an important person,</v>

554
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.100
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not an anti woman in any way,</v>

555
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.900
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not the female.</v>

556
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to her and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wrote that book,</v>

557
00:24:31.191 --> 00:24:32.690
<v Speaker 1>the war on boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

558
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 1>she's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's excellent.</v>

559
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:35.503
<v Speaker 1>But I think a lot of this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I noticed is that a </v>

560
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:41.990
<v Speaker 1>lot of the left wing idiot logs at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all are fairly young.</v>

561
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:42.853
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times they don't have a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of experience in the world or you </v>

562
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:49.160
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are people who are like,</v>

563
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:49.994
<v Speaker 1>if you just take the average journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've met a lot of them now and talk </v>

564
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average journalist,</v>

565
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:54.614
<v Speaker 1>even the average academic in colleges or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the people that are kind of </v>

566
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.620
<v Speaker 1>controlling this conversation in certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects,</v>

567
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:02.323
<v Speaker 1>they have just not really ever met </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody or worked with anybody that </v>

568
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:09.183
<v Speaker 1>worked with their hands that he spends a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time that had to be in the </v>

569
00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:15.900
<v Speaker 1>military that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

570
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.080
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be pretty cloistered,</v>

571
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

572
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.853
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even even Sam Harris by his own </v>

573
00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:23.660
<v Speaker 1>admission said that in his Rolodex of </v>
<v Speaker 1>1100 people,</v>

574
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 1>he only had one friend who smoked.</v>

575
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.640
<v Speaker 1>And that was Christopher hitchens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That significant.</v>

576
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:33.790
<v Speaker 1>It's significant when you are exposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>one element of society.</v>

577
00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:35.003
<v Speaker 1>And one of the advantages that I think a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic has when you travel so much is </v>

578
00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:41.450
<v Speaker 1>that you're around real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that work with their hands,</v>

579
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.700
<v Speaker 1>people to do other things that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the military,</v>

580
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:45.260
<v Speaker 1>people that are cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are,</v>

581
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:50.120
<v Speaker 1>that are essentially a huge part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabric of this side who are on the right</v>

582
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.013
<v Speaker 1>on uncertainty on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you start to realize is that </v>

583
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

584
00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.820
<v Speaker 1>the world is way more complicated as is </v>
<v Speaker 1>always the way it is,</v>

585
00:25:58.821 --> 00:26:00.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just way more complicated.</v>

586
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:02.220
<v Speaker 1>People are way less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

587
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to pigeonhole there.</v>

588
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.233
<v Speaker 1>Just because you supported trump doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily mean you are right winner </v>

589
00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.890
<v Speaker 1>across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you're,</v>

590
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the patriarchy and stuff.</v>

591
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.033
<v Speaker 1>And I find that a lot of young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I find a lot of people who are </v>

592
00:26:15.711 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 1>trying to be woke and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we do this as Americans.</v>

593
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the right.</v>

594
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:23.270
<v Speaker 1>We do this as Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to find a bad guy and we want to</v>

595
00:26:23.271 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 1>put a label on that bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want a single variable answer.</v>

596
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.040
<v Speaker 1>We want a single variable solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

597
00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are racist,</v>

598
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.330
<v Speaker 1>you are a sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a homophobe,</v>

599
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.390
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to be sanctioned and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to get rid of you.</v>

600
00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 1>And if we can get rid of racism as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism has a and do with it.</v>

601
00:26:42.261 --> 00:26:43.094
<v Speaker 1>Actually it's about tribalism because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't need a difference in skin </v>

602
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:46.164
<v Speaker 1>color to hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of the Middle East or </v>

603
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Africa or even this country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the melanin in your skin,</v>

604
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.980
<v Speaker 1>it's just we're tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

605
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 1>but we tend to want to find that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>label.</v>

606
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.650
<v Speaker 1>You're a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a homophobe bibles.</v>

607
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Most certainly racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

608
00:27:02.461 --> 00:27:03.460
<v Speaker 1>of course there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You beat.</v>

609
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't think racism is the problem that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're facing.</v>

610
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:06.294
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more of a tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that if everybody was the same </v>

611
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:09.990
<v Speaker 1>color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have no problem,</v>

612
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joining groups and hitting each other.</v>

613
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

614
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you see the Middle East,</v>

615
00:27:14.611 --> 00:27:16.420
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

616
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Yuval Harari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism is just a symptom of that.</v>

617
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.143
<v Speaker 1>You Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harare's a great book sapiens and </v>

618
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 1>everybody should read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read it on your recommendation.</v>

619
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.830
<v Speaker 1>If the Dinka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dinka and the Nuer and the Sudan,</v>

620
00:27:28.831 --> 00:27:30.780
<v Speaker 1>let's just take them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look exactly the same.</v>

621
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Just Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have an exact,</v>

622
00:27:32.011 --> 00:27:33.130
<v Speaker 1>just racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

623
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.360
<v Speaker 1>They like saying all black people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same.</v>

624
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look,</v>

625
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:38.461
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

626
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:38.831
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

627
00:27:38.831 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 1>they are basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

628
00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.160
<v Speaker 1>they are they the only way to tell them </v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference is the tribal markings.</v>

629
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.980
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look exactly the same.</v>

630
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Very similar cultures or hurting </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

631
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.930
<v Speaker 1>A Dinka and the Dinka language means </v>
<v Speaker 1>people knew in the new,</v>

632
00:27:53.931 --> 00:27:56.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>language means original people.</v>

633
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're sworn enemies.</v>

634
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 1>They fucking hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to justin ran about.</v>

635
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:02.664
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ta Talk to Justin Wren about how the </v>

636
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.000
<v Speaker 1>pygmies are treated in the country right</v>
<v Speaker 1>next door.</v>

637
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.103
<v Speaker 1>They're brutally discriminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't even go to hospitals or </v>

638
00:28:12.361 --> 00:28:15.150
<v Speaker 1>schools because they're short and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're magic apparently.</v>

639
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.670
<v Speaker 1>So go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ain't about color.</v>

640
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 1>We don't need color to hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't.</v>

641
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.443
<v Speaker 1>We would find something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be neighborhoods or lines in </v>

642
00:28:23.881 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 1>the dirt or sports teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yes.</v>

643
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.593
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we mean we hate each other from </v>

644
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 1>neighboring high schools in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

645
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.420
<v Speaker 1>We compete with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a good,</v>

646
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 1>good natured competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that either.</v>

647
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.163
<v Speaker 1>There's a natural need that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete against each other and conquer </v>

648
00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:41.514
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because we used to do that </v>

649
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.870
<v Speaker 1>exclusively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

650
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:45.803
<v Speaker 1>That's how people move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this Viking show is all </v>

651
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:50.430
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People coming into peoples' villages,</v>

652
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 1>fucking them up and taken all their gold</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>

653
00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 1>that's what people did forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yes,</v>

654
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the other thing.</v>

655
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.460
<v Speaker 1>It's really taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so fucking taboo.</v>

656
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Even say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what are you going to risk something</v>

657
00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:04.323
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the narrative is those people aren't </v>

658
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:08.274
<v Speaker 1>doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just take any group of people </v>

659
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.190
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

660
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Because they've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only one answer to that.</v>

661
00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.310
<v Speaker 1>They've been put down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They been oppressed,</v>

662
00:29:17.311 --> 00:29:18.750
<v Speaker 1>they've been suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

663
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

664
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:21.743
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can tell me you don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of this country unless you </v>

665
00:29:24.181 --> 00:29:27.270
<v Speaker 1>studied the black experience at least a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit because that is.</v>

666
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:31.590
<v Speaker 1>That is such a huge part of the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this country and to be a black person</v>

667
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 1>in this country is not something I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>no idea about,</v>

668
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.750
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't been easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Granted,</v>

669
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 1>let's just take any ethnic group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were to ever like Thomas Soul,</v>

670
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.813
<v Speaker 1>who's a black scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were ever to bring up the idea </v>

671
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:50.941
<v Speaker 1>that maybe part of the problem in </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain groups,</v>

672
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't doing well,</v>

673
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.880
<v Speaker 1>could be internal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be of their own making,</v>

674
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 1>could be that there are certain aspects </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that person's culture,</v>

675
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 1>whether they're in Hewitt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're Mexican,</v>

676
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:07.180
<v Speaker 1>whether they're black or whether they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hillbilly white guy.</v>

677
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.960
<v Speaker 1>If you start talking about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>their culture and the way they.</v>

678
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Their belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

679
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.340
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

680
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Speaker 1>their practices could have something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with why they're not getting ahead.</v>

681
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.853
<v Speaker 1>You better be damn careful because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're blaming the victim because it is </v>

682
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:24.320
<v Speaker 1>true that,</v>

683
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.153
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really necessarily blaming </v>

684
00:30:26.721 --> 00:30:27.411
<v Speaker 2>the victim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

685
00:30:27.411 --> 00:30:28.244
<v Speaker 2>Because the victim in this case is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's a part of a culture and </v>

686
00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:31.934
<v Speaker 2>we're all influenced by our environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you were involved in a culture </v>

687
00:30:35.031 --> 00:30:35.864
<v Speaker 2>that has very specific ways of behaving </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're supposed to engage in these </v>

688
00:30:38.511 --> 00:30:43.220
<v Speaker 2>and whether it's a know female genital </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutilation that they do to children on a</v>

689
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.320
<v Speaker 2>regular basis in some parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

690
00:30:45.321 --> 00:30:46.370
<v Speaker 2>like why did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

691
00:30:46.371 --> 00:30:48.500
<v Speaker 2>they've just been doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they've been doing that.</v>

692
00:30:48.501 --> 00:30:49.334
<v Speaker 2>So they just keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of weird things that </v>

693
00:30:51.111 --> 00:30:53.900
<v Speaker 2>people just get sucked into and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even realize what you're doing.</v>

694
00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.610
<v Speaker 2>You're 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live in that life.</v>

695
00:30:55.611 --> 00:30:56.444
<v Speaker 2>Then it becomes a part of your pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>or behavior and then when you're 35 and </v>

696
00:30:59.451 --> 00:31:00.284
<v Speaker 2>everyone around you is behaving the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>way in the world filled with violence </v>

697
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.870
<v Speaker 2>and no one can hit the pause button and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

698
00:31:05.871 --> 00:31:08.360
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why we getting each other,</v>

699
00:31:08.361 --> 00:31:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Hutus and Tutsis like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing?</v>

700
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.380
<v Speaker 2>No one's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>

701
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:13.663
<v Speaker 2>settle the fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you get locked up in the </v>

702
00:31:16.101 --> 00:31:19.550
<v Speaker 2>momentum of your past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the past,</v>

703
00:31:19.551 --> 00:31:21.650
<v Speaker 2>of your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ancestors,</v>

704
00:31:21.651 --> 00:31:22.940
<v Speaker 2>your community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your environment.</v>

705
00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:23.983
<v Speaker 2>Very few people have complete autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the idea that we're supposed to ask </v>

706
00:31:26.271 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 2>somebody to just figure it out or get </v>
<v Speaker 2>their shit together,</v>

707
00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.610
<v Speaker 2>pull themselves up by their bootstraps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty preposterous.</v>

708
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's usually coming from people that</v>

709
00:31:33.681 --> 00:31:34.514
<v Speaker 2>got a nice juicy hand like life gave you</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of aces and you got to seven </v>

710
00:31:38.451 --> 00:31:41.660
<v Speaker 2>over there and a two and you try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out if you can get a flush,</v>

711
00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.450
<v Speaker 2>like you've got a good hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got lucky.</v>

712
00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.640
<v Speaker 2>So if you say you made it with a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>

713
00:31:46.641 --> 00:31:47.474
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

714
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.010
<v Speaker 2>congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won the pot.</v>

715
00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.110
<v Speaker 2>You got dealt three aces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kinda.</v>

716
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got lucky.</v>

717
00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.113
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the first to admit that should </v>

718
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:56.243
<v Speaker 2>be the first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that some people are born with </v>

719
00:31:58.611 --> 00:32:00.710
<v Speaker 2>more advantaged than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a better family.</v>

720
00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.573
<v Speaker 2>Just stop for a moment and I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to this are already to Social </v>

721
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.413
<v Speaker 2>Justice Warrior II in this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is one of the things that </v>

722
00:32:08.001 --> 00:32:08.834
<v Speaker 2>pisses me off and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with so many of those twats on </v>

723
00:32:12.171 --> 00:32:13.004
<v Speaker 2>so many important issues and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get so crazy that they wanted to </v>

724
00:32:16.071 --> 00:32:18.620
<v Speaker 2>interrupt people at Christina Hoff </v>
<v Speaker 2>summers and yell at.</v>

725
00:32:18.621 --> 00:32:19.730
<v Speaker 2>She's a fascist and</v>

726
00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.240
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>

727
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.280
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just too much conflict.</v>

728
00:32:25.281 --> 00:32:26.114
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not reasonable that they're not </v>

729
00:32:29.211 --> 00:32:31.850
<v Speaker 1>civil or reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know where else to go.</v>

730
00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.313
<v Speaker 1>Like what if you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable and you're going to decide </v>

731
00:32:37.821 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>that you're that right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you</v>

732
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.813
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your site is rooted in truth and </v>

733
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.740
<v Speaker 2>love and that and my sides rooted in </v>
<v Speaker 2>falsehood.</v>

734
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:45.623
<v Speaker 2>Knievel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt,</v>

735
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.720
<v Speaker 2>aggressive issues are all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

736
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 2>no one has ever like super into women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights but racist,</v>

737
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:51.983
<v Speaker 2>like they're all like there's a pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>of behavior that you're supposed to </v>

738
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 2>follow them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like really?</v>

739
00:32:57.531 --> 00:32:58.364
<v Speaker 2>It's a really interesting predetermined </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern that everybody locks into </v>

740
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:03.110
<v Speaker 2>because it's support gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all these things.</v>

741
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can yell.</v>

742
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you're,</v>

743
00:33:04.821 --> 00:33:05.654
<v Speaker 2>if you're in favor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe that global warming is </v>

744
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 2>caused by human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be in the right.</v>

745
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.150
<v Speaker 2>You know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're.</v>

746
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Unless you know where you stand on gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage,</v>

747
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:15.763
<v Speaker 2>on everything else like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unfortunately you can't be sort </v>

748
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:19.610
<v Speaker 2>of responsive to evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

749
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:20.623
<v Speaker 2>So instead of being affiliated with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>party or a candidate be affiliated with </v>

750
00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:26.120
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem?</v>

751
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Will agree with all three shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

752
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.850
<v Speaker 2>That socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

753
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 2>So there's gotta be a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could put our ideas together,</v>

754
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 2>create a little idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sex.</v>

755
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

756
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:37.880
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be a way to deal with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

757
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

758
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:41.390
<v Speaker 2>can we talk about the fact that we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree that the problem socks.</v>

759
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.433
<v Speaker 2>Now you're saying we need more guns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this other side saying we need less </v>

760
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>

761
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.660
<v Speaker 2>is there something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there something we can.</v>

762
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Can we at least start talking instead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

763
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Brendan on the podcast said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we agree that a gum problem,</v>

764
00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.500
<v Speaker 2>the fucking number of hate emails we got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know,</v>

765
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.320
<v Speaker 2>want to give up those guns and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

766
00:34:02.321 --> 00:34:02.991
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

767
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:03.824
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jim Jefferies was so funny because </v>

768
00:34:04.761 --> 00:34:07.000
<v Speaker 2>he goes and his pod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear that?</v>

769
00:34:07.001 --> 00:34:08.010
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stand up in it.</v>

770
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.170
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the argument,</v>

771
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.350
<v Speaker 2>because I like them so fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

772
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:13.700
<v Speaker 2>that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

773
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.043
<v Speaker 2>The constitution says that guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a right to bear arms so we can </v>

774
00:34:17.331 --> 00:34:18.980
<v Speaker 2>protect ourselves against tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

775
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.821
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

776
00:34:19.821 --> 00:34:22.040
<v Speaker 2>that's what the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

777
00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

778
00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:24.740
<v Speaker 2>the government has drones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

779
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.560
<v Speaker 2>They got tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got cruise missiles.</v>

780
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Your ar 15 ain't doing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another problem.</v>

781
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.810
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to understand this.</v>

782
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 2>The government is us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

783
00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that you just described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who works in the military,</v>

784
00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.170
<v Speaker 2>everyone just described someone who's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldier,</v>

785
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 2>two soldiers or civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the same people.</v>

786
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:43.040
<v Speaker 2>They're people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're us.</v>

787
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.780
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about some global </v>
<v Speaker 2>elites.</v>

788
00:34:44.781 --> 00:34:46.880
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not taking over with us.</v>

789
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.820
<v Speaker 2>We are not going to take over ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not.</v>

790
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:51.890
<v Speaker 2>This is not a stupid fucking country.</v>

791
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.890
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>the military will start taking them.</v>

792
00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:55.724
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to be careful is people that </v>

793
00:34:56.991 --> 00:34:59.090
<v Speaker 2>have extreme power and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judgment.</v>

794
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.073
<v Speaker 2>Like that cop that shot that kid in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallway in Arizona that that horrible </v>

795
00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:06.230
<v Speaker 2>video was bad white guy shooting a white</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy too.</v>

796
00:35:06.231 --> 00:35:07.064
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if that has anything </v>

797
00:35:08.091 --> 00:35:10.640
<v Speaker 2>to do with racism with a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>cops are doing.</v>

798
00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:11.474
<v Speaker 2>I think some of it most certainly does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of it has to do with </v>

799
00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:14.864
<v Speaker 2>people to just incompetent and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>police officers and they shouldn't be </v>

800
00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:18.524
<v Speaker 2>police officers and on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the stress of the job just </v>

801
00:35:21.951 --> 00:35:22.784
<v Speaker 2>breaks people's brains and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people are just so out of </v>

802
00:35:25.341 --> 00:35:26.174
<v Speaker 2>their fucking mind with worrying about </v>
<v Speaker 2>being shot and dealing with trauma and </v>

803
00:35:29.181 --> 00:35:34.181
<v Speaker 2>dealing with violence and dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic abuse and fucking murdered kids</v>

804
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 2>and all the fucked up things.</v>

805
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 2>They say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See everyday they're brains are frazzled</v>

806
00:35:38.131 --> 00:35:38.964
<v Speaker 2>man and they're stepping out into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street and then they can confront </v>

807
00:35:42.091 --> 00:35:44.100
<v Speaker 2>somebody and they just want to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot.</v>

808
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I just want to shoot before they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>shot there on a hair trigger,</v>

809
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:47.634
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a couple of seconds to write </v>

810
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.650
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and sometimes it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they plant a gun on the guy.</v>

811
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:55.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes it's absolutely a dirty</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop.</v>

812
00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.071
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

813
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the guy's reaching for his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wallet,</v>

814
00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 2>they shoot him in the car with his baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the backseat.</v>

815
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.440
<v Speaker 2>This has been a bunch of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

816
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.530
<v Speaker 2>and I think it boils down to more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

817
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.100
<v Speaker 2>people that are fucking completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>incompetent at being a police officer.</v>

818
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.143
<v Speaker 2>What's amazing is the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions where you never hear shit </v>

819
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:13.314
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's amazing is how many people get </v>

820
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 2>pulled over every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people deal with a cop,</v>

821
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.610
<v Speaker 2>how many people get questioned by a cop?</v>

822
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.533
<v Speaker 2>How many people are in a situation where</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cop has to talk to them about </v>

823
00:36:25.261 --> 00:36:28.020
<v Speaker 2>something that happened and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens and nobody gets shot.</v>

824
00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.220
<v Speaker 2>It's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The numbers of actual interactions where</v>

825
00:36:32.221 --> 00:36:33.054
<v Speaker 2>everything goes okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far outweigh the dirty cop that shoots </v>

826
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:38.550
<v Speaker 2>the kid in the hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

827
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.291
<v Speaker 2>the and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

828
00:36:39.291 --> 00:36:42.150
<v Speaker 2>the cop that plants the Taser and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy after he shoots them.</v>

829
00:36:42.151 --> 00:36:43.920
<v Speaker 2>All these different things where there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dirty guy,</v>

830
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.983
<v Speaker 2>there's just people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number of honorable police officers </v>

831
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.660
<v Speaker 2>is actually pretty fucking stunningly </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

832
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.503
<v Speaker 2>So if cops that save lives or stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>crying from happiness and all those </v>

833
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 2>things protect people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human beings have this crazy brain right</v>

834
00:36:59.581 --> 00:37:00.414
<v Speaker 2>where this negativity bias where </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like violence and stuff has </v>

835
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:07.500
<v Speaker 2>such an effect on our brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're really good at seeing problems but</v>

836
00:37:07.501 --> 00:37:08.334
<v Speaker 2>really bad at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at coming up with the solutions like we </v>

837
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 2>tend to jump to.</v>

838
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:13.170
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a problem,</v>

839
00:37:13.171 --> 00:37:15.390
<v Speaker 2>if it's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very thing about terrorism,</v>

840
00:37:15.391 --> 00:37:16.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people die on,</v>

841
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:20.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a very scary situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Far More people die of diabetes.</v>

842
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.383
<v Speaker 2>Far More people die of heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People die if the way you're eating far </v>

843
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:28.680
<v Speaker 2>more die from all the various </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical opiates.</v>

844
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.130
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

845
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.960
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell how many people die of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspirin,</v>

846
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.430
<v Speaker 2>some crazy number think it's $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

847
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.733
<v Speaker 2>but things are not as sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we tend to react to the things that </v>

848
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:41.611
<v Speaker 2>really scare us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

849
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:42.444
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll violence violence is what gets us </v>

850
00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:45.760
<v Speaker 2>not disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I knew it was happening and I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

860

<v Speaker 2>I stayed home and I ate real good and I </v>

866
00:38:26.911 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I was real proud of myself that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognized it.</v>

867
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's going on here.</v>

868
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty in tune with what I'm feeling</v>

869

<v Speaker 2>like a pussy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There are two things they talk about </v>

899
00:39:36.821 --> 00:39:40.230
<v Speaker 1>like when you do a to a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one is this,</v>

900
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:41.123
<v Speaker 1>this fucking behavioral scientist named.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called scarcity and his </v>

901
00:39:44.651 --> 00:39:45.484
<v Speaker 1>name is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lr chef here and I did a podcast with </v>

902
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:51.400
<v Speaker 1>him and he'd studies like how humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave when they have.</v>

903
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't have enough food in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach,</v>

904
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.280
<v Speaker 1>like most economists wrote their </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatises from a full stomach.</v>

905
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Adam Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father of capitalism was also living</v>

906
00:40:00.071 --> 00:40:00.904
<v Speaker 1>with his mother when he wrote the moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentiments of man and the wealth of </v>

907
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:04.114
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

908
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.360

<v Speaker 1>as this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company.</v>

911
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:08.981
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet Marketing Gurus,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm a free market guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a capitalist.</v>

918
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

919
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:22.024
<v Speaker 1>And I've been inundated in the sort of </v>

923
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:33.581
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

924
00:40:33.581 --> 00:40:34.414
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they don't tell you is when Adam </v>

925
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.333
<v Speaker 1>Smith was writing the wealth of nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking handbook for all capitalist </v>

926
00:40:39.551 --> 00:40:42.270
<v Speaker 1>and free market guys like yourself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that his mother was like,</v>

927
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner's almost ready.</v>

928
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.000
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

929
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

930
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I folded your laundry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

931
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.540
<v Speaker 1>what's that worth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>

932
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.263
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

933
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>So you got to take those things into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

934
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.350
<v Speaker 1>So funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

935
00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.780
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my perspective on,</v>

936
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.600
<v Speaker 1>on capitalism has always come from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full belly.</v>

937
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Never been hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a wrestler guys.</v>

938
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I did have to suck a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is never been hungry.</v>

939
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Never had to worry about where my next </v>
<v Speaker 1>meal was coming from.</v>

940
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Certainly never had to worry about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>roof over my head.</v>

941
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:08.943
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big difference between even a </v>

942
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:13.700
<v Speaker 1>guy like me and you like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got your.</v>

943
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Your perspective is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

944
00:41:15.071 --> 00:41:18.040
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be adult has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a level of compassion.</v>

945
00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I think that as a civilization we </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't hit.</v>

946
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.140
<v Speaker 1>We haven't hit the right number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in this number where we.</v>

947
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.033
<v Speaker 1>We don't give a fuck about each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and I think that one of the ways </v>

948
00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:31.891
<v Speaker 1>that that could be solved is I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking a lot about universal basis,</v>

949
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 1>basic income that</v>

950
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:38.540
<v Speaker 2>if that was a possibility where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could give everybody just a small amount</v>

951
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:40.490
<v Speaker 2>of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like $12,000</v>

952
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:41.324
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a thousand dollars a </v>

953
00:41:42.951 --> 00:41:45.440
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically enough to get by,</v>

954
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't have to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

955
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Then you wouldn't have to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that aspect.</v>

956
00:41:50.871 --> 00:41:51.704
<v Speaker 2>Like you would always have food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could make sure that everybody </v>

957
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:56.420
<v Speaker 2>always had food and everybody always had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place to sleep,</v>

958
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.343
<v Speaker 2>what would that cost?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would it cost to eradicate </v>

959
00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 2>homelessness to a point where if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were homeless,</v>

960
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:03.194
<v Speaker 2>it was a total voluntary situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either you're just a nomad who likes </v>

961
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 2>camping or you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're mentally ill and you just need to</v>

962
00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:10.754
<v Speaker 2>sleep in a box because you think that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way that the aliens can't get </v>

963
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

964
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.480
<v Speaker 2>there's those people at skid row is </v>
<v Speaker 2>filled with crazy.</v>

965
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much,</v>

966
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:22.700
<v Speaker 2>how like what percentage of our cities </v>
<v Speaker 2>have homeless people in them?</v>

967
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Like is it three percent of the city's </v>
<v Speaker 2>homeless?</v>

968
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:27.190
<v Speaker 2>One percent of the city's almost summer </v>
<v Speaker 2>climates.</v>

969
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.220
<v Speaker 2>It's higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

970
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:29.443
<v Speaker 2>How would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

971
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 2>how much of an impact would it be if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could just bring that down to zero?</v>

972
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:34.963
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't that be just great for the way </v>

973
00:42:38.061 --> 00:42:40.370
<v Speaker 2>people feel about other people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

974
00:42:40.371 --> 00:42:42.950
<v Speaker 2>there are societies that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Singapore,</v>

975
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.750
<v Speaker 2>certain Scandinavian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hippie.</v>

976
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:47.300
<v Speaker 2>This podcast is a strong weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

977
00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:47.781
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

978
00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:48.614
<v Speaker 2>but you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're asking a really good question </v>

979
00:42:49.251 --> 00:42:51.980
<v Speaker 2>because they have done these </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments.</v>

980
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Twenty billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

981
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.410
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could end homeless,</v>

982
00:42:56.411 --> 00:42:56.841
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

983
00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 2>With money used to buy Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 2>decorations,</v>

984
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.883
<v Speaker 2>it would cost about $20 million for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government to effectively eliminate </v>

985
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:05.684
<v Speaker 2>homelessness in the United States of </v>
<v Speaker 2>housing and urban development official </v>

986
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 2>told the New York Times Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>December 11,</v>

987
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:13.860
<v Speaker 2>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think for what we spend it,</v>

988
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.713
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of the wrong question because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I give a man a fish or feed them in and </v>

989
00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 2>teach a man to fish.</v>

990
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a really tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

991
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 2>They have to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird question,</v>

992
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's also one that no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing.</v>

993
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.383
<v Speaker 2>It's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at people who are homeless to </v>

994
00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:29.811
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

995
00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 2>you fucking bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your shit together.</v>

996
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 2>All you lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck or all you crazy person.</v>

997
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he must be a junkie.</v>

998
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

999
00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:38.043
<v Speaker 2>so can I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my friend works for does this worse </v>

1000
00:43:39.611 --> 00:43:43.670
<v Speaker 2>with homeless youth and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty extensively.</v>

1001
00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:44.504
<v Speaker 2>Hasn't done it for 20 years and actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>the what he'll tell you and he's very </v>

1002
00:43:50.421 --> 00:43:51.254
<v Speaker 2>compassionate person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he'll tell you that the system in </v>

1003
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:56.444
<v Speaker 2>this city of Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of resources for people </v>

1004
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 2>on the street from places to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

1005
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:04.723
<v Speaker 2>places to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>places to take a shower there and and </v>

1006
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:09.800
<v Speaker 2>what happens is there are a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that get this network.</v>

1007
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:10.663
<v Speaker 2>They figure out where to go and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that they are talking about </v>

1008
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:18.920
<v Speaker 2>in this community and trying to get kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and homeless people off the street.</v>

1009
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:20.870
<v Speaker 2>It's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing.</v>

1010
00:44:20.871 --> 00:44:22.250
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a complicated issue,</v>

1011
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:26.410
<v Speaker 2>but what has been said and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>shocking to me was they were like,</v>

1012
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.210
<v Speaker 2>problem is the system is so easy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

1013
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can live on the street and</v>

1014
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.350
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1015
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:34.740
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a youth,</v>

1016
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:37.200
<v Speaker 1>you can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you understand how to how to work the</v>

1017
00:44:37.201 --> 00:44:38.034
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so many resources that a lot </v>

1018
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:45.060
<v Speaker 1>of times it doesn't lend itself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really needing to get out of a situation</v>

1019
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:45.894
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how many of these kids are playing </v>

1020
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.210
<v Speaker 1>this out like this with a gaming the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>

1021
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 1>A lot of really because you're a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

1022
00:44:50.341 --> 00:44:52.530
<v Speaker 1>so you figure out where you can get your</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast,</v>

1023
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:54.390
<v Speaker 1>where you can get a shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can get your computer,</v>

1024
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:55.224
<v Speaker 1>where you can get your hangout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can get all these things </v>

1025
00:44:56.941 --> 00:44:59.280
<v Speaker 1>somehow under that's hurting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying,</v>

1026
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:00.503
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we shouldn't have these </v>

1027
00:45:01.111 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1028
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:02.723
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was fascinating that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people that are really on the </v>

1029
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:05.424
<v Speaker 1>front lines and all in this are saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the the ironic and frustrating </v>

1030
00:45:09.751 --> 00:45:14.751
<v Speaker 1>thing sometimes can be that it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>create not complacency,</v>

1031
00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:18.900
<v Speaker 1>but certainly there are way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources than you think.</v>

1032
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:19.733
<v Speaker 1>There are people that have worked very </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to address this problem and people </v>

1033
00:45:23.401 --> 00:45:28.050
<v Speaker 1>do it when they know where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do know where to get food.</v>

1034
00:45:28.051 --> 00:45:30.870
<v Speaker 1>They do know where to get a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do know what to do so they can live</v>

1035
00:45:30.871 --> 00:45:31.630
<v Speaker 1>on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

1036
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:33.060
<v Speaker 1>There's many levels to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1037
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:34.770
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the big levels,</v>

1038
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.250
<v Speaker 1>the inescapable is mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:45:37.251 --> 00:45:38.084
<v Speaker 1>Those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are </v>

1040
00:45:38.881 --> 00:45:39.714
<v Speaker 1>wandering around the street that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>should probably be in some sort of an </v>

1041
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:43.710
<v Speaker 1>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1042
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Getting healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes and medicated.</v>

1043
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:46.913
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how do you force someone to do that </v>

1044
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:48.833
<v Speaker 1>and is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the issue or is it a funding </v>

1045
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:51.970
<v Speaker 1>issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1046
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.550
<v Speaker 1>that was an issue apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting Reagan.</v>

1047
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Reagan was in office,</v>

1048
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.233
<v Speaker 1>they lower the standard of what's Cuckoo</v>
<v Speaker 1>for cocoa puffs and they just let a </v>

1049
00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:01.650
<v Speaker 1>bunch of dudes just wander through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

1050
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.513
<v Speaker 1>That actually wasn't the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a little bit more complicated </v>

1051
00:46:04.421 --> 00:46:04.920
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

1052
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.753
<v Speaker 1>It was at the state doesn't have a right</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep you against your will if you </v>

1053
00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:09.001
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1054
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:09.834
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there had to be very specific </v>

1055
00:46:11.131 --> 00:46:12.750
<v Speaker 1>criteria for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1056
00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:13.584
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing with gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we need to help mental health </v>

1057
00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:16.254
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1058
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:17.363
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talked to the psychiatrist will </v>

1059
00:46:18.711 --> 00:46:19.544
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look dude,</v>

1060
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.910
<v Speaker 1>the criteria for getting tougher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1061
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:24.803
<v Speaker 1>saying and getting somebody essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>classified as a danger to society and </v>

1062
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real threat is very steep.</v>

1063
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.890
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1064
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:35.410
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1065
00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that because somebody talks</v>
<v Speaker 1>to themselves.</v>

1066
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.850
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it because they're hearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>voices.</v>

1067
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other doesn't want to visit that kid</v>

1068
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.760
<v Speaker 1>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1069
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:47.550
<v Speaker 1>The kid who shot up to school in Florida</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they decided he wasn't a threat,</v>

1070
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but he might not have been a threat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1071
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Like people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1072
00:46:51.181 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they visited them two years ago.</v>

1073
00:46:52.831 --> 00:46:53.730
<v Speaker 1>They're incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1074
00:46:53.731 --> 00:46:57.210
<v Speaker 1>he might be a different person now you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to realize that like people get way</v>

1075
00:46:57.211 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we've all known people that we knew</v>

1076
00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:02.550
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't see him for six years and</v>

1077
00:47:02.551 --> 00:47:03.271
<v Speaker 1>then you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1078
00:47:03.271 --> 00:47:04.104
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's because people evolve and </v>

1079
00:47:05.371 --> 00:47:07.470
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they evolve and sometimes they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1080
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they recede.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it gets ugly.</v>

1081
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:10.913
<v Speaker 1>So definitely didn't you go crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't you talking about how because 20 </v>

1082
00:47:14.191 --> 00:47:16.580
<v Speaker 1>percent of boys in this fucking country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>r,</v>

1083
00:47:16.581 --> 00:47:17.414
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a r,</v>

1084
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:19.740
<v Speaker 1>r,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a diagnosed with Adhd,</v>

1085
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:21.443
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed of course because you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent 10 minutes with you who's not an </v>

1086
00:47:24.781 --> 00:47:27.000
<v Speaker 1>expert on Adhd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a thousand other things.</v>

1087
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a boy.</v>

1088
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It was on Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick</v>

1089
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:31.263
<v Speaker 2>posted up to study and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>lugging a d hd was something that was </v>

1090
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:38.230
<v Speaker 2>not the one that was created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if Google this too.</v>

1091
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adhd was the one that was created by the</v>

1092
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 2>advertising agency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a surprise.</v>

1093
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:45.603
<v Speaker 2>There's been several conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were literally invented by advertising </v>

1094
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:51.544
<v Speaker 2>agencies in order to promote a cure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's attention deficit hyperactivity </v>

1095
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:58.110
<v Speaker 2>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1096
00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.493
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much of that is a real </v>

1097
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:05.050
<v Speaker 2>disease and maybe maybe some of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm not.</v>

1098
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:05.943
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously not an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some of it is a kid whose brain </v>

1099
00:48:08.111 --> 00:48:09.390
<v Speaker 2>works different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1100
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.533
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1101
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:14.500
<v Speaker 2>My dog might have adhd or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it is.</v>

1102
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I go to see him and he goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

1103
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:18.960
<v Speaker 2>He's out of his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks we're going running,</v>

1104
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.100
<v Speaker 2>he's running around in circles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hopping up and down.</v>

1105
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 2>He bolts back and forth into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>backyard.</v>

1106
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.000
<v Speaker 2>He's like a maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can't control them.</v>

1107
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.730
<v Speaker 2>You know what the solution for that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take him running,</v>

1108
00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:28.564
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't lock them in a room and then </v>

1109
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:30.364
<v Speaker 2>drug them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I was wanting to dealing </v>

1110
00:48:31.511 --> 00:48:33.130
<v Speaker 2>with little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when I was really focused.</v>

1111
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't focused Algebra.</v>

1112
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.310
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really focused.</v>

1113
00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 2>If somebody started talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting and how to throw a right hand,</v>

1114
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:40.180
<v Speaker 2>just think about what I'm saying with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>

1115
00:48:40.181 --> 00:48:41.014
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's really something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that dog wanted to go run and </v>

1116
00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:45.760
<v Speaker 2>invite you to forced him to sit into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

1117
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.460
<v Speaker 2>He would go crazy bark and he wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do that.</v>

1118
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 2>That's how kids are exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn thing.</v>

1119
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:52.840
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 2>The drugging of the American boy.</v>

1121
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:55.840
<v Speaker 2>But what was the tweet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

1122
00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Is this an esquire article?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did it.</v>

1123
00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.593
<v Speaker 2>What did the tweet say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One in five boys will be diagnosed with </v>

1124
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Adhd by the time they make it to high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school to date.</v>

1125
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:05.043
<v Speaker 2>Only one significant study has looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>adhd misdiagnosis and found 20 to 25 </v>

1126
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:14.370
<v Speaker 2>percent of boys were misdiagnosed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this was before a d,</v>

1127
00:49:14.371 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 2>h,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d was a ca as common as it is now,</v>

1128
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:17.883
<v Speaker 2>so they're saying it's a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know quite a few people that are </v>

1129
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:23.590
<v Speaker 2>drugging their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my next door neighbor.</v>

1130
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:26.260
<v Speaker 2>They put their fucking kid on Ritalin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing wrong with this kid.</v>

1131
00:49:26.261 --> 00:49:27.094
<v Speaker 2>I talked to that kid all the times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just takes too much energy that you </v>

1132
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:31.264
<v Speaker 2>just had too much energy and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to deal with it and they weren't </v>

1133
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:34.054
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They worked all day and then the kids </v>

1134
00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:36.304
<v Speaker 2>bouncing off the walls and nobody wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take care of the kid and so they put </v>

1135
00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:39.310
<v Speaker 2>him on Ritalin.</v>

1136
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Awful dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening everywhere.</v>

1137
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.033
<v Speaker 2>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bad side effects some of these </v>

1138
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this,</v>

1139
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.473
<v Speaker 2>six point 4 million children between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ages of four and 17 have been diagnosed </v>

1140
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:51.424
<v Speaker 2>with Adhd by high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nearly 20 percent of all boys will have </v>

1141
00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:58.090
<v Speaker 2>been diagnosed with Adhd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A 37 percent,</v>

1142
00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:01.060
<v Speaker 2>37 percent increase since 2003.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My son,</v>

1143
00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:01.894
<v Speaker 2>my son is a classic example of a kid who</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like to sit still and rough </v>

1144
00:50:04.841 --> 00:50:07.370
<v Speaker 2>houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google does have adhd,</v>

1145
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.930
<v Speaker 2>so if a school's have no time for horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no time for boy energy.</v>

1146
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:11.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

1147
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.170
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're condemned because it's aggressive</v>

1148
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:15.004
<v Speaker 2>and my son is the way to not be a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's being told that his hands are hot </v>

1149
00:50:17.771 --> 00:50:20.230
<v Speaker 2>lava and he can't use his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's healthy.</v>

1150
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of liberal school you've taken</v>

1151
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.760
<v Speaker 2>for public school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Public School.</v>

1152
00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:25.683
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens.</v>

1153
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>That's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're dealing with.</v>

1154
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.820
<v Speaker 2>A 1900 adhd was first mentioned in 19.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1155
00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 2>two British pediatric pediatrician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it must be a wrong one.</v>

1156
00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:39.200
<v Speaker 2>A different one described an abnormal </v>
<v Speaker 2>defect of moral control and children.</v>

1157
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.393
<v Speaker 2>He found that some effective children </v>
<v Speaker 2>could not control behavior the way a </v>

1158
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:45.140
<v Speaker 2>typical child would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were still intelligent.</v>

1159
00:50:45.141 --> 00:50:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was restless legs syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that.</v>

1160
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you tell me that one might have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>

1161
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:52.330
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was the.</v>

1162
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Who was the guest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>

1163
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:58.130
<v Speaker 2>The guest was a woman who was telling us</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about this.</v>

1164
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Some medical expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it Kelly Brogan?</v>

1165
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.640
<v Speaker 2>It might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might've been Kelly Brogan.</v>

1166
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Dr Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what didn't you say weren't.</v>

1167
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Aren't there studies about school </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooters and a lot of them were on SSR.</v>

1168
00:51:11.161 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I's and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1169
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Mass shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just school shooters,</v>

1170
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:16.483
<v Speaker 2>but like even this Vegas Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Vegas guy was on anti anxiety </v>

1171
00:51:20.991 --> 00:51:21.824
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>

1172
00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff in.</v>

1173
00:51:23.431 --> 00:51:26.450
<v Speaker 2>That's also Chris Cornell was on anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety medication.</v>

1174
00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:31.650
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot of people who are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>psych drugs who lose their fucking minds</v>

1175
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 2>because psych drugs are not universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1176
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no thing like here's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect example.</v>

1177
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.053
<v Speaker 2>Say if you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a solution that makes alcohol </v>

1178
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:47.180
<v Speaker 2>91 octane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1179
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.273
<v Speaker 2>And you add something to that and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can add some additives and it'll spike </v>

1180
00:51:51.951 --> 00:51:55.130
<v Speaker 2>it up and you could try to find the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right mixture,</v>

1181
00:51:55.131 --> 00:51:55.964
<v Speaker 2>but that's just fucking gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You throwing things in there and try to </v>

1182
00:51:58.641 --> 00:51:59.474
<v Speaker 2>mix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know exactly what the right </v>

1183
00:52:00.531 --> 00:52:03.440
<v Speaker 2>thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they're doing your brain.</v>

1184
00:52:03.441 --> 00:52:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the chipkey these things,</v>

1185
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.010
<v Speaker 2>that's why they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try this one.</v>

1186
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:08.450
<v Speaker 2>There's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1187
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:09.973
<v Speaker 2>you have one cup of flour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need two eggs and one tablespoon of </v>

1188
00:52:14.751 --> 00:52:15.250
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1189
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:15.481
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1190
00:52:15.481 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1191
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.753
<v Speaker 2>There's no specific recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what the fuck does feel good mean </v>

1192
00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:21.890
<v Speaker 2>that the other thing that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking into account is said,</v>

1193
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be depressed for a good </v>

1194
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1195
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:26.174
<v Speaker 2>if you made me do a job I hated and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't allowed to work out or I </v>

1196
00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:32.030
<v Speaker 2>didn't know how to eat or a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1197
00:52:32.031 --> 00:52:34.040
<v Speaker 2>They make me feel good because I have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>self regulate.</v>

1198
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:34.874
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 51 and I gotta I gotta I still have </v>

1199
00:52:37.131 --> 00:52:39.190
<v Speaker 2>to self regulate because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1200
00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:43.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go crazy if I don't have.</v>

1201
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:46.580
<v Speaker 2>If I didn't know how to do those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would probably be depressed now.</v>

1202
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Now you're going to give me drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not going to help me.</v>

1203
00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:51.061
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what it is.</v>

1204
00:52:51.061 --> 00:52:53.090
<v Speaker 2>What I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My behavior is what it is.</v>

1205
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.013
<v Speaker 2>For sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's where I think you've got to </v>

1206
00:52:55.401 --> 00:52:58.160
<v Speaker 2>recognize that that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your son who has that energy,</v>

1207
00:52:58.161 --> 00:53:01.520
<v Speaker 2>that's a gift and what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making them squander that gift by</v>

1208
00:53:01.521 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 2>sitting them down in a fucking charity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to go crazy.</v>

1209
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:07.280
<v Speaker 2>That kid is supposed to be like my dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>running around all day.</v>

1210
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dog is a year old at seven.</v>

1211
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.060
<v Speaker 2>He's a seven year old dog basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1212
00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:14.600
<v Speaker 2>in dog years and he's like a seven year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old kid.</v>

1213
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:16.790
<v Speaker 2>He's running around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going fucking crazy,</v>

1214
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's because he wants to run.</v>

1215
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once he runs,</v>

1216
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.120
<v Speaker 2>he's high dogs the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1217
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.810
<v Speaker 2>And your kid will be to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1218
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:25.653
<v Speaker 2>if your kid was involved in something </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they emphasized physical movement </v>

1219
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 2>and then taught things in between </v>
<v Speaker 2>workouts,</v>

1220
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:34.450
<v Speaker 2>taught things in between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1221
00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.230
<v Speaker 2>they play a game outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play a little dodge ball,</v>

1222
00:53:37.231 --> 00:53:39.390
<v Speaker 2>play a little soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play a little basketball.</v>

1223
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Then after you wear yourself out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

1224
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:42.850
<v Speaker 2>come sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to teach about math.</v>

1225
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Teach them about math and then you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to show them,</v>

1226
00:53:45.421 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 2>this is leverage.</v>

1227
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:47.063
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to pick things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you think you'd pick it up like or </v>

1228
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.820
<v Speaker 2>like let them now pick it up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>leverage.</v>

1229
00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

1230
00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:52.443
<v Speaker 2>you understand you could teach kids in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very physical way instead of forcing </v>

1231
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:56.844
<v Speaker 2>them to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck wants to sit that hard ass </v>

1232
00:53:59.231 --> 00:54:01.170
<v Speaker 2>chair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We feel other people's gum on the top of</v>

1233
00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:02.280
<v Speaker 2>your leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1235
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:07.860
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting there waiting for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking class to be over stuck.</v>

1236
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their energies.</v>

1237

<v Speaker 2>How did I ever tell you that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My acting teacher who looked at me time </v>

00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:14.940
<v Speaker 2>if you liked yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fuck yourself.</v>

1265
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:17.160
<v Speaker 2>That guy's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep hating yourself.</v>

1266
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:19.740
<v Speaker 2>It's the best part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how that got tanks.</v>

1267
00:55:19.741 --> 00:55:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Monk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1268
00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1269
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole point,</v>

1270
00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:27.810
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing that drives me is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that I've never been satisfied with</v>

1271
00:55:27.811 --> 00:55:29.700
<v Speaker 2>myself and I'm never going to lose that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1272
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:32.280
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make me really happy with myself,</v>

1273
00:55:32.281 --> 00:55:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1274
00:55:34.501 --> 00:55:36.960
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure out how to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think not you,</v>

1275
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:42.080
<v Speaker 2>but I think humans to somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnect you from the result.</v>

1276
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.570
<v Speaker 2>If you could figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnect you from the result,</v>

1277
00:55:45.571 --> 00:55:46.404
<v Speaker 2>you could look at it more objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to feel the sting of </v>

1278
00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:50.100
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fact,</v>

1279
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:53.580
<v Speaker 2>but you have to recognize what that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>and intellectualize it.</v>

1280
00:55:53.581 --> 00:55:54.780
<v Speaker 2>You got to put it in this little box.</v>

1281
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is good because now I'm going to be</v>

1282
00:55:56.971 --> 00:55:57.804
<v Speaker 2>fucking pumped up to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to recognize the urgency and </v>

1283
00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:02.850
<v Speaker 2>failure because it's so extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable,</v>

1284
00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Speaker 2>but that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What me is,</v>

1285
00:56:05.191 --> 00:56:06.024
<v Speaker 2>is the person who's doing this and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually going to be a finished </v>

1286
00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 2>product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to figure this out,</v>

1287
00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:10.213
<v Speaker 2>but right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little thing that happened that </v>

1288
00:56:11.251 --> 00:56:12.330
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1289
00:56:12.331 --> 00:56:14.350
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't freak out you.</v>

1290
00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Everybody fucks up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you fucked up this way,</v>

1291
00:56:17.131 --> 00:56:20.430
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't run into someone's car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you did run into someone's car,</v>

1292
00:56:20.431 --> 00:56:21.264
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got their own little fuck </v>

1293
00:56:22.831 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 2>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge part of part of being a human.</v>

1294
00:56:25.361 --> 00:56:28.000
<v Speaker 2>You got to understand the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing something incorrectly.</v>

1295
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:29.283
<v Speaker 2>The end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the humiliating feeling of </v>

1296
00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:35.080
<v Speaker 2>being like put in your place like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might think you're good at something and</v>

1297
00:56:35.081 --> 00:56:35.710
<v Speaker 2>then you fail at it.</v>

1298
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:36.543
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1299
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I got this elevated sense of how good I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was at this thing.</v>

1300
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:40.204
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to look at it more </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectively and I have to get to that </v>

1301
00:56:41.891 --> 00:56:46.891
<v Speaker 2>place where I thought I was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to wear Andy Kalpin.</v>

1302
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Have you had great very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant guy.</v>

1303
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's best for recovery?</v>

1304
00:56:52.261 --> 00:56:54.010
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you want to recover?</v>

1305
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:54.933
<v Speaker 2>That's what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1306
00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:55.893
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you let your body adapt and </v>

1307
00:56:56.741 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just eat some food,</v>

1308
00:56:58.091 --> 00:56:58.924
<v Speaker 2>see how it feels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe maybe suffer a little bit and </v>

1309
00:57:00.761 --> 00:57:01.594
<v Speaker 2>see what that does because your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>might have to compensate and get </v>

1310
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:04.560
<v Speaker 2>stronger as a result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1311
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:05.900
<v Speaker 2>An interesting way of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1312
00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:07.780
<v Speaker 2>I think there's definitely something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1313
00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why people push,</v>

1314
00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:10.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1315
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what pushing is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's forcing adaptation.</v>

1316
00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:14.051
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's going,</v>

1317
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:16.450
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this asshole wants to dead lift now.</v>

1318
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.961
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1319
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to adapt.</v>

1320
00:57:18.071 --> 00:57:18.904
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also with the sauna is you got </v>

1321
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's trying to adapt.</v>

1322
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:22.563
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this asshole wants to live at 170 </v>

1323
00:57:23.591 --> 00:57:24.424
<v Speaker 2>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to figure out how to keep </v>

1324
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:26.284
<v Speaker 2>everything from shutting down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's mass produce these heat shock </v>

1325
00:57:28.961 --> 00:57:31.100
<v Speaker 2>proteins and try to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1326
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.113
<v Speaker 2>how norepinephrine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also like being honest with </v>

1327
00:57:34.781 --> 00:57:38.380
<v Speaker 2>somebody is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like it's also kinda like sitting and</v>

1328
00:57:38.381 --> 00:57:40.210
<v Speaker 2>hearing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to hear about yourself.</v>

1329
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe shortcomings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1330
00:57:41.361 --> 00:57:44.020
<v Speaker 2>So when somebody says some somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to you,</v>

1331
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:48.310
<v Speaker 2>like you're not taking yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not working hard enough or you're</v>

1332
00:57:48.311 --> 00:57:50.740
<v Speaker 2>not working correctly or you did this </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

1333
00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:56.460
<v Speaker 2>or your ideas are a bit bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you why that shit is not fun</v>

1334
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.080
<v Speaker 2>at all here.</v>

1335
00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:00.423
<v Speaker 2>But it's exactly like working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could just sit and listen and </v>

1336
00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:05.050
<v Speaker 2>take it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not argue it.</v>

1337
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it in,</v>

1338
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.490
<v Speaker 2>feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Awhile,</v>

1339
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:09.363
<v Speaker 2>I promise you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promise you that that's probably the </v>

1340
00:58:12.371 --> 00:58:16.300
<v Speaker 2>best way to change listening and hearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it'll bother you,</v>

1341
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:19.720
<v Speaker 2>let it bother you and then let that </v>
<v Speaker 2>spurned you to action.</v>

1342
00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:21.100
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1343
00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.053
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to shout Christina summers </v>

1344
00:58:23.321 --> 00:58:24.154
<v Speaker 2>down or you want to get into your safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>space and not hear those things because </v>

1345
00:58:27.491 --> 00:58:28.870
<v Speaker 2>they hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why they're.</v>

1346
00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's only part of the problem.</v>

1347
00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:32.710
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is a control power </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1348
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:33.743
<v Speaker 2>The country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's control and power problems </v>

1349
00:58:34.581 --> 00:58:35.414
<v Speaker 2>because these are 18 year old kids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've just gotten away from home for </v>

1350
00:58:37.031 --> 00:58:37.864
<v Speaker 2>the first time and they want to exercise</v>
<v Speaker 2>their power and they want to change the </v>

1351
00:58:39.911 --> 00:58:41.320
<v Speaker 2>world and they're fucking babies.</v>

1352
00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.353
<v Speaker 2>They have half baked brains and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to yell shit out and they think </v>

1353
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:46.144
<v Speaker 2>that they're doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really do and they were yelling </v>

1354
00:58:47.651 --> 00:58:48.560
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have.</v>

1355
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:49.463
<v Speaker 2>We won't have fascists in our school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see Jordan Peterson was doing a </v>

1356
00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:54.730
<v Speaker 2>speech and they were literally at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>windows.</v>

1357
00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.830
<v Speaker 2>They climb the walls and got to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>windows,</v>

1358
00:58:56.831 --> 00:59:00.310
<v Speaker 2>were banging on the windows from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside while the speech went on.</v>

1359
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Wow Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's disturbing.</v>

1360
00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:03.003
<v Speaker 2>And everyone inside his super calm and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that keep an eye on the </v>

1361
00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:06.274
<v Speaker 2>window because you hear it cracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a smashing this fucking </v>

1362
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:11.980
<v Speaker 2>window just banging up against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The entire time he's talking,</v>

1363
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:13.750
<v Speaker 2>he just hear Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1364
00:59:13.751 --> 00:59:14.584
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1365
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:15.371
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1366
00:59:15.371 --> 00:59:16.204
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

1367
00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.073
<v Speaker 2>And they're yelling shit outside about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascism or it's like they don't even </v>

1368
00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:21.244
<v Speaker 2>know what the fuck that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they literally are just saying it </v>

1369
00:59:23.931 --> 00:59:25.400
<v Speaker 2>for anybody who disagrees with them.</v>

1370
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:29.150
<v Speaker 2>When a real fascist comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be so duped.</v>

1371
00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.353
<v Speaker 2>There'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be shot against a wall and </v>

1372
00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:33.510
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

1373
00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.393
<v Speaker 2>that's what fascists do real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they seem to think that disagreeing </v>

1374
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:39.733
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1375
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:43.400
<v Speaker 2>people were out of their fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any quotes fascism,</v>

1376
00:59:43.401 --> 00:59:45.230
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have no confidence.</v>

1377
00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1378
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:46.980
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1379
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.833
<v Speaker 2>because if you're having an argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>with somebody and you end up hitting </v>

1380
00:59:49.731 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 2>them because they're saying because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like it means you don't have.</v>

1381
00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:54.100
<v Speaker 2>The idea is to compete with their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1382
00:59:54.101 --> 00:59:54.934
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just young and they </v>

1383
00:59:57.021 --> 00:59:58.790
<v Speaker 2>don't understand what the fuck they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1384
00:59:58.860 --> 00:59:59.250
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1385
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.420
<v Speaker 2>they're enjoying this ability to scream </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1386
01:00:02.421 --> 01:00:03.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing.</v>

1387
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have got way too much power.</v>

1388
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Their children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.550
<v Speaker 2>They're essentially children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1390
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could go to war,</v>

1391
01:00:09.831 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 2>some of them and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

1392
01:00:10.881 --> 01:00:11.600
<v Speaker 2>but that's not right.</v>

1393
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably shouldn't be able to.</v>

1394
01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Probably like 21 before you make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>

1395
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:18.043
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that they don't have enough </v>

1396
01:00:20.061 --> 01:00:22.730
<v Speaker 2>security to keep the fucking kids are </v>
<v Speaker 2>banging on the windows.</v>

1397
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of nonsense facility do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you run?</v>

1398
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 2>You just didn't see that comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you guys,</v>

1399
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.810
<v Speaker 2>do you have the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys have the Internet.</v>

1400
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.660
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As kind of knew the American culture has</v>

1401
01:00:32.661 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 2>always been a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know what I'm saying?</v>

1402
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:37.750
<v Speaker 2>American culture has always given like </v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids.</v>

1403
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Is that recently too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1404
01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.393
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had talks about this like helicopter </v>

1405
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:43.244
<v Speaker 2>parenting and sort of the idea that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid has his own autonomy and it's very </v>

1406
01:00:46.251 --> 01:00:46.810
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1407
01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen all the new science on this.</v>

1408
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1409
01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your kid has ticks,</v>

1410
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.333
<v Speaker 2>is allowed to exercise their point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view and have a tantrum and then you </v>

1411
01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:56.780
<v Speaker 2>have to show them that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1412
01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:02.020
<v Speaker 2>that there are consequences for that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a new way of looking at,</v>

1413
01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of cultures are like,</v>

1414
01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:05.084
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fucking talk to me like that </v>

1415
01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hit you in the fucking.</v>

1416
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:09.283
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take this riding crop and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whack your fucking legs or whatever it </v>

1417
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:13.670
<v Speaker 2>might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

1418
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got a real soft right now.</v>

1419
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:16.873
<v Speaker 2>It's a real easy time to be alive and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think ultimately the ship's going to </v>

1420
01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:19.814
<v Speaker 2>balance out a really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think ultimately a lot of these </v>

1421
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:28.060
<v Speaker 2>kids that are super radical now will </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably stabilize as they get older and</v>

1422
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:29.294
<v Speaker 2>more experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be more embarrassed with some of </v>

1423
01:01:30.351 --> 01:01:33.080
<v Speaker 2>the things they've done to especially to</v>
<v Speaker 2>disrupt free speech.</v>

1424
01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:33.933
<v Speaker 2>They they should really be embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by that because it's so foolish like </v>

1425
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is formulate a really</v>

1426
01:01:39.081 --> 01:01:39.914
<v Speaker 2>good argument with ideas and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>play those ideas out in the court of </v>

1427
01:01:43.401 --> 01:01:44.234
<v Speaker 2>public opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do it in some sort of a way where </v>

1428
01:01:45.951 --> 01:01:49.700
<v Speaker 2>you have a one person representing one </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

1429
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:53.510
<v Speaker 2>one person representing the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you beat that idea with better ideas</v>

1430
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.560
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you're supposed to do.</v>

1431
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole exercise and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that oppose your ideas.</v>

1432
01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.730
<v Speaker 2>You should use that to challenge you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve your ideas,</v>

1433
01:02:01.731 --> 01:02:02.564
<v Speaker 2>to make your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve your ideas undeniable so that </v>

1434
01:02:05.141 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 2>when you present that argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've looked at it from both sides.</v>

1435
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:08.743
<v Speaker 2>There's far too many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including these people that are </v>

1436
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:12.890
<v Speaker 2>interrupting people that are only </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at an argument from the point of</v>

1437
01:02:12.891 --> 01:02:13.724
<v Speaker 2>view that they would like to be correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're only looking at it like </v>

1438
01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:17.630
<v Speaker 2>she's a fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a Nazi.</v>

1439
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.770
<v Speaker 2>They're not looking at real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1440
01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:19.604
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's just a lady and maybe she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nice lady and maybe she's got some </v>

1441
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:24.450
<v Speaker 2>points and maybe I agree with her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I don't,</v>

1442
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.120
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to let her talk like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is all nonsense.</v>

1443
01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Holding signs up and trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

1444
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 2>This is not the time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't persuade anybody over to your</v>

1445
01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:32.460
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

1446
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:33.293
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even try to do that and </v>

1447
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.093
<v Speaker 2>they're just trying to recruit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>troops and then the also the trying to </v>

1448
01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.453
<v Speaker 2>send out a flag that they care and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're out here doing the right God </v>

1449
01:02:41.721 --> 01:02:42.554
<v Speaker 2>damn thing using my voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out here using my voice like it's </v>

1450
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1451
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:47.754
<v Speaker 2>you're being a little kid that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrupting their tribe and its ways </v>

1452
01:02:52.041 --> 01:02:54.240
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be against something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then to define what they're for.</v>

1453
01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:55.074
<v Speaker 2>If you ever asked them what their for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had this conversation quality </v>

1454
01:02:57.031 --> 01:03:00.000
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that equality where everything,</v>

1455
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:01.680
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Including comedians.</v>

1456
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 2>I want an equal number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1457
01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.520
<v Speaker 2>You see what that one Bert?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone wants to medians men and </v>

1459
01:03:08.521 --> 01:03:09.990
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the dumbest Shit I've ever heard in</v>

1460
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you funny enough to be on the stage?</v>

1461
01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1462
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Then I don't give a fuck what you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1463
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to hear that.</v>

1464
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when Jerry Seinfeld got in </v>

1465
01:03:18.781 --> 01:03:22.500
<v Speaker 2>trouble because they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why's comedian cars having coffee?</v>

1466
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:25.450
<v Speaker 2>All white guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I dunno,</v>

1467
01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 2>but you know there are a lot of funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>white guys,</v>

1468
01:03:27.361 --> 01:03:29.580
<v Speaker 2>so fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny Black guys too.</v>

1469
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:30.443
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what Jerry Seinfeld studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So essentially I don't care what color </v>

1470
01:03:32.761 --> 01:03:35.760
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I speak the language of comedy or funny.</v>

1471
01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

1472
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:40.420
<v Speaker 2>that sounds racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1473
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:45.510
<v Speaker 2>but that sounds racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dumb and you're fucking dumb.</v>

1474
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:46.733
<v Speaker 2>What would you say if you were there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that lady said that because there </v>

1475
01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:51.810
<v Speaker 2>was a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two guys are sitting in a guy and a girl</v>

1476
01:03:51.811 --> 01:03:52.644
<v Speaker 2>sitting there talking and they played </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jerry Seinfeld clip and then the </v>

1477
01:03:55.171 --> 01:03:57.270
<v Speaker 2>woman who was an African American was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1478
01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's racist.</v>

1479
01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.510
<v Speaker 2>And I was sitting at home by comic in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and most of his audiences that</v>

1480
01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:04.344
<v Speaker 2>most of his ticket pairs are white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's undeniable that most of the people </v>

1481
01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:09.750
<v Speaker 2>that go to his movies are white and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

1482
01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:11.490
<v Speaker 2>he turned it because he's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>

1483
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:12.343
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't have anything to do </v>

1484
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:13.674
<v Speaker 2>with what she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what she saying is that he's racist </v>

1485
01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.060
<v Speaker 2>because he's not having black people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>his show.</v>

1486
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he.</v>

1487
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:24.810
<v Speaker 2>And he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1488
01:04:24.811 --> 01:04:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't even care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just care.</v>

1489
01:04:26.191 --> 01:04:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Are they funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1490
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Like diversity doesn't mean anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1491
01:04:28.891 --> 01:04:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

1492
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:35.210
<v Speaker 2>that's so racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like when you say something's</v>

1493
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.710
<v Speaker 2>racist today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to back it up anymore.</v>

1494
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just back off.</v>

1495
01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're saying a white </v>
<v Speaker 2>person is racist.</v>

1496
01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.813
<v Speaker 2>If you say a white person's racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody pulls out the microphone </v>

1497
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:44.760
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1498
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.170
<v Speaker 2>My magnifying glass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>

1499
01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.600
<v Speaker 2>what have we got here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at a waste.</v>

1500
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 2>But they'll also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know it.</v>

1501
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:54.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know it.</v>

1502
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the white supremacy is everywhere</v>

1503
01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:00.590
<v Speaker 2>and will they teach that at schools now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now they teach that also at some jobs</v>

1504
01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:05.220
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to bias training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1505
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conscious bias training.</v>

1506
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:08.363
<v Speaker 2>What do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's antibiotic conscious </v>

1507
01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:11.183
<v Speaker 2>subconscious bias training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you might even realize you're </v>

1508
01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:17.470
<v Speaker 2>racist and you are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many black guys got in late?</v>

1509
01:05:17.471 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Because of all this</v>

1510
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully a lot.</v>

1511
01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>A lot of hippie white chicks just want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show they're not racist.</v>

1512
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just got it out of his dick down.</v>

1513
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Amy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1514
01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:30.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the choir jerking off.</v>

1515
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:35.250
<v Speaker 1>What's in crying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird,</v>

1516
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:36.011
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

1517
01:05:36.011 --> 01:05:36.844
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen us so divided and part </v>

1518
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:41.630
<v Speaker 1>of it has to do with trump for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like this reaction like that.</v>

1519
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:46.180
<v Speaker 1>They feel like I'm really obligated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

1520
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>People feel obligated to act and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things change,</v>

1521
01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>which I think is ultimately good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this thing,</v>

1522
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>the all what's going on right now does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not concern me nearly as much as it does</v>

1523
01:05:55.061 --> 01:05:55.894
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other people because I feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like people are already reacting to it </v>

1524
01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.480
<v Speaker 1>and already going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck you know,</v>

1525
01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:02.314
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ship is already starting to </v>

1526
01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:04.564
<v Speaker 1>write itself.</v>

1527
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.673
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Oscars was the lowest rated I think </v>

1528
01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:08.494
<v Speaker 1>in the history of the Oscar heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a 26 million people </v>

1529
01:06:11.831 --> 01:06:13.780
<v Speaker 1>watched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of fucking people.</v>

1530
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't Shit on someone who got 26 million</v>

1531
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:21.340
<v Speaker 1>people were afraid to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get very kind of like,</v>

1532
01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.900
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting political here.</v>

1533
01:06:22.901 --> 01:06:26.560
<v Speaker 1>And when they looked at the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers where they were comparing it</v>

1534
01:06:26.561 --> 01:06:30.820
<v Speaker 1>to like 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were down $5 million from 2013,</v>

1535
01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what was it around 2013 Netflix.</v>

1536
01:06:34.061 --> 01:06:36.010
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more shit to watch.</v>

1537
01:06:36.011 --> 01:06:37.690
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it down from last year?</v>

1538
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:40.450
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely people that are bored</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Hollywood though,</v>

1539
01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>like enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1540
01:06:41.801 --> 01:06:42.634
<v Speaker 1>they Hollywood's overreach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Hollywood tends to be what </v>

1541
01:06:45.281 --> 01:06:48.160
<v Speaker 1>bothers me about Hollywood is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtuous virtue signaling,</v>

1542
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:51.940
<v Speaker 1>like they're going to set an example you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking guys like you want to be liked.</v>

1543
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're as fickle as it gets.</v>

1544
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:55.893
<v Speaker 1>They were the same people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up and clapping for Roman </v>

1545
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Polanski.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry man.</v>

1546
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them were.</v>

1547
01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were really saying some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit.</v>

1548
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on guys.</v>

1549
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time ago and he's drugged </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sodomized at 13 year old.</v>

1550
01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I think he was like more than one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1551
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:12.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so guess what?</v>

1552
01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't have that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not kidding.</v>

1553
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:17.560
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to sign a petition to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>them back in the country.</v>

1554
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't forgive that.</v>

1555
01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay in France.</v>

1556
01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:22.323
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to bring it back to the </v>

1557
01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:26.530
<v Speaker 1>country to arrest them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really trying hard to do that.</v>

1558
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:28.263
<v Speaker 1>And there's people that resist that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an amazing artist and you </v>

1559
01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:34.030
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists are just be consistent though.</v>

1560
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.310
<v Speaker 1>You can't system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I draw the line.</v>

1561
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:39.010
<v Speaker 1>You can't drug kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck with Asia Argento,</v>

1562
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:39.873
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the people that came out against </v>

1563
01:07:40.961 --> 01:07:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had been raped by him apparently,</v>

1564
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:46.750
<v Speaker 1>and then she had a sexual relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 10 years afterwards,</v>

1565
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:48.010
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>

1566
01:07:48.011 --> 01:07:48.844
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I actually forgive that because </v>

1567
01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:51.430
<v Speaker 1>people go back to the trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1568
01:07:51.431 --> 01:07:52.690
<v Speaker 1>They want to relive it on their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>

1569
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>but she signed the petition to for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Roman Polanski to,</v>

1570
01:07:56.710 --> 01:08:00.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be freed when he was put under arrest</v>

1571
01:08:00.221 --> 01:08:03.910
<v Speaker 1>and I believe it was Switzerland and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not consistent.</v>

1572
01:08:03.911 --> 01:08:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1573
01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>But if that guy is just as bad as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1574
01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:11.050
<v Speaker 1>you can see the petition online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was her perspective?</v>

1575
01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:12.963
<v Speaker 1>She was somebody who thought Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polanski should not be prosecuted for </v>

1576
01:08:17.331 --> 01:08:20.240
<v Speaker 1>something that happened a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She signed that petition.</v>

1577
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:21.950
<v Speaker 1>I would never sign that petition.</v>

1578
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:22.993
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a big problem with that sort </v>

1579
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:26.030
<v Speaker 1>of disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

1580
01:08:26.031 --> 01:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know her.</v>

1581
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1582
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:30.163
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe what she says about Harvey </v>

1583
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.493
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1584
01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:34.940
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1585
01:08:34.941 --> 01:08:35.774
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well she went back to the scene of the </v>

1586
01:08:36.471 --> 01:08:37.304
<v Speaker 1>crime that's very common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't sign a petition and then now </v>

1587
01:08:40.251 --> 01:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>be this leading voice in this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:08:43.191 --> 01:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>anti harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very inconsistent.</v>

1589
01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to at least answer to that.</v>

1590
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Did she comment on once she saw there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a mia culpa there,</v>

1591
01:08:51.771 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's very inconsistent in it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that out there.</v>

1592
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that we should make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that she definitely did that.</v>

1593
01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:00.240
<v Speaker 1>You'll see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just see if you can go the young dreamy.</v>

1594
01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.460
<v Speaker 1>It feels like something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1595
01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I looked it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually looked it up.</v>

1596
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see who had signed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>petition.</v>

1597
01:09:07.161 --> 01:09:09.080
<v Speaker 1>I came across her name and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1598
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:11.900
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1599
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.460
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1600
01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about what happened.</v>

1601
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I know that he drugged in some younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

1602
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:29.500
<v Speaker 1>She was 13 and her mom dropped her off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was there.</v>

1603
01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.860
<v Speaker 1>It was the seventies men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would just relationship every bit</v>

1604
01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:35.710
<v Speaker 1>of 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit the year.</v>

1605
01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1606
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.293
<v Speaker 1>but I believe he knew she was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he knew he was going to go away to </v>

1607
01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:46.151
<v Speaker 1>jail and he left the country to Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ and say.</v>

1608
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.080
<v Speaker 1>And then apparently there's another </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman that he had done that too.</v>

1609
01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:55.010
<v Speaker 1>So imagine being on the scene back then.</v>

1610
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.113
<v Speaker 1>How weird that must have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there had been like think about </v>

1611
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:00.043
<v Speaker 1>Roman Polanski,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making movies and like what the 19 </v>

1612
01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:02.390
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1613
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean God trying to town.</v>

1614
01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.660
<v Speaker 1>It's only only days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1615
01:10:05.661 --> 01:10:06.494
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they'd only been making movies for </v>

1616
01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 1>like a few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a real new thing.</v>

1617
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:14.060
<v Speaker 1>She signed the petition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I found a tweet she just put,</v>

1618
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:16.880
<v Speaker 1>she put out a couple months ago where </v>
<v Speaker 1>she said she regretted doing it.</v>

1619
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regretted the signing the petition years</v>

1620
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said a mistake robin plants.</v>

1621
01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:23.690
<v Speaker 1>He's a filmmaker whose work at meijer </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly,</v>

1622
01:10:23.691 --> 01:10:26.270
<v Speaker 1>but if I ever see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll spit in his face if he's lucky.</v>

1623
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you signed petition already.</v>

1624
01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Regretted signing the petition years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>already felt it was a mistake.</v>

1625
01:10:31.941 --> 01:10:32.774
<v Speaker 1>No excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was stupid with this indicates a </v>

1626
01:10:34.321 --> 01:10:35.154
<v Speaker 1>pattern of behavior that if true and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it to be true is beyond </v>

1627
01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:39.140
<v Speaker 1>unforgivable.</v>

1628
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:40.183
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1629
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a good point though about you.</v>

1630
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.673
<v Speaker 1>She made a mistake in there is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to people that have been </v>

1631
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:50.720
<v Speaker 1>violated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they blame themselves.</v>

1632
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:51.583
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm paying for that and there could </v>

1633
01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:56.310
<v Speaker 1>be a little of that in her decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>making process to.</v>

1634
01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be a little bit of wanting to be</v>

1635
01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:01.070
<v Speaker 1>in with Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1636
01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:03.860
<v Speaker 1>that's not ethically or morally </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent.</v>

1637
01:11:03.861 --> 01:11:04.694
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she fucked up and she realized she </v>

1638
01:11:05.721 --> 01:11:07.850
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're also coming after people now,</v>

1639
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:09.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're gonna,</v>

1640
01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.633
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to end and a lot of these </v>

1641
01:11:11.751 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve to become after.</v>

1642
01:11:14.881 --> 01:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to be consistent here.</v>

1643
01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't she begins being consistent by</v>

1644
01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:21.870
<v Speaker 1>just saying that she fucked up and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that she fucked up.</v>

1645
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:22.704
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people are saying </v>

1646
01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:24.063
<v Speaker 1>that once they get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that petition the petition doesn't </v>

1647
01:11:26.521 --> 01:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>mean Jack Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ain't letting him.</v>

1648
01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.500
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He signed it and it was at.</v>

1649
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.153
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody that would sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and like I would never sign that </v>

1650
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>petition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm trying to say.</v>

1651
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:35.873
<v Speaker 1>Being consistent if I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the guy came to America and got </v>

1652
01:11:40.471 --> 01:11:44.460
<v Speaker 1>arrested and went through the trial and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then got convicted,</v>

1653
01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:47.250
<v Speaker 1>how much time would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1654
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:54.380
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is like would it be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better karmically to go to jail for what</v>

1655
01:11:57.001 --> 01:11:59.250
<v Speaker 1>he did come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to jail and then no one.</v>

1656
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would always know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you got out that you were convicted</v>

1657
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:06.960
<v Speaker 1>and you were punished for child </v>
<v Speaker 1>molestation,</v>

1658
01:12:06.961 --> 01:12:09.660
<v Speaker 1>like you did it and they got you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would know.</v>

1659
01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:10.523
<v Speaker 1>Whereas now he's living in France and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to deal with it floating over his </v>

1660
01:12:14.311 --> 01:12:15.144
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who meets me knows that I </v>

1661
01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:21.861
<v Speaker 1>drugged and raped a kid everywhere I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows a drugged and raped a kid</v>

1662
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.640
<v Speaker 1>and it just keeps playing out in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head all day long.</v>

1663
01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Public shaming is powerful shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1664
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1665
01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:35.070
<v Speaker 1>this is drugging and raping a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a forgiving guy.</v>

1666
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Can't figure that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1667
01:12:36.511 --> 01:12:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a forgiving dude,</v>

1668
01:12:39.031 --> 01:12:39.864
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't stay mad and I think it's good </v>

1669
01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:42.630
<v Speaker 1>to be forgiving about things.</v>

1670
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:45.240
<v Speaker 1>There are certain things that to me when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1671
01:12:45.241 --> 01:12:47.910
<v Speaker 1>and he's a great filmmaker and a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>artist for me,</v>

1672
01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:50.550
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult,</v>

1673
01:12:50.551 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult.</v>

1674
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:53.694
<v Speaker 1>I had an argument with a bunch of older </v>
<v Speaker 1>actors about this and they were all </v>

1675
01:12:56.221 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 1>saying it was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looked up and I was like,</v>

1676
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:02.340
<v Speaker 1>if it was your daughter and she was 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you feel?</v>

1677
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:04.640
<v Speaker 1>You just got to keep going back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1678
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:06.540
<v Speaker 1>especially if you actually have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>

1679
01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.613
<v Speaker 1>you actually have a daughter that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not conceptualizing that your </v>

1680
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:12.270
<v Speaker 1>gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually locked into your brain.</v>

1681
01:13:12.271 --> 01:13:13.104
<v Speaker 1>You're actually thinking about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter and it becomes a different </v>

1682
01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.420
<v Speaker 1>completely different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking when I was young,</v>

1683
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:19.560
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.260
<v Speaker 1>If someone did that to my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it was like before I had a kid,</v>

1685
01:13:22.261 --> 01:13:23.094
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just a weird concept that </v>

1686
01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.910
<v Speaker 1>didn't seem real.</v>

1687
01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:29.730
<v Speaker 1>But now you think about this 13 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl and you're like,</v>

1688
01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:30.564
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what a court would do and what a </v>

1689
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:36.420
<v Speaker 1>trial would do is you might hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

1690
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might hear.</v>

1691
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

1692
01:13:40.591 --> 01:13:43.860
<v Speaker 1>she said she was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about drugging,</v>

1693
01:13:43.861 --> 01:13:45.420
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She smoked a little weed that,</v>

1694
01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.790
<v Speaker 1>that guy gave her over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be careful.</v>

1695
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:48.624
<v Speaker 1>Right then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you start hearing all the </v>

1696
01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:53.220
<v Speaker 1>extenuating circumstances and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would go,</v>

1697
01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.193
<v Speaker 1>you got to do the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least I get how that happened </v>

1698
01:13:56.911 --> 01:13:58.410
<v Speaker 1>because you thought it was something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1699
01:13:58.411 --> 01:13:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was your intention?</v>

1700
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.130
<v Speaker 1>What did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know that.</v>

1701
01:14:02.131 --> 01:14:04.740
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is we start and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this too,</v>

1702
01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and I'm doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1703
01:14:05.881 --> 01:14:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know all the details of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

1704
01:14:07.181 --> 01:14:08.014
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all I'm saying is that he drugged </v>

1705
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>and sodomized a 13 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's goal that everyone</v>

1706
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.210
<v Speaker 2>was drugged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him included.</v>

1707
01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this what I'm saying,</v>

1708
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:15.664
<v Speaker 2>so we all have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have to be careful and I have to </v>

1709
01:14:17.431 --> 01:14:17.901
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm,</v>

1710
01:14:17.901 --> 01:14:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of breaking my own rule here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1711
01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm drawing these very strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardened fast,</v>

1712
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.943
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's no context and what I'm </v>

1713
01:14:27.341 --> 01:14:29.440
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no nuance in what I'm saying.</v>

1714
01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:30.910
<v Speaker 2>There's no context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1715
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:31.953
<v Speaker 2>And you got to be careful because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is nuanced and context in a </v>

1716
01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:35.014
<v Speaker 2>way otherwise otherwise you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you're taking me at just the </v>

1717
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:40.430
<v Speaker 2>words I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm seeing from this,</v>

1718
01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:43.450
<v Speaker 2>this is like she's upset and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>

1719
01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Like she's upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She signed it and Europe said she signed</v>

1720
01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:47.194
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean nearly as much to </v>

1721
01:14:49.661 --> 01:14:50.494
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people making a mistake like her </v>

1722
01:14:52.151 --> 01:14:55.240
<v Speaker 2>making that mistake doesn't mean much to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1723
01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't give it.</v>

1724
01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1725
01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.860
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no consequences.</v>

1726
01:14:59.861 --> 01:15:02.170
<v Speaker 2>No one got hurt because of that mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1727
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Like it was a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She fucked up,</v>

1728
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:08.050
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't ultimately hurt anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't.</v>

1729
01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:08.973
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the fact that someone would</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least temporarily have that thought </v>

1730
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:13.300
<v Speaker 2>in their mind like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy should be free,</v>

1731
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.830
<v Speaker 2>like leave him alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's bygones be bygones.</v>

1732
01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Actually talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1733
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.050
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm talking about.dot</v>

1734
01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood tends to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just using her as an example.</v>

1735
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood tends to do that which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular,</v>

1736
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.513
<v Speaker 2>that which is going to make them liked </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than something that's morally or </v>

1737
01:15:31.061 --> 01:15:33.170
<v Speaker 2>ethically consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>

1738
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.593
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it all comes down to the whole </v>

1739
01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:40.720
<v Speaker 2>process of being chosen to do things </v>
<v Speaker 2>with being chosen to direct or chosen to</v>

1740
01:15:40.721 --> 01:15:41.554
<v Speaker 2>act or chosen.</v>

1741
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's constantly working to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>chosen.</v>

1742
01:15:43.631 --> 01:15:45.460
<v Speaker 2>You're all trying to audition for </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1743
01:15:45.461 --> 01:15:47.950
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to angle to get a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>role.</v>

1744
01:15:47.951 --> 01:15:50.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a constant process of like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like me,</v>

1745
01:15:50.261 --> 01:15:53.950
<v Speaker 2>like me and these are people that go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this job with his yearning,</v>

1746
01:15:53.951 --> 01:15:54.784
<v Speaker 2>desire to be loved and then on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're playing this weird </v>

1747
01:15:57.491 --> 01:15:58.600
<v Speaker 2>political game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1748
01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:00.700
<v Speaker 2>acting is all political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1749
01:16:00.701 --> 01:16:01.534
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense that every </v>
<v Speaker 2>other occupation except maybe tech </v>

1750
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:09.130
<v Speaker 2>tech's probably like mostly mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>

1751
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:10.383
<v Speaker 2>but Hollywood is almost exclusively </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal and if you step out of those </v>

1752
01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:14.360
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to work with you anyway.</v>

1753
01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.273
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood on the surface is liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually nobody who's conservative </v>

1754
01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.350
<v Speaker 2>or whatever will speak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1755
01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Like Tim Allen lost his show because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

1756
01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Because he's conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an old white guy.</v>

1757
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:26.720
<v Speaker 2>What are you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1758
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 2>white guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1759
01:16:27.971 --> 01:16:28.990
<v Speaker 2>that's apparently golf.</v>

1760
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:30.363
<v Speaker 2>Probably a very real thing nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started hanging out with Dennis </v>

1761
01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>

1762
01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:38.690
<v Speaker 2>He went fucking James.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Woods is crazy.</v>

1763
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.660
<v Speaker 2>James Woods is arguing with people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

1764
01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Like James,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 70 years old.</v>

1765
01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many days you got left?</v>

1766
01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:44.493
<v Speaker 2>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many moments in your life do you </v>

1767
01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 2>really have left?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a thousand?</v>

1768
01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:48.641
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

1769
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:50.230
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 of them on twitter.</v>

1770
01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not wise.</v>

1771
01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.473
<v Speaker 2>That's not a wise lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said he was blackballed for his </v>

1772
01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:56.740
<v Speaker 2>conservative views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he really?</v>

1773
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1774
01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

1775
01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1776
01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1777
01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm being helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1778
01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:08.260
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1779
01:17:08.261 --> 01:17:10.970
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call out certain people.</v>

1780
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.833
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking about the inconsistency </v>
<v Speaker 2>is most people are doing the best they </v>

1781
01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:16.640
<v Speaker 2>can and trying to make the world a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better place.</v>

1782
01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.473
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think most people would just look </v>

1783
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:23.380
<v Speaker 2>rolling downhill in a hamster wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks,</v>

1784
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:25.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure out how to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking thing.</v>

1785
01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are just on full on </v>

1786
01:17:27.711 --> 01:17:28.544
<v Speaker 2>momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are definitely not thinking </v>

1787
01:17:30.051 --> 01:17:31.850
<v Speaker 2>about how to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the world a better place.</v>

1788
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.863
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally people think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they try to think is how do I get </v>

1789
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:38.420
<v Speaker 2>buy number one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then how do I get better?</v>

1790
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Speaker 2>How do I get ahead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>

1791
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.860
<v Speaker 2>those are the things they think of and </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally what's going on?</v>

1792
01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.230
<v Speaker 2>What's up it over there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1793
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.313
<v Speaker 2>Fucking trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they go back to work until you </v>

1794
01:17:47.421 --> 01:17:48.750
<v Speaker 2>can do sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's most people like James Woods.</v>

1796
01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jesus James,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>

1797
01:17:53.631 --> 01:17:55.970
<v Speaker 2>but you're not changing hearts and minds</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter.</v>

1798
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:59.980
<v Speaker 2>While the funny shit though sometimes I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to say like funny guy,</v>

1799
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.160
<v Speaker 2>the biggest thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1800
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.940
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to persuade anybody.</v>

1801
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.900
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking like I was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>why would the times I've changed my mind</v>

1802
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:12.320
<v Speaker 2>hard to change my mind was I never </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed it in an argument.</v>

1803
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:13.711
<v Speaker 2>Change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1804
01:18:13.711 --> 01:18:15.470
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I changed it in a conversation.</v>

1805
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind changing my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's important too.</v>

1806
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:19.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>

1807
01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I've changed my mind before and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>got mad at me,</v>

1808
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:24.830
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You change your mind like,</v>

1809
01:18:24.831 --> 01:18:26.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I changed my mind.</v>

1810
01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I learned some new stuff and then went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1811
01:18:27.921 --> 01:18:31.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't defend this old idea and I'm not</v>

1812
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:32.600
<v Speaker 2>an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>

1813
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:34.070
<v Speaker 2>The first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

1814
01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.880
<v Speaker 2>what's the first rule?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And being a scientist doubt,</v>

1815
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:37.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance.</v>

1816
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:38.623
<v Speaker 2>You don't know anything and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make sure that you're responsive to </v>

1817
01:18:41.991 --> 01:18:42.824
<v Speaker 2>the evidence and then if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you build up a whole reputation </v>

1818
01:18:45.591 --> 01:18:46.424
<v Speaker 2>on your conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be willing to change or </v>

1819
01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:50.540
<v Speaker 2>conclusion based upon new evidence.</v>

1820
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:53.150
<v Speaker 2>And you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a finished product.</v>

1821
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1822
01:18:54.201 --> 01:18:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Your finished product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1823
01:18:55.221 --> 01:18:56.390
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a verb.</v>

1824
01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm.</v>

1825
01:18:57.810 --> 01:18:59.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely smarter than I was three </v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago.</v>

1826
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:00.953
<v Speaker 2>It's different person to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about how about the differences in </v>

1827
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:06.230
<v Speaker 2>you when you were 28 and now it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human person.</v>

1828
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally different human.</v>

1829
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that raises an interesting question </v>

1830
01:19:11.181 --> 01:19:13.220
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>

1831
01:19:13.221 --> 01:19:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you're a very different person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you did something awful?</v>

1832
01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Then let's maybe murder and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1833
01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Should they let you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1834
01:19:18.591 --> 01:19:21.320
<v Speaker 2>and now at 51,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so different than when I was 21.</v>

1835
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was such a moron.</v>

1836
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:24.583
<v Speaker 2>I was a moron at 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember feeling that awkward lack of </v>

1837
01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.264
<v Speaker 2>control I had for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like feeling how awkward it was and we </v>

1838
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.863
<v Speaker 2>wishing I had more composure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember actively feeling that at 21 </v>

1839
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.943
<v Speaker 2>that it was so impulsive and so crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wished I was more composed and I </v>

1840
01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:42.620
<v Speaker 2>would see people that had their shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and I would really admire them.</v>

1841
01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I look at that guy all composed and shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>dressed nice,</v>

1842
01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.910
<v Speaker 2>knows what to say when not to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1843
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.720
<v Speaker 2>blurt things out that I should never </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1844
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.010
<v Speaker 2>How about the way you look?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do.</v>

1845
01:19:52.011 --> 01:19:52.844
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about the way I looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things like women and their </v>

1846
01:19:55.311 --> 01:19:58.020
<v Speaker 2>capabilities when I was a young man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

1847
01:19:58.190 --> 01:19:59.023
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed me in looking at women in in </v>

1848
01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:04.520
<v Speaker 2>a different light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC and having children with a woman</v>

1849
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.540
<v Speaker 2>and watching how good she wasn't raising</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and all the things that that takes,</v>

1850
01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:10.523
<v Speaker 2>that's a certain type of strength and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then watching women like paige vanzant </v>

1851
01:20:13.831 --> 01:20:14.664
<v Speaker 2>fight three rounds with a broken arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was all something that I </v>

1852
01:20:17.761 --> 01:20:18.594
<v Speaker 2>didn't think belonged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was an arena I was not aware of </v>

1853
01:20:20.851 --> 01:20:21.684
<v Speaker 2>that kind of feminine strength or </v>
<v Speaker 2>fortitude or whatever you want to call </v>

1854
01:20:25.471 --> 01:20:26.010
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1855
01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:30.480
<v Speaker 2>It causes me to look at that gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently than I did before.</v>

1856
01:20:30.481 --> 01:20:33.480
<v Speaker 2>So in a lot of ways I'm a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and as you get older,</v>

1857
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:36.480
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the world differently as you are</v>

1858
01:20:36.481 --> 01:20:41.481
<v Speaker 2>exposed to more data and exposed to more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and different paradigms and examples and</v>

1859
01:20:42.391 --> 01:20:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a good thing.</v>

1860
01:20:44.290 --> 01:20:45.750
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>

1861
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:46.663
<v Speaker 2>The female male debate back and forth is</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous because people vary so much </v>

1862
01:20:51.301 --> 01:20:54.150
<v Speaker 2>inside those groups that for someone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1863
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:54.984
<v Speaker 2>all women do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are all thinking this will be </v>

1864
01:20:56.741 --> 01:20:57.181
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1865
01:20:57.181 --> 01:20:59.040
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

1866
01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:01.950
<v Speaker 2>That's just as stupid as saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men do moon all dues.</v>

1867
01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:03.600
<v Speaker 2>All mandus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1868
01:21:03.601 --> 01:21:04.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not.</v>

1869
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:06.630
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it fucking human beings.</v>

1870
01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:07.493
<v Speaker 2>There's a great number of men that do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stupid thing and a great number of </v>

1871
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:11.004
<v Speaker 2>women that say this annoying thing is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great number of people that are just </v>

1872
01:21:14.461 --> 01:21:15.810
<v Speaker 2>looking to skate by in this life.</v>

1873
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a great number of dummies,</v>

1874
01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.180
<v Speaker 2>there's a great number of really </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspirational,</v>

1875
01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:22.014
<v Speaker 2>fantastic people that also have vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them had really smart </v>

1876
01:21:25.801 --> 01:21:26.634
<v Speaker 2>ones that blow your mind in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and they just happen to be </v>

1877
01:21:29.401 --> 01:21:30.234
<v Speaker 2>female and there's a lot of them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just happened to be male and they </v>

1878
01:21:32.811 --> 01:21:33.644
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That male who happens to be fucking </v>

1879
01:21:35.401 --> 01:21:36.234
<v Speaker 2>brilliant and articulate and mindblowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>has almost no fucking relation to some </v>

1880
01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.480
<v Speaker 2>idiot shithead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ditch digger asshole.</v>

1881
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:46.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which nothing wrong with taking digital </v>

1882
01:21:47.221 --> 01:21:48.054
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't dig ditches if you're an </v>

1883
01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.400
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to be.</v>

1884
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:51.533
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like if one of the things </v>

1885
01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:53.334
<v Speaker 2>I noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of people from different </v>

1886
01:21:53.881 --> 01:21:56.140
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to Nigeria in this corner,</v>

1887
01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.380
<v Speaker 2>you've got Pakistan in that corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got China in that corner,</v>

1888
01:21:58.381 --> 01:21:59.214
<v Speaker 2>you've got fucking America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a white guy from Iowa when they </v>

1889
01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:02.184
<v Speaker 2>all have to get food out to a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in a restaurant or they gotta </v>

1890
01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.650
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to run a business </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1891
01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:09.900
<v Speaker 2>All that shit didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has time for that shit.</v>

1892
01:22:09.901 --> 01:22:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's kind of working toward a </v>
<v Speaker 2>common goal.</v>

1893
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you actually have something important</v>

1894
01:22:14.011 --> 01:22:15.620
<v Speaker 2>to deal with when you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>something important to do,</v>

1895
01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.473
<v Speaker 2>start looking at like weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I fucking hate ginger's Ginger's </v>

1896
01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:21.294
<v Speaker 2>role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The devil.</v>

1897
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Now you start looking at things </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1898
01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:27.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start looking at the differences and</v>

1899
01:22:27.211 --> 01:22:29.860
<v Speaker 2>getting annoyed with stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1900
01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all human beings,</v>

1901
01:22:31.651 --> 01:22:34.140
<v Speaker 2>just like your son have a physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement.</v>

1902
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:37.530
<v Speaker 2>There is a bond requirement that we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>have with each other.</v>

1903
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a love requirement that we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>have with each other.</v>

1904
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:41.603
<v Speaker 2>We have to get a certain amount of love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to have a certain amount of </v>

1905
01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:44.004
<v Speaker 2>bonding and comradery with the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you and these needs should be </v>

1906
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:48.623
<v Speaker 2>legit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they give you like a vitamin C </v>

1907
01:22:50.041 --> 01:22:50.630
<v Speaker 2>chart.</v>

1908
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:53.190
<v Speaker 2>USD,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recommended daily allowance of Vitamin</v>

1909
01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:54.023
<v Speaker 2>C.</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this recommended daily allowance of </v>

1910
01:22:56.130 --> 01:22:58.380
<v Speaker 2>iron?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that like all that stuff is important</v>

1911
01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:59.333
<v Speaker 2>for your body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have an equally important </v>

1912
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:04.740
<v Speaker 2>requirement for your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind?</v>

1913
01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.713
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for just your physical being like </v>

1914
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:12.560
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily your body in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like nutrition but just love and warmth.</v>

1915
01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:13.403
<v Speaker 2>Like the human touch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the babies will die if you </v>

1916
01:23:15.221 --> 01:23:15.940
<v Speaker 2>don't touch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1917
01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called failure to thrive.</v>

1918
01:23:17.650 --> 01:23:20.530
<v Speaker 2>So in hospitals when they have babies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't have parents,</v>

1919
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.840
<v Speaker 2>they have people that come around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold the babies.</v>

1920
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:26.410
<v Speaker 2>She's not held.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can feed the baby and everything.</v>

1921
01:23:26.411 --> 01:23:28.480
<v Speaker 2>If the baby's not held,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the baby will die.</v>

1922
01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:29.643
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to be touched by another human </v>

1923
01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:32.010
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A baby has to.</v>

1924
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like water or food.</v>

1925
01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.280
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that this,</v>

1926
01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:39.114
<v Speaker 2>this is being violated in schools when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you teach in little kids with tons of </v>

1927
01:23:42.491 --> 01:23:43.324
<v Speaker 2>energy and the way they cope with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>violation is give those kids medication </v>

1928
01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:49.630
<v Speaker 2>that makes them conform and we just </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept that.</v>

1929
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:50.643
<v Speaker 2>And then people get on anti anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>medication and people get on all this </v>

1930
01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:53.944
<v Speaker 2>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that medication and how many of these </v>

1931
01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:55.864
<v Speaker 2>medications are clearly described </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your life sucks or prescribed </v>

1932
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:01.390
<v Speaker 2>rather because your life sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of them is it?</v>

1933
01:24:01.391 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Half?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it 30 percent?</v>

1934
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:04.503
<v Speaker 2>Like what number of people actually have</v>
<v Speaker 2>something wrong with their brain and </v>

1935
01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:07.504
<v Speaker 2>what number of people have something </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with their brain because their </v>

1936
01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:09.790
<v Speaker 2>life sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1937
01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:14.680
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate going over this same subject over</v>

1938
01:24:14.681 --> 01:24:17.550
<v Speaker 2>and over again because it's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1939
01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:21.160
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to hard to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers because it all depends.</v>

1940
01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.380
<v Speaker 2>It's drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to Andy Galpin about that.</v>

1941
01:24:23.381 --> 01:24:24.214
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1942
01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1943
01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 2>is this vitamin good for you or is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement could fee or is this.</v>

1944
01:24:28.361 --> 01:24:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I was showing him stuff I take and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1945
01:24:29.861 --> 01:24:32.920
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just depends on your body.</v>

1946
01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.530
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing with your body,</v>

1947
01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.370
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

1948
01:24:36.370 --> 01:24:40.090
<v Speaker 2>what is your routine like on a daily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a weekly basis,</v>

1949
01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:42.160
<v Speaker 2>what kind of stresses you putting your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body on?</v>

1950
01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Some things work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some things don't.</v>

1951
01:24:43.811 --> 01:24:46.180
<v Speaker 2>There is no clear cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single variable answer.</v>

1952
01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.133
<v Speaker 2>It's just so fascinating that all of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies have different requirements </v>

1953
01:24:49.571 --> 01:24:52.150
<v Speaker 2>because we literally developed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the world.</v>

1954
01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I know and scooted over here in a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started fucking each other.</v>

1955
01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:57.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at you.</v>

1956
01:24:57.311 --> 01:24:58.144
<v Speaker 2>Allergic to cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all just weird things that stuck </v>

1957
01:25:01.811 --> 01:25:02.644
<v Speaker 2>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do better with goat dairy and me too </v>

1958
01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:08.740
<v Speaker 2>and I do with Mediterranean than I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Holstein cow dairy dude.</v>

1959
01:25:08.741 --> 01:25:10.000
<v Speaker 2>My daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she was little,</v>

1960
01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:11.860
<v Speaker 2>she would throw up if she drank cow's </v>
<v Speaker 2>milk,</v>

1961
01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:14.740
<v Speaker 2>but she would drink goat's milk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd have no problem with it at all.</v>

1962
01:25:14.890 --> 01:25:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

1963
01:25:16.151 --> 01:25:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like human dairy.</v>

1964
01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you fuck with raw milk at all?</v>

1965
01:25:20.230 --> 01:25:21.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>

1966
01:25:21.011 --> 01:25:24.040
<v Speaker 2>but not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fuck with raw goat milk.</v>

1967
01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:25.323
<v Speaker 2>I can't do raw milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A cow would rather get raw goat milk </v>

1968
01:25:27.881 --> 01:25:28.714
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they treat goats the way they treat </v>

1969
01:25:30.971 --> 01:25:33.310
<v Speaker 2>cows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figure if you're running goats,</v>

1970
01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:34.493
<v Speaker 2>you probably like a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal friendly goat milk in the world </v>

1971
01:25:37.721 --> 01:25:42.721
<v Speaker 2>from this amish from the Amish Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's which and creamy and delicious.</v>

1972
01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.433
<v Speaker 2>Would you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go on a limb here and guess would </v>

1973
01:25:47.261 --> 01:25:52.261
<v Speaker 2>you imagine there's factory farming of </v>
<v Speaker 2>goats like milking commercial large?</v>

1974
01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>

1975
01:25:54.011 --> 01:25:54.844
<v Speaker 2>Like I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain ultra pasteurized milk </v>

1976
01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:58.840
<v Speaker 2>called Meyers that I get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's really good,</v>

1977
01:25:58.841 --> 01:26:01.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's ultra pasteurized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure that's that.</v>

1978
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:03.500
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>factory farming,</v>

1979
01:26:03.501 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem,</v>

1980
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we want consistency in our food.</v>

1981
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:09.920
<v Speaker 1>So you want to buy eggs and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to buy a carton of eggs,</v>

1982
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:13.870
<v Speaker 1>you know they're going to cost a dollar </v>
<v Speaker 1>50 or $2 and 50 or $3 and 50,</v>

1983
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:14.713
<v Speaker 1>whatever you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that they're going to cost a </v>

1984
01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:16.154
<v Speaker 1>certain amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't go to the store and one day </v>

1985
01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:20.870
<v Speaker 1>they're three slash 50 and the next day </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're $12.</v>

1986
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:21.883
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we figured out a way to create </v>

1987
01:26:25.701 --> 01:26:26.534
<v Speaker 1>enough eggs so that there is enough of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot so that we can keep the price at a </v>

1988
01:26:29.901 --> 01:26:30.734
<v Speaker 1>certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with if you had all these </v>

1989
01:26:33.351 --> 01:26:34.640
<v Speaker 1>family farms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1990
01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:35.503
<v Speaker 1>Which I've always been a fan as I always</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about family farms versus factory </v>

1991
01:26:38.301 --> 01:26:39.140
<v Speaker 1>farms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

1992
01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Brian never done a day of farming in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking life.</v>

1993
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Don't know anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I done my reading.</v>

1994
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:48.530
<v Speaker 1>So here's Brian again with his point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view because he's read some stuff and he</v>

1995
01:26:48.531 --> 01:26:50.960
<v Speaker 1>likes eating at Erewhon and whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1996
01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Because I can afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like family.</v>

1997
01:26:53.781 --> 01:26:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like family's family.</v>

1998
01:26:56.301 --> 01:26:57.134
<v Speaker 1>Farming is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that if you look at the </v>

1999
01:27:00.771 --> 01:27:01.604
<v Speaker 1>way farming it works is that some family</v>
<v Speaker 1>farms aren't as good as other family </v>

2000
01:27:06.681 --> 01:27:09.410
<v Speaker 1>farms for a thousand reasons that is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>as productive,</v>

2001
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.273
<v Speaker 1>not as proficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would happen is that family </v>

2002
01:27:11.871 --> 01:27:12.950
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey bro,</v>

2003
01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a chicken farmer too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not doing it right.</v>

2004
01:27:16.191 --> 01:27:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Let me buy your farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy your farm for 15 times.</v>

2005
01:27:20.031 --> 01:27:21.980
<v Speaker 1>What it's worth right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need the money,</v>

2006
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.713
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to secretly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to make my money back </v>

2007
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:28.970
<v Speaker 1>because I know how I knew how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than that guy and then I do that.</v>

2008
01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.193
<v Speaker 1>Now I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go and buy a machine that's actually </v>

2009
01:27:32.811 --> 01:27:35.360
<v Speaker 1>faster and I go to the next form and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2010
01:27:35.361 --> 01:27:36.194
<v Speaker 1>hey bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to compete with me on </v>

2011
01:27:37.641 --> 01:27:39.380
<v Speaker 1>the market anyway and you're not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2012
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Sell me your farm and what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to go fuck you?</v>

2013
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Not because you're not a city slicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a farmer himself talking to.</v>

2014
01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't like your attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Bro,</v>

2015
01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:54.110
<v Speaker 1>my fucking phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could give you a deal.</v>

2016
01:27:54.111 --> 01:27:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

2017
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I not to make A.</v>

2018
01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people.</v>

2019
01:27:58.311 --> 01:28:02.000
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with factory farm is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lack of moral standards,</v>

2020
01:28:02.150 --> 01:28:04.610
<v Speaker 1>like when they shove these chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these little boxes.</v>

2021
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.593
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is we've adapted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ecosystem that we operate under and </v>

2022
01:28:09.471 --> 01:28:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the ecosystem that we operate under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get free food basically.</v>

2023
01:28:12.661 --> 01:28:13.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Free Food,</v>

2024
01:28:13.431 --> 01:28:15.790
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of protein.</v>

2025
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:16.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2026
01:28:16.511 --> 01:28:17.344
<v Speaker 1>it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The food is just coming in and the eggs </v>

2027
01:28:18.831 --> 01:28:19.664
<v Speaker 1>are everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so someone's got to be able to make all </v>

2028
01:28:21.411 --> 01:28:22.244
<v Speaker 1>those eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we sort of develop these areas and </v>

2029
01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:29.990
<v Speaker 1>stacked them up with people based on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that it's easy to get food here.</v>

2030
01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:32.360
<v Speaker 1>It was really hard to get food here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 18 hundreds.</v>

2031
01:28:32.361 --> 01:28:34.460
<v Speaker 1>It'd be 1500 people here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2032
01:28:34.461 --> 01:28:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like the desert,</v>

2033
01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:36.993
<v Speaker 1>but as people desert people live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people that this little ranch here </v>

2034
01:28:40.101 --> 01:28:40.934
<v Speaker 1>ranch there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2035
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no fucking food man or </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

2036
01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot there.</v>

2037
01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:45.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2038
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:46.783
<v Speaker 1>So because of the fact that we figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to be able to feed all these </v>

2039
01:28:50.181 --> 01:28:51.670
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions and millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's.</v>

2040
01:28:51.671 --> 01:28:52.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2041
01:28:52.231 --> 01:28:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Well in this one little spot like la in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular where no one's growing,</v>

2042
01:28:55.311 --> 01:28:56.144
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything shoved in there in terms of </v>

2043
01:28:57.921 --> 01:28:59.960
<v Speaker 1>humans and they're just pumping eggs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there left and right.</v>

2044
01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've sort populated that place</v>

2045
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:05.720
<v Speaker 2>based on this ridiculous idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to meet.</v>

2046
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not a ridiculous idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a reality.</v>

2047
01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:09.511
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2048
01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:12.540
<v Speaker 2>But then people come along and they see </v>
<v Speaker 2>a peta video and then they go,</v>

2049
01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:14.250
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still want to live here,</v>

2050
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.840
<v Speaker 2>so while you're going to have to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegan then,</v>

2051
01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do that,</v>

2052
01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.113
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have to chop down a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fucking trees and start growing food </v>

2053
01:29:19.981 --> 01:29:20.814
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have to put it </v>

2054
01:29:21.361 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these people are going to be Vegan,</v>

2055
01:29:23.490 --> 01:29:24.323
<v Speaker 2>all 2 million in this town and 6 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the neighborhood town and then $20 </v>

2056
01:29:28.611 --> 01:29:29.444
<v Speaker 2>million in la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of agricultural runoff and </v>

2057
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:32.583
<v Speaker 2>pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a lot of fucking </v>

2058
01:29:33.631 --> 01:29:34.464
<v Speaker 2>shit go into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a lot of combines </v>

2059
01:29:36.001 --> 01:29:40.140
<v Speaker 2>chewing up rabbits and rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground nesting birds.</v>

2060
01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:42.960
<v Speaker 2>Everything's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's going to get buzzed up.</v>

2061
01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:46.470
<v Speaker 2>When you gathering up all that grain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to need to feed all those 2</v>

2062
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:48.810
<v Speaker 2>million people that don't have access to</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal protein anymore.</v>

2063
01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:50.370
<v Speaker 2>That's not good either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2064
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:53.850
<v Speaker 2>We're fucked is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're giving up that easy.</v>

2065
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:54.743
<v Speaker 2>I give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think technology is allowing us to </v>

2066
01:29:56.551 --> 01:29:59.580
<v Speaker 2>grow more food on less land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's true.</v>

2067
01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm very hopeful for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2068
01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:03.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial meat,</v>

2069
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:05.063
<v Speaker 2>that meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're growing very hopeful for that </v>

2070
01:30:06.661 --> 01:30:07.494
<v Speaker 2>because if we could figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it healthy to get that kind of </v>

2071
01:30:11.251 --> 01:30:12.084
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would still have population control </v>

2072
01:30:13.681 --> 01:30:16.500
<v Speaker 2>problems and I think I would never stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting because of that.</v>

2073
01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:17.993
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's meat without a central nervous </v>

2074
01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:21.240
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eat without a central nervous system and</v>

2075
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:25.410
<v Speaker 2>we could probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's done and it really works.</v>

2076
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.273
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of ifs there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we could probably eliminate most of </v>

2077
01:30:28.981 --> 01:30:29.850
<v Speaker 2>the factory farming.</v>

2078
01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:32.280
<v Speaker 2>The real problem would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you do with all those cows?</v>

2079
01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:35.250
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with the cows now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would die off and then you wouldn't</v>

2080
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.740
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want them to go extinct,</v>

2081
01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:38.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some cows because there'll be </v>

2082
01:30:39.661 --> 01:30:40.494
<v Speaker 2>people who it'd be a whole marketplace </v>
<v Speaker 2>of eating meat with the central nervous </v>

2083
01:30:46.051 --> 01:30:47.220
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just watch,</v>

2084
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:49.130
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely is natural.</v>

2085
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:52.700
<v Speaker 2>We go back to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to be a marketplace</v>

2086
01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:56.730
<v Speaker 2>for eating food as it quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurred naturally.</v>

2087
01:30:56.731 --> 01:30:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Which of course Holstein cows are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

2088
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:02.220
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I was going to get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with letting them go,</v>

2089
01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:03.413
<v Speaker 2>if we ever let them go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they morph sort of like the same way </v>

2090
01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:06.684
<v Speaker 2>pigs morph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become this thing called scrub </v>

2091
01:31:07.981 --> 01:31:09.150
<v Speaker 2>bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of scrub bowls?</v>

2092
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2093
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.550
<v Speaker 2>it's really popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially in Australia.</v>

2094
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:18.270
<v Speaker 2>They're wild cattle cattle really broken</v>
<v Speaker 2>through fences and lived many,</v>

2095
01:31:18.271 --> 01:31:21.150
<v Speaker 2>many generations in the wild men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The males are super aggressive.</v>

2096
01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

2097
01:31:22.981 --> 01:31:23.791
<v Speaker 2>let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2098
01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:25.470
<v Speaker 2>they're dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Fuck enormous.</v>

2099
01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Enormous bull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not afraid of lions.</v>

2100
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Afraid of water buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can climb a tree.</v>

2101
01:31:29.341 --> 01:31:31.020
<v Speaker 2>When you see a water buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2102
01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:31.943
<v Speaker 2>my friend Adam Green tree who shot that </v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo above the flag and I'm in the </v>

2103
01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.880
<v Speaker 2>north lands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a scrub bull.</v>

2104
01:31:41.881 --> 01:31:42.714
<v Speaker 2>So you see how weird that thing looks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks weird because it's probably </v>

2105
01:31:45.391 --> 01:31:46.920
<v Speaker 2>lived in the wild for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

2106
01:31:46.921 --> 01:31:49.380
<v Speaker 2>many generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're huge.</v>

2107
01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of the sack on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2108
01:31:51.630 --> 01:31:54.540
<v Speaker 2>look at his sack and look at his hog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2109
01:31:54.541 --> 01:31:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No joke.</v>

2110
01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:59.820
<v Speaker 2>That thing is laying pipe all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just banging all these cows</v>

2111
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.083
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're enormous wild cows and they're </v>

2112
01:32:03.041 --> 01:32:06.610
<v Speaker 1>very aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The males in particular will fuck you up</v>

2113
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:09.130
<v Speaker 1>because they're not steers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2114
01:32:09.150 --> 01:32:11.470
<v Speaker 1>There are bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we're getting steak,</v>

2115
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.770
<v Speaker 1>you're getting steak most of the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a a steers and animal.</v>

2116
01:32:14.771 --> 01:32:16.540
<v Speaker 1>They cut the balls off of it when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

2117
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:20.080
<v Speaker 1>These are full as bowls with the muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>

2118
01:32:20.081 --> 01:32:24.070
<v Speaker 1>That animal look at the size of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing's huge.</v>

2119
01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:29.110
<v Speaker 1>These are big fucking wild bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2121
01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.150
<v Speaker 1>what does that weigh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen hundred pounds or some shit.</v>

2122
01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2123
01:32:33.970 --> 01:32:34.803
<v Speaker 1>So that would happen in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to recognize that if people </v>

2124
01:32:37.331 --> 01:32:42.160
<v Speaker 1>stopped having domestic cattle and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just let those cattle roam through,</v>

2125
01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.233
<v Speaker 1>you would have a devastating impact on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ecosystem just like you have with </v>

2126
01:32:45.971 --> 01:32:48.100
<v Speaker 1>wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be similar.</v>

2127
01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:49.323
<v Speaker 1>You'd have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have those cows would all be </v>

2128
01:32:50.921 --> 01:32:53.780
<v Speaker 1>euthanized or they be eating and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's,</v>

2129
01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:55.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's blinding the cows,</v>

2130
01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.333
<v Speaker 1>but you'd have to have a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of them that we keep alive </v>

2131
01:32:58.361 --> 01:33:01.390
<v Speaker 1>what it needed for milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2132
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:04.110
<v Speaker 1>can milk them if they come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial mill.</v>

2133
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:05.323
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

2134
01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not really supposed to drink milk</v>

2135
01:33:08.831 --> 01:33:09.550
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2136
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cheese is good.</v>

2137
01:33:11.531 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it though?</v>

2138
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cheese and I drink wine.</v>

2139
01:33:15.431 --> 01:33:17.460
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make me feel good and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>never stopping.</v>

2140
01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:21.190
<v Speaker 1>How about that one does not make me feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>good until it goes in my mouth.</v>

2141
01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:26.490
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I like I was in that makeup chair and</v>

2142
01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you drink in one I was doing now was </v>
<v Speaker 1>puffy in the morning and I looked at the</v>

2143
01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:34.160
<v Speaker 1>makeup woman and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think and I said,</v>

2144
01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I so puffy in the morning?</v>

2145
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you drinking at nine ago?</v>

2146
01:33:38.770 --> 01:33:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Every night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2147
01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

2148
01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:42.573
<v Speaker 1>If you have to shoot the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not want to drink three </v>

2149
01:33:44.381 --> 01:33:48.130
<v Speaker 1>glasses of wine because I get swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just drink it.</v>

2150
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Weird people are weird.</v>

2161
01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Milk Almond milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite son.</v>

2162
01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:22.653
<v Speaker 1>Even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.960
<v Speaker 1>There's no almond entities that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>almond milk.</v>

2164
01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So whenever a joke like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's someone's joked.</v>

2165
01:34:28.531 --> 01:34:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I just bite someone's joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2166
01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.393
<v Speaker 1>The whole almond milk thing is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just soaking nuts and then </v>

2167
01:34:35.681 --> 01:34:37.710
<v Speaker 1>getting the dirty water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what it's like.</v>

2168
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:38.663
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you a eat coco pops </v>
<v Speaker 1>cuckoo for cocoa puffs and you would </v>

2169
01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.410
<v Speaker 1>have that chocolate in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that be the chocolate?</v>

2170
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:45.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bottom.</v>

2171
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Press them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God it.</v>

2172
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:48.070
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stay,</v>

2173
01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:49.870
<v Speaker 1>they take the almonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they soak them,</v>

2174
01:34:49.871 --> 01:34:50.920
<v Speaker 1>they sprout them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2175
01:34:50.921 --> 01:34:52.210
<v Speaker 1>but then they press them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2176
01:34:52.211 --> 01:34:53.860
<v Speaker 1>but that dirty water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just water.</v>

2177
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:55.510
<v Speaker 1>The almonds were soaking around it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2178
01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 1>because they don't do it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

2179
01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2180
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.410
<v Speaker 2>the way they do it as they crushed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>almonds after they've been.</v>

2181
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.880
<v Speaker 2>After they had been soaked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take the skin off and then they.</v>

2182
01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:05.063
<v Speaker 2>They crushed them and then they mix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They crushed them and then they press </v>

2183
01:35:08.361 --> 01:35:11.050
<v Speaker 2>them and it creates like a milky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dirty water.</v>

2184
01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what kind of fucking almond</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor when you're talking about bro.</v>

2185
01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.660
<v Speaker 2>It's dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almond water.</v>

2186
01:35:17.690 --> 01:35:22.400
<v Speaker 2>What is your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm genetically engineered yeast.</v>

2187
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:23.390
<v Speaker 2>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

2188
01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:25.890
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the cellular ag?</v>

2189
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.710
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan milk.</v>

2190
01:35:27.711 --> 01:35:29.030
<v Speaker 2>It's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2191
01:35:29.031 --> 01:35:30.620
<v Speaker 2>The term genetically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2192
01:35:30.621 --> 01:35:35.621
<v Speaker 2>The team used genetically engineered </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeast to pro produce six key proteins.</v>

2193
01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn motherfucker.</v>

2194
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.863
<v Speaker 2>Six key proteins that provide the </v>
<v Speaker 2>texture and plants to harvest ate fatty </v>

2195
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:47.390
<v Speaker 2>acids that contribute to the flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally they add sugars,</v>

2196
01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.220
<v Speaker 2>minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and water.</v>

2197
01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Easy peasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sugar.</v>

2198
01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:55.120
<v Speaker 2>With this straightforward recipe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the composition can be modified to leave</v>

2199
01:35:55.130 --> 01:35:55.963
<v Speaker 2>potentially harmful components such as </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol and hormones out of the </v>

2200
01:35:59.031 --> 01:35:59.864
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>

2201
01:35:59.910 --> 01:36:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Kind of lactose cholesterol by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the building blocks of all cells.</v>

2202
01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't lack sugar.</v>

2203
01:36:07.770 --> 01:36:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Google that back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2204
01:36:09.081 --> 01:36:10.340
<v Speaker 2>they're putting sugar in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2205
01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:11.293
<v Speaker 2>but they said they put sugars in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise it would taste like </v>

2206
01:36:13.371 --> 01:36:14.970
<v Speaker 2>donkey piss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.090
<v Speaker 2>East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2208
01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.670
<v Speaker 2>east is a life form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you draw the line?</v>

2209
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a Vegan and you're eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeast,</v>

2210
01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:23.893
<v Speaker 2>you are eating a living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're eating a life form that if you </v>

2211
01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:29.810
<v Speaker 2>didn't eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would replicate.</v>

2212
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:32.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a life form.</v>

2213
01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:35.810
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're eating probiotics,</v>

2214
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:37.760
<v Speaker 2>like say if you're a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eating probiotics,</v>

2215
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you are eating a little tiny light </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms.</v>

2216
01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:40.933
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have fermented that you're </v>

2217
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:47.930
<v Speaker 2>letting animals grow on your food and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating your food and the animals,</v>

2218
01:36:47.931 --> 01:36:49.430
<v Speaker 2>so like that's where I get my protein.</v>

2219
01:36:49.730 --> 01:36:51.920
<v Speaker 2>You're eating animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating little tiny,</v>

2220
01:36:51.921 --> 01:36:53.510
<v Speaker 2>tiny little animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one,</v>

2221
01:36:53.511 --> 01:36:54.370
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

2222
01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.960
<v Speaker 2>nine out of 10 of your cells are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

2223
01:36:56.961 --> 01:36:59.870
<v Speaker 2>They're bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every cell of your body is made from it,</v>

2224
01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:00.853
<v Speaker 2>and all of your steroid hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormones are synthesized from </v>

2225
01:37:03.741 --> 01:37:04.574
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including all of the sex and adrenal </v>

2226
01:37:06.501 --> 01:37:07.191
<v Speaker 2>hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2227
01:37:07.191 --> 01:37:08.570
<v Speaker 2>you definitely don't want that in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2228
01:37:08.571 --> 01:37:09.404
<v Speaker 2>Then do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want something that's </v>

2229
01:37:10.941 --> 01:37:13.460
<v Speaker 2>responsible for every fucking cell in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body?</v>

2230
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:14.833
<v Speaker 2>Like this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that diet is better for you is so </v>

2231
01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn cockamamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're telling you that they're putting</v>

2232
01:37:21.681 --> 01:37:24.860
<v Speaker 2>in sugar so that it makes it palatable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and taking you.</v>

2233
01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:25.813
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>naughty cholesterol that's responsible </v>

2234
01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:32.030
<v Speaker 2>for every fucking cell in your body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hormones.</v>

2235
01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.920
<v Speaker 2>We don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have it.</v>

2236
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:36.800
<v Speaker 2>They're not even paying attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

2237
01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:37.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's a belief system.</v>

2238
01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:38.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2239
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:39.980
<v Speaker 2>here's what it is though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's where it gets weird.</v>

2240
01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.610
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2241
01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:42.513
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also believe in many ways is a left </v>

2242
01:37:43.911 --> 01:37:48.911
<v Speaker 2>right thing that the left believes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change science wholeheartedly,</v>

2243
01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.000
<v Speaker 2>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does not believe in gender is gender</v>

2244
01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:54.020
<v Speaker 2>size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2245
01:37:54.021 --> 01:37:55.800
<v Speaker 2>that's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

2246
01:37:55.801 --> 01:37:59.100
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you talk about the difference between</v>

2247
01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:02.950
<v Speaker 2>male and female xy chromosomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll shut you down.</v>

2248
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Did you see bret Weinstein's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife?</v>

2249
01:38:05.891 --> 01:38:07.770
<v Speaker 2>I heard they were hiring Eric Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2250
01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heather hiding.</v>

2251
01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:13.360
<v Speaker 2>She was doing a speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2252
01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:15.120
<v Speaker 2>with James Demore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2253
01:38:15.121 --> 01:38:15.954
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about gender diversity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's just talking about the </v>

2254
01:38:17.911 --> 01:38:20.580
<v Speaker 2>difference between males and females.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From a scientist point of view.</v>

2255
01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:22.590
<v Speaker 2>She's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a real biologist,</v>

2256
01:38:22.591 --> 01:38:24.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get up and screaming.</v>

2257
01:38:24.721 --> 01:38:26.310
<v Speaker 2>They're shutting her down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking out.</v>

2258
01:38:26.311 --> 01:38:29.280
<v Speaker 2>They knocked over the sound system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They called her a fascist.</v>

2259
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said he's a Nazi.</v>

2260
01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:34.320
<v Speaker 2>You're against science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's amazing.</v>

2261
01:38:34.530 --> 01:38:35.850
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So dumb.</v>

2262
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.940
<v Speaker 2>But it's this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this left right thing to.</v>

2263
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.650
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the left.</v>

2264
01:38:40.651 --> 01:38:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Once you do 100 percent buy into </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever science they accept,</v>

2265
01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:50.150
<v Speaker 2>but also they don't buy into a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that just doesn't fit with whatever</v>

2266
01:38:50.581 --> 01:38:51.414
<v Speaker 2>their ideology I left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't the cultural purity the far </v>

2267
01:38:53.881 --> 01:38:55.650
<v Speaker 2>right's into racial period?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2268
01:38:55.651 --> 01:38:57.930
<v Speaker 2>but it was the denial of sciences and </v>
<v Speaker 2>new thing.</v>

2269
01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.213
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's denial of science was just not a </v>

2270
01:39:00.391 --> 01:39:03.660
<v Speaker 2>part of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left was always pro science posted,</v>

2271
01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:07.350
<v Speaker 2>supposedly pro science that the idea was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were more educated,</v>

2272
01:39:07.351 --> 01:39:08.920
<v Speaker 2>but as I looked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt it was like,</v>

2273
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:09.763
<v Speaker 2>that's not really true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you would think that it would be </v>

2274
01:39:11.701 --> 01:39:14.820
<v Speaker 2>more educated because they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it left and right or is it just.</v>

2275
01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:15.733
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it.</v>

2276
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Are we talking about just people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2277
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.033
<v Speaker 2>I feel like when we talk about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are not going to have a </v>

2278
01:39:22.621 --> 01:39:25.370
<v Speaker 2>sound systems and walking out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouting that Christine and summers,</v>

2279
01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they're right or left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that these are young,</v>

2280
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:33.240
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confused people.</v>

2281
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Shitheads shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:39:35.431 --> 01:39:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're proud.</v>

2283
01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:40.260
<v Speaker 2>First of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're very smart.</v>

2284
01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

2285
01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:45.300
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of them might have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological problems.</v>

2286
01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.433
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of them want to belong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of them just want to be </v>

2287
01:39:49.951 --> 01:39:54.900
<v Speaker 2>heard and people do clumsy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people want to feel significant,</v>

2288
01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:56.093
<v Speaker 2>they'll do even crazier shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like put a gun in their hand and shoot </v>

2289
01:39:58.081 --> 01:39:59.610
<v Speaker 2>somebody so sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2290
01:39:59.611 --> 01:40:00.720
<v Speaker 2>and it usually it belongs.</v>

2291
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:03.660
<v Speaker 2>It's the realm of young people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what to do with their energy.</v>

2292
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:05.130
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2293
01:40:05.131 --> 01:40:07.500
<v Speaker 2>like we talked about before with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina Hoff summers,</v>

2294
01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:08.363
<v Speaker 2>there's just a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>free from their parents for the first </v>

2295
01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:11.250
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2296
01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:13.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've only been free for 24 months and</v>

2297
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:16.530
<v Speaker 2>they're stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dyed their hair green.</v>

2298
01:40:16.531 --> 01:40:18.810
<v Speaker 2>You can't stop me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fascist and I just,</v>

2299
01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:19.753
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to stop everything and they </v>

2300
01:40:20.941 --> 01:40:21.774
<v Speaker 2>want attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately I think that this is </v>

2301
01:40:25.981 --> 01:40:26.814
<v Speaker 2>giving us an opportunity to really fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>examine ideas and even though these </v>

2302
01:40:30.061 --> 01:40:32.250
<v Speaker 2>people shouting people down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those noises going on,</v>

2303
01:40:32.251 --> 01:40:33.570
<v Speaker 2>like there'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a result.</v>

2304
01:40:34.050 --> 01:40:34.883
<v Speaker 2>They'll be some sort of an ebb and flow </v>
<v Speaker 2>to all this that I feel very hopeful </v>

2305
01:40:39.091 --> 01:40:39.924
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I look at the ebb and flow of </v>

2306
01:40:40.981 --> 01:40:41.910
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I like it.</v>

2307
01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:42.773
<v Speaker 2>I like what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that there's a lot of fucking </v>

2308
01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:45.084
<v Speaker 2>chaos and definitely some people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken some unsafe unnecessarily bullets </v>

2309
01:40:48.150 --> 01:40:48.983
<v Speaker 2>and there's definitely some ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are getting shut down that shouldn't be </v>

2310
01:40:51.151 --> 01:40:51.984
<v Speaker 2>and there's definitely some overuse the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word Nazi and fascist and all this </v>

2311
01:40:55.421 --> 01:40:56.254
<v Speaker 2>different stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like overwhelmingly all </v>

2312
01:40:58.841 --> 01:40:59.674
<v Speaker 2>this crazy energy is being pushed into </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least the idea that we're improving </v>

2313
01:41:03.881 --> 01:41:05.260
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2314
01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:08.380
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to improve the world.</v>

2315
01:41:08.410 --> 01:41:09.243
<v Speaker 3>I had a bunch of women on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about sexism in </v>

2316
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood and of course I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see it that much.</v>

2317
01:41:15.191 --> 01:41:16.024
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't say it,</v>

2318
01:41:16.210 --> 01:41:18.790
<v Speaker 3>and these women were all really </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent and I said,</v>

2319
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta be honest man.</v>

2320
01:41:20.201 --> 01:41:22.630
<v Speaker 3>As a white man now I just feel like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2321
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:24.180
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2322
01:41:24.210 --> 01:41:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2323
01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2324
01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:28.780
<v Speaker 3>I gotta watch what I say now I've got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch how I talk.</v>

2325
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:30.120
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the women goes,</v>

2326
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Katie goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2327
01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:34.230
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine what that's like one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it like to have to watch it?</v>

2328
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Watch what you say and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch what your impact is like.</v>

2329
01:41:38.311 --> 01:41:40.420
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile she's been dealing with that.</v>

2330
01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:41.673
<v Speaker 3>Every woman I know has been dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that for fucking ever and I guess I </v>

2331
01:41:44.201 --> 01:41:46.480
<v Speaker 3>didn't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't look at their perspective.</v>

2332
01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:48.460
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to look at other people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

2333
01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:49.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2334
01:41:49.121 --> 01:41:49.954
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

2335
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:50.833
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to shop in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast we were talking about a Joey </v>

2336
01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Diaz had some crazy shit about some </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicks ass and uh,</v>

2337
01:41:57.170 --> 01:41:59.270
<v Speaker 2>and we were all laughing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2338
01:41:59.271 --> 01:42:00.870
<v Speaker 2>it's Joey's fucking Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a comedian.</v>

2339
01:42:00.871 --> 01:42:02.630
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally understand and I'm with you.</v>

2340
01:42:02.690 --> 01:42:07.690
<v Speaker 2>But now imagine if you were a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>sized guy and you were dealing with some</v>

2341
01:42:10.221 --> 01:42:11.054
<v Speaker 2>seven foot tall ogre who was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>online talking about how good your </v>

2342
01:42:16.461 --> 01:42:18.440
<v Speaker 2>asshole smelled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

2343
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:19.303
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you knew that that guy wanted to </v>

2344
01:42:20.451 --> 01:42:21.284
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you knew that if he was alone </v>

2345
01:42:22.251 --> 01:42:24.110
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could probably like hold you down and</v>

2346
01:42:24.111 --> 01:42:26.390
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that would be terrifying,</v>

2347
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:27.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2348
01:42:27.170 --> 01:42:29.720
<v Speaker 2>that'd be terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

2349
01:42:29.721 --> 01:42:32.090
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about a female fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably would fuck joey.</v>

2350
01:42:32.091 --> 01:42:34.550
<v Speaker 2>His ass probably beat Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His ass.</v>

2351
01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Bad Ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know Joey's not in the best shape.</v>

2352
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:39.820
<v Speaker 2>He might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might call clock</v>

2353
01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:41.330
<v Speaker 3>punched out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She starts circling,</v>

2354
01:42:41.331 --> 01:42:42.164
<v Speaker 3>is jagged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's scared she's going to pepper his </v>

2355
01:42:44.651 --> 01:42:46.580
<v Speaker 3>face a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but either way he's being funny.</v>

2356
01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:48.120
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was saying about.</v>

2357
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:49.103
<v Speaker 2>Imagine now though that your a girl who </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear someone talk about your asshole </v>

2358
01:42:53.441 --> 01:42:55.530
<v Speaker 2>like that and we've all done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all done it.</v>

2359
01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

2360
01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:58.913
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's got to be a terrible </v>

2361
01:42:59.851 --> 01:43:00.684
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

2362
01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2363
01:43:03.801 --> 01:43:04.634
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to be a woman for one day to </v>

2364
01:43:06.681 --> 01:43:08.210
<v Speaker 3>see what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you'd like to get fucked.</v>

2365

<v Speaker 3>If you're a woman for one day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just suck a dick.</v>

2366
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:12.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you like,</v>

2367
01:43:12.201 --> 01:43:14.480
<v Speaker 3>that's where I draw the line in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only want to see where it goes.</v>

2368
01:43:14.481 --> 01:43:16.790
<v Speaker 3>I just want to see what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what does it feel like?</v>

2369
01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Like stuck it in your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could have found that out.</v>

2370
01:43:19.321 --> 01:43:19.971
<v Speaker 3>I was a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2371
01:43:19.971 --> 01:43:20.804
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's it like to be attracted to a man </v>

2372
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:25.220
<v Speaker 3>like I look at you and I know women find</v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive.</v>

2373
01:43:25.221 --> 01:43:27.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't find you attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful,</v>

2374

2381
01:43:41.770 --> 01:43:42.603

01:44:02.061 --> 01:44:03.170
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be married to him.</v>

2395
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I would make tea and I was think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

2396
01:44:13.221 --> 01:44:14.054
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop being so shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get into crime and gained </v>

2397
01:44:16.071 --> 01:44:17.920
<v Speaker 1>some weight instead of being so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Just eat some pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So legit and terrific up.</v>

2399
01:44:21.150 --> 01:44:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died young.</v>

2400
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:23.143
<v Speaker 1>That was a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's one of those guys that when he </v>

2401
01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:26.060
<v Speaker 1>died I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2402
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:28.430
<v Speaker 1>55 or 52 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2403
01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:29.960
<v Speaker 1>He was in that neighborhood.</v>

2404
01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Looked every bit of 60.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2405
01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:33.920
<v Speaker 1>He had it all in his system to baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2406
01:44:33.921 --> 01:44:34.754
<v Speaker 1>he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2407
01:44:34.930 --> 01:44:37.400
<v Speaker 1>He had the full ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes to do well.</v>

2408
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I know guys have worked with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know guys well who worked with him and</v>

2409
01:44:40.401 --> 01:44:42.950
<v Speaker 1>he just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could fucking tear it up man.</v>

2410
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Who's the movie though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Played a hitman.</v>

2411
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:48.830
<v Speaker 1>What was that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>True Romance?</v>

2412
01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:49.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2413
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that one but there was a more recent</v>

2414
01:44:51.381 --> 01:44:54.620
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm God damn it.</v>

2415
01:44:54.650 --> 01:44:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Was it with Brad Pitt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there,</v>

2416
01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.910
<v Speaker 1>moved with him and Brad Pitt killing me </v>
<v Speaker 1>softly.</v>

2417
01:44:58.970 --> 01:45:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was he a Hitman to.</v>

2418
01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:04.280
<v Speaker 1>They were both Hitman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also in the drop.</v>

2419
01:45:04.281 --> 01:45:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2420
01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of killing me softly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one,</v>

2421
01:45:07.731 --> 01:45:10.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was great and true romance,</v>

2422
01:45:10.011 --> 01:45:10.641
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2423
01:45:10.641 --> 01:45:12.260
<v Speaker 1>He's great and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

2424
01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that Tony Soprano's character </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally literally changed gene,</v>

2425
01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.133
<v Speaker 1>what we think of as like a hero in a TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>show because all of a sudden the hero </v>

2426
01:45:21.441 --> 01:45:23.630
<v Speaker 1>was a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the hero.</v>

2427
01:45:23.770 --> 01:45:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Like when he killed Christopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they had the car accident,</v>

2428
01:45:27.201 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 1>you just fucking smothered him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2429
01:45:28.731 --> 01:45:31.310
<v Speaker 1>this is a good excuse to kill this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just killed him right there.</v>

2430
01:45:31.311 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

2431
01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2432
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:38.690
<v Speaker 1>When he closed his nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2433
01:45:38.691 --> 01:45:40.570
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fucked up.</v>

2434
01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:44.930
<v Speaker 1>There's no class that was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2435
01:45:45.230 --> 01:45:46.790
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was like.</v>

2436
01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.940
<v Speaker 1>That's willing to do whatever it took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2437
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:51.740
<v Speaker 1>but it was also the star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>

2438
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:53.690
<v Speaker 1>The star of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you liked him?</v>

2439
01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what was so genius.</v>

2440
01:45:56.860 --> 01:45:59.480
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a show like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so bad.</v>

2441
01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so bad and there's.</v>

2442
01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:06.380
<v Speaker 1>There hasn't been a show like that since</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

2443
01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.233
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who else is like that much of a villain </v>

2444
01:46:13.341 --> 01:46:16.040
<v Speaker 1>and a hero wrapped up into one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else?</v>

2445
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:17.930
<v Speaker 1>What other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What other?</v>

2446
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:20.960
<v Speaker 1>The only person that you can maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking bad,</v>

2447
01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but you could see why he was doing it.</v>

2448
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:24.950
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Soprano's was a Hemi badge,</v>

2449
01:46:25.090 --> 01:46:26.960
<v Speaker 1>cheated on his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly murdered,</v>

2450
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:28.820
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the.</v>

2451
01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:31.310
<v Speaker 1>What was fascinating about him is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the dichotomy.</v>

2452
01:46:31.311 --> 01:46:32.144
<v Speaker 1>It was the guy who loved his family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told the son to do his homework and not </v>

2453
01:46:36.321 --> 01:46:39.830
<v Speaker 1>to swear at the table and also an order </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hit in the same breath.</v>

2454
01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:41.293
<v Speaker 1>That insane contradiction was what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't take your eyes off because </v>

2455
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:46.423
<v Speaker 1>we're bipolar reps because you can be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad guy and also a really good guy </v>

2456
01:46:49.891 --> 01:46:50.724
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fucking crazy and true </v>

2457
01:46:52.381 --> 01:46:53.310
<v Speaker 1>about human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2458
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:54.163
<v Speaker 1>that's what's brilliant though about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that writing is that they figured out </v>

2459
01:46:56.521 --> 01:46:57.354
<v Speaker 1>how to encapsulate that in fiction where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's playing out every week and you're </v>

2460
01:47:01.141 --> 01:47:03.440
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not sick of the guy like you want</v>

2461
01:47:03.441 --> 01:47:04.274
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see if he's going to make </v>

2462
01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:05.100
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2463
01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:05.933
<v Speaker 1>Is he going to get busted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he going to jail or they gonna crack </v>

2464
01:47:08.281 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 1>down on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to rat them out,</v>

2465
01:47:10.710 --> 01:47:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

2466
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:17.340
<v Speaker 1>that shows an interesting like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor for life.</v>

2467
01:47:17.341 --> 01:47:18.174
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess what I really worry about </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our social situation today is the </v>

2468
01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:23.993
<v Speaker 1>destruction of people and how they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>never allowed to come back into the </v>

2469
01:47:27.271 --> 01:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>fold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I worry about.</v>

2470
01:47:28.930 --> 01:47:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like public shaming or whatever it might</v>

2471
01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:32.244
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there are very few people that </v>

2472
01:47:34.081 --> 01:47:37.770
<v Speaker 1>deserve eternal damnation and they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

2473
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:39.960
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman Polanski.</v>

2474
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2475
01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:42.713
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great artist and a great filmmaker on </v>

2476
01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:48.210
<v Speaker 1>reacting to the fact that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

2477
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't justify having you come back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country and be pardoned after that.</v>

2478
01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:59.640
<v Speaker 1>If the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if what you did is true.</v>

2479
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.090
<v Speaker 1>If what I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've read and been told is true,</v>

2480
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:04.253
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I'm supposed to forgive</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so that that's mainly because a </v>

2481
01:48:07.190 --> 01:48:11.340
<v Speaker 1>child and so that falls into line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unacceptable things for me,</v>

2482
01:48:11.370 --> 01:48:12.203
<v Speaker 1>but then there's people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>shamed like Al Franken where you're </v>

2483
01:48:15.701 --> 01:48:16.600
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

2484
01:48:16.710 --> 01:48:17.680
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was ridiculous.</v>

2485
01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.420
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he do?</v>

2486
01:48:19.421 --> 01:48:23.600
<v Speaker 1>What I get to the photo was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate that he took the end.</v>

2487
01:48:24.490 --> 01:48:26.820
<v Speaker 1>You can't just train him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny Weinstein.</v>

2488
01:48:26.821 --> 01:48:27.840
<v Speaker 1>That cheapens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2489
01:48:27.841 --> 01:48:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't have done it,</v>

2490
01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.070
<v Speaker 1>but he was trying to be funny and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people try to be funny,</v>

2491
01:48:32.071 --> 01:48:34.020
<v Speaker 1>especially people are around each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

2492
01:48:34.021 --> 01:48:37.920
<v Speaker 1>They get stupid and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they crossed lines and you know,</v>

2493
01:48:38.190 --> 01:48:39.023
<v Speaker 1>or you just don't read the signals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Cross a line in that you're trying </v>

2494
01:48:42.811 --> 01:48:45.060
<v Speaker 1>to pick somebody up or you're putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on them.</v>

2495
01:48:45.061 --> 01:48:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that ultimately what </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to do though is people are</v>

2496
01:48:48.541 --> 01:48:50.910
<v Speaker 1>going to have to learn to be nicer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

2497
01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:52.013
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they're going to be really careful </v>

2498
01:48:55.261 --> 01:49:00.261
<v Speaker 1>and afraid and I worry that if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2499
01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:01.920
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do people,</v>

2500
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:06.090
<v Speaker 1>most people meet their wives and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriends?</v>

2501
01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:07.920
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times it's a work a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

2502
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:08.783
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their husbands and their wives and I </v>

2503
01:49:10.471 --> 01:49:11.304
<v Speaker 1>think that your don't be surprised if </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations start to have a zero </v>

2504
01:49:15.451 --> 01:49:18.960
<v Speaker 1>tolerance policy for any kind of romance</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the office space.</v>

2505
01:49:18.961 --> 01:49:19.794
<v Speaker 1>It'll be like the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's allowed to date anybody and if </v>

2506
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you do get fired right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no questions asked,</v>

2507
01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:26.100
<v Speaker 1>and now think about the fact that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hours a day in this place,</v>

01:54:00.741 --> 01:54:02.190
<v Speaker 1>super progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2623
01:54:02.230 --> 01:54:04.820
<v Speaker 1>The Jews didn't exactly have it easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying.</v>

2624
01:54:04.821 --> 01:54:05.654
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were saying that this is not just </v>

2625
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:09.343
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also about subordination and that </v>

2626
01:54:12.351 --> 01:54:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing this subordination plate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's planning,</v>

2627
01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:19.040
<v Speaker 1>that's taking place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a lot of these men like the way</v>

2628
01:54:19.041 --> 01:54:19.874
<v Speaker 1>they're behaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're behaving to be subordinate </v>

2629
01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:22.210
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

2630
01:54:22.210 --> 01:54:25.030
<v Speaker 1>There are being obedience trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2631
01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:25.873
<v Speaker 1>and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're giving into it to show that you </v>

2632
01:54:27.441 --> 01:54:28.274
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't punish me because I'm on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>side because they were terrified of the </v>

2633
01:54:31.671 --> 01:54:32.504
<v Speaker 1>women that are wielding this power now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got up in the air building that </v>

2634
01:54:34.621 --> 01:54:35.220
<v Speaker 1>wild.</v>

2635
01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I've got a theory about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant men.</v>

2636
01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:39.943
<v Speaker 1>Historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you create a bunch of quiet resent </v>

2637
01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:47.360
<v Speaker 1>and it turns into allowed violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are really good at.</v>

2638
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.823
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be careful about make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine men a wholesale because I </v>

2639
01:54:53.991 --> 01:54:54.824
<v Speaker 1>always worry that it's very easy to whip</v>
<v Speaker 1>them up when you got the right </v>

2640
01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:01.243
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and the right leader and </v>
<v Speaker 1>men like to organize and they liked to </v>

2641
01:55:05.511 --> 01:55:06.344
<v Speaker 1>fight and they like to fight back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes them feel significant </v>

2642
01:55:09.711 --> 01:55:13.340
<v Speaker 1>when they've been emasculated and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think it's,</v>

2643
01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the expression.</v>

2644
01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Punishment doesn't change behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just suppresses it.</v>

2645
01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:19.633
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that in the turn of the </v>

2646
01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:21.710
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not this one,</v>

2647
01:55:21.711 --> 01:55:22.544
<v Speaker 1>but the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a giant bachelor culture in </v>

2648
01:55:26.691 --> 01:55:27.524
<v Speaker 1>America where men just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had just gotten through like a lot </v>

2649
01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:35.270
<v Speaker 1>of it was like in the twenties to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an after the depression.</v>

2650
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:38.660
<v Speaker 1>It was like the burden of having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>family was just too much.</v>

2651
01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:39.733
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't attractive to them and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a bunch of men that gravitate </v>

2652
01:55:42.021 --> 01:55:44.090
<v Speaker 1>towards pool halls and in</v>

2653
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:44.933
<v Speaker 2>19 early 19 hundreds of New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was more than 900 pool halls in </v>

2654
01:55:50.881 --> 01:55:55.881
<v Speaker 2>New York City to just stop and think of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that more than 900 pools and there's all</v>

2655
01:55:56.911 --> 01:55:59.850
<v Speaker 2>these men that would just go there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would hang out and they were like,</v>

2656
01:55:59.851 --> 01:56:03.660
<v Speaker 2>fuck that life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just didn't want to have a part</v>

2657
01:56:03.661 --> 01:56:05.640
<v Speaker 2>of it because it was too brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was too hard.</v>

2658
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:11.120
<v Speaker 2>They're all this country would need for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing to flip on its fucking ass.</v>

2659
01:56:11.850 --> 01:56:15.120
<v Speaker 2>All they would need is legalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitution and guys would be like,</v>

2660
01:56:15.121 --> 01:56:15.954
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold up,</v>

2661
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:16.980
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

2662
01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.420
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely love you.</v>

2663
01:56:18.421 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I'd definitely love you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wait a minute,</v>

2664
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:21.540
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I signing?</v>

2665
01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.033
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If if people found out that they could </v>

2666
01:56:25.831 --> 01:56:29.130
<v Speaker 2>just get sex anytime they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they had $100,</v>

2667
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:30.143
<v Speaker 2>like if you have $100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get sex and you get sex and a </v>

2668
01:56:32.281 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 2>pretty girl and it's clean.</v>

2669
01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:35.970
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would be outraged.</v>

2670
01:56:35.971 --> 01:56:36.301
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2671
01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:38.370
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to have power over this </v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

2672
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:41.730
<v Speaker 2>If I can't control his sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could only.</v>

2673
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I only have him locked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise we're just friends.</v>

2674
01:56:44.490 --> 01:56:46.650
<v Speaker 2>See if we're just friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't have half his money.</v>

2675
01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell him what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell him when to be home,</v>

2676
01:56:49.651 --> 01:56:50.484
<v Speaker 2>but let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to live together and I have to </v>

2677
01:56:52.531 --> 01:56:53.364
<v Speaker 2>control his sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we live together and then I control </v>

2678
01:56:55.101 --> 01:56:57.000
<v Speaker 2>his sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I have all this power.</v>

2679
01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:58.073
<v Speaker 2>But if they were in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 2>legalized prostitution was just like </v>

2680
01:57:00.810 --> 01:57:05.310
<v Speaker 2>grocery stores or it's just everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would the first of all,</v>

2681
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:08.910
<v Speaker 2>the amount of hose would probably be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

2682
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:13.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like used to be a lot richer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're just doing it like under the</v>

2683
01:57:13.111 --> 01:57:13.770
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

2684
01:57:13.770 --> 01:57:17.880
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can get rated as sneakiness.</v>

2685
01:57:17.881 --> 01:57:18.714
<v Speaker 2>There's all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2686
01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:19.673
<v Speaker 2>the gold diggers instead of hose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some girls would just go straight into </v>

2687
01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:23.910
<v Speaker 2>heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2688
01:57:23.911 --> 01:57:24.744
<v Speaker 2>But here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think men are more interested in </v>

2689
01:57:26.971 --> 01:57:29.250
<v Speaker 2>sex or admiration?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's both.</v>

2690
01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:31.680
<v Speaker 2>They want to be fake admiration from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hose.</v>

2691
01:57:31.770 --> 01:57:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they say with all due respect,</v>

2692
01:57:33.821 --> 01:57:34.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fake though.</v>

2693
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I think men can do want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>admired more than anything else they do.</v>

2694
01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:41.640
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want their dick to be the biggest.</v>

2695
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:42.503
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's a mushroom cap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just make all the noise please and let </v>

2696
01:57:45.001 --> 01:57:48.030
<v Speaker 2>me know I'm King Kong and that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you stick to the woman.</v>

2697
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:49.103
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times you'll stick that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman who you know has got your back no </v>

2698
01:57:52.081 --> 01:57:52.914
<v Speaker 2>matter what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy who finds that there's a lot of </v>

2699
01:57:55.981 --> 01:57:57.600
<v Speaker 2>people that don't find that in for them.</v>

2700
01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Legalized prostitution right next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bolero.</v>

2701
01:57:59.970 --> 01:58:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Hop on in Chanera go sandwich Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>kitchen.</v>

2703
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:14.570

<v Speaker 2>Like what people like why,</v>

2704
01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:15.773
<v Speaker 2>why are you dating?</v>

2705
01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:19.333
<v Speaker 2>dating because you want companionship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like are you too consumed with work and </v>

2706
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:23.323
<v Speaker 2>are you busy all day and you just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hang out with your friends but you </v>

<v Speaker 2>And if that was the case.</v>

2709
01:58:29.190 --> 01:58:30.930

<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be the same,</v>

2713
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:38.583
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have stayed in jail if he had </v>

2714
01:58:39.541 --> 01:58:41.800
<v Speaker 2>access to women because he was hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with all his friends.</v>

2715
01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:42.140
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

2716
01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:45.550
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the fucking best best because all</v>

<v Speaker 3>he just did food kind of sucks,</v>

2719
01:58:49.871 --> 01:58:51.810
<v Speaker 3>but you're all laughing and you're all </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a shitty situation.</v>

2720
01:58:51.811 --> 01:58:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody gets along.</v>

2721
01:58:53.110 --> 01:58:54.280
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had girls,</v>

2722
01:58:54.670 --> 01:58:57.890
<v Speaker 3>if I had access to women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not have left.</v>

2723
01:58:57.950 --> 01:59:00.220
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is in Fort Dix to like,</v>

2724
01:59:00.221 --> 01:59:01.054
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest federal penitentiary in the </v>

2725
01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:03.360
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2726
01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously torn on prostitution </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want anybody that I know</v>

2727
01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:08.733
<v Speaker 2>kids or my kids to go into prostitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also don't think anybody should </v>

2728
01:59:13.151 --> 01:59:13.984
<v Speaker 2>tell people that something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely legal to do for free is </v>

2729
01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:21.390
<v Speaker 2>illegal to charge money for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2730
01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Like there is some gay male escort that </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out today.</v>

2731
01:59:25.530 --> 01:59:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

2732
01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I put it on my twitter about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let these fucking people have sex.</v>

2733
01:59:29.951 --> 01:59:30.784
<v Speaker 2>Like some gay male escort was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the priests at the Vatican and </v>

<v Speaker 2>them have male escorts,</v>

2744
01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:56.320

<v Speaker 2>Say That's fine.</v>

2745
01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Just as long as you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe in Jesus still.</v>

2746
01:59:58.031 --> 01:59:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I believe in Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love Dick.</v>

2748
02:00:01.331 --> 02:00:02.164
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well Jesus must've put that love for </v>

<v Speaker 2>Dick in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2751
02:00:06.851 --> 02:00:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must have been.</v>

2752
02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:09.460
<v Speaker 2>The truth is</v>

2753
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.350
<v Speaker 3>it's a complicated thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2754
02:00:12.351 --> 02:00:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Because then where do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2755
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:18.850
<v Speaker 3>so like we had these urges and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them are not very productive,</v>

2756
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:23.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you want to have sex with all,</v>

2757
02:00:23.210 --> 02:00:25.580
<v Speaker 3>you want to have sex with everybody you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can or whatever it might be,</v>

2758
02:00:25.581 --> 02:00:27.800
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not viable because there are just</v>

2759
02:00:27.801 --> 02:00:28.640
<v Speaker 3>certain trade offs</v>

2760
02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:30.600
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2761
02:00:30.670 --> 02:00:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2762
02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:36.280
<v Speaker 2>the viable alternatives x Mokena you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these ai robot fuck dolls that live</v>

2763
02:00:37.541 --> 02:00:40.030
<v Speaker 2>in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is they probably get too</v>

2764
02:00:40.031 --> 02:00:44.230
<v Speaker 2>smart than they kill your real wife.</v>

2766
02:00:46.031 --> 02:00:47.980
<v Speaker 2>your sperm into babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

2767
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:51.080
<v Speaker 2>they've figured out a way to create an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual digital wound.</v>

2768
02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Could idea for from movie dude.</v>

2811
02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:47.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real thing that the same people </v>

2812
02:02:48.231 --> 02:02:50.120
<v Speaker 2>that are making those Boston dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots,</v>

2813
02:02:50.530 --> 02:02:52.730
<v Speaker 2>you just see the one recently that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounces.</v>

2814
02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:53.683
<v Speaker 2>It pulls up to the side of a wall and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then bounces over the wall like 13 feet </v>

2815
02:02:56.301 --> 02:02:59.090
<v Speaker 2>in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No lands on top of a building.</v>

2816
02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:00.073
<v Speaker 2>It could land on the roof of a building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on from the bottom and hop all the </v>

2817
02:03:02.931 --> 02:03:05.570
<v Speaker 2>way up to the second story.</v>

2818
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:06.403
<v Speaker 2>Building two story building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It leaps literally from the ground all </v>

2819
02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:13.040
<v Speaker 2>the way to the top itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on wheels,</v>

2820
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:14.810
<v Speaker 2>so it writes itself perfectly every </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2821
02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:16.550
<v Speaker 2>That's so fucking,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jamie's like,</v>

2825
02:03:23.871 --> 02:03:26.750
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim Kardashian called out the easy mafia</v>

2826
02:03:26.751 --> 02:03:27.240
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You like her a camera dash,</v>

2828
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:30.403
<v Speaker 2>and he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves celebrity gossip and upset of </v>

2829
02:03:33.831 --> 02:03:36.030
<v Speaker 2>how I met your mother and she was there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were.</v>

2830
02:03:36.031 --> 02:03:38.270
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her dressing room was right next to mine</v>

2831
02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:41.230
<v Speaker 2>that she was on set and she didn't look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what I thought she was.</v>

2832
02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:43.040
<v Speaker 2>She didn't have any makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's pretty and all,</v>

2833
02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:45.060
<v Speaker 2>but it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that I was hurt.</v>

2834
02:03:45.061 --> 02:03:46.380
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's Kim Kardashian.</v>

2835
02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:47.243
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

2836
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:48.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a person.</v>

2837
02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:49.833
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've made a bizarre choice to spend a </v>

2838
02:03:53.481 --> 02:03:55.980
<v Speaker 2>tremendous and me included spend a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of talent,</v>

2839
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:58.070
<v Speaker 2>tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of time thinking about</v>

2840
02:03:58.071 --> 02:03:58.904
<v Speaker 2>a person that really doesn't do a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just live like that's what's </v>

2841
02:04:02.961 --> 02:04:04.250
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like she,</v>

2842
02:04:04.251 --> 02:04:08.270
<v Speaker 2>they've tapped into this extreme desire </v>
<v Speaker 2>for gossip and some weird,</v>

2843
02:04:08.271 --> 02:04:09.104
<v Speaker 2>crazy way where they do all these wacky </v>
<v Speaker 2>things with life where you can't take </v>

2844
02:04:10.821 --> 02:04:13.070
<v Speaker 2>your eyes off of them and they always </v>
<v Speaker 2>have something new going on,</v>

2845
02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.150
<v Speaker 2>but they don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now she got wise though and married a</v>

2846
02:04:17.151 --> 02:04:19.910
<v Speaker 2>guy who does other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd married Kanye West,</v>

2847
02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:22.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a giant cultural thing.</v>

2848
02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then now it becomes more legit.</v>

2849
02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Now the whole empire is like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>solidified,</v>

2850
02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:31.320
<v Speaker 2>like they've added some fucking sand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ambition,</v>

2851
02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:33.490
<v Speaker 2>ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like this strange.</v>

2852
02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.333
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely that.</v>

2853
02:04:35.090 --> 02:04:37.260
<v Speaker 2>There's ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also this.</v>

2854
02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.090
<v Speaker 2>They've figured out how to Juke the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

2855
02:04:39.450 --> 02:04:43.380
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to Shuck and jive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make their way in with no singing,</v>

2856
02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:46.700
<v Speaker 2>no dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no comedy into money.</v>

2857
02:04:46.710 --> 02:04:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I think I have money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you do?</v>

2858
02:04:49.291 --> 02:04:50.124
<v Speaker 2>Anything different than you did like </v>
<v Speaker 2>besides not worry so much about what a </v>

2859
02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:55.740
<v Speaker 2>car is going to cost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you do that's luxurious?</v>

2860
02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:57.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't really do much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man addressed.</v>

2861
02:04:57.730 --> 02:05:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Those are dress I know address normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2862
02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go running.</v>

2863
02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:04.073
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any advice you'd like hunting </v>

2864
02:05:06.370 --> 02:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>on advice though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I get my.</v>

2865
02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is what I mean is like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't spend.</v>

2866
02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take a lot of time and energy.</v>

2870
02:05:19.710 --> 02:05:20.543
<v Speaker 2>I think if you wanted to travel and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to go on some big time </v>

<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kick each other in the balls when </v>

<v Speaker 2>they were living there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like be jockeying for attention.</v>

2910
02:07:02.010 --> 02:07:02.843
<v Speaker 2>They had buddy each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why they have those antlers in </v>

2911
02:07:04.351 --> 02:07:08.280
<v Speaker 2>the first place and then they walk up </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind each other and lift their feet up</v>

2912
02:07:08.281 --> 02:07:11.070

<v Speaker 2>Once they collide,</v>

2924
02:07:38.530 --> 02:07:40.600
<v Speaker 2>look at his sack on the right just </v>
<v Speaker 2>swinging.</v>

2925
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:41.463

<v Speaker 2>I smell mountain lion.</v>

2928
02:07:48.890 --> 02:07:50.460
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing algorithms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2929
02:07:50.660 --> 02:07:53.500

<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2931
02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:01.000
<v Speaker 2>And they snap into it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they're running into their</v>

2932
02:08:01.001 --> 02:08:01.834
<v Speaker 2>head down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're putting all this extra emphasis </v>

2933
02:08:04.121 --> 02:08:04.954
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to make it uncomfortable </v>

2934
02:08:05.591 --> 02:08:06.424
<v Speaker 2>for the other dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing is when you see two </v>

2935
02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:11.350
<v Speaker 2>bucks and they're orange get tied up </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2936
02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:13.780
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's crazy about this is that they</v>

2937
02:08:13.781 --> 02:08:16.150
<v Speaker 2>pause afterwards so they must get their </v>
<v Speaker 2>bell rung.</v>

2938
02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

2939
02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:22.420
<v Speaker 2>they just stand there and they back up </v>
<v Speaker 2>like no one is like,</v>

2940
02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.433
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit you again and now hit you with </v>

2941
02:08:24.491 --> 02:08:25.630
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>

2942
02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:26.600
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Take a days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't find a bucket,</v>

2944

<v Speaker 2>must be lunches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2945
02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:31.960
<v Speaker 2>And then they built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both like,</v>

2946
02:08:31.961 --> 02:08:34.810
<v Speaker 2>what is happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>

2947
02:08:34.811 --> 02:08:36.880
<v Speaker 2>They turned to sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost like the one.</v>

2948
02:08:36.881 --> 02:08:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Ignore the fact that the guys there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

2949
02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:44.590
<v Speaker 2>look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they see cool shit.</v>

2950
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:45.663
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2951
02:08:47.590 --> 02:08:50.010
<v Speaker 2>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You butterflies and fairies.</v>

2952
02:08:50.290 --> 02:08:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Fairies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His came up off the ground.</v>

2953
02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Do they hit each other so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just stop.</v>

2954
02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.153
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hit each other and then they just </v>

2955
02:08:57.821 --> 02:09:02.800
<v Speaker 2>chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're getting off on it,</v>

2956
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:05.860
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're getting some kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

2957
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:08.103
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if anybody's ever observed like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wonder if there'd be a way to measure </v>

2958
02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:15.170
<v Speaker 2>like certain neuro transmitters on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like inaction,</v>

2959
02:09:15.250 --> 02:09:19.060
<v Speaker 2>like let them collide with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then figure out like what happens to</v>

2960
02:09:19.061 --> 02:09:19.720
<v Speaker 2>the brain.</v>

2961
02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's some burst of happiness </v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes out of that.</v>

2962
02:09:22.150 --> 02:09:22.983
<v Speaker 2>They talk about this in concussion where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the where they don't suffer from brain </v>

2963
02:09:26.861 --> 02:09:29.020
<v Speaker 2>trauma or cte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually they don't get.</v>

2964
02:09:29.050 --> 02:09:30.640
<v Speaker 2>You think that they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but male,</v>

2965
02:09:31.090 --> 02:09:34.510
<v Speaker 2>the male rams don't have science and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain is designed different than our</v>

2966
02:09:34.511 --> 02:09:36.990
<v Speaker 2>same as a woodpecker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woodpecker is brain and fuck it,</v>

2967
02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:38.913
<v Speaker 2>they were in my garden are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The physiology of the skull was the </v>

2968
02:09:42.071 --> 02:09:42.904
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way their brain is attached to </v>

2969
02:09:44.741 --> 02:09:45.574
<v Speaker 2>the inside of the skull is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our brains like barely attached our </v>

2970
02:09:49.331 --> 02:09:50.164
<v Speaker 2>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone who's like not worried </v>

2971
02:09:51.011 --> 02:09:52.480
<v Speaker 2>about anything bad going wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2972
02:09:52.490 --> 02:09:55.330
<v Speaker 2>it's all gelatinous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like our spinal cord goes brain and it's</v>

2973
02:09:55.331 --> 02:09:57.790
<v Speaker 2>all one big sort of gelatinous mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2974
02:09:57.820 --> 02:10:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we're just not sturdy,</v>

2975
02:10:01.710 --> 02:10:02.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just so weak in comparison to </v>

2976
02:10:04.271 --> 02:10:06.390
<v Speaker 2>other animals like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it's like,</v>

2977
02:10:06.391 --> 02:10:09.160
<v Speaker 2>like you remember when you shot your </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer in Montana and we were um,</v>

2978
02:10:09.250 --> 02:10:13.120
<v Speaker 2>we were cleaning it and addressing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're pulling on the skin.</v>

2979
02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:14.433
<v Speaker 2>You're grabbing that which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people turn into jackets </v>

2980
02:10:18.311 --> 02:10:19.144
<v Speaker 2>and pants and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the native Americans just make </v>

2981
02:10:20.591 --> 02:10:23.350
<v Speaker 2>clothes on them and you're grabbing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hide and you're thinking,</v>

2982
02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:25.300
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so thick.</v>

2983
02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:26.193
<v Speaker 2>Like this shit is strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're pulling on it and then grab your </v>

2984
02:10:29.441 --> 02:10:32.650
<v Speaker 2>bitch ass scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have toilet paper scan,</v>

2985
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:37.560
<v Speaker 2>nick it and it's a process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2986
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.070
<v Speaker 2>while we were cleaning that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were,</v>

2987
02:10:40.071 --> 02:10:41.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were doing the ravine comer.</v>

2988
02:10:42.170 --> 02:10:43.003
<v Speaker 2>I remember I sliced my finger open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just touched my finger with the blade </v>

2989
02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:48.260
<v Speaker 2>and my fingers squirting all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2990
02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to really dig in to get to this</v>

2991
02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:51.693

2993
02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you get an infection,</v>

2994
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:59.150
<v Speaker 2>like if you got a blister on your foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're in the wilderness,</v>

2995
02:10:59.210 --> 02:11:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you know who you're fucked,</v>

<v Speaker 2>horns and they're starting to scrape the</v>

3047
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:06.440
<v Speaker 2>velvet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the outer skin off of the bone.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their antlers are so big that that </v>

3100
02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:11.800

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3129
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:09.300

<v Speaker 2>People go shit on to Mexico.</v>

3130
02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:11.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe deer.</v>

3131
02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:13.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of deer in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Nora.</v>

3132
02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:16.230
<v Speaker 2>So Nora has a lot of mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dangerous though,</v>

3133
02:16:16.231 --> 02:16:17.670
<v Speaker 2>aren't there a bunch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be scared.</v>

3134
02:16:19.930 --> 02:16:23.160
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you gotta worry about is uh,</v>

3135
02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you would go to their towns </v>
<v Speaker 2>and caused problems,</v>

3136
02:16:27.771 --> 02:16:31.330
<v Speaker 2>you went to just say no to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're busy making drug money.</v>

3137
02:16:31.710 --> 02:16:33.610
<v Speaker 2>They don't have time to go looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some asshole.</v>

3138
02:16:33.611 --> 02:16:34.444
<v Speaker 2>Shoot a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's branches that you go to out </v>

3139
02:16:36.431 --> 02:16:39.650
<v Speaker 2>there were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd normally they're hunting ranches.</v>

3140
02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:41.500
<v Speaker 2>That's why people go there in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

3141
02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:42.873
<v Speaker 2>And that would probably be like where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you park your stuff and you drive in </v>

3142
02:16:45.911 --> 02:16:46.744
<v Speaker 2>from Arizona to Cancun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the guys who's there and </v>

3143
02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:50.950
<v Speaker 2>wealth do guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

3144
02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:52.530
<v Speaker 2>what about the cartels?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3145
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:56.890
<v Speaker 2>they own a lot of these resorts to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>money for them,</v>

3146
02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:57.753
<v Speaker 2>they don't worry about the cartels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've talked to a guy with this </v>

3147
02:16:59.831 --> 02:17:02.740
<v Speaker 2>amazing restaurant and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the cartels?</v>

3148
02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:05.000
<v Speaker 2>And they said they'd come here and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

3149
02:17:05.001 --> 02:17:05.834
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This does show up in a bunch of SUV is </v>

3150
02:17:07.361 --> 02:17:08.320
<v Speaker 2>they come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tip,</v>

3151
02:17:08.350 --> 02:17:09.183
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>

3152
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like extort money.</v>

3153
02:17:10.690 --> 02:17:11.523
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time that happens is if you're </v>

3154
02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:13.293
<v Speaker 2>selling drugs out of your restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're selling drugs out of your </v>

3155
02:17:16.151 --> 02:17:17.230
<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want a piece.</v>

3156
02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all ingrained.</v>

3157
02:17:20.351 --> 02:17:22.840
<v Speaker 2>It's all like a whole business you say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3158
02:17:22.841 --> 02:17:24.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3159
02:17:24.310 --> 02:17:25.143
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Punta Mita and we took these </v>

3160
02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:29.613
<v Speaker 2>golf carts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They let us take these golf carts to </v>

3161
02:17:31.361 --> 02:17:32.860
<v Speaker 2>town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're staying at this resort.</v>

3162
02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:34.091
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

3163
02:17:34.091 --> 02:17:39.091
<v Speaker 2>you leave the resort and when you leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>the resort there is a stark contrast.</v>

3164
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.983
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From safety and beautifully manicured </v>

3165
02:17:43.751 --> 02:17:48.751
<v Speaker 2>lawns and landscaped grounds to we get </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3166
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:50.103
<v Speaker 2>We are maybe 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 yards from the outside and we see a </v>

3167
02:17:54.881 --> 02:17:56.050
<v Speaker 2>military base.</v>

3168
02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:59.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a very small military base with two</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys with bulletproof vests,</v>

3169
02:17:59.770 --> 02:18:00.603
<v Speaker 2>helmets on holding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what kind of fucking high </v>

3170
02:18:02.441 --> 02:18:07.360
<v Speaker 2>powered rifle are behind a metal plate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's attached to the top of a jeep.</v>

3171
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:12.750
<v Speaker 2>So they literally area in like riot war </v>
<v Speaker 2>type vehicle.</v>

3172
02:18:13.121 --> 02:18:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fully armed,</v>

3173
02:18:15.010 --> 02:18:15.843
<v Speaker 2>ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if anything went wrong right over </v>

3174
02:18:17.951 --> 02:18:20.920
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they drive in so they're protecting this</v>

3175
02:18:20.921 --> 02:18:23.230
<v Speaker 2>resort and I realized like protective is</v>
<v Speaker 2>sword.</v>

3176
02:18:23.260 --> 02:18:24.093
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there to protect all these </v>

3177
02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:27.933
<v Speaker 2>wealthy people from Europe and America </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wherever the fly in stay at this </v>

3178
02:18:31.871 --> 02:18:34.030
<v Speaker 2>resort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like Whoa,</v>

3179
02:18:34.031 --> 02:18:38.290
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy because it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean why else would that be there?</v>

3180
02:18:38.370 --> 02:18:41.650
<v Speaker 2>It's there and they're like waiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the gate.</v>

3181
02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:43.073
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

3182
02:18:43.330 --> 02:18:44.163
<v Speaker 2>there's a great deal to be said about </v>
<v Speaker 2>having institutions you can trust like </v>

3183
02:18:48.791 --> 02:18:52.330
<v Speaker 2>courts that can enforce contracts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not corruptible.</v>

3184
02:18:52.330 --> 02:18:54.130
<v Speaker 2>So in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you buy a house,</v>

3185
02:18:54.131 --> 02:18:56.050
<v Speaker 2>that piece of paper actually means </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3186
02:18:56.300 --> 02:18:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And most countries not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your private property,</v>

3187
02:18:59.891 --> 02:19:03.610
<v Speaker 2>but somebody with a bigger guy come and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it from me as we can decide you did</v>

3188
02:19:03.611 --> 02:19:05.050
<v Speaker 2>something wrong and they have to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3189
02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:05.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is the fundamental difference </v>

3190
02:19:06.791 --> 02:19:09.490
<v Speaker 2>between our countries still and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries,</v>

3191
02:19:09.491 --> 02:19:11.200
<v Speaker 2>including Mexico and someplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3192
02:19:11.201 --> 02:19:13.210
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened to that McAfee guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

3193
02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Where was it that he was at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it Costa Rica?</v>

3194
02:19:16.330 --> 02:19:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Where was he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3195
02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:19.930
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else that you remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

3196
02:19:19.931 --> 02:19:20.764
<v Speaker 2>the McAfee guy that came up with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>virus software and then he went bananas </v>

3197
02:19:23.501 --> 02:19:26.950
<v Speaker 2>and moved to some other country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some tropical country.</v>

3198
02:19:27.530 --> 02:19:30.440
<v Speaker 2>What happened to as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They accused him of murder.</v>

3199
02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Was it billy's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They accused him of murder and he had to</v>

3200
02:19:34.881 --> 02:19:37.730
<v Speaker 2>flee the country and they took his land </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>

3201
02:19:37.731 --> 02:19:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're their railroad in me.</v>

3202
02:19:39.170 --> 02:19:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually talked to him on the podcast</v>

3203
02:19:41.841 --> 02:19:42.674
<v Speaker 2>when he was on the Lam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He called me up on the phone and I did </v>

3204
02:19:45.771 --> 02:19:49.160
<v Speaker 2>an interview with him on the lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what happens.</v>

3205
02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:50.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a.</v>

3206
02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:51.860
<v Speaker 2>He gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's living in America now,</v>

3207
02:19:51.861 --> 02:19:52.694
<v Speaker 2>but he's like a bonafide wild man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he denied these reports that </v>

3208
02:19:56.290 --> 02:19:57.123
<v Speaker 2>there's a forum where someone was taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>photos of method they were making and </v>

3209
02:20:04.041 --> 02:20:06.950
<v Speaker 2>explaining how their re-engineering meth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and making it better.</v>

3210
02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:09.140
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were saying that it was him,</v>

3211
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:10.950
<v Speaker 2>that he was the one who was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3212
02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:13.910
<v Speaker 2>so he's in beliefs get some fucking lab </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his backyard.</v>

3213
02:20:13.911 --> 02:20:14.744
<v Speaker 2>He denied the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if it's true or not </v>

3214
02:20:16.341 --> 02:20:18.740
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said he was trolling like,</v>

3215
02:20:18.741 --> 02:20:19.670
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

3216
02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that Jamie.</v>

3217
02:20:22.430 --> 02:20:24.380
<v Speaker 2>It was something connected to like bath </v>
<v Speaker 2>salts,</v>

3218
02:20:24.381 --> 02:20:28.550
<v Speaker 2>like he figured out how to reengineer </v>
<v Speaker 2>bath salts and make them better people.</v>

3219
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Can you know what's going to happen if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you take.</v>

3220
02:20:30.351 --> 02:20:31.184
<v Speaker 2>Nobody took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had a lot of problems and then </v>

3221
02:20:32.691 --> 02:20:35.420
<v Speaker 2>took some meth and they got better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my question though.</v>

3222
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:37.790
<v Speaker 2>How many people are doing math right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we just don't hear about it.</v>

3223
02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meth labs and dead dogs.</v>

3224
02:20:40.401 --> 02:20:45.401
<v Speaker 2>So the founder of McAfee antivirus went </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the run and believes Meth,</v>

3225
02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:48.830
<v Speaker 2>meth labs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was about the dogs.</v>

3226
02:20:48.831 --> 02:20:52.280
<v Speaker 2>When it say what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scroll back and dead dogs.</v>

3227
02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3228
02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Dead Dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the story.</v>

3229
02:20:55.361 --> 02:20:57.890
<v Speaker 2>He says he was trolling about the meth </v>
<v Speaker 2>labs,</v>

3230
02:20:58.280 --> 02:20:59.113
<v Speaker 2>but it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That dude was just part is as often </v>

3231
02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:03.013
<v Speaker 2>believes somebody wind up accusing </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody of murder and I think they </v>

3232
02:21:06.981 --> 02:21:08.660
<v Speaker 2>wanted to question him and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3233
02:21:08.661 --> 02:21:11.690
<v Speaker 2>you think I'm gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Move back to America.</v>

3234
02:21:11.691 --> 02:21:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I tried this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun guys.</v>

3235
02:21:14.290 --> 02:21:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just blog about you for a couple of</v>

3236
02:21:15.891 --> 02:21:16.724
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3237
02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:22.430
<v Speaker 2>What's he do for money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started McAfee antivirus.</v>

3238
02:21:22.431 --> 02:21:25.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's got millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took a lot of his cash though.</v>

3239
02:21:25.641 --> 02:21:28.190
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with Russia and a lot</v>

3240
02:21:28.191 --> 02:21:29.024
<v Speaker 2>of countries when when like the ruling </v>
<v Speaker 2>elite has the power to do whatever they </v>

3241
02:21:32.331 --> 02:21:33.210
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including kill you.</v>

3242
02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:37.250
<v Speaker 2>You guys take your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this double agent in England today.</v>

3243
02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:40.190
<v Speaker 2>London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and his daughter are gravely ill.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3247
02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:46.190

<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

3248
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna you're gonna die.</v>

3249
02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a bad job.</v>

3250
02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Secret agent against Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a risky fucking job.</v>

3251
02:21:55.370 --> 02:21:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Did you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Boy.</v>

3254
02:21:58.281 --> 02:22:01.730
<v Speaker 2>One a Oscar for that Disney did and well</v>
<v Speaker 2>deserved.</v>

3255
02:22:02.090 --> 02:22:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Well deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know where that Russian scientists.</v>

3256
02:22:03.981 --> 02:22:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is under protection.</v>

3257
02:22:06.530 --> 02:22:07.363
<v Speaker 2>He is right now under protective custody</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere where they're worried about </v>

3258
02:22:11.661 --> 02:22:14.480
<v Speaker 2>him being assassinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They they took.</v>

3259
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Not only did they take all of his money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took away his wife's house.</v>

3260
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:19.301
<v Speaker 2>They did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3262
02:22:20.781 --> 02:22:21.614
<v Speaker 2>Homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're trying to pressure him </v>

3263
02:22:24.411 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>into going back to Russia and giving</v>

3264
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:28.740
<v Speaker 1>himself up by making his family </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially homeless.</v>

3265
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're putting tremendous pressure on </v>

3266
02:22:32.521 --> 02:22:34.950
<v Speaker 1>him so he can't get his wife out or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

3267
02:22:34.951 --> 02:22:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Or Gregory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is his last name?</v>

3268
02:22:37.130 --> 02:22:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Gagarin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't as well,</v>

3269
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:44.250

<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

3270
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:45.720
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't want to listen.</v>

3271
02:22:45.810 --> 02:22:48.780
<v Speaker 1>She didn't want to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was already out of the country and he</v>

3272
02:22:48.781 --> 02:22:50.880
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't want to listen to him and she</v>

3273
02:22:50.881 --> 02:22:51.714
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand that he had been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were listening to his phone calls </v>

3274
02:22:54.001 --> 02:22:54.834
<v Speaker 1>and emails that she didn't have a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have a way of expressing to </v>

3275
02:22:57.061 --> 02:22:58.920
<v Speaker 1>her like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3276
02:22:58.921 --> 02:23:01.560
<v Speaker 1>you've gotta get the fuck out now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you did that,</v>

3277
02:23:01.561 --> 02:23:03.180
<v Speaker 1>they would have just come and scooped </v>
<v Speaker 1>her up.</v>

3278
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:06.103
<v Speaker 1>No due process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rod Shanoff Gregory watching off the </v>

3279
02:23:09.601 --> 02:23:11.130
<v Speaker 1>head of the Russian anti-doping </v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratory.</v>

3280
02:23:11.131 --> 02:23:13.200
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing documentary folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen it,</v>

3281
02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:14.273
<v Speaker 1>it's on Netflix man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it just shows you what it could be </v>

3282
02:23:17.431 --> 02:23:20.040
<v Speaker 1>like in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't play by the rules.</v>

3283
02:23:20.041 --> 02:23:22.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He who has the power makes the rules.</v>

3284
02:23:22.741 --> 02:23:23.720
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

3285
02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:27.630
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with the mafia basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized bad.</v>

3286
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people that love it</v>

3287
02:23:30.121 --> 02:23:31.320
<v Speaker 1>to be like that here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3288
02:23:31.321 --> 02:23:32.400
<v Speaker 1>they would love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3289
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And they don't because they have no idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what history is about.</v>

3290
02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to use this,</v>

3291
02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:39.720
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to believe in things </v>

3293
02:23:43.591 --> 02:23:46.290
<v Speaker 1>like due process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3294
02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:47.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity of courts and all those </v>

3295
02:23:48.991 --> 02:23:49.890
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3296
02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:50.963
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to believe that you </v>

3297
02:23:53.761 --> 02:23:55.950
<v Speaker 1>should have a right to criticize your </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

3298
02:23:57.330 --> 02:23:58.163
<v Speaker 1>I know what works for you right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the person in power is on your </v>

3299
02:24:01.321 --> 02:24:03.120
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're next.</v>

3300
02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:04.073
<v Speaker 1>You're next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as the tables flip and the </v>

3301
02:24:05.371 --> 02:24:08.490
<v Speaker 1>table's always flip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you are historically ignorant.</v>

3302
02:24:08.910 --> 02:24:11.910
<v Speaker 1>There is a reason that the founding </v>
<v Speaker 1>fathers thought through these things.</v>

3303
02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:14.980
<v Speaker 1>They came from tyranny and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3304
02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:15.873
<v Speaker 1>the genius of the founding fathers was </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's those checks and balances and </v>

3305
02:24:18.631 --> 02:24:19.464
<v Speaker 1>representative government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's such a radical idea that our </v>

3306
02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:26.580
<v Speaker 1>leaders are basically are they serve at </v>
<v Speaker 1>our whim?</v>

3307
02:24:26.581 --> 02:24:27.414
<v Speaker 1>Now that's all changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence lessig you need to have on the </v>

3308
02:24:30.121 --> 02:24:32.820
<v Speaker 1>podcast who wrote republic last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about them all the time.</v>

3309
02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence lessig will tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

3310
02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:37.490
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's at Harvard University.</v>

3311
02:24:37.491 --> 02:24:39.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a law professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3312
02:24:39.361 --> 02:24:44.361
<v Speaker 1>your government does not represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the Gerrymander districts where</v>

3313
02:24:44.780 --> 02:24:46.440
<v Speaker 1>there are all these districts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>gerrymandered.</v>

3314
02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:47.353
<v Speaker 1>You know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the congressional districts are </v>

3315
02:24:50.161 --> 02:24:50.994
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're redrawn so that they favor one </v>

3316
02:24:55.921 --> 02:24:57.990
<v Speaker 1>party or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand?</v>

3317
02:24:58.430 --> 02:24:59.263
<v Speaker 1>So demographics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a million Republicans in </v>

3318
02:25:01.891 --> 02:25:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not vote.</v>

3319
02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:05.670
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not represented.</v>

3320
02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:06.533
<v Speaker 1>Because the districts are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>gerrymandered that it's always going to </v>

3321
02:25:09.871 --> 02:25:12.900
<v Speaker 1>be typically a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one example.</v>

3322
02:25:12.930 --> 02:25:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of the 435 seats in Congress,</v>

3323
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.943
<v Speaker 1>the ones that aren't chairman and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that are actually where your vote </v>

3324
02:25:21.721 --> 02:25:24.850
<v Speaker 1>actually counts there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 35 of those seats,</v>

3325
02:25:24.970 --> 02:25:26.560
<v Speaker 1>about 35 of the 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35.</v>

3326
02:25:26.561 --> 02:25:27.394
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep this in mind to every fucking </v>

3327
02:25:30.641 --> 02:25:31.474
<v Speaker 1>congressmen that you know spends 30 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of his or her time calling </v>

3328
02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:41.820
<v Speaker 1>for money raising funds and they do sent</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 to 70 percent of their time.</v>

3329
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:44.440
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they do it.</v>

3330
02:25:44.441 --> 02:25:48.550
<v Speaker 1>And this has been well documented in </v>
<v Speaker 1>republic last and so damn much money.</v>

3331
02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:50.440
<v Speaker 1>There are some very good books that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>read on this.</v>

3332
02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I've had less sick on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why's he got to have him on because he's</v>

3333
02:25:53.351 --> 02:25:54.910
<v Speaker 1>a fucking important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be happy to.</v>

3334
02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:55.773
<v Speaker 1>He's so important to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had his spells name Lawrence </v>

3335
02:26:00.130 --> 02:26:05.130
<v Speaker 1>lessig s l e s s I g and he does an </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing job.</v>

3336
02:26:05.351 --> 02:26:07.690
<v Speaker 1>He's got a great ted talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can listen to her for 20 minutes.</v>

3337
02:26:07.930 --> 02:26:08.763
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just listen to him talk about how </v>

3338
02:26:10.691 --> 02:26:13.690
<v Speaker 1>democracy doesn't work the way it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>with money in politics now,</v>

3339
02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:14.793
<v Speaker 1>and he talks about campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just so when you didn't say campaign </v>

3340
02:26:16.481 --> 02:26:17.314
<v Speaker 1>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reform everybody's zones out that those </v>

3341
02:26:19.001 --> 02:26:20.290
<v Speaker 1>words are exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3342
02:26:20.291 --> 02:26:21.124
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he opens the book with this fucking </v>

3343
02:26:24.041 --> 02:26:26.560
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thorough quote and he talks about if you</v>

3344
02:26:26.561 --> 02:26:27.394
<v Speaker 1>want to talk about the problems in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and our democracy and this </v>

3345
02:26:30.191 --> 02:26:31.024
<v Speaker 1>thorough quote is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see men everywhere hacking at the </v>

3346
02:26:32.801 --> 02:26:35.770
<v Speaker 1>branches of evil while none are striking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the root.</v>

3347
02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:38.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a great fucking quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3348
02:26:38.151 --> 02:26:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Him Throw Hudson good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3349
02:26:39.671 --> 02:26:41.750
<v Speaker 1>he had some good ones because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

3350
02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:44.560
<v Speaker 1>some of those data and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my other favorite mark twain quote,</v>

3351
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:45.783
<v Speaker 1>a loyalty to my country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always to my government only when it </v>

3352
02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:49.930
<v Speaker 1>deserves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two really cool quotes,</v>

3353
02:26:49.931 --> 02:26:52.780
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does a really good job of saying that</v>

3354
02:26:52.781 --> 02:26:53.614
<v Speaker 1>35 seats really matter and those are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only ones that matter with those </v>

3355
02:26:56.980 --> 02:26:58.570
<v Speaker 1>districts worth voting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3356
02:26:58.650 --> 02:27:00.670
<v Speaker 1>where it makes sense to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where if you're,</v>

3357
02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:02.590
<v Speaker 1>if you're a republican or a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that,</v>

3358
02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:06.640
<v Speaker 1>where that to contested seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then those,</v>

3359
02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:08.530
<v Speaker 1>those concussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congressional,</v>

3360
02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:09.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates or those ones were in Qa or </v>

3361
02:27:11.570 --> 02:27:12.880
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the seat's already.</v>

3362
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.890
<v Speaker 1>They have to raise money to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

3363
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:16.023
<v Speaker 1>So they're talking to their donors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fundraisers are the ones that are </v>

3364
02:27:18.761 --> 02:27:19.594
<v Speaker 1>telling them what kind of issues they </v>
<v Speaker 1>better hit on if they want the big </v>

3365
02:27:22.871 --> 02:27:23.500
<v Speaker 1>donors.</v>

3366
02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:26.890
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy system.</v>

3367
02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:27.783
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system has affected the place where </v>

3368
02:27:30.941 --> 02:27:31.774
<v Speaker 1>we came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what if the United States didn't </v>

3369
02:27:34.090 --> 02:27:34.923
<v Speaker 1>take off from Europe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we didn't bail and start this </v>

3370
02:27:37.421 --> 02:27:39.670
<v Speaker 1>thing up over here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would it be like over there?</v>

3371
02:27:39.870 --> 02:27:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Because what it was like over there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of kings and queens and shit and</v>

3372
02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:44.630
<v Speaker 1>had been like that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3373
02:27:44.770 --> 02:27:47.950
<v Speaker 1>And now now it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a queen,</v>

3374
02:27:47.951 --> 02:27:49.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3375
02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:51.190
<v Speaker 1>there's one prince was getting married </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3376
02:27:51.210 --> 02:27:52.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who seem to give a fuck about.</v>

3377
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3378
02:27:54.221 --> 02:27:56.680
<v Speaker 1>George George Washington said right when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to make him king,</v>

3379
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:58.840
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fight this revolutionary war to</v>

3380
02:27:58.841 --> 02:27:59.674
<v Speaker 1>become George the second and George </v>
<v Speaker 1>George King George was the king over </v>

3381
02:28:03.341 --> 02:28:04.174
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when King George found out that </v>

3382
02:28:06.251 --> 02:28:09.790
<v Speaker 1>George Washington refuse to kingship and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

3383
02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:10.893
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a president and I will serve a term </v>

3384
02:28:12.841 --> 02:28:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and I'll go back to month Jello.</v>

3385
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Wherever he's from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that Jefferson or whatever,</v>

3386
02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:18.620
<v Speaker 1>either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said or Mount Vernon.</v>

3387
02:28:18.621 --> 02:28:19.454
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3388
02:28:20.570 --> 02:28:21.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short came to our said if he said that </v>

3389
02:28:22.431 --> 02:28:26.120
<v Speaker 1>he's the greatest man to airlift to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected power.</v>

3390
02:28:26.180 --> 02:28:28.670
<v Speaker 1>But that's what George Washington said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fought.</v>

3391
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.863
<v Speaker 1>I fought against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing is that it's affected </v>

3392
02:28:32.691 --> 02:28:33.524
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the goal of this works better </v>

3393
02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:38.990
<v Speaker 1>because it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how did it set in over there?</v>

3394
02:28:38.991 --> 02:28:39.824
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how did it eventually they gave up </v>

3395
02:28:43.580 --> 02:28:46.970
<v Speaker 1>power to sort of emulate the west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3396
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:51.330
<v Speaker 1>the British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British always had a tradition of so</v>

3397
02:28:51.530 --> 02:28:55.370
<v Speaker 1>way before the revolutionary war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way before the American experiment.</v>

3398
02:28:55.820 --> 02:28:56.653
<v Speaker 1>There was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact the thing it started with Henry </v>

3399
02:28:58.371 --> 02:28:59.204
<v Speaker 1>the eighth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was always a contentious debate </v>

3400
02:29:03.411 --> 02:29:06.740
<v Speaker 1>about how much power the king should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have versus parliament,</v>

3401
02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:09.950
<v Speaker 1>how much power the king should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus the landed gentry verse.</v>

3402
02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:13.880
<v Speaker 1>It was always that issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of lyricists that the king</v>

3403
02:29:13.881 --> 02:29:16.040
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to show any merit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

3404
02:29:16.090 --> 02:29:16.923
<v Speaker 1>They didn't rise through the ranks by </v>
<v Speaker 1>hacking their way through a river of </v>

3405
02:29:19.071 --> 02:29:20.210
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't.</v>

3406
02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:21.073
<v Speaker 1>They didn't just figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring prosperity to the land and so </v>

3407
02:29:24.351 --> 02:29:26.360
<v Speaker 1>voted them at as king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually,</v>

3408
02:29:26.361 --> 02:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>it's actually fascinating that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>small island,</v>

3409
02:29:28.770 --> 02:29:29.603
<v Speaker 1>the small island of Pale people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically controlled almost the entire </v>

3410
02:29:33.111 --> 02:29:34.970
<v Speaker 1>world on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's given credit is</v>

3411
02:29:34.971 --> 02:29:38.390
<v Speaker 1>that the British had this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious idea almost.</v>

3412
02:29:38.540 --> 02:29:39.373
<v Speaker 1>It was called the great chain of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the great chain of being was you </v>

3413
02:29:42.021 --> 02:29:45.200
<v Speaker 1>have God at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>king is second place,</v>

3414
02:29:45.530 --> 02:29:50.000
<v Speaker 1>then you have the aristocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have the nobility,</v>

3415
02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:52.520
<v Speaker 1>the landed gentry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the surface,</v>

3416
02:29:52.780 --> 02:29:56.600
<v Speaker 1>and if you and for you to aspire out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your place,</v>

3417
02:29:56.601 --> 02:29:59.900
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your God given place for you to say,</v>

3418
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I may be an aristocrat or Nobel or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta Gentry,</v>

3419
02:30:04.131 --> 02:30:05.210
<v Speaker 1>but someday I'm going to be the king.</v>

3420
02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:06.253
<v Speaker 1>That would be considered fucking heresy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the equivalent of us </v>

3421
02:30:09.471 --> 02:30:10.304
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think white people are better than </v>

3422
02:30:11.541 --> 02:30:12.830
<v Speaker 1>black people today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3423
02:30:12.831 --> 02:30:14.870
<v Speaker 1>it would be to do that and use it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>

3424
02:30:14.930 --> 02:30:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3425
02:30:15.700 --> 02:30:16.580
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3426
02:30:16.581 --> 02:30:17.414
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to isolate him and say </v>

3427
02:30:17.931 --> 02:30:19.550
<v Speaker 1>that with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to pause in between each one,</v>

3428
02:30:19.551 --> 02:30:21.320
<v Speaker 1>so in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God to speak,</v>

3429
02:30:21.350 --> 02:30:23.480
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

3430
02:30:23.481 --> 02:30:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I worry about that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you.</v>

3431
02:30:24.850 --> 02:30:29.330
<v Speaker 1>You would not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that created an incredible order and</v>

3432
02:30:29.331 --> 02:30:32.540
<v Speaker 1>it created a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good system to get shit done.</v>

3433
02:30:32.780 --> 02:30:36.170
<v Speaker 1>When people all were in their place </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing their duty.</v>

3434
02:30:36.171 --> 02:30:38.570
<v Speaker 1>It was very easy to organize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3435
02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:43.600
<v Speaker 1>but not to innovate changes like America</v>
<v Speaker 1>has done.</v>

3436
02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:47.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Brits were vendors because they.</v>

3437
02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:48.233
<v Speaker 1>They did fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is they don't have </v>

3438
02:30:49.611 --> 02:30:52.790
<v Speaker 1>the freedom that they had over here.</v>

3439
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:53.623
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have caste system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the ability to rise from the </v>

3440
02:30:56.241 --> 02:30:57.680
<v Speaker 1>bottom to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're here.</v>

3441
02:30:57.770 --> 02:30:58.730
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>

3442
02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:03.200
<v Speaker 1>That is what is most attractive about </v>
<v Speaker 1>America as potential potential.</v>

3443
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:04.063
<v Speaker 1>That's why we haven't had revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we don't have the poor </v>

3444
02:31:06.171 --> 02:31:07.004
<v Speaker 1>confiscating the wealth of the rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of for him to believe </v>

3445
02:31:09.231 --> 02:31:12.230
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge.</v>

3446
02:31:12.231 --> 02:31:13.064
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a lot of friends that have </v>

3447
02:31:14.181 --> 02:31:15.140
<v Speaker 1>come over from England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3448
02:31:15.141 --> 02:31:19.100
<v Speaker 1>and they just talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how you could actually do something</v>

3449
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:21.510
<v Speaker 1>here and people are supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3450
02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:23.430
<v Speaker 1>They don't shoot you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he said,</v>

3451
02:31:23.431 --> 02:31:25.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing that happens over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they.</v>

3452
02:31:25.770 --> 02:31:26.603
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to see anybody succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to put you in your place and </v>

3453
02:31:29.461 --> 02:31:32.790
<v Speaker 1>they try to downplay the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your success.</v>

3454
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3455
02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To your face.</v>

3456
02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:38.960
<v Speaker 1>It's very gauche to try to aspire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia has the same issue.</v>

3457
02:31:39.610 --> 02:31:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It's it's old Europe thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3458
02:31:41.371 --> 02:31:41.870
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3459
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:43.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be exhausting.</v>

3460
02:31:43.650 --> 02:31:48.650
<v Speaker 1>It's why when along a France started </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about taxing the rich,</v>

3461
02:31:48.661 --> 02:31:49.494
<v Speaker 1>75 percent of their income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was met with a great deal of support </v>

3462
02:31:52.831 --> 02:31:55.560
<v Speaker 1>because it wasn't workable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

3463
02:31:55.700 --> 02:31:56.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always been a real suspicion </v>

3464
02:32:00.631 --> 02:32:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Europe of people with too much money </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they become aristocracy and they</v>

3465
02:32:05.491 --> 02:32:06.570
<v Speaker 1>become oppressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3466
02:32:07.010 --> 02:32:07.843
<v Speaker 1>that's the echoed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're hearing today about the </v>

3467
02:32:09.271 --> 02:32:10.830
<v Speaker 1>elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one percenters,</v>

3468
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3469
02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:12.931
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3470
02:32:12.931 --> 02:32:15.120
<v Speaker 1>the problem with wealth inequality in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

3471
02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:17.820
<v Speaker 1>it's called Marxism wealth inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3472
02:32:18.270 --> 02:32:19.103
<v Speaker 1>It's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a march where we're dealing </v>

3473
02:32:21.211 --> 02:32:23.100
<v Speaker 1>with cultural Marxism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3474
02:32:24.270 --> 02:32:26.210
<v Speaker 1>that's always going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always gonna be the,</v>

3475
02:32:26.220 --> 02:32:27.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a very easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good guy,</v>

3476
02:32:27.961 --> 02:32:28.794
<v Speaker 1>bad guy thing.</v>

3477
02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:29.753
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize that wealth is </v>

3478
02:32:30.391 --> 02:32:31.840
<v Speaker 1>always changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

3479
02:32:32.130 --> 02:32:33.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't start wealthy.</v>

3480
02:32:33.631 --> 02:32:37.110
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people started poor then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>got wealthy than they lost their money.</v>

3481
02:32:37.111 --> 02:32:39.240
<v Speaker 1>They got wealthy again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is however,</v>

3482
02:32:39.241 --> 02:32:42.990
<v Speaker 1>a concentration of have a great deal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and in very few hands,</v>

3483
02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Google,</v>

3484
02:32:44.281 --> 02:32:49.281
<v Speaker 1>Amazon and apple and facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the only employ about 500,000</v>

3485
02:32:50.041 --> 02:32:52.920
<v Speaker 1>people total and they have so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>

3486
02:32:52.921 --> 02:32:53.970
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3487
02:32:53.971 --> 02:32:54.804
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is what do we do about </v>

3488
02:32:55.561 --> 02:32:57.090
<v Speaker 1>universal income?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3489
02:32:57.091 --> 02:33:00.480
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy and I think this is all going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come to a head with Ai.</v>

3490
02:33:00.810 --> 02:33:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think things are going to be automated</v>

3491
02:33:03.151 --> 02:33:05.220
<v Speaker 1>in a way that nobody has a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3492
02:33:05.310 --> 02:33:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to eliminate all </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving jobs.</v>

3493
02:33:07.530 --> 02:33:08.363
<v Speaker 1>I think that's within 20 years of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>life we're going to be looking back at </v>

3494
02:33:10.530 --> 02:33:11.580
<v Speaker 1>driving your own car.</v>

3495
02:33:11.580 --> 02:33:13.530
<v Speaker 1>The way we look back at drum brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3496
02:33:13.531 --> 02:33:15.630
<v Speaker 1>So now what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do with human question?</v>

3497
02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With an outdated piece of machinery.</v>

3498
02:33:18.210 --> 02:33:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3499
02:33:19.621 --> 02:33:22.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it manufacturing,</v>

3500
02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:23.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need robots for and maybe </v>

3501
02:33:25.141 --> 02:33:28.350
<v Speaker 1>there's other things other than driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing and driving.</v>

3502
02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's other people will be to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put your tray into a,</v>

3503
02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:35.490
<v Speaker 1>you know thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burger flipping robot.</v>

3504
02:33:35.491 --> 02:33:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Flippy starts shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kally Burger.</v>

3505
02:33:37.770 --> 02:33:38.603
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a burger flipping robot so it </v>

3506
02:33:40.291 --> 02:33:41.124
<v Speaker 1>was going to get a perfect burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have some kid </v>

3507
02:33:42.151 --> 02:33:43.920
<v Speaker 1>talking about pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgetting about your burger.</v>

3508
02:33:44.270 --> 02:33:45.840
<v Speaker 1>You get to Overcook Burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3509
02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:47.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3510
02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:50.820
<v Speaker 1>So if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it seems to me that we are.</v>

3511
02:33:51.180 --> 02:33:53.550
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure out what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this leisure time,</v>

3512
02:33:53.551 --> 02:33:54.450
<v Speaker 1>but we have to pay people.</v>

3513
02:33:54.540 --> 02:33:56.010
<v Speaker 1>It could be real weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can.</v>

3514
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's creeping up on us.</v>

3515
02:33:57.991 --> 02:33:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Show to like the Internet creeped up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

3516
02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:00.593
<v Speaker 1>Like the Internet came out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden everyone had access to </v>

3517
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:06.470
<v Speaker 1>any answer to any question you ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

3518
02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.313
<v Speaker 1>You could watch videos on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could learn how to do anything </v>

3519
02:34:10.021 --> 02:34:12.090
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a youtube video where you</v>

3520
02:34:12.091 --> 02:34:12.924
<v Speaker 1>can learn basically how to crochet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could learn how to Tan your own </v>

3521
02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:18.190
<v Speaker 1>leather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could learn how to build a bomb.</v>

3522
02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:19.063
<v Speaker 1>You can fucking do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just constantly be taking in </v>

3523
02:34:22.081 --> 02:34:24.700
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the beginning.</v>

3524
02:34:24.730 --> 02:34:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I think one day within the next 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>

3525
02:34:28.970 --> 02:34:29.803
<v Speaker 1>they are going to have everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>automated before it's artificial </v>

3526
02:34:32.951 --> 02:34:33.784
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be in a super </v>

3527
02:34:34.961 --> 02:34:38.830
<v Speaker 1>efficient robot that can do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>task you program it to do.</v>

3528
02:34:39.010 --> 02:34:40.540
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be way better at it than </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3529
02:34:40.541 --> 02:34:41.374
<v Speaker 1>It'd be pointless to have a person do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing and then we got to decide </v>

3530
02:34:43.571 --> 02:34:45.900
<v Speaker 1>what to do with all these people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be.</v>

3531
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:46.743
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of us are going to be a lot of </v>

3532
02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:50.200
<v Speaker 1>clips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3533
02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:52.190
<v Speaker 1>so what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're calling it?</v>

3534
02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Forty seven percent of a cover of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine.</v>

3535
02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:57.363
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humility is the new smart is this book </v>

3536
02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:03.610
<v Speaker 1>about this 47 percent of all jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know of now,</v>

3537
02:35:03.611 --> 02:35:06.400
<v Speaker 1>at least in this country are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsolete in the next 20 years.</v>

3538
02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we'll adapt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3539
02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3540
02:35:09.401 --> 02:35:12.330
<v Speaker 1>we'll adaptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope we just get more creative.</v>

3541
02:35:12.370 --> 02:35:13.203
<v Speaker 1>I hope people start doing things more </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their hands already are we already </v>

3542
02:35:17.351 --> 02:35:17.831
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

3543
02:35:17.831 --> 02:35:19.780
<v Speaker 1>there's more access to expressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

3544
02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:20.613
<v Speaker 1>The problem is it becomes like the call </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the amateur where you just got a lot </v>

3545
02:35:22.421 --> 02:35:23.254
<v Speaker 1>of bullshit out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that we will be in a </v>

3546
02:35:28.031 --> 02:35:29.300
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3547
02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:30.153
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3548
02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at where our philosophy.</v>

3549
02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:32.681
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3550
02:35:32.681 --> 02:35:34.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it the rise of,</v>

3551
02:35:34.990 --> 02:35:39.100
<v Speaker 1>of European Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was it?</v>

3552
02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:40.473
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3553
02:35:40.810 --> 02:35:41.643
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at like how the Greeks were </v>

3554
02:35:44.051 --> 02:35:49.051
<v Speaker 1>able to export timber wine and olive </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>

3555
02:35:50.730 --> 02:35:54.370
<v Speaker 1>it gave their economy some money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had leisure time.</v>

3556
02:35:54.371 --> 02:35:55.204
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to live on subsistence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could trade for things that they </v>

3557
02:35:57.221 --> 02:35:58.990
<v Speaker 1>needed as opposed to making them </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

3558
02:35:59.230 --> 02:36:00.063
<v Speaker 1>So the Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greece was fairly wealthy and </v>

3559
02:36:01.901 --> 02:36:05.740
<v Speaker 1>comparison and it gave a large sector of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their population,</v>

3560
02:36:05.741 --> 02:36:06.574
<v Speaker 1>at least the Richard population time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do things like not be in the fields all </v>

3561
02:36:12.430 --> 02:36:13.930
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather time to sit around,</v>

3562
02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:15.340
<v Speaker 1>eat and think and talk.</v>

3563
02:36:15.730 --> 02:36:16.563
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

3564
02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:17.733
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is probably where a lot of like </v>

3565
02:36:19.691 --> 02:36:21.850
<v Speaker 1>socrates and Plato and Aristotle </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefited from.</v>

3566
02:36:21.851 --> 02:36:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3567
02:36:22.570 --> 02:36:26.320
<v Speaker 1>So you wonder like as as we get to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where we don't have to so much,</v>

3568
02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:30.490
<v Speaker 1>it becomes very easy to keep our bodies </v>
<v Speaker 1>in homeostasis,</v>

3569
02:36:30.491 --> 02:36:31.324
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep our bodies when they're at the </v>

3570
02:36:32.201 --> 02:36:35.860
<v Speaker 1>right temperature and we just need a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of food and shelter and,</v>

3571
02:36:36.130 --> 02:36:38.620
<v Speaker 1>and then you've look a cheap </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment is.</v>

3572
02:36:38.621 --> 02:36:40.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at Netflix man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 10 bucks a month.</v>

3573
02:36:40.451 --> 02:36:43.120
<v Speaker 1>You can watch anything you want forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3574
02:36:43.570 --> 02:36:46.840
<v Speaker 1>So then like what do we do man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do with our time?</v>

3575
02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Well we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have to think about what we're</v>

3576
02:36:50.380 --> 02:36:54.280
<v Speaker 1>going to do from 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 to 2020.</v>

3577
02:36:54.490 --> 02:36:55.323
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just sort of happened and I think </v>

3578
02:36:57.041 --> 02:36:57.874
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're going to have to </v>

3579
02:36:59.501 --> 02:36:59.980
<v Speaker 1>adjust.</v>

3580
02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the advice we give to children</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as what's necessary,</v>

3581
02:37:03.431 --> 02:37:04.264
<v Speaker 1>what's not necessarily tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to tell your kids </v>

3582
02:37:05.831 --> 02:37:06.670
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

3583
02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:08.620
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>as they go along,</v>

3584
02:37:08.621 --> 02:37:10.600
<v Speaker 1>but they got to be flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3585
02:37:10.890 --> 02:37:11.723
<v Speaker 1>and I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I've been thinking this </v>

3586
02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:16.310
<v Speaker 1>a lot lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to move.</v>

3587
02:37:16.610 --> 02:37:17.443
<v Speaker 1>I think California is over fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>populated and I think it's going to get </v>

3588
02:37:20.211 --> 02:37:23.270
<v Speaker 1>to a point in our lifetime or it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart place to be.</v>

3589
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3590
02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:26.840
<v Speaker 1>This way too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3591
02:37:26.841 --> 02:37:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to the airport all the time,</v>

3592
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drive.</v>

3593
02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I had to do it the other day at 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

3594
02:37:32.121 --> 02:37:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is hilarious.</v>

3595
02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Or you'll get to a point where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fly.</v>

3596
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:38.480
<v Speaker 1>You want to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get to a point where that's true,</v>

3597
02:37:38.481 --> 02:37:39.314
<v Speaker 1>but the sheer number of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything goes wrong all in this one </v>

3598
02:37:42.711 --> 02:37:44.390
<v Speaker 1>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not wise.</v>

3599
02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:46.340
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3600
02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I always feel unsafe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel good.</v>

3601
02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:51.500
<v Speaker 1>It feels like people aren't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

3602
02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:52.363
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were infested with the a futurist </v>

3603
02:37:57.490 --> 02:37:59.480
<v Speaker 1>who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to learn how to learn,</v>

3604
02:37:59.690 --> 02:38:00.890
<v Speaker 1>unlearn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and relearn.</v>

3605
02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:03.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only way we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive in the 21st century.</v>

3606
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:04.543
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really worried about pupils </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive and I think we're going to be </v>

3607
02:38:06.921 --> 02:38:08.380
<v Speaker 1>okay in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lungs,</v>

3608
02:38:08.390 --> 02:38:09.223
<v Speaker 1>we don't get hit by anything like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get potent or we don't get hit by </v>

3609
02:38:12.111 --> 02:38:14.510
<v Speaker 1>an asteroid or we don't get hit by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>super volcano,</v>

3610
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:15.383
<v Speaker 1>which are all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things are actually really </v>

3611
02:38:16.791 --> 02:38:18.110
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3612
02:38:18.111 --> 02:38:20.000
<v Speaker 1>no one wants to think that we can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked by Russia,</v>

3613
02:38:20.001 --> 02:38:24.020
<v Speaker 1>but for sure we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of weird scenarios can present</v>

3614
02:38:24.021 --> 02:38:24.854
<v Speaker 1>themselves in this wacky life with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of things falling into place and </v>

3615
02:38:26.871 --> 02:38:29.230
<v Speaker 1>the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you got World War Two.</v>

3616
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:30.500
<v Speaker 1>It's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3617
02:38:30.501 --> 02:38:34.340
<v Speaker 1>that's just the nature of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we deny the past,</v>

3618
02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:36.110
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that was then we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

3619
02:38:36.111 --> 02:38:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't look at this rationally,</v>

3620
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:40.910
<v Speaker 1>we can realize how precarious we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3621
02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:43.490
<v Speaker 1>That is just one thing that we can kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of control.</v>

3622
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully human beings can control their</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses to fucking hit the button.</v>

3623
02:38:49.850 --> 02:38:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Now they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>

3624
02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:53.953
<v Speaker 1>Nassim Taleb talks about the Black Swan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so know that there's always a black </v>

3625
02:38:58.581 --> 02:38:59.414
<v Speaker 1>swan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that the aberration know that </v>

3626
02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:03.530
<v Speaker 1>history is full of things you never saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

3627
02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

3628
02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:07.730
<v Speaker 1>a financial crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the housing crisis,</v>

3629
02:39:07.731 --> 02:39:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean it goes on and on and history is </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of that.</v>

3630
02:39:10.341 --> 02:39:11.174
<v Speaker 1>Most wars start as a weekend skirmish </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people kind of leave for the </v>

3631
02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:16.333
<v Speaker 1>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave all this stuff and it's going to </v>

3632
02:39:16.851 --> 02:39:17.900
<v Speaker 1>be over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before you know it,</v>

3633
02:39:17.901 --> 02:39:18.191
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3634
02:39:18.191 --> 02:39:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a 30 year civil war that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Lebanon.</v>

3635
02:39:20.391 --> 02:39:25.391
<v Speaker 1>That's where tellabs from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you've got to at least know that</v>

3636
02:39:25.671 --> 02:39:26.840
<v Speaker 1>you're going be able to predict the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

3637
02:39:26.841 --> 02:39:27.674
<v Speaker 1>but know that they're the unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always be present and we'll always take </v>

3638
02:39:31.310 --> 02:39:35.090
<v Speaker 1>what you took to be reality and flip it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it's fucking head.</v>

3639
02:39:35.390 --> 02:39:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think robotics and I think ai are </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

3640
02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:42.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tidal wave.</v>

3641
02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:43.033
<v Speaker 1>Do you worry at all about super power </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggles between the United States and </v>

3642
02:39:45.471 --> 02:39:46.304
<v Speaker 1>China and United States and Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way less only because I think that </v>

3643
02:39:49.131 --> 02:39:54.080
<v Speaker 1>there's less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's less profit in violent warfare.</v>

3644
02:39:54.350 --> 02:39:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't profit anybody this way,</v>

3645
02:39:56.691 --> 02:39:59.330
<v Speaker 1>more profit in trade and dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3646
02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:01.430
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have issues like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tariff issue,</v>

3647
02:40:01.431 --> 02:40:03.110
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3648
02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:03.741
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3649
02:40:03.741 --> 02:40:04.574
<v Speaker 1>so the biggest advantage is that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a whole lot of advantage for a </v>

3650
02:40:08.601 --> 02:40:13.601
<v Speaker 1>country to take over territory because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what makes you</v>

3651
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:14.873
<v Speaker 2>wealthier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if Russia came in and took over </v>

3652
02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:19.133
<v Speaker 2>silicon valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that take off about </v>

3653
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:21.870
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

3654
02:40:21.871 --> 02:40:24.390
<v Speaker 2>But that's typically what dropping a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb somewhere.</v>

3655
02:40:24.420 --> 02:40:25.253
<v Speaker 2>What they're saying is essentially that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not talking about invading the </v>

3656
02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:29.220
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

3657
02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would never do that.</v>

3658
02:40:30.511 --> 02:40:31.344
<v Speaker 2>The real question is what unless they </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuked us for why would they drop a bomb </v>

3659
02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:34.973
<v Speaker 2>where there might be some reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel backed into a corner to </v>

3660
02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:40.380
<v Speaker 2>interest in the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3661
02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:41.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not likely unless they feel like </v>

3662
02:40:42.541 --> 02:40:43.374
<v Speaker 2>there was some way where they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit extremely well from having us </v>

3663
02:40:46.411 --> 02:40:47.244
<v Speaker 2>debilitate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not likely because we would attack </v>

3664
02:40:49.711 --> 02:40:51.420
<v Speaker 2>back and it's mutually assured </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>

3665
02:40:51.421 --> 02:40:52.254
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that a person could make </v>

3666
02:40:54.211 --> 02:40:55.044
<v Speaker 2>the decision whether or not to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whether or not that's logical and </v>

3667
02:40:57.511 --> 02:41:00.810
<v Speaker 2>you're relying on a person who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially a murderous dictator running</v>

3668
02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:03.960
<v Speaker 2>this fucking crazy halfass government </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there.</v>

3669
02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is he doing over there?</v>

3670
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just from what you know about Russia</v>

3671
02:41:09.581 --> 02:41:13.680
<v Speaker 2>state sponsored doping program with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and went straight up to Putin,</v>

3672
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:15.090
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew what the fuck they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

3673
02:41:15.091 --> 02:41:16.320
<v Speaker 2>They were doing it on purpose because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3674
02:41:16.730 --> 02:41:17.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3675
02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:20.850
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy country band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy and it's 2018.</v>

3676
02:41:20.860 --> 02:41:22.350
<v Speaker 2>It's still crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>

3677
02:41:22.351 --> 02:41:23.184
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's run by the one idea which is might </v>

3678
02:41:25.441 --> 02:41:28.680
<v Speaker 2>makes right that the male with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest club is the male that,</v>

3679
02:41:28.730 --> 02:41:30.670
<v Speaker 2>that calls all the shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

3680
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:32.730
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big concern with me.</v>

3681
02:41:32.850 --> 02:41:33.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my real big concern are natural </v>

3682
02:41:35.401 --> 02:41:37.380
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pandemics,</v>

3683
02:41:37.470 --> 02:41:39.300
<v Speaker 2>pandemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virus or accidents,</v>

3684
02:41:39.301 --> 02:41:43.260
<v Speaker 2>nuclear accidents and earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earthquakes.</v>

3685
02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big one for me,</v>

3686
02:41:45.331 --> 02:41:49.170
<v Speaker 2>super volcano,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is an inevitable reality that we're</v>

3687
02:41:49.171 --> 02:41:50.004
<v Speaker 2>going to have to face one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's 100 years from now or 10 </v>

3688
02:41:52.351 --> 02:41:53.184
<v Speaker 2>years from now.</v>

3689
02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Yellowstone is going to blow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know when,</v>

3690
02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:59.910
<v Speaker 2>but it could be anytime and it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>take out the entire.</v>

3691
02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:01.000
<v Speaker 2>The whole continent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then.</v>

3692
02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the yellowstone blows,</v>

3693
02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:05.010
<v Speaker 2>they say every six to 800,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3694
02:42:05.130 --> 02:42:09.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a continent killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just blows and everybody's fucked and</v>

3695
02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:11.340
<v Speaker 2>it last time it happened was 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

3696
02:42:12.270 --> 02:42:13.103
<v Speaker 2>so it might be 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years before it happens again and who </v>

3697
02:42:15.121 --> 02:42:16.830
<v Speaker 2>knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might figure out how to drill hole in</v>

3698
02:42:16.831 --> 02:42:20.850
<v Speaker 2>there and pop it like Dr Pimple Popper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They received that instagram page.</v>

3699
02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Sure half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's drills a hole in there,</v>

3700
02:42:22.501 --> 02:42:25.220
<v Speaker 2>like a pimple on sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that love out and maybe it's okay.</v>

3701
02:42:25.270 --> 02:42:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3702
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.903
<v Speaker 2>maybe that'll keep it from blowing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it blows to the thousands of </v>

3703
02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:31.980
<v Speaker 2>earthquakes every year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands,</v>

3704
02:42:32.490 --> 02:42:34.890
<v Speaker 2>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just constantly moving and rumbling.</v>

3705
02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:35.753
<v Speaker 2>It's just loose crust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And underneath is Chai fantic reservoir </v>

3706
02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:42.330
<v Speaker 2>of Melton Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>melted rock,</v>

3707
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:45.490
<v Speaker 2>melted rock that shoots into the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott giant,</v>

3708
02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:47.070
<v Speaker 2>very blood of the earth.</v>

3709
02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:48.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so big.</v>

3710
02:42:48.061 --> 02:42:50.820
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even know it was a volcano </v>
<v Speaker 2>until like,</v>

3711
02:42:51.390 --> 02:42:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 20 years ago,</v>

3712
02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:58.260
<v Speaker 2>they started doing overhead satellite </v>
<v Speaker 2>photos and they're like,</v>

3713
02:42:58.290 --> 02:42:59.770
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

3714
02:42:59.771 --> 02:43:00.604
<v Speaker 2>they thought it was just like a hotbed </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Geo solar activity or what it would </v>

3715
02:43:04.110 --> 02:43:05.040
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not geo solar,</v>

3716
02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:08.430
<v Speaker 2>geothermal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geothermal activity,</v>

3717
02:43:08.431 --> 02:43:09.264
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had an old faithful spray water up </v>

3718
02:43:10.411 --> 02:43:11.500
<v Speaker 2>in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They realized,</v>

3719
02:43:11.860 --> 02:43:12.693
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something going on underneath </v>

3720
02:43:13.090 --> 02:43:16.060
<v Speaker 2>the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they get these satellite photos</v>

3721
02:43:16.061 --> 02:43:18.130
<v Speaker 2>and they realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

3722
02:43:18.131 --> 02:43:20.350
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a crater.</v>

3723
02:43:20.740 --> 02:43:21.573
<v Speaker 2>This thing is a crater that used to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain had exploded and I want to say </v>

3724
02:43:26.561 --> 02:43:27.670
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like,</v>

3725
02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:31.780
<v Speaker 2>how wide is the called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to mess this up.</v>

3726
02:43:32.410 --> 02:43:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's like 600 kilometers </v>
<v Speaker 2>wide.</v>

3727
02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3728
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:37.833
<v Speaker 2>It's an enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know is a molten lava as the </v>

3729
02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:43.600
<v Speaker 2>coordinator of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of shit down then it's not good.</v>

3730
02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:46.410
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3731
02:43:46.470 --> 02:43:47.081
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3732
02:43:47.081 --> 02:43:48.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 35 miles.</v>

3733
02:43:48.850 --> 02:43:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Fifty Mile Long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3734
02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Currently has appeared that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

3735
02:43:52.321 --> 02:43:53.880
<v Speaker 1>There are so many different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

3736
02:43:53.881 --> 02:43:57.330
<v Speaker 1>So the reality that that if you go up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the stars,</v>

3737
02:43:57.331 --> 02:44:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a different reality and if you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait in the microscopic level,</v>

3738
02:44:00.991 --> 02:44:03.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally different reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can go to the subatomic level.</v>

3739
02:44:04.390 --> 02:44:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The region's most recent caldera forming</v>

3740
02:44:07.121 --> 02:44:09.400
<v Speaker 2>eruption was 640,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

3741
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:14.220
<v Speaker 2>creating the 35 mile wide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 mile long yellowstone Caldera.</v>

3742
02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up the distance,</v>

3743
02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:17.440
<v Speaker 2>but still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty God damn big.</v>

3744
02:44:17.650 --> 02:44:22.180
<v Speaker 2>So a 50 mile long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 mile wide volcano.</v>

3745
02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:23.073
<v Speaker 2>That just blows up to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tops not there anymore and just </v>

3746
02:44:25.901 --> 02:44:30.400
<v Speaker 2>shoots off shit a mile into the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you get nuclear winter all over</v>

3747
02:44:30.401 --> 02:44:32.410
<v Speaker 2>the globe in anything even remotely </v>
<v Speaker 2>near.</v>

3748
02:44:32.411 --> 02:44:34.420
<v Speaker 2>It gets cooked instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

3749
02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucked.</v>

3750
02:44:35.411 --> 02:44:36.700
<v Speaker 2>So we're all dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3751
02:44:36.701 --> 02:44:37.840
<v Speaker 2>we're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fuck.</v>

3752
02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:40.990
<v Speaker 2>We're dead as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If yellow's don't blows,</v>

3753
02:44:41.140 --> 02:44:44.090
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a chance that people will </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to the dikes.</v>

3754
02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:45.493
<v Speaker 1>I talk to that like Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they'll lose a leg of this bias to </v>

3755
02:44:47.811 --> 02:44:49.930
<v Speaker 1>a shark or something or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they.</v>

3756
02:44:49.931 --> 02:44:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And they ended up dying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3757
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:52.460
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3758
02:44:52.460 --> 02:44:54.300
<v Speaker 1>they pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3759
02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:57.800
<v Speaker 1>they all said that it was a super </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful,</v>

3760
02:44:58.330 --> 02:45:01.190
<v Speaker 1>like they just got this overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of peace and they were like,</v>

3761
02:45:01.191 --> 02:45:02.030
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die now.</v>

3762
02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the brain.</v>

3763
02:45:05.721 --> 02:45:06.554
<v Speaker 1>The brain's pumping out that dopamine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dimethyltryptamine and all these </v>

3764
02:45:09.771 --> 02:45:12.020
<v Speaker 1>different things to try to transition </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3765
02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like existence is a weird thing.</v>

3766
02:45:14.811 --> 02:45:16.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you think happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3767
02:45:16.641 --> 02:45:17.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3768
02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:18.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go,</v>

3769
02:45:18.470 --> 02:45:21.350
<v Speaker 1>my feeling is that talking to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physicists,</v>

3770
02:45:21.351 --> 02:45:22.730
<v Speaker 1>this bad ass dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3771
02:45:23.210 --> 02:45:24.043
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there must be this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence is a question of he was </v>

3772
02:45:31.701 --> 02:45:33.860
<v Speaker 1>talking about existence is a question of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>

3773
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:35.960
<v Speaker 1>what question you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asking or were you standing?</v>

3774
02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:39.440
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different forms of existence,</v>

3775
02:45:39.441 --> 02:45:41.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are different forms of reality.</v>

3776
02:45:41.810 --> 02:45:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the subatomic reality,</v>

3777
02:45:44.091 --> 02:45:48.170
<v Speaker 1>there's the Newtonian reality that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can measure and see we're here.</v>

3778
02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:51.980
<v Speaker 1>If I was looking at Los Angeles from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane that's a different perspective.</v>

3779
02:45:51.981 --> 02:45:54.530
<v Speaker 1>It might be a different kind of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he,</v>

3780
02:45:54.580 --> 02:45:55.413
<v Speaker 1>he kinda like said most physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to explain what existence </v>

3781
02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:00.860
<v Speaker 1>is right and how it's meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3782
02:46:00.861 --> 02:46:03.770
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck he talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about mathematics.</v>

3783
02:46:03.771 --> 02:46:04.820
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

3784
02:46:04.821 --> 02:46:08.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a reality to us because of where</v>

3785
02:46:08.361 --> 02:46:13.361
<v Speaker 1>we are and the space time continuum that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're occupying right now.</v>

3786
02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:15.553
<v Speaker 1>So we are here and all that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing may not may very well not </v>

3787
02:46:21.381 --> 02:46:25.100
<v Speaker 1>even be a reality right over in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

3788
02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:26.853
<v Speaker 1>What the would mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say when they sit around with legal </v>

3789
02:46:28.971 --> 02:46:29.804
<v Speaker 1>papers all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll write a bunch of shit and nobody </v>

3790
02:46:31.671 --> 02:46:32.150
<v Speaker 1>fucks up.</v>

3791
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3792
02:46:34.761 --> 02:46:36.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3793
02:46:36.081 --> 02:46:36.771
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3794
02:46:36.771 --> 02:46:37.604
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said he's going to win a Nobel </v>

3795
02:46:40.131 --> 02:46:41.450
<v Speaker 1>prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3796
02:46:41.451 --> 02:46:43.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the best way to put it,</v>

3797
02:46:43.641 --> 02:46:48.641
<v Speaker 1>as think of you having a virtual reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>goggles on and you know,</v>

3798
02:46:49.761 --> 02:46:50.594
<v Speaker 1>people just splashing water on you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the water and you're getting </v>

3799
02:46:52.791 --> 02:46:53.624
<v Speaker 1>rocked back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the best way to describe </v>

3800
02:46:55.281 --> 02:46:57.740
<v Speaker 1>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you consider to be your reality.</v>

3801
02:46:58.640 --> 02:46:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3802
02:46:59.940 --> 02:47:01.250
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

3803
02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

3804
02:47:03.140 --> 02:47:03.973
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they seem to be able to prove a lot </v>

3805
02:47:05.031 --> 02:47:10.031
<v Speaker 1>of this in like what's fascinating to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I didn't know how to get into this,</v>

3806
02:47:10.341 --> 02:47:11.174
<v Speaker 1>but like he was talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrons can communicate with each </v>

3807
02:47:13.491 --> 02:47:14.324
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like got a sheet of metal and they </v>

3808
02:47:16.251 --> 02:47:16.550
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

3809
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:19.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't see each other like in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the actions are light years away,</v>

3810
02:47:19.971 --> 02:47:23.400
<v Speaker 1>but they completely all work together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about how to do.</v>

3811
02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:26.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a mathematical way of proving </v>
<v Speaker 1>halls.</v>

3812
02:47:26.651 --> 02:47:31.280
<v Speaker 1>There is a mathematical sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithm that proves that they are.</v>

3813
02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:34.460
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that is that there an </v>
<v Speaker 1>invisible conductor,</v>

3814
02:47:34.490 --> 02:47:35.323
<v Speaker 1>like something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a higher intelligence and immersion </v>

3815
02:47:38.721 --> 02:47:39.554
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is dictating that </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication intelligence or order an </v>

3816
02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:46.160
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3817
02:47:46.161 --> 02:47:49.190
<v Speaker 1>But not an intelligence as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it tells us the wrong way to say it.</v>

3818
02:47:49.191 --> 02:47:50.024
<v Speaker 1>And he said that to me too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I sit intelligent and he said </v>

3819
02:47:51.201 --> 02:47:53.810
<v Speaker 1>order and you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an order,</v>

3820
02:47:53.811 --> 02:47:54.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

3821
02:47:55.130 --> 02:47:57.550
<v Speaker 1>there's an order to the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3822
02:47:57.650 --> 02:47:59.840
<v Speaker 1>So the way schools of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3823
02:47:59.841 --> 02:48:01.460
<v Speaker 1>schools of fish and birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bird,</v>

3824
02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:03.560
<v Speaker 1>guess what else behaves that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inert matter,</v>

3825
02:48:03.890 --> 02:48:04.723
<v Speaker 1>electrons.</v>

3826
02:48:04.980 --> 02:48:07.940
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going on with birds.</v>

3827
02:48:07.941 --> 02:48:08.774
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why birds have </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of internal compass and that </v>

3828
02:48:11.361 --> 02:48:15.380
<v Speaker 1>they literally mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They react to the poles of the earth.</v>

3829
02:48:15.770 --> 02:48:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Like they know when migrating birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know which way to go.</v>

3830
02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:21.073
<v Speaker 1>Like they really do somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also know not to fly into each </v>

3831
02:48:23.511 --> 02:48:24.344
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see them all flying </v>

3832
02:48:25.761 --> 02:48:28.700
<v Speaker 1>together and they move in tandem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

3833
02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:30.470
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gorgeous.</v>

3834
02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain's the same way.</v>

3835
02:48:32.181 --> 02:48:34.430
<v Speaker 1>So the neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason.</v>

3836
02:48:34.431 --> 02:48:37.610
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense that the neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So each neuron is just essentially an on</v>

3837
02:48:37.611 --> 02:48:39.330
<v Speaker 1>off switch or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3838
02:48:39.430 --> 02:48:42.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for whatever reason,</v>

3839
02:48:42.771 --> 02:48:45.380
<v Speaker 1>all of those neurons have self </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized,</v>

3840
02:48:46.370 --> 02:48:48.140
<v Speaker 1>organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they self organized.</v>

3841
02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fascinating.</v>

3842
02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:53.660
<v Speaker 1>And the way your brain has self </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized,</v>

3843
02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:58.690
<v Speaker 1>so has this sheet of metal and he kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of proved he sat around and I think he's</v>

3844
02:48:59.961 --> 02:49:03.530
<v Speaker 1>38 or 39 and he and he solved this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this theorem called wholesale,</v>

3845
02:49:03.590 --> 02:49:05.480
<v Speaker 1>took them three years to make sure he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was right.</v>

3846
02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like</v>

3847
02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:08.833
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a big mass event like like mob </v>

3848
02:49:13.021 --> 02:49:15.150
<v Speaker 2>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think that's part of what what</v>

3849
02:49:15.151 --> 02:49:19.590
<v Speaker 2>is going on with mob mentality and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>things happen and things can get chaotic</v>

3850
02:49:19.591 --> 02:49:22.680
<v Speaker 2>and people just go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd go with it in mob and I think.</v>

3851
02:49:23.370 --> 02:49:24.203
<v Speaker 2>I think the origin of that is probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>survival instincts in war that in war </v>

3852
02:49:29.100 --> 02:49:29.933
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept unbelievably barbaric</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality and so you have to be able to </v>

3853
02:49:35.371 --> 02:49:38.130
<v Speaker 2>slide into that wherever we're killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody with axes,</v>

3854
02:49:38.131 --> 02:49:40.500
<v Speaker 2>let's go and then everybody else is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

3855
02:49:40.501 --> 02:49:41.334
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he started hacking people up </v>

3856
02:49:42.841 --> 02:49:46.900
<v Speaker 2>where you would never do it by yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was just totally up to you,</v>

3857
02:49:47.250 --> 02:49:48.083
<v Speaker 2>but you find yourself getting caught up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the way in the hive where the human </v>

3858
02:49:52.051 --> 02:49:54.660
<v Speaker 2>hive is moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all these people are moving towards</v>

3859
02:49:54.661 --> 02:49:55.494
<v Speaker 2>violence or moving towards chaos like </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get wrapped up in these mob </v>

3860
02:49:59.401 --> 02:50:01.790
<v Speaker 2>mentality moments in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad.</v>

3861
02:50:01.791 --> 02:50:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

3862
02:50:01.980 --> 02:50:03.870
<v Speaker 1>you can also go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually,</v>

3863
02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:05.033
<v Speaker 1>you can step back from that and actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can explain that actually when you </v>

3864
02:50:10.561 --> 02:50:11.394
<v Speaker 1>look at bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain bacteria and certain insect </v>

3865
02:50:14.811 --> 02:50:15.980
<v Speaker 1>colonies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let me explain.</v>

3866
02:50:16.410 --> 02:50:17.243
<v Speaker 1>So somebody like Antonio Damasio who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a behavioral scientist who wrote a </v>

3867
02:50:22.951 --> 02:50:23.784
<v Speaker 1>fucking great book but very dense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the strange order of things and </v>

3868
02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:31.960
<v Speaker 1>he talks about how human beings behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a certain way,</v>

3869
02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:33.293
<v Speaker 1>like their feelings are directly related</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their biology because their feelings </v>

3870
02:50:38.490 --> 02:50:40.890
<v Speaker 1>are essentially the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3871
02:50:41.010 --> 02:50:44.010
<v Speaker 1>the voices or the mechanism by which you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3872
02:50:44.011 --> 02:50:44.844
<v Speaker 1>whether or not to bring your body back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into homeostasis when it's out of </v>

3873
02:50:48.091 --> 02:50:51.420
<v Speaker 1>homeostasis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homeodynamic actually stay right?</v>

3874
02:50:51.421 --> 02:50:55.800
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mob is probably going in there with</v>

3875
02:50:55.810 --> 02:51:00.810
<v Speaker 1>access because they perceive the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings are they perceive a threat from</v>

3876
02:51:02.521 --> 02:51:03.354
<v Speaker 1>that other group because that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>group is going to take something from </v>

3877
02:51:05.491 --> 02:51:06.390
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3878
02:51:06.450 --> 02:51:09.150
<v Speaker 1>it's going to either take their </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

3879
02:51:09.151 --> 02:51:10.410
<v Speaker 1>their children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it might be,</v>

3880
02:51:10.411 --> 02:51:11.610
<v Speaker 1>and take over their territory.</v>

3881
02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:12.633
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so watch bacteria actually behave the </v>

3882
02:51:15.601 --> 02:51:19.650
<v Speaker 1>exact same way and you can put bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>into certain like,</v>

3883
02:51:19.651 --> 02:51:20.484
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a scientist who does this a </v>

3884
02:51:21.631 --> 02:51:23.520
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put them into certain conditions</v>

3885
02:51:23.521 --> 02:51:27.240
<v Speaker 1>where the bacterial behave like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do some fascinating things.</v>

3886
02:51:27.720 --> 02:51:28.553
<v Speaker 1>Not only will they fucking take over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other bacteria and go out into an all </v>

3887
02:51:31.321 --> 02:51:34.110
<v Speaker 1>out war and kill mercilessly the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria,</v>

3888
02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:37.200
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes when they find they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill that bacteria,</v>

3889
02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:39.540
<v Speaker 1>they'll actually cooperate with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria.</v>

3890
02:51:40.290 --> 02:51:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>

3891
02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:42.293
<v Speaker 1>Within the ranks of their own bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bacteria that are not pulling their </v>

3892
02:51:45.751 --> 02:51:46.584
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tend to be lazier than the other </v>

3893
02:51:48.301 --> 02:51:50.760
<v Speaker 1>bacteria that are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the same species.</v>

3894
02:51:51.480 --> 02:51:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Those bacteria will be fucking shunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be pushed out.</v>

3895
02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:57.120
<v Speaker 1>They will not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like people,</v>

3896
02:51:57.580 --> 02:51:58.130
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3897
02:51:58.130 --> 02:52:02.970
<v Speaker 1>they're the weak link insects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at insect colonies,</v>

3898
02:52:03.090 --> 02:52:05.950
<v Speaker 1>they behave very much like human </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures do.</v>

3899
02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:07.480
<v Speaker 1>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3900
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:11.620
<v Speaker 1>an aunt that's protecting the queen ant </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a b that's protecting the Queen Bee.</v>

3901
02:52:11.830 --> 02:52:16.830
<v Speaker 1>You have soldiers that do the fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have workers that do the working and</v>

3902
02:52:17.261 --> 02:52:21.100
<v Speaker 1>they self organize in this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and nobody's really.</v>

3903
02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:23.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's somebody.</v>

3904
02:52:23.380 --> 02:52:24.213
<v Speaker 1>It's not a top down thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a genetically programmed </v>

3905
02:52:26.281 --> 02:52:29.530
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their behavior is very similar.</v>

3906
02:52:29.890 --> 02:52:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even with bacteria,</v>

3907
02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:32.793
<v Speaker 1>when they can't beat this bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll join forces with that bacteria </v>

3908
02:52:35.770 --> 02:52:39.250
<v Speaker 1>to defeat the other bacteria that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaker and it's fascinating.</v>

3909
02:52:39.430 --> 02:52:40.263
<v Speaker 1>So even on the uni cellular level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see striking similarities between </v>

3910
02:52:45.311 --> 02:52:49.600
<v Speaker 1>humans and even bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now add to that the fact that one,</v>

3911
02:52:49.960 --> 02:52:50.793
<v Speaker 1>only one in 10 of yourselves as a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being is actually human and the rest is </v>

3912
02:52:54.371 --> 02:52:58.870
<v Speaker 1>bacteria back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you as a human might be the Patina.</v>

3913
02:52:59.080 --> 02:53:02.980
<v Speaker 1>You're just the Patina on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a background of bacteria.</v>

3914
02:53:03.550 --> 02:53:07.240
<v Speaker 1>So maybe bacteria is dictating how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you behave.</v>

3915
02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bacteria is also the outside skin,</v>

3916
02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:12.100
<v Speaker 1>inside and outside skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flora is incredibly important.</v>

3917
02:53:12.220 --> 02:53:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I always recommend people eat</v>

3918
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:18.010
<v Speaker 1>probiotics is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>helps you with diseases.</v>

3919
02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:18.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then natural oil soaps that not non </v>

3920
02:53:21.761 --> 02:53:23.710
<v Speaker 1>antibacterial soaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very important.</v>

3921
02:53:23.770 --> 02:53:25.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's right.</v>

3922
02:53:25.181 --> 02:53:27.760
<v Speaker 1>So keeping your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your biodome yeah.</v>

3923
02:53:27.850 --> 02:53:28.683
<v Speaker 1>In order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the new science might also be </v>

3924
02:53:31.811 --> 02:53:34.480
<v Speaker 1>dictating your very behavior because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

3925
02:53:34.600 --> 02:53:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I think when I eat healthier and I eat a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of probiotics,</v>

3926
02:53:37.661 --> 02:53:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I feel more at ease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel more comfortable.</v>

3927
02:53:40.300 --> 02:53:41.133
<v Speaker 1>I heard you have to be careful with </v>
<v Speaker 1>probiotics because you can throw off </v>

3928
02:53:43.121 --> 02:53:45.220
<v Speaker 1>your gut level two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are you eating now?</v>

3929
02:53:45.221 --> 02:53:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food Miles.</v>

3930
02:53:46.870 --> 02:53:47.703
<v Speaker 1>I've decided a long time ago that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take some probiotic pills and stuff </v>

3931
02:53:52.001 --> 02:53:52.330
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3932
02:53:52.330 --> 02:53:54.100
<v Speaker 1>And I definitely take someone on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

3933
02:53:54.790 --> 02:53:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I bring that on a total gut health </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm,</v>

3934
02:53:56.581 --> 02:53:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what the fuck.</v>

3935
02:53:57.800 --> 02:53:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure I'm getting good </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

3936
02:53:59.531 --> 02:54:02.410
<v Speaker 1>But a mom at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of fermented vegetables.</v>

3937
02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to the,</v>

3938
02:54:03.841 --> 02:54:04.674
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat Kimchi like almost everyday </v>

3939
02:54:06.450 --> 02:54:07.980
<v Speaker 1>because you're an extremist and I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3940
02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:10.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is good if you feel good,</v>

3941
02:54:10.330 --> 02:54:13.040
<v Speaker 1>drink a lot of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Kombucha is fucking phenomenal.</v>

3942
02:54:13.041 --> 02:54:15.930
<v Speaker 1>That gts Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard a uh,</v>

3943
02:54:16.590 --> 02:54:17.423
<v Speaker 1>some oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody in my family got a endometrial </v>

3944
02:54:19.931 --> 02:54:24.931
<v Speaker 1>cancer and the doctor said the surgeon </v>
<v Speaker 1>who deals with this exclusively said,</v>

3945
02:54:26.170 --> 02:54:27.720
<v Speaker 1>do me a favor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't drink these for awhile.</v>

3946
02:54:28.220 --> 02:54:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

3947
02:54:29.381 --> 02:54:30.850
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3948
02:54:30.910 --> 02:54:31.743
<v Speaker 1>I can't prove this yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I see a direct link between this </v>

3949
02:54:35.290 --> 02:54:38.620
<v Speaker 1>type of cancer and women who drink a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of probiotic drinks like this.</v>

3950
02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:40.120
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3951
02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:41.770
<v Speaker 1>CV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find anything on that.</v>

3952
02:54:42.130 --> 02:54:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Women drink probiotic drinks cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

3953
02:54:45.761 --> 02:54:49.140
<v Speaker 1>And this is a women's drinks martinis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blowjobs.</v>

3954
02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Put that all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

3955
02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:53.650
<v Speaker 1>come on dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's too much.</v>

3956
02:54:53.770 --> 02:54:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>

3957
02:54:56.680 --> 02:54:58.750
<v Speaker 1>That would be terrifying man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that was the case.</v>

3958
02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Well I would think maybe there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain level,</v>

3959
02:55:02.530 --> 02:55:03.980
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nutty person</v>

3960
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:07.640
<v Speaker 2>who drank like really powerful Kombucha </v>
<v Speaker 2>all day.</v>

3961
02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Like all you drank is Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3962
02:55:10.090 --> 02:55:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Like your body might be overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremist and anything,</v>

3963
02:55:12.801 --> 02:55:14.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you gotta have balance.</v>

3964
02:55:15.260 --> 02:55:16.093
<v Speaker 2>The question is this to what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>metric for how many vitamins you need </v>

3965
02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:21.320
<v Speaker 2>and then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have enough,</v>

3966
02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:26.540
<v Speaker 2>what is adding more to that do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it help you or doesn't do?</v>

3967
02:55:26.541 --> 02:55:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does do harm.</v>

3968
02:55:28.130 --> 02:55:28.963
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it the same for you as it is for </v>

3969
02:55:31.581 --> 02:55:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Brendan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the same for me?</v>

3970
02:55:33.170 --> 02:55:34.003
<v Speaker 2>Like how is there a US da when </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's body so radically different </v>

3971
02:55:37.791 --> 02:55:38.624
<v Speaker 2>size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different know like w how come a </v>

3972
02:55:40.820 --> 02:55:42.680
<v Speaker 2>thousand milligrams is good for this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not good for him.</v>

3973
02:55:43.610 --> 02:55:44.443
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a lot of people too</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are probably just not getting the </v>

3974
02:55:47.061 --> 02:55:50.450
<v Speaker 2>right fucking combinations of food too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3975
02:55:50.570 --> 02:55:55.570
<v Speaker 2>like just need to experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's the right combinations</v>

3976
02:55:55.791 --> 02:55:56.624
<v Speaker 2>of things for you.</v>

3977
02:55:56.930 --> 02:55:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Like that was what the whole gracie diet</v>
<v Speaker 2>was based on.</v>

3978
02:55:59.930 --> 02:56:01.940
<v Speaker 2>The gracie diet was based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3979
02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:05.850
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't eat certain foods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination because the enzymes that are</v>

3980
02:56:05.910 --> 02:56:10.000
<v Speaker 2>to breakdown fruit or not good to mix </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the enzymes that break down meat,</v>

3981
02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:13.730
<v Speaker 2>you should eat them separate from each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and like they had a bunch of whole</v>

3982
02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:15.620
<v Speaker 2>theories about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your,</v>

3983
02:56:15.630 --> 02:56:17.060
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think if you,</v>

3984
02:56:17.061 --> 02:56:21.050
<v Speaker 2>if there were certain truths about diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>after all this time,</v>

3985
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:22.820
<v Speaker 2>like certain truths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3986
02:56:23.060 --> 02:56:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Giant variations between human </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirements.</v>

3987
02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:27.313
<v Speaker 2>That's what I found the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've stopped saying for a long time ago </v>

3988
02:56:30.051 --> 02:56:30.884
<v Speaker 2>that you should do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing you should definitely do is </v>

3989
02:56:32.121 --> 02:56:33.030
<v Speaker 2>eat healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3990
02:56:33.380 --> 02:56:34.213
<v Speaker 2>So what's eating healthy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

3991
02:56:35.751 --> 02:56:36.584
<v Speaker 2>unless you have some sort of a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

3992
02:56:38.301 --> 02:56:40.850
<v Speaker 2>with eating a bunch of green leafy </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables.</v>

3993
02:56:40.850 --> 02:56:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that Shit's very important for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3994
02:56:42.490 --> 02:56:43.970
<v Speaker 2>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel better when I do it.</v>

3995
02:56:44.330 --> 02:56:46.880
<v Speaker 2>My body feels like when I eat like a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass salad,</v>

3996
02:56:46.881 --> 02:56:47.714
<v Speaker 2>like a spinach salad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body was feeling like this was like </v>

3997
02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:51.270
<v Speaker 2>he got it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3998
02:56:51.460 --> 02:56:52.310
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got it in there.</v>

3999
02:56:52.311 --> 02:56:53.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking for them.</v>

4000
02:56:53.631 --> 02:56:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Some of that green leafy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those Fido nutrients that.</v>

4001
02:56:57.170 --> 02:56:58.760
<v Speaker 2>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just.</v>

4002
02:56:58.820 --> 02:57:01.640
<v Speaker 2>It feels like my body jives with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

4003
02:57:02.030 --> 02:57:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Elk Wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meat tastes better.</v>

4004
02:57:05.151 --> 02:57:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Feels differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evolved.</v>

4005
02:57:06.770 --> 02:57:08.450
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just different.</v>

4006
02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:09.313
<v Speaker 2>I know it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's been saying it forever and </v>

4007
02:57:10.761 --> 02:57:11.780
<v Speaker 2>then want to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

4008
02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:15.260
<v Speaker 2>oh whew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it gives you that salad thing times</v>

4009
02:57:15.261 --> 02:57:16.094
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4010
02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:18.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I eat a nice steak,</v>

4011
02:57:18.861 --> 02:57:20.510
<v Speaker 2>it feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a nice steak,</v>

4012
02:57:20.511 --> 02:57:21.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lazy nice.</v>

4013
02:57:22.220 --> 02:57:23.053
<v Speaker 2>It's a lazy meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I eat a cut into nice American corn </v>

4014
02:57:25.971 --> 02:57:28.790
<v Speaker 2>fed steak tastes delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lazy meat.</v>

4015
02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I cut into a piece of elk or go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4016
02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:35.180
<v Speaker 2>it just rumbles somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deepen your DNA.</v>

4017
02:57:35.181 --> 02:57:37.680
<v Speaker 2>You eat a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If some of US eating deer,</v>

4018
02:57:37.710 --> 02:57:38.543
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's like this motherfucker was </v>

4019
02:57:39.721 --> 02:57:40.554
<v Speaker 2>sprinting all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there's something in there </v>

4020
02:57:42.501 --> 02:57:43.334
<v Speaker 2>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're eating an animal that has this </v>

4021
02:57:45.021 --> 02:57:47.190
<v Speaker 2>vitality to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A wild Vitas,</v>

4022
02:57:47.210 --> 02:57:48.043
<v Speaker 2>Charles pollock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you know the strength coach talks </v>

4023
02:57:49.551 --> 02:57:50.570
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

4024
02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:52.190
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to eat.</v>

4025
02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:56.540
<v Speaker 2>My favorite made is the longhorn </v>
<v Speaker 2>antelope in the north of Canada.</v>

4026
02:57:56.541 --> 02:57:58.400
<v Speaker 2>They spent a lot of time running away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from wolves,</v>

4027
02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:02.070
<v Speaker 2>so you know the glycogen in the is </v>
<v Speaker 2>always there,</v>

4028
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.903
<v Speaker 3>always have a high level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy who like a meat fudge and </v>

4029
02:58:04.891 --> 02:58:06.600
<v Speaker 3>of course you have to kill them from </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter.</v>

4030
02:58:06.601 --> 02:58:08.240
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to kill them anywhere</v>

4031
02:58:08.241 --> 02:58:09.074
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you should have a helicopter and </v>

4032
02:58:10.381 --> 02:58:12.430
<v Speaker 3>there's only one meets two in Toronto </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I go to.</v>

4033
02:58:12.431 --> 02:58:13.021
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

4034
02:58:13.021 --> 02:58:14.250
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it easy,</v>

4035
02:58:14.251 --> 02:58:16.950
<v Speaker 3>but it does sound delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada is antelope.</v>

4036
02:58:16.951 --> 02:58:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a type of antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4037
02:58:18.540 --> 02:58:21.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not Caribou now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a type of antelope I think.</v>

4038
02:58:21.420 --> 02:58:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4039
02:58:22.250 --> 02:58:23.083
<v Speaker 3>and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they.</v>

4040
02:58:23.330 --> 02:58:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's handled up.</v>

4041
02:58:25.230 --> 02:58:25.921
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

4042
02:58:25.921 --> 02:58:29.700
<v Speaker 3>but either way they run away from wolves</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day and the glycogen is really high.</v>

4043
02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:33.710
<v Speaker 2>We're going axis deer hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's going to Hawaii.</v>

4044
02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:35.350
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but acts,</v>

4045
02:58:35.420 --> 02:58:36.253
<v Speaker 2>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they evolved in India running away from </v>

4046
02:58:38.661 --> 02:58:39.494
<v Speaker 2>tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're an Asian deer and their natural </v>

4047
02:58:42.741 --> 02:58:43.580
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tigers.</v>

4048
02:58:43.940 --> 02:58:48.350
<v Speaker 2>You have never seen an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shot a deer that was 40 yards away.</v>

4049
02:58:48.740 --> 02:58:50.600
<v Speaker 2>It looked at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let the Arrow go.</v>

4050
02:58:50.601 --> 02:58:54.650
<v Speaker 2>By the time the Arrow got to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nowhere near where it was.</v>

4051
02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:59.330
<v Speaker 2>My Arrow goes 280 feet per second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Arrow,</v>

4052
02:58:59.331 --> 02:59:01.910
<v Speaker 2>once it left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the string was headed towards that thing</v>

4053
02:59:01.911 --> 02:59:04.910
<v Speaker 2>at 280 feet per second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that deer was nowhere near it.</v>

4054
02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was six,</v>

4055
02:59:06.361 --> 02:59:07.540
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

4056
02:59:07.550 --> 02:59:09.770
<v Speaker 2>seven feet away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like gone.</v>

4057
02:59:09.771 --> 02:59:12.080
<v Speaker 2>The Arrow went right into the bushes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was over there.</v>

4058
02:59:13.550 --> 02:59:16.280
<v Speaker 2>You ain't seen nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like from the Matrix.</v>

4059
02:59:16.310 --> 02:59:17.143
<v Speaker 2>Let me see an access to your big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about a hundred and 30 to 150 </v>

4060
02:59:22.131 --> 02:59:23.120
<v Speaker 2>pounds for a big one.</v>

4061
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:24.343
<v Speaker 2>Not quite as big as a white tail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a northern White Tilak we hunted </v>

4062
02:59:27.981 --> 02:59:28.814
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4063
02:59:28.820 --> 02:59:29.653
<v Speaker 2>that looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looks a lot bigger than it really </v>

4064
02:59:31.401 --> 02:59:32.234
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like saving and find the </v>

4065
02:59:34.071 --> 02:59:35.300
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that I shot,</v>

4066
02:59:35.650 --> 02:59:38.300
<v Speaker 2>it's online on Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram page.</v>

4067
02:59:38.540 --> 02:59:40.250
<v Speaker 2>I try to keep them off all the dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

4068
02:59:40.251 --> 02:59:42.830
<v Speaker 2>off my instagram page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send them to my hunter friends.</v>

4069
02:59:42.831 --> 02:59:44.540
<v Speaker 2>They post them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get so mad.</v>

4070
02:59:44.541 --> 02:59:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They definitely get mad.</v>

4071
02:59:46.970 --> 02:59:49.100
<v Speaker 2>People get mad at me while they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>burger on their page.</v>

4072
02:59:49.670 --> 02:59:53.690
<v Speaker 2>People are just goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my access to you that I shot.</v>

4073
02:59:55.490 --> 02:59:58.190
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why that's in Hawaii.</v>

4074
02:59:58.191 --> 03:00:00.320
<v Speaker 2>That was why a lot of bugs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4075
03:00:00.560 --> 03:00:02.840
<v Speaker 2>no little tiny ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little bit,</v>

4076
03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:04.370
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it really is,</v>

4077
03:00:04.371 --> 03:00:07.340
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant that's a pronghorn antelope.</v>

4078
03:00:07.341 --> 03:00:09.320
<v Speaker 2>That's a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an antelope in Canada.</v>

4079
03:00:09.830 --> 03:00:10.663
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know they're in Montana and </v>

4080
03:00:11.991 --> 03:00:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming.</v>

4081
03:00:12.420 --> 03:00:13.670
<v Speaker 2>One Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4082
03:00:13.671 --> 03:00:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on a coin down the south.</v>

4083
03:00:18.350 --> 03:00:20.480
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

4084
03:00:20.570 --> 03:00:22.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4085
03:00:23.090 --> 03:00:24.830
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just Texas.</v>

4086
03:00:25.400 --> 03:00:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Texas is not the south though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4087
03:00:28.310 --> 03:00:30.460
<v Speaker 2>so if we could organize something for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico urine,</v>

4088
03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will use rifles.</v>

4089
03:00:33.050 --> 03:00:34.800
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be easy for me now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4090
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:36.800
<v Speaker 2>you brought me that bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have yet to know.</v>

4091
03:00:36.890 --> 03:00:39.890
<v Speaker 2>But you can't go bow hunting without.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if we go.</v>

4092
03:00:39.891 --> 03:00:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after dear.</v>

4093
03:00:41.270 --> 03:00:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I said with that thing one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't do it the right way,</v>

4094
03:00:44.121 --> 03:00:46.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's just,</v>

4095
03:00:47.390 --> 03:00:49.790
<v Speaker 2>it's just something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to really do it,</v>

4096
03:00:49.791 --> 03:00:52.850
<v Speaker 2>you got to get obsessed with it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time you do it.</v>

4097
03:00:52.851 --> 03:00:54.410
<v Speaker 2>It should be in a controlled </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

4098
03:00:54.411 --> 03:00:55.244
<v Speaker 2>like one of the first way would really </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a good way would be wild pigs over </v>

4099
03:01:00.191 --> 03:01:01.024
<v Speaker 2>bait because there's a lot of places </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they try to eradicate these wild </v>

4100
03:01:03.941 --> 03:01:04.774
<v Speaker 2>pigs so they have feeders and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeders of go off in the wild pigs are </v>

4101
03:01:07.391 --> 03:01:08.224
<v Speaker 2>almost like conditioned to go near the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeder and then when they go near the </v>

4102
03:01:11.291 --> 03:01:12.124
<v Speaker 2>feeder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know exactly the distance because </v>

4103
03:01:13.211 --> 03:01:14.044
<v Speaker 2>they're right underneath the feet are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the feeders 20 yards away from you and </v>

4104
03:01:15.701 --> 03:01:19.570
<v Speaker 2>you have a controlled shot and it's easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an animal that they must kill,</v>

4105
03:01:19.810 --> 03:01:22.330
<v Speaker 2>so there's not like a number of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can hunt.</v>

4106
03:01:22.460 --> 03:01:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Can't believe how many there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many.</v>

4107
03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:27.370
<v Speaker 2>If you're in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shoot them out of helicopters.</v>

4108
03:01:27.371 --> 03:01:29.100
<v Speaker 2>They fly around in helicopters and gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

4109
03:01:29.310 --> 03:01:31.180
<v Speaker 2>They still say you can't shoot your way </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the problem.</v>

4110
03:01:32.050 --> 03:01:32.883
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing their best to at least do </v>

4111
03:01:34.121 --> 03:01:36.640
<v Speaker 2>something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to shoot their way out</v>

4112
03:01:36.641 --> 03:01:38.230
<v Speaker 2>of the problem to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extinction.</v>

4113
03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:39.910
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They move so quick.</v>

4114
03:01:39.940 --> 03:01:41.590
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're smart,</v>

4115
03:01:41.591 --> 03:01:42.424
<v Speaker 2>tough as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have litters three or four </v>

4116
03:01:43.541 --> 03:01:45.450
<v Speaker 2>times a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4117
03:01:45.640 --> 03:01:50.640
<v Speaker 2>They just constantly running around </v>
<v Speaker 2>other moms.</v>

4118
03:01:51.220 --> 03:01:52.053
<v Speaker 2>What are the ones that I saw?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one eating out of a garbage can </v>

4119
03:01:53.921 --> 03:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>in the Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those got to be in.</v>

4120
03:01:55.690 --> 03:01:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Those are not wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are wild boars.</v>

4121
03:01:59.020 --> 03:01:59.853
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>board just means a male of female is a </v>

4122
03:02:02.380 --> 03:02:03.760
<v Speaker 2>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of those ones that you see,</v>

4123
03:02:03.770 --> 03:02:04.820
<v Speaker 2>they have got a razorback.</v>

4124
03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:05.713
<v Speaker 2>They're just like those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look like they're not as big as </v>

4125
03:02:08.531 --> 03:02:10.390
<v Speaker 2>pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just fierce looking at.</v>

4126
03:02:10.391 --> 03:02:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just because the supply of food,</v>

4127
03:02:12.041 --> 03:02:17.041
<v Speaker 2>if they had as much pigs as wild boar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4128
03:02:17.081 --> 03:02:18.100
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4129
03:02:18.101 --> 03:02:19.360
<v Speaker 2>That's a real wild boar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4130
03:02:19.390 --> 03:02:22.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a big ass pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't look like a real pig,</v>

4131
03:02:22.100 --> 03:02:23.970
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That almost looks like a wart hog.</v>

4132
03:02:24.180 --> 03:02:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

4133
03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:28.330
<v Speaker 2>So big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing about wild pigs,</v>

4134
03:02:28.331 --> 03:02:30.520
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something I learned from my pal,</v>

4135
03:02:30.521 --> 03:02:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Steve Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are literally all the same animal,</v>

4136
03:02:34.180 --> 03:02:37.300
<v Speaker 2>wild pigs and domestic pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the same animal.</v>

4137
03:02:37.301 --> 03:02:38.134
<v Speaker 2>It's called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all part of one gigantic </v>

4138
03:02:41.381 --> 03:02:42.214
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor capturing the size of that thing </v>

4139
03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:48.710
<v Speaker 2>that looks like a power lifter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4140
03:02:48.711 --> 03:02:49.544
<v Speaker 2>The thing is it looks like it's like 400</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds as long as snout is just tiny </v>

4141
03:02:52.721 --> 03:02:55.630
<v Speaker 2>little bitch ass feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny feet.</v>

4142
03:02:55.690 --> 03:02:56.710
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't even seem real.</v>

4143
03:02:56.860 --> 03:02:58.390
<v Speaker 2>That seems like an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
