<v Speaker 1>we got a chance to see Richard Pryor </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

98
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.543
<v Speaker 1>Remember those students for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was so nervous I was in </v>

99
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>that office at the comedy store and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought them in water and I was like,</v>

100
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.043
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we used to get punished for </v>

101
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>listening to his stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I was like,</v>

102
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I told him that and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

103
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:40.141
<v Speaker 1>And then later on his wife wouldn't let </v>
<v Speaker 1>me bring him the too nice.</v>

104
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>He used to call him Martinis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd bring me in Tunis,</v>

105
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Tunisia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like three to prowl,</v>

106
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>bring them whenever he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast for cocaine,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

108
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

109
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought it to him and she made me </v>

110
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 1>change it to water.</v>

111
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>He made me change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love her.</v>

112
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.184
<v Speaker 1>I know what she was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's like he's </v>

113
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let him have his Friggen Martini,</v>

114
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.343
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I brought it on stage and he sipped </v>

115
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it and he knew it was water and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

116
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.180
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

117
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor doesn't like me.</v>

118
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>No bitch wipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

119
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to get in trouble.</v>

120
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know if it was his meds that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would counteract.</v>

121
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>You never know why she was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

122
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear Ya.</v>

123
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean ultimately you have to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

124
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.430
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can't remember.</v>

125
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 1>So I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

126
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>he did it a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go on after him a lot.</v>

127
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a year.</v>

128
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>He did a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did Monday,</v>

129
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday.</v>

130
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 1>And then it switched down to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday.</v>

131
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how many times I went </v>

132
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.224
<v Speaker 1>on after him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember I bombed basically every </v>

133
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.404
<v Speaker 1>single one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I might have got over a couple of </v>

134
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was packed.</v>

135
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.493
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was weird too because he was really </v>

136
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chili carrier bought chewy.</v>

137
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who else?</v>

138
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.510
<v Speaker 1>James?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

139
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.373
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't bad.</v>

140
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.750
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was.</v>

141
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 2>It was Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martinez.</v>

142
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:04.620
<v Speaker 2>His husband remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

143
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.663
<v Speaker 2>David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to help him and Julie used to help </v>

144
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Richard Pryor get to the stage now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>

145
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid to put my headphones all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way off.</v>

146
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

147
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I have a paranoia and worry that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to sneak up on it.</v>

148
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sort of blocked this filly.</v>

149
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:21.554
<v Speaker 2>That's that old school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philly philly has a UFC lightweight </v>

150
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 2>champion of the world now from Philly </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that Alvarez.</v>

151
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's from philly.</v>

152
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 2>How come I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stinks.</v>

153
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>

154
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.370
<v Speaker 2>And how are the fights this weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

155
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>The opera is one was probably the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

156
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Well I didn't watch of those was a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>underdog.</v>

157
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 2>He felt hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dos Anjos on the Internet.</v>

158
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 2>It was on the Internet.</v>

159
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.570
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oops was only on UFC fight reflex like a</v>

160
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 2>cat on UFC fight pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't think a lot of people.</v>

161
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know how many people watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight past ones,</v>

162
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not as much as Fox.</v>

163
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's as much as a paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>

164
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:03.914
<v Speaker 2>but I could be wrong at this point </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know there's millions of </v>

165
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 2>millions of people would have fight pass</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I,</v>

166
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that the actual numbers,</v>

167
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.023
<v Speaker 2>but fipass is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can watch every fight that's ever </v>

168
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 2>taken place and they have a few world </v>
<v Speaker 2>title fights on it now.</v>

169
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 2>So that world title fight was a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the three day celebration.</v>

170
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.413
<v Speaker 2>So it was a heartfelt dos Anjos versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight title </v>

171
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:24.683
<v Speaker 2>and then it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to young Jay check and a logic </v>

172
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.680
<v Speaker 2>a day on Friday night for the women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>strawweight title.</v>

173
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.513
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the big UFC 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was three nights of insane fights </v>

174
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.483
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I came off stage when the girls </v>

175
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:39.554
<v Speaker 2>were fighting and I came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to show my friend the bar at the </v>

176
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:42.741
<v Speaker 2>comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 2>the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

178
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:44.301
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in here.</v>

179
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:46.030
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

180
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot we're doing comics.</v>

181
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Sorry guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go out.</v>

182
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.270
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

183
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:56.720
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seeing rock back and he killed it.</v>

184
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar beat a world.</v>

185
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama like a world class </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight.</v>

186
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just asking a question guy.</v>

187
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He beat a world class heavyweight.</v>

188
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.823
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat Mark Hunt mean he fucking </v>

189
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:10.124
<v Speaker 2>legitimately mark beat Mark Hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He avoided getting knocked down on his </v>

190
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:15.110
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took them down to fucking gorilla.</v>

191
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 2>He took him down like nobody can you </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch him take,</v>

192
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 2>wanted to take Mark Hunt down and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

193
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's stopping that?</v>

194
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 2>How are you stopping that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

195
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.090
<v Speaker 2>his horsepower is just so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he gets a hold of a judge,</v>

196
00:08:27.091 --> 00:08:27.924
<v Speaker 2>it's just boom and he's taking them down</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Mark Hunt is a difficult guy to </v>

197
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 2>take down and Mark Hunt is all of 265 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

198
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 2>He's a big fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for brock to do that to him that way,</v>

199
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

200
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.530
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could probably tell you,</v>

201
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.373
<v Speaker 2>is that what a good example of somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't supposedly you steroids to </v>

202
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's a monster.</v>

203
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 2>His muscles are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And supposedly he got tested,</v>

204
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:54.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

205
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.473
<v Speaker 2>He got for this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got tested five times within a very </v>

206
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:00.294
<v Speaker 2>short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just be completely honest in </v>

207
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 2>the nature of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

208
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.120
<v Speaker 2>open discourse when you look at someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're jacked as fucked,</v>

209
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 2>it could easily be genetics because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are girls that have giant tits for</v>

210
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:17.570
<v Speaker 2>no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like size,</v>

211
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 2>double e tits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

212
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

213
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.503
<v Speaker 2>And they're 100 percent natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's some girls that are </v>

214
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have very large boobs,</v>

215
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.663
<v Speaker 2>girls besides you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people out there that </v>

216
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 2>have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing going on,</v>

217
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 2>this task or this is just a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between human shapes.</v>

218
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:35.743
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there are people that are built </v>

219
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Sidley as a buddy of mine from</v>

220
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:40.104
<v Speaker 2>a back in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was shocked and he didn't even lift </v>

221
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:43.674
<v Speaker 2>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just Jamaican kid that I was </v>

222
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 2>friends with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

223
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:51.210
<v Speaker 2>he was fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was ridiculously yoked and he barely,</v>

224
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.383
<v Speaker 2>he barely worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he did like a kickboxing things </v>

225
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:57.050
<v Speaker 2>and some pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not.</v>

226
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.933
<v Speaker 2>He was never lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was just doing martial arts </v>

227
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:02.950
<v Speaker 2>stuff and he was jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother Charlie was like,</v>

228
00:10:02.951 --> 00:10:03.784
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always muscly up until like two years </v>

229
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 2>ago has changed.</v>

230
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell him I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

231
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.663
<v Speaker 2>I'll get pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hear that little kid to listen to a </v>

232
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:12.870
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the little kid,</v>

233
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:14.960
<v Speaker 2>a little muscle kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was super kid.</v>

234
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.563
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen him now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He works at Universal Studios as in the </v>

235
00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:23.400
<v Speaker 2>water world exhibit and now he's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>

236
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of has a beer gut now.</v>

237
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Like he stopped lifting because he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was boring man.</v>

238
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:30.414
<v Speaker 2>Well this wasn't a case of then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>alleged that his parents had had him on </v>

239
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 2>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably staring.</v>

240
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 2>That's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really sad.</v>

241
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 2>If that's the same store that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about,</v>

242
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I think there's been more than one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those like little yoke dudes.</v>

243
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.193
<v Speaker 2>I know this is one little yoke dude that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a genetic disorder that cows have </v>

244
00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 2>some times and those whippet dogs have </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes we had to.</v>

245
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen that?</v>

246
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.160
<v Speaker 2>The whip it dogs and get the double </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle disorder?</v>

247
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dog was lazy,</v>

248
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 2>but she was a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

249
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Just assume if they have the extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle,</v>

250
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:06.870
<v Speaker 2>they'd be more with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

251
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:10.460
<v Speaker 2>there's this thing that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whippets and some cows that's called.</v>

252
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.760
<v Speaker 2>It's called a myostatin inhibitor and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>milestone staten inhibitor.</v>

253
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it regulates the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle tissue,</v>

254
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 2>the carry around with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when these whippets get it,</v>

255
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 2>they look like the hulk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look fake.</v>

256
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 2>They look like a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

257
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.043
<v Speaker 2>I've seen pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull up a photo of a whippet mio staten </v>

258
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Tibbott her dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how to spell that.</v>

259
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 2>But apparently there's a boy in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least one kid that's confirm that was</v>

260
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 2>born with this disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's really young,</v>

261
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:43.854
<v Speaker 2>but he's jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just fucking super yolked Baby </v>

262
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.413
<v Speaker 2>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what the men look at their </v>

263
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like really weird.</v>

264
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 3>They're usually a very slender dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very kangaroo looking.</v>

265

268
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.020

271
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 3>like they were newspaper reporters or </v>

<v Speaker 3>They say though,</v>

295
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 3>they say though that if you find them in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wild,</v>

296
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:22.060
<v Speaker 3>you are not supposed to ever approach.</v>

<v Speaker 3>around last week is a kangaroo seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>its reflection in somebody's window and </v>

301
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:36.304
<v Speaker 3>it's trying to fight it so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the guys on the other side with the </v>

302
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:39.910
<v Speaker 3>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just as jacked.</v>

303
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Like kangaroo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like punching the window.</v>

304
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Like it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my gosh.</v>

305
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.321
<v Speaker 3>Video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

306
00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:45.940
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the coolest video that came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out last week.</v>

307
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:46.774
<v Speaker 3>If you just type in a kangaroo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a window fist fighting himself in a </v>

308
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 3>window,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shadowboxing a window.</v>

309
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>

310
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:57.270
<v Speaker 3>I think they're great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so weird what it does though.</v>

311
00:13:57.271 --> 00:14:02.271
<v Speaker 3>The way it acts that sits on its tail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bouncing around these legs and then</v>

312
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 3>it's got those jagged upper body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>

313
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.900
<v Speaker 3>There was like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get spooked.</v>

314
00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Easy to like this one big one was trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have sex.</v>

315
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say it wasn't sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was definitely rape,</v>

316
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 3>but it was like he was pulling her back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was trying to get away,</v>

317
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.290
<v Speaker 3>but there was a reason she was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get away because there was like a weird.</v>

318
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:22.690
<v Speaker 3>When come they want to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all scattered.</v>

319
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Then they went under the tree and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they got into it and I was like,</v>

320
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe she just wanted some privacy or.</v>

321
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 3>That was really interesting how they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sneak out,</v>

322
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.670
<v Speaker 3>but she was scared and then as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird thing came,</v>

323
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:34.504
<v Speaker 3>it was like a wind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all went scattered and then they </v>

324
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.700
<v Speaker 3>got back into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was exciting.</v>

325
00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.023
<v Speaker 3>Kinga.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is so scary.</v>

327
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 3>So knock on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one's not too jacked.</v>

328
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's creepy though.</v>

329
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

330
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.680
<v Speaker 2>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he starts getting pissed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>mirror.</v>

333
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's throwing himself at the window.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's trying to fight.</v>

336
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.580
<v Speaker 2>What he sees as a reflection in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>window at your house is a creepy animal.</v>

337
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.400

00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 2>and even insects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

351
00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:00.974
<v Speaker 2>Like cows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos regurgitate their food and </v>

352
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:05.090
<v Speaker 2>read through it before it's ready to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally digested.</v>

353
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:05.953
<v Speaker 2>Juvenile kangaroo reviews the outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>world from the Pouch of adult female </v>

354
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've seen Eddie,</v>

355
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.480
<v Speaker 2>if he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

356
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.110
<v Speaker 2>he got fucking chased by one in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

357
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:15.944
<v Speaker 2>He told the story of how he thought it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was fake because it was so big because </v>

358
00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 2>it was like a fucking seven foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>kangaroo.</v>

359
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.333
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was fake and he got out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car and he was with a bunch of </v>

360
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.573
<v Speaker 2>Australians and he starts walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards it and his friend go and his </v>

361
00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:37.710
<v Speaker 2>friends stopped him and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back in the car and you know,</v>

362
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.430
<v Speaker 2>bad Australian accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty Rad,</v>

363
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.483
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

364
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.700
<v Speaker 2>So the dude ran back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie ran back to the car and apparently</v>

365
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 2>this fucking kangaroo is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>after them.</v>

366
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Like this giant kangaroo is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go too close to them,</v>

367
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.343
<v Speaker 2>if they think you're a threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably been fucked with people </v>

368
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.253
<v Speaker 2>unless they were in captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where I went to see them chasing a </v>

369
00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Speaker 2>golf court after golfers on Jurassic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Park.</v>

370
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my point to that thing.</v>

371
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Ate Meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be Foxville.</v>

372
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if there was like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and they ate meat.</v>

373
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:15.020
<v Speaker 2>There were predators bouncing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd kill them.</v>

374
00:17:15.021 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

375
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Don't have to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fight you.</v>

376
00:17:17.811 --> 00:17:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Is that why they are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

377
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I feel like fighting tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack Ufc Kenga roles.</v>

378
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they that they're just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>preference.</v>

379
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Like do they ever cross the line and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

380
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:31.130

<v Speaker 2>Do cows eat birds where they find them?</v>

384
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.730
<v Speaker 2>If they find them on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat nesting birds.</v>

385
00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:43.460
<v Speaker 2>The birds a fall out in the fall on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

466
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.780
<v Speaker 1>He's not moving your time to go see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to wake up.</v>

467
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Soon as he took the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took the thing off.</v>

468
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even have it on the bulls out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there like,</v>

469
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.300
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

470
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I would play that game in that little </v>
<v Speaker 1>trampoline thing.</v>

471
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the only place to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is it that we love this,</v>

472
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.450
<v Speaker 1>like part of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here,</v>

473
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.270
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking,</v>

474
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.260
<v Speaker 1>we're watching something fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

475
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 1>We're watching it from the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

476
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

477
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

478
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like mid air.</v>

479
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this like?</v>

480
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Why are we so attracted to this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

481
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 1>It is weird that we're attracted to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think of a guy mid air with his legs</v>

482
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:05.500
<v Speaker 1>spread Eagle and he's about to land on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bull.</v>

483
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going through his head?</v>

484
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.850
<v Speaker 1>We're watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a little slower than we are.</v>

485
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.560
<v Speaker 1>He probably felt like if it's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

486
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I could do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People feel like if it's a thing,</v>

487
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:20.883
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's a thing that people do </v>

488
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 1>and other people do it what it could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

489
00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put the fucking.</v>

490
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 1>He might be the first group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be one of the first tasters.</v>

491
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they were like,</v>

492
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:35.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're testing something out.</v>

493
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Can you come test this out for us?</v>

494
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Would you be our Guinea pig?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you do it?</v>

495
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

496
00:22:41.621 --> 00:22:42.454
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is ironic because I hosted fear </v>

497
00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:46.090
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

498
00:22:46.091 --> 00:22:46.924
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to have anything to do </v>

499
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 1>with anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

500
00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:49.654
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be bigger and used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're inside the ball and it </v>

501
00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 1>needs to be like a stronger material and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it'd be okay.</v>

502
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I think pretty strong material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's.</v>

503
00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 1>There's bull horns coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with that.</v>

504
00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Here's how I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People I think vastly overestimate their</v>

505
00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:10.201
<v Speaker 1>ability to move their body vastly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think when that ball's going,</v>

506
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll just fucking go with it and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking,</v>

507
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still going to be looking at fake </v>

508
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.120
<v Speaker 1>them out backfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bull comes on you so fast.</v>

509
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad quote right there.</v>

510
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.023
<v Speaker 1>Got excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that anybody else thinking </v>

511
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get into this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see that bull launch,</v>

512
00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:34.630
<v Speaker 1>that dude into the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

513
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you that guy at that moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was flying was like,</v>

514
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.280
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

515
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

516
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.160
<v Speaker 1>This is not what I felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

517
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was not in the brochure.</v>

518
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't control this guy.</v>

519
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.663
<v Speaker 1>That guy probably didn't think before or</v>
<v Speaker 1>after or during these rides is a dumb </v>

520
00:23:52.321 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably one of those.</v>

521
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man.</v>

522
00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.440

<v Speaker 1>I to tell you what I'll do.</v>

523
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll climate side of that phone with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bolt hit me.</v>

524
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could shoot an apple off my head.</v>

525
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared to die.</v>

526
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:11.070
<v Speaker 1>If my granddad was an Indian hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent Apache broke,</v>

527
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I got that warrior blood.</v>

528
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck what I gotta do what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotTa do.</v>

529
00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:17.354
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be the first in line first in the </v>

530
00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:20.224
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the brain's slipping out of </v>

531
00:24:22.191 --> 00:24:24.320
<v Speaker 1>their skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad knees fucked up.</v>

532
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Farmers back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

533
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.310
<v Speaker 1>It's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those dudes.</v>

534
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Fear factor thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do it just for the money.</v>

535
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I would only do the stunts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do the food.</v>

536
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can barely a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>

537
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 1>You could have got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people got there.</v>

538
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:43.571
<v Speaker 1>Was it was no parody like as far as like</v>
<v Speaker 1>how difficult things were on some shows?</v>

539
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:44.564
<v Speaker 1>There were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was always totally random </v>

540
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:47.030
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you got what you had to eat.</v>

541
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.150
<v Speaker 1>But some of it was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like roaches are easy.</v>

542
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:50.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

543
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roaches,</v>

544
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

545
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 1>They barely tastes like anything.</v>

546
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 1>We ate those like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

547
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Like so picky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a joke in there somewhere,</v>

548
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes on you.</v>

549
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 1>And Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we are full circle.</v>

550
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all in your head because if you</v>

551
00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:16.040
<v Speaker 1>eat crabs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating the same thing.</v>

552
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.810
<v Speaker 1>They're like a crab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

553
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you want me to see for the worst fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor to me is like a Swedish fish.</v>

554
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 1>If you really needed the money and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were there,</v>

555
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.350
<v Speaker 1>I looked at the other people you're with</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

556
00:25:30.351 --> 00:25:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to let these pussies beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>me crazy.</v>

557
00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little competitive but not.</v>

558
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I could beat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>

559
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:41.360
<v Speaker 1>like letting everybody see me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit my pants right.</v>

560
00:25:41.361 --> 00:25:42.194
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that would probably go right </v>

561
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:44.120
<v Speaker 1>through me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm afraid of,</v>

562
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>like I would throw up or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>

563
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:47.203
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you have an allergy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird foods or is it just you're just </v>

564
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a little retarded.</v>

565
00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.860
<v Speaker 1>I know not to say that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to hear.</v>

566
00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.880
<v Speaker 1>This is a retard free zone on facebook </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people do that people are angry.</v>

567
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:02.423
<v Speaker 1>It's just go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consumer sent me a list of words to say </v>

568
00:26:05.811 --> 00:26:07.330
<v Speaker 1>other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how crazy is that?</v>

569
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.263
<v Speaker 1>So whatever the language police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out there and they kind of pull </v>

570
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:16.340
<v Speaker 1>you over and give you a ticket and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel really good about it.</v>

571
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't like what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like how you're saying it.</v>

572
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Intent is not as critical as the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>words that come out of your mouth to add</v>

573
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.320
<v Speaker 1>the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Police,</v>

574
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I will punch in the face that you hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

575
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Physical language police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a regular police.</v>

576
00:26:32.631 --> 00:26:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not crazy.</v>

577
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

578
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.213
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody should learn to </v>

579
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:39.734
<v Speaker 1>behave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if a language that they're </v>

580
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 1>misbehaving to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language police</v>

581
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 3>so they get punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I am a little violent.</v>

582
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the punch.</v>

583
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I do love to punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that terrible?</v>

584
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.793
<v Speaker 3>Punching people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>

585
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.050
<v Speaker 3>You're like one of those walk by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch people in the alarm.</v>

586
00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 3>In my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an insane asylum.</v>

587
00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 3>If there was 10 of us in a row home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have six brothers.</v>

588
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 3>I woke up every day to a punch in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>

589
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:07.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other stuff,</v>

590
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10.770
<v Speaker 3>whatever you dick to the failure of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerance.</v>

591
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:12.780
<v Speaker 3>You grew up with like a lot of tolerance</v>
<v Speaker 3>for bullshit.</v>

592
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.760
<v Speaker 3>So your patient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thin,</v>

593
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean your skin gets.</v>

594
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:18.024
<v Speaker 3>Then I can't have thick thicker if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have like I have one niece that was a </v>

595
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:26.290
<v Speaker 3>little thin skinned and then my brothers</v>
<v Speaker 3>just beat that out of her poor thing.</v>

596
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.620
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know what she was getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>

597
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:30.211
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

598
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.044
<v Speaker 3>are you sensitive?</v>

599
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 3>Come over here for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then now she's cool now.</v>

600
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.641
<v Speaker 3>Now she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

601
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's stupid to be sensitive.</v>

602
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much could your parents have control</v>

603
00:27:41.221 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 3>you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many of you.</v>

604
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Especially because my parents split up </v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

605
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 3>So when I was like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they split up,</v>

606
00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:50.490
<v Speaker 3>so it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

607
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.310
<v Speaker 3>it's on now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can't catch me now.</v>

608
00:27:53.311 --> 00:27:54.144
<v Speaker 3>But that wasn't true because my dad's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>marine and he only moved like five </v>

609
00:27:56.581 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 3>blocks away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so any new,</v>

610
00:27:58.171 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 3>every cop in the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I,</v>

611
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.460
<v Speaker 3>if I did anything he knew the next day </v>
<v Speaker 3>or he'd see me,</v>

612
00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:07.890
<v Speaker 3>he'd be out and see me and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

613
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 3>But I was afraid of my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

614
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:11.730
<v Speaker 3>are you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still afraid of my dad.</v>

615
00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:14.700
<v Speaker 3>He's 80 every once in a while be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey dad,</v>

616
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.680
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

617
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.660
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

618
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.503
<v Speaker 3>but I still backed.</v>

619
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Well he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even today you couldn't get upset at</v>

620
00:28:22.321 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 3>him and talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like personal,</v>

621
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:24.270
<v Speaker 3>personal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

622
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 3>I had a fight with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to him.</v>

623
00:28:26.821 --> 00:28:27.654
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call them because I use them for </v>

624
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:31.410
<v Speaker 3>material and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just gives gems,</v>

625
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.273
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now he lives in Rehobeth beach </v>

626
00:28:33.741 --> 00:28:34.574
<v Speaker 3>cheats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Retires,</v>

627
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 3>it's in Delaware and it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a predominantly gay area.</v>

628
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.080
<v Speaker 3>My Dad's a marine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like covered in tattoos.</v>

629
00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:45.490
<v Speaker 3>He still wears his dog tags because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to jerk off to.</v>

630
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did not know that.</v>

631
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Now he knows that and he also had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He refers to lesbians.</v>

632
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 3>It's girl faggots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

633
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.840
<v Speaker 3>that's not what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm like,</v>

634
00:28:57.841 --> 00:28:58.674
<v Speaker 3>they're lesbians and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what were there from the </v>

635
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.650
<v Speaker 3>UFC has an openly gay women's </v>
<v Speaker 3>bantamweight champion.</v>

636
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

637
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a beast to.</v>

638
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.073
<v Speaker 3>I would say at the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I love about him is that the </v>

639
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:14.400
<v Speaker 3>women are just as good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amanda Nunez,</v>

640
00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.740
<v Speaker 2>she's the new champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knocked out of me.</v>

641
00:29:17.741 --> 00:29:20.090
<v Speaker 2>She stopped doing the first round was </v>
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

642
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.700
<v Speaker 2>I only saw the highlights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but great fight.</v>

643
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.400
<v Speaker 2>She's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's awesome.</v>

644
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.890
<v Speaker 2>She's so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like lightening fast.</v>

645
00:29:26.891 --> 00:29:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Her hands are so explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she's.</v>

646
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 2>She's so hard to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

647
00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.173
<v Speaker 2>she's one of those girls that she's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sprinter and like in the third and </v>

648
00:29:34.301 --> 00:29:35.134
<v Speaker 2>fourth and fifth round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when she's going to have a hard </v>

649
00:29:36.761 --> 00:29:39.100
<v Speaker 2>time because he blows out so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

650
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 2>she takes people out like she's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

651
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Like from standing and on the ground as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well or Jujitsu is really good,</v>

652
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.623
<v Speaker 2>but she's so explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only worry or concern that people </v>

653
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 2>have is that I wonder if she can sustain</v>
<v Speaker 2>that level,</v>

654
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.690
<v Speaker 2>but to fight like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody.</v>

655
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.770
<v Speaker 2>She's incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really,</v>

656
00:29:56.771 --> 00:29:57.604
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting because she has </v>
<v Speaker 2>had fights where she kind of faded in </v>

657
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

658
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.513
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to get through that storm</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she brings and it's just so she's </v>

659
00:30:04.801 --> 00:30:06.200
<v Speaker 2>so explosive.</v>

660
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's between her and I mean there's,</v>

661
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody moves quite as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast as her or our hits quite as hard as</v>

662
00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:15.334
<v Speaker 2>her in that division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there might be girls like Holly </v>

663
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Holm that might be like a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more skillful as a strike or a much more</v>

664
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:24.760
<v Speaker 2>experienced than the striker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The very few people hit with the kind of</v>

665
00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:29.290
<v Speaker 2>pop that she's got something at watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm was great.</v>

666
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.560
<v Speaker 2>She's awesome watching her it from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>get like I wish they had that when I was</v>

667
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:37.510
<v Speaker 2>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we talked about that before.</v>

668
00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Like I definitely would have gotten into</v>
<v Speaker 2>as kit.</v>

669
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I know you would have easily because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have gotten arrested as much,</v>

670
00:30:43.951 --> 00:30:44.784
<v Speaker 2>so it's like easier that way if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>another woman's been away that doesn't </v>

671
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:48.820
<v Speaker 2>get enough credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raquel Pennington.</v>

672
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen her.</v>

673
00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:52.723
<v Speaker 2>She's good now.</v>

674
00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to scam me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop me face.</v>

675
00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:56.351
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

676
00:30:56.351 --> 00:30:58.720
<v Speaker 2>I thought that ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very,</v>

677
00:30:58.721 --> 00:30:59.554
<v Speaker 2>very skillful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like on the outside of the very </v>

678
00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:03.690
<v Speaker 2>top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She but she's a.</v>

679
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.180
<v Speaker 2>she's beaten some really tough people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watch and I get jealous.</v>

680
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:12.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I want to get into her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm and her fought Holly Holm,</v>

681
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.990
<v Speaker 2>UFC debut and it was a split decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really close fight.</v>

682
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.080
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's very good and better now than.</v>

683
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.333
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better now than she was then and that </v>

684
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.170
<v Speaker 2>she wears a shirt that says rocky </v>
<v Speaker 2>killers just told me this.</v>

685
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.383
<v Speaker 2>She's got this one submission victory </v>
<v Speaker 2>where she catches this girl Ashley Evan </v>

686
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.153
<v Speaker 2>Smith and a bulldog choke and chokes her</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious with like one second to go </v>

687
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.923
<v Speaker 2>in the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go over her neck and she's out </v>

688
00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:40.084
<v Speaker 2>cold in this puddle of blood was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those where you're doing </v>

689
00:31:43.421 --> 00:31:44.840
<v Speaker 2>commentary like wow.</v>

690
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.850
<v Speaker 2>It was a screamer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so ridiculous.</v>

691
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women's Bantam weight division is filled</v>

692
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:55.360
<v Speaker 2>with fucking killers now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many good fighters.</v>

693
00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trading titles.</v>

694
00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.700
<v Speaker 2>The main events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which title I,</v>

695
00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big deal.</v>

696
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Women's sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

697
00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:03.904

<v Speaker 2>What's definitely a big deal for the </v>

698
00:32:05.201 --> 00:32:06.220
<v Speaker 2>biggest paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of John Jones didn't test positive for </v>

700
00:32:10.151 --> 00:32:13.000
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because he did,</v>

701
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.390
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

702
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.550
<v Speaker 2>So is he admitted to it yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he saying what he did?</v>

703
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>

704
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.510
<v Speaker 2>He's not saying anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tailpiece son and leaked the information</v>

705
00:32:22.511 --> 00:32:27.100
<v Speaker 2>during my last podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's out of it's shell has leaked out</v>

706
00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:28.660
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>

707
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he said to me out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no,</v>

708
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:34.880
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hear anything about.</v>

709
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.943
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a weird position because I don't </v>

710
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:38.470
<v Speaker 2>think you're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he supposed to.</v>

711
00:32:38.471 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Anybody is supposed to be talking about</v>

712
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.460
<v Speaker 1>the medical results until like it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>released.</v>

713
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

714
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to plead ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

715
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll plead ignorance all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bridal name.</v>

716
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably took boner pills </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have all that shit in them,</v>

717
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have potent pills,</v>

718
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:57.090
<v Speaker 1>have steroids in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boner pills,</v>

719
00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 1>because I just found Joe's gas station </v>
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>

720
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.593
<v Speaker 1>It has like the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen these right on is known </v>

721
00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:05.954
<v Speaker 1>for his love of the boner pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes what you would call a boner </v>

722
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:09.464
<v Speaker 1>pill contour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's actually read blogs about boner </v>

723
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:15.860
<v Speaker 1>pills and directed me to reviews of </v>
<v Speaker 1>boner pills.</v>

724
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

725
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:18.523
<v Speaker 1>these things have steroids in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a bunch of stuff and if you </v>

726
00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.960
<v Speaker 1>party wasn't the last thing he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>busted for cocaine or something.</v>

727
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 1>If you bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do cocaine,</v>

728
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys take these because you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hard off of having cocaine.</v>

729
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.010
<v Speaker 1>And so if he takes boner pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's.</v>

730
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Gonna is a little too much speculation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for respect.</v>

731
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.333
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to step out of this </v>

732
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:42.230
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither confirm nor deny.</v>

733
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Take turns into a werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starts chasing us around the rope.</v>

734
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.570
<v Speaker 1>It just lays his dick out on the domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

735
00:33:53.571 --> 00:33:55.860
<v Speaker 1>What would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need,</v>

736
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.270
<v Speaker 1>this one has a Hologram of a rhino and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he turned it.</v>

737
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.910
<v Speaker 1>It turns into a but at one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

738
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm at the gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>

739
00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:07.250
<v Speaker 1>What are the good ones and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad ones?</v>

740
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.263
<v Speaker 1>How do you know what to take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've come to the conclusion that if it </v>

741
00:34:09.801 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>has a rhinoceros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works in.</v>

742
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.930
<v Speaker 1>The great thing if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky,</v>

743
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:15.764
<v Speaker 1>lived in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City has these bodegas </v>

744
00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:18.944
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have them and they have older </v>

745
00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:20.924
<v Speaker 1>product which is usually stronger </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people died from them or like </v>

746
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a giant heart on </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught,</v>

747
00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we keep talking about this,</v>

748
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:34.940
<v Speaker 1>but we need to fucking run a test here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and find out what.</v>

749
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.793
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to take it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm thinking about doing is </v>

750
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:39.250
<v Speaker 1>taking it to a laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

751
00:34:39.251 --> 00:34:40.084
<v Speaker 1>there you find out what's in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want the fucking Chinese </v>

752
00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:45.890
<v Speaker 1>triad to be asking me like some shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mickey rourke not.</v>

753
00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:47.420
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't even say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look good.</v>

754
00:34:47.421 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 1>One Year of the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a great movie.</v>

755
00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going for comic effect.</v>

756
00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I had to check myself a reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just.</v>

757
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening.</v>

758
00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm Pro Rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

759
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:00.940
<v Speaker 1>You want to solve these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They work,</v>

760
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.760
<v Speaker 1>they're great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't take it.</v>

761
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:07.130
<v Speaker 1>The black cat ones or any of the cat </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones because those ones actually made me</v>

762
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:12.310
<v Speaker 1>see visually and stuff and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like blood pressure or something.</v>

763
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:14.714
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's all fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't take those because that fucks </v>

764
00:35:16.551 --> 00:35:18.200
<v Speaker 1>with your blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty hardcore.</v>

765
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

766
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.100
<v Speaker 1>don't take risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he tells you don't take it.</v>

767
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Don't take it folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

768
00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you think your </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance is.</v>

769
00:35:27.111 --> 00:35:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Eli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think you have the same tolerance</v>

770
00:35:29.511 --> 00:35:31.220
<v Speaker 1>is red band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're incorrect.</v>

771
00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got you.</v>

772
00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.390

<v Speaker 1>it kind of rage.</v>

773
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 1>They were the ones that have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids</v>

774
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.110
<v Speaker 2>in them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've found.</v>

775
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.013
<v Speaker 2>I think most of them have steroids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell the difference which those </v>

776
00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 2>because you immediately want to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

777

<v Speaker 2>You're not only getting hard.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the different ingredients that were in </v>

781
00:35:57.721 --> 00:36:00.300
<v Speaker 2>these things that a guy broke it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they do to you.</v>

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.373
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a few.</v>

783
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately that guy doesn't.</v>

784
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.120
<v Speaker 2>He's only talking about what's on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

785
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Like what they're saying that's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

786
00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:09.613
<v Speaker 2>testing tested it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if anybody's ever actually </v>

787
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:14.720

<v Speaker 4>Hey Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of giving me,</v>

861
00:39:31.321 --> 00:39:33.030
<v Speaker 4>we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll just give me a biography,</v>

862
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.060
<v Speaker 4>but I try it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even close.</v>

863
00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.230
<v Speaker 4>Not even close to that.</v>

864
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not even close to them</v>

865
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:43.360
<v Speaker 4>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This little store bought the rhino seven</v>

866
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.990
<v Speaker 4>way better than a Viagra or any of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

867
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.313
<v Speaker 3>So it's what you think is probably like </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids and maybe like amphetamines or </v>

868
00:39:50.691 --> 00:39:51.940
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd swole,</v>

<v Speaker 3>will you take one of these?</v>

873
00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.550
<v Speaker 3>We take one of these home and take one </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that doesn't seem like a good idea.</v>

874
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:11.783
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck is in those </v>

<v Speaker 3>the South Pacific.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what the difference is?</v>

880
00:40:25.251 --> 00:40:26.084
<v Speaker 3>Batch to batch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no quality control like this is </v>

881
00:40:28.881 --> 00:40:31.010
<v Speaker 3>the wild west shit in your body.</v>

<v Speaker 1>much as you can,</v>

884
00:40:38.461 --> 00:40:40.700
<v Speaker 1>but if you eat at restaurants you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really know.</v>

885
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.330
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the worst.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't need for anything,</v>

888
00:40:46.261 --> 00:40:47.094
<v Speaker 1>but I eat shitty food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like eat whatever you want to </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

892
00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't like seafood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you eat like a monster or a great </v>

893
00:40:55.291 --> 00:40:57.570
<v Speaker 1>metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've always had a crazy metabolism,</v>

894
00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:00.720
<v Speaker 1>but I like candy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd eat Swedish fish and think,</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had fish for dinner and what I mean </v>

<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

897
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Cake cookies while I'm at it took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>boner pill.</v>

898
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.810
<v Speaker 1>You feel uncomfortable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

899
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.030
<v Speaker 1>One of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

900
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what we should put on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what happens next and they</v>

901
00:41:14.971 --> 00:41:17.190
<v Speaker 1>give me shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

902
00:41:17.191 --> 00:41:18.030
<v Speaker 1>That came out wrong.</v>

903
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:23.320
<v Speaker 4>So somebody gave me a Viagra or cialis </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the blue one.</v>

904
00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:26.410
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a Viagra and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know when to take it,</v>

905
00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:30.130
<v Speaker 4>so I put it in my Zantex container.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zantac is for heartburn,</v>

906
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.990
<v Speaker 4>Xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zantac,</v>

907
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:33.590
<v Speaker 4>Zantac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

908
00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

909
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fly with this pill in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets.</v>

910
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just putting my Zantac for God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

911
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:42.370
<v Speaker 1>My girlfriend took it by mistake </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking Zantac and she said that she.</v>

912
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:43.640
<v Speaker 1>She did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She felt weird,</v>

913
00:41:43.641 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 1>like I like felt tingly and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

914
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't do anything but it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Zantac.</v>

915
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if she went to work and got </v>
<v Speaker 1>popped for steroids,</v>

916
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she had a job at ups or something </v>

917
00:41:56.211 --> 00:41:58.940
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and navigate your urine sample,</v>

918
00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:00.650

<v Speaker 1>Your pants were swelling up.</v>

920

<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just.</v>

923
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.320
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said it was kind of tingly,</v>

924
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.790
<v Speaker 1>not a moose knuckle but a horse's foot.</v>

925
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 1>It was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this.</v>

926
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Moose knuckle is a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

927
00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.040
<v Speaker 1>That is a fun thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

928
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you don't,</v>

929
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.710
<v Speaker 1>if you don't think that Moose knuckle is</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

930
00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:35.780
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're avoiding humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

931
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.960
<v Speaker 1>You're avoiding opportunities to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a good person at heart.</v>

932
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.273
<v Speaker 1>He really aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should check yourself all the way </v>

933
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:45.130
<v Speaker 1>through at all the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portland,</v>

934
00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:45.711
<v Speaker 1>Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

935
00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 1>how many people actually see a moose </v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckle?</v>

936
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Know what that looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had to have photos before it became a</v>

937
00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:53.540
<v Speaker 1>moose knuckle because it's not like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

938
00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Many people see a moose.</v>

939
00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:02.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a total loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a guy only on paper.</v>

940
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.980
<v Speaker 1>On paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

941
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.800
<v Speaker 1>But think about it like before </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling,</v>

942
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:12.620
<v Speaker 1>like I bet they would never call it </v>
<v Speaker 1>moose knuckle in the 18 hundreds because</v>

943
00:43:12.621 --> 00:43:15.080
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have any pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to see a moose.</v>

944
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women weren't allowed to wear pants that</v>

945
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.470
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like for the longest time.</v>

946
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:25.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's like an expression that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>prove like did not exist before the.</v>

947
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Because if you lived in New York in like</v>
<v Speaker 1>1830 and you said,</v>

948
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.030
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your moose knuckle.</v>

949
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:32.893
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck does a Moose knuckle look </v>

950
00:43:34.681 --> 00:43:35.960
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what.</v>

951
00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:36.853
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where would they look at a drawing with </v>

952
00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:39.454
<v Speaker 1>them and what they used to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a slave foot or maybe you loose </v>

953
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.980
<v Speaker 1>walking around because they weren't made</v>
<v Speaker 1>up back then,</v>

954
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.110
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think there were that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would see them.</v>

955
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.030
<v Speaker 1>If you live in a city like New York City</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in Maine,</v>

956
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

957
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.850
<v Speaker 1>you're just walking through my </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

958
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:58.400
<v Speaker 1>How many Moose though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it's not native to that much.</v>

959
00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have a large range in North </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

960
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:04.010
<v Speaker 1>It's got like the northern states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>

961
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Maine has moose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Hampshire.</v>

962
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.213
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing a sign watch out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the boost because they walk at their </v>

963
00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:11.720
<v Speaker 1>real tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit your car.</v>

964
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Could hit him or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified.</v>

965
00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:16.550
<v Speaker 1>It was the creepiest longest drive I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever did.</v>

966
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:18.820
<v Speaker 1>They're scary because you die when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit one of those.</v>

967
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.103
<v Speaker 1>Those those things kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then dear to deer deer kill 200 </v>

968
00:44:26.211 --> 00:44:29.090
<v Speaker 1>people a year in car accidents in just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

969
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 1>There was a ton I saw in Jersey a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks ago.</v>

970
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see deer.</v>

971
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I just saw the signs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was more than I've ever seen.</v>

972
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're everywhere.</v>

973
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was talking about deers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

974
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:43.550
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people looked.</v>

975
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:47.340
<v Speaker 3>It's because our predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've gotten rid of all the predators.</v>

976
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.713
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well let's just let some fucking hyenas </v>

977
00:44:50.641 --> 00:44:51.474
<v Speaker 3>and mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Louis take out all the back pain is a </v>

978
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:59.780
<v Speaker 3>mountain lions around your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking whack people are crazy.</v>

979
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:02.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

980
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.410
<v Speaker 3>I love crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time they.</v>

981
00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.320
<v Speaker 3>They're going a little too far with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy these days.</v>

982
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think like as a comedian like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>

983
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.700
<v Speaker 3>We need them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

984
00:45:11.701 --> 00:45:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>

985
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.080
<v Speaker 3>It's fun sometimes because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to push back against.</v>

986
00:45:16.081 --> 00:45:16.914
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because some of them are just so </v>

987
00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:21.300
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so regressive.</v>

988
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:24.360
<v Speaker 3>Trying to control people you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

989
00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:27.780
<v Speaker 3>You're not like open like an open and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerant person.</v>

990
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:28.614
<v Speaker 3>As someone who wants to communicate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between their ideas and your </v>

991
00:45:30.631 --> 00:45:33.080
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what's going on.</v>

992
00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:39.210
<v Speaker 3>Like joke about my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the most UN-PC person there is.</v>

993
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a lot,</v>

994
00:45:41.251 --> 00:45:46.251
<v Speaker 3>but he's at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think bad guys from that generation.</v>

995
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:49.620
<v Speaker 3>My nieces and nephews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the young ones that yell at him pop up.</v>

996
00:45:49.621 --> 00:45:51.010
<v Speaker 3>He can't talk like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

999
00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:57.840
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad has weapons everywhere.</v>

1000
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:01.680
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1001
00:46:01.681 --> 00:46:04.500
<v Speaker 3>like gun violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally went home.</v>

1002
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.680
<v Speaker 3>I was working on the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1003
00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:08.280
<v Speaker 3>and I went to a funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1004
00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:10.500
<v Speaker 3>my dad's brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my uncle Tom,</v>

1005
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.860
<v Speaker 3>his girlfriend died 88 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still what I'm saying.</v>

1006
00:46:13.861 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 3>It's taken rhino pills obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she,</v>

1007
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:18.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1008
00:46:18.031 --> 00:46:21.480
<v Speaker 3>So there was a funeral and then we went </v>
<v Speaker 3>to his house and he's this tough,</v>

1009
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.100
<v Speaker 3>tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a real,</v>

1010
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.510
<v Speaker 3>like he built bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he did with his life,</v>

1011
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:26.363
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a marine for years and he stood </v>

1012
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:28.944
<v Speaker 3>up to like look out the window and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>belt buckle with dangling and it said </v>

1013
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.633
<v Speaker 3>Nra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I forgot where I was from for a </v>

1014
00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:37.090
<v Speaker 3>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1015
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 3>these are the people that I grew up </v>
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>

1016
00:46:38.911 --> 00:46:40.860
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it never phased me,</v>

1017

<v Speaker 3>typewriter stores.</v>

1040
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 3>and then I started having flashbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1041
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:58.220
<v Speaker 3>why do I know how to read Spool Ribbon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wasn't I educated properly in line?</v>

1042
00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's it.</v>

1043
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:02.200
<v Speaker 3>All I know is typewriters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could fix your typewriter.</v>

1044
00:48:02.201 --> 00:48:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I could do everything is crazy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That laptop,</v>

1045
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.753
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you had to erase something you </v>

1046
00:48:07.991 --> 00:48:08.824
<v Speaker 3>had like the little white thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to sell though nine paint over it </v>

1047
00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:17.350
<v Speaker 3>and then you back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1048
00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.090
<v Speaker 3>go always back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mess it up.</v>

1049
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.070
<v Speaker 3>My Dad types with one finger.</v>

1050
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I would have never learned how to type </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't for video games.</v>

1051
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.343
<v Speaker 2>I learned how I learned how to type 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent so I could talk to people </v>

1052
00:48:30.131 --> 00:48:31.490
<v Speaker 2>quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good angle.</v>

1053
00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.473
<v Speaker 2>Playing quake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I learned how to type 100 </v>

1054
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:36.004
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

1055
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:39.260
<v Speaker 3>That's a good angle for people like well</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need typing now,</v>

1056
00:48:39.261 --> 00:48:41.450
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we had typing in high school because</v>

1057
00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:42.470
<v Speaker 3>especially women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1058
00:48:42.471 --> 00:48:43.221
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn to type.</v>

1059
00:48:43.221 --> 00:48:44.060
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to do anything else.</v>

1060
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I used to write all my stuff out long </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand until I started playing video games</v>

1061
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.640
<v Speaker 2>and when I started video games also want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start writing blogs.</v>

1062
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.863
<v Speaker 2>I didn't because I started like working </v>
<v Speaker 2>on figuring out how to type and I got </v>

1063
00:48:56.891 --> 00:48:58.840
<v Speaker 2>one of those Mavis Bacon things you ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that?</v>

1064
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like a game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got into video games.</v>

1065
00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe,</v>

1066
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's Mavis beacon teaches typing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1067
00:49:05.201 --> 00:49:06.034
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a typing program but it's a </v>

1068
00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:08.920
<v Speaker 2>video game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It and I grew up in a typo.</v>

1069
00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.540
<v Speaker 2>It's probably only for videos tutors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's awesome.</v>

1070
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:14.403
<v Speaker 2>It's like really a great way to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the things show up and you're </v>

1071
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 2>supposed to keep your hands in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

1072
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:21.930
<v Speaker 2>The perfect position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.010
<v Speaker 2>And then when the little things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving across,</v>

1074
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:24.844
<v Speaker 2>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to try to keep up with what's </v>

1075
00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:27.874
<v Speaker 2>being typed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to follow it underneath it and </v>

1076
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:34.060
<v Speaker 2>there's like games you play and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I sound like a spokesperson.</v>

1077
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.850
<v Speaker 2>That's how I learned to type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned to type you in that.</v>

1078
00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Can you do it without looking like are </v>
<v Speaker 3>you that good?</v>

1079
00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:42.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom's that person,</v>

1080
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:43.470
<v Speaker 3>but I don't do it totally correct.</v>

1081
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1082
00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I've probably had a hurt finger when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned,</v>

1083
00:49:47.391 --> 00:49:52.391
<v Speaker 2>so I lift up one of them or something or</v>
<v Speaker 2>use like four on one side and $3.</v>

1084
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely like an odd duck.</v>

1085
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.920
<v Speaker 3>I remember they used to yell like in </v>
<v Speaker 3>typing class,</v>

1086
00:49:58.921 --> 00:50:00.260
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you use your pinkies,</v>

1087
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.550
<v Speaker 3>these pitches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pitches and not cooperative.</v>

1088
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:04.960
<v Speaker 3>They don't work the way you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1089
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:09.570
<v Speaker 3>don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to use the other finger.</v>

1090
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:12.930
<v Speaker 3>My pinkies are so uncooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little toes.</v>

1091
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.520
<v Speaker 3>But these fingers like I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

1092
00:50:14.521 --> 00:50:15.420
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just give it a base to it,</v>

1093
00:50:15.421 --> 00:50:16.410
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know what the fuck are you</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing?</v>

00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:18.074
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit ass guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people just can't help it or get </v>

1155
00:53:20.661 --> 00:53:21.230
<v Speaker 2>into the message.</v>

1156
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.063
<v Speaker 2>What's my message?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll look.</v>

1157
00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Got another message over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1158
00:53:24.711 --> 00:53:26.870
<v Speaker 2>They were about to have trump other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1159
00:53:26.871 --> 00:53:27.704
<v Speaker 2>Some people are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people that are flat out 100 </v>

1160
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:34.830
<v Speaker 2>percent attached to that phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is step one.</v>

1161
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Eleanor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is step one.</v>

1162
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:39.720
<v Speaker 2>APP addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't stop.</v>

1163
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:40.613
<v Speaker 2>This is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is different than the phone thing </v>

1164
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:44.363
<v Speaker 2>is different because if you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that you wanted to say that phones </v>

1165
00:53:47.221 --> 00:53:50.650
<v Speaker 2>are a drug and addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1166
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.350
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to sort out the consequences.</v>

1167
00:53:53.351 --> 00:53:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Like what are the consequences of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug?</v>

1168
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.213
<v Speaker 2>We don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the consequences of coffee are </v>

1169
00:53:57.931 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 2>pretty mundane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no big deal.</v>

1170
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

1171
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:00.953
<v Speaker 2>you get fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This might be the most addictive drug </v>

1172
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:05.370
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if it was a drug,</v>

1173
00:54:05.371 --> 00:54:07.700
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't an object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

1174
00:54:07.701 --> 00:54:08.534
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what drug do you walk down the street </v>

1175
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:14.130
<v Speaker 2>and you see everyone on every one </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding their phone,</v>

1176
00:54:14.131 --> 00:54:14.990
<v Speaker 2>looking at their phone.</v>

1177
00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:18.780
<v Speaker 2>When you're looking down street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might see 40,</v>

1178
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:21.510
<v Speaker 2>50 percent of the people holding a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

1179
00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is obviously it's a device,</v>

1180
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:27.143
<v Speaker 2>but let's just classify it as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsession or as something that you're a </v>

1181
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:32.963
<v Speaker 2>fixation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps something that is just </v>

1182
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:36.023
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly influential in the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you pay so much attention to it in </v>

1183
00:54:39.661 --> 00:54:40.494
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is more of a lover than anyone </v>

1184
00:54:43.261 --> 00:54:44.094
<v Speaker 2>you've ever known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if this fucking thing is with you </v>

1185
00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:49.500
<v Speaker 2>while you shit with you all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>companions,</v>

1186
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.353
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't trump sex like I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After you can't try this girl trying to </v>

1187
00:54:54.961 --> 00:54:55.794
<v Speaker 2>get some good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I don't know what's going to </v>

1188
00:54:57.051 --> 00:54:57.680
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1189
00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.680
<v Speaker 4>Were you already feeling towards me </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at her for so long that you have</v>

1190
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:12.750
<v Speaker 4>pathways carved in your anatomy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know Him with the ceiling Pokemon,</v>

1191
00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:15.920
<v Speaker 4>the pokemon games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taking it to the next level because when</v>

1192
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:17.860
<v Speaker 4>I explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>explain what's going on.</v>

1193
00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:20.980
<v Speaker 4>The easiest way to say web pokemon is it</v>
<v Speaker 4>takes Google maps.</v>

1194
00:55:20.981 --> 00:55:21.814
<v Speaker 4>You have to sign into Google.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes Google maps and all the </v>

1195
00:55:23.891 --> 00:55:27.790
<v Speaker 4>information that's in Google maps and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes it the level of video game.</v>

1196
00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:31.180
<v Speaker 4>So instead of playing a level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're playing your own street,</v>

1197
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:33.820
<v Speaker 4>you're finding you're finding creatures </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your house.</v>

1198
00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.550
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so yeah.</v>

1199
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.460
<v Speaker 4>So then there's places like churches are</v>
<v Speaker 4>called Jim's.</v>

1200
00:55:39.461 --> 00:55:40.294
<v Speaker 4>That's where you go and if you go to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>church you can train your fighter to be </v>

1201
00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:45.154
<v Speaker 4>stronger and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're using real world places and </v>

1202
00:55:49.841 --> 00:55:52.840
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like landmarks and you're finding things</v>

1203
00:55:52.841 --> 00:55:54.310
<v Speaker 4>that like water fountains.</v>

1204
00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:57.070
<v Speaker 4>Like if you go to the water fountain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of coins there.</v>

1205
00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.053
<v Speaker 4>So it's using the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's crazy is like if you're at </v>

1206
00:56:00.101 --> 00:56:04.120
<v Speaker 4>the comedy store it on Google maps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can upload your own photos,</v>

1207
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1208
00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.360
<v Speaker 4>like I was at the comedy store on Google</v>
<v Speaker 4>maps,</v>

1209
00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.493
<v Speaker 4>so it pulls that information also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're playing the game you'll be </v>

1210
00:56:11.921 --> 00:56:12.311
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1211
00:56:12.311 --> 00:56:16.330
<v Speaker 4>there's Andy Kaufman sign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we go to the Andy Kaufman sign,</v>

1212
00:56:16.331 --> 00:56:20.320
<v Speaker 4>we can get some treasures and it shows </v>
<v Speaker 4>you the Andy Kaufman signed in the video</v>

1213
00:56:20.321 --> 00:56:22.420
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's the crazy thing,</v>

1214
00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:23.523
<v Speaker 4>in one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like two days it's almost every single </v>

1215
00:56:25.721 --> 00:56:30.721
<v Speaker 4>person has downloaded and played it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the crazy thing I was thinking of is how</v>

1216
00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:34.300
<v Speaker 4>awesome is it that it's connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Google and we're sending,</v>

1217
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:35.203
<v Speaker 4>because it opens your camera at parts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the game when you're battling and it's </v>

1218
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:41.230
<v Speaker 4>scanning your room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your houses,</v>

1219
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:43.150
<v Speaker 4>and it's sending it to google.</v>

1220
00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:44.183
<v Speaker 4>So this is like the best way that Google</v>
<v Speaker 4>is now getting a complete map of our </v>

1221
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:48.514
<v Speaker 4>house inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's scanning every street in </v>

1222
00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:53.704
<v Speaker 4>like one year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your Google is going to be able to see </v>

1223
00:56:56.050 --> 00:57:01.050
<v Speaker 4>every single inch of it every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>place inside and outside because of this</v>

1224
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:02.140
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long has it been out?</v>

1225
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:03.760
<v Speaker 4>Like three days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three days already.</v>

1226
00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm more phones on android than tinder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's about to pass up twitter.</v>

1227
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:08.103
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think we should bring </v>

1228
00:57:08.951 --> 00:57:10.510
<v Speaker 4>typewriters back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1229
00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:11.403
<v Speaker 4>And no one's thinking about this though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just opening our camera and </v>

1230
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:17.020
<v Speaker 4>recording our rooms and sending it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>google.</v>

1231
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.233
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This real gentle yoga poses looking up </v>

1232
00:57:21.761 --> 00:57:23.290
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew we were going to talk about us.</v>

1233
00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:25.180
<v Speaker 4>I pulled up some stuff already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a,</v>

1234
00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:26.373
<v Speaker 4>the interesting thing that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it being on open gps maps as those </v>

1235
00:57:29.411 --> 00:57:30.760
<v Speaker 4>places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those locations,</v>

1236
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:31.953
<v Speaker 4>like there's a guy's home that's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>turned into one of these gyms and he's </v>

1237
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:35.103
<v Speaker 4>like mad that people are showing up </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of his place because he bought </v>

1238
00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:41.440
<v Speaker 4>an old church and so churches in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game automatically become Jim.</v>

1239
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.540
<v Speaker 4>So people are hanging outside of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>house now.</v>

1240
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:47.200
<v Speaker 4>But also interesting things like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>has happened where the West Westboro,</v>

1241
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 4>Westboro Baptist Church has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>overtaken by a gay friendly pokemon.</v>

1242
00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.073
<v Speaker 4>So people were like kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know necessarily trolling them </v>

1243
00:57:54.101 --> 00:57:57.040
<v Speaker 4>and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then,</v>

1244
00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:57.963
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so by walking around and looking for </v>

1245
00:57:59.321 --> 00:58:01.980
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a teenager found dead body somewhere and</v>

1246
00:58:01.981 --> 00:58:02.814
<v Speaker 4>just three days they've already been </v>
<v Speaker 4>dead body found by teenager hunting </v>

1247
00:58:06.911 --> 00:58:08.020
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pokemon.</v>

1248
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She found it underneath the bridge.</v>

1249
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.713
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This last part I was trying to get a </v>

1250
00:58:14.411 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pokemon wiggins told CNN instead,</v>

1251
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 4>she made the alarming and alarming </v>
<v Speaker 4>discovery,</v>

1252
00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:22.690
<v Speaker 4>a dead body close to the Wyoming </v>
<v Speaker 4>highway.</v>

1253
00:58:22.691 --> 00:58:23.524
<v Speaker 4>Seven 89 bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably would have never went down </v>

1254
00:58:26.141 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 4>there if it weren't for this game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She admitted,</v>

1255
00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:29.183
<v Speaker 4>but the scary incident isn't deterring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her wigans says she will continue to </v>

1256
00:58:32.891 --> 00:58:36.340
<v Speaker 4>play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw somebody playing on the highway on</v>

1257
00:58:36.341 --> 00:58:37.000
<v Speaker 4>the way here.</v>

1258
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:37.833
<v Speaker 4>I saw somebody playing on the highway </v>
<v Speaker 4>last plastics bad enough we don't need </v>

1259
00:58:40.661 --> 00:58:43.120
<v Speaker 4>the last night when I was waiting for my</v>
<v Speaker 4>uber at my house,</v>

1260
00:58:43.121 --> 00:58:46.240
<v Speaker 4>I just three minutes I saw two different</v>
<v Speaker 4>groups of kids,</v>

1261
00:58:46.241 --> 00:58:48.340
<v Speaker 4>like one on skateboards and one on </v>
<v Speaker 4>bikes.</v>

1262
00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 4>Just playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's scary is like on that article</v>

1263
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.843
<v Speaker 4>now armed robbers are robbing people at </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain places in the game because they </v>

1264
00:58:56.621 --> 00:58:59.710
<v Speaker 4>know the kids are going to be there with</v>
<v Speaker 4>like new phones like I phones and stuff.</v>

1265
00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.140
<v Speaker 4>So they're waiting at certain places </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out,</v>

1266
00:59:02.141 --> 00:59:02.974
<v Speaker 4>stealing our phones and because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>allows players to drop a lower module </v>

1267
00:59:08.081 --> 00:59:13.081
<v Speaker 4>and a real world location to attract </v>
<v Speaker 4>high numbers of Pokemon for 30 minutes.</v>

1268
00:59:13.631 --> 00:59:14.464
<v Speaker 4>The lure modules have reportedly also </v>
<v Speaker 4>been used by business owners to bring </v>

1269
00:59:17.681 --> 00:59:20.260
<v Speaker 4>people to their stores.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1270
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:21.333
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1271
00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.160
<v Speaker 4>so this is the next level?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1272
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:26.480
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what starts the next level,</v>

1273
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:30.140
<v Speaker 4>this kind of thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next level of what's that Internet,</v>

1274
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.490
<v Speaker 4>augmented reality that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take over and it's also scanning.</v>

1275
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:35.324
<v Speaker 4>Just like snapchat scanned all our faces</v>
<v Speaker 4>using all these filters now and they </v>

1276
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:39.680
<v Speaker 4>have perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could three d model.</v>

1277
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:42.970
<v Speaker 4>All our faces now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we we've been scanning are faced</v>

1278
00:59:42.971 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 4>with now they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're scanning the whole entire United</v>

1279
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have maps of everything</v>

1280
00:59:47.601 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 4>inside and outside in like less than a </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

1281
00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.213
<v Speaker 2>Didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think though that eventually that </v>

1282
00:59:52.991 --> 00:59:55.470
<v Speaker 2>that was going to be inevitable and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to be unavoidable.</v>

1283
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.130
<v Speaker 2>There's the technology's gonna dissolve </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the windows.</v>

1284
00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Well this is the next is dissolving in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the windows.</v>

1285
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.633
<v Speaker 2>That's also fascinating that it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>augmented reality like that's what got </v>

1286
01:00:07.591 --> 01:00:10.890
<v Speaker 2>everybody in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the augmented reality is what snuck</v>

1287
01:00:10.891 --> 01:00:13.320
<v Speaker 2>everybody in and then everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1288
01:00:13.321 --> 01:00:15.430
<v Speaker 2>let's play a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm part of the game.</v>

1289
01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:16.323
<v Speaker 2>Then you're completely sucked into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>very bizarre new world where you're </v>

1290
01:00:21.901 --> 01:00:25.740
<v Speaker 2>playing a game but wrapped around your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own actual environment.</v>

1291
01:00:25.741 --> 01:00:26.160
<v Speaker 2>What do you.</v>

1292
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.730
<v Speaker 4>This guy owns the gym of that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>

<v Speaker 4>technically,</v>

1294
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.290
<v Speaker 4>and it can be stolen or taken there.</v>

1295
01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Woohoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met the owner of my gym.</v>

1296
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1297
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1298
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:47.170

<v Speaker 2>please don't tell anybody where I live,</v>

1299
01:00:47.171 --> 01:00:48.640
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get away from my apartment.</v>

1300
01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.673
<v Speaker 2>They're going to get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those pokemon people are going to get </v>

1301
01:00:52.021 --> 01:00:52.740
<v Speaker 2>sued.</v>

1302
01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.573
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be a lot of lawsuits </v>

1303
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:57.330
<v Speaker 4>about this game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's gonna be a lot of people dying.</v>

1304
01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the way here,</v>

1305
01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:00.234
<v Speaker 4>I saw somebody using it while driving </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that dead body with somebody </v>

1306
01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:05.394
<v Speaker 4>trying to get a water pokemon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was probably somebody murdered or a </v>

1307
01:01:10.231 --> 01:01:11.310
<v Speaker 4>homeless person?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1308
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.590
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could have been under that.</v>

1309
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Where's the water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Up with somebody.</v>

1310
01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you find something,</v>

1311
01:01:19.651 --> 01:01:21.720
<v Speaker 2>find like a water law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>

1312
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:23.390
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1313
01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:26.120
<v Speaker 4>It's an alert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this thing that you can drop on the</v>

1314
01:01:26.121 --> 01:01:28.670
<v Speaker 4>ground and so did someone drop it where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the home was,</v>

1315
01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.110
<v Speaker 4>where the dead person was?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1316
01:01:30.111 --> 01:01:33.140
<v Speaker 4>she was just searching for pokemon go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of.</v>

1317
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.920
<v Speaker 4>It reminds me of like when you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1318
01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.620
<v Speaker 4>bicycle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bicycle,</v>

1319
01:01:36.621 --> 01:01:38.720
<v Speaker 4>inner going around your neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like playing adventure,</v>

1320
01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:40.490
<v Speaker 4>like looking at things and finding </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1321
01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:41.443
<v Speaker 4>It's Kinda like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes you kind of go out in your </v>

1322
01:01:42.591 --> 01:01:45.860
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood and look at stuff like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know that there was like a buddha</v>

1323
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:49.790
<v Speaker 4>across the street and like this forest </v>
<v Speaker 4>by my house and I found out by this game</v>

1324
01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:51.020
<v Speaker 4>because it was like go here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1325
01:01:51.021 --> 01:01:55.280
<v Speaker 4>there's some stuff here and so it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of cool because it shows you around your</v>

1326
01:01:55.281 --> 01:01:57.860
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood and stuff like that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you might've not known.</v>

1327
01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:58.873
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like that old game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a geo tagging game that people used to </v>

1328
01:02:01.461 --> 01:02:02.294
<v Speaker 4>play where it's like go to these </v>
<v Speaker 4>coordinates and you'll find like a </v>

1329
01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:07.710
<v Speaker 4>president and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to got really cynical go.</v>

1330
01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:08.873
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like some sort of an alien </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to you going move around your </v>

1331
01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:15.810
<v Speaker 4>coordinates and take photographs of </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything so perfectly.</v>

1332
01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:16.883
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting to see what </v>

1333
01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:20.550
<v Speaker 4>businesses or businesses are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like dairy queen,</v>

1334
01:02:20.551 --> 01:02:21.384
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dropped something on the ground is like </v>

1335
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:26.200
<v Speaker 4>paying customers only can come here and </v>
<v Speaker 4>get pokemon.</v>

1336
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 4>So that's probably smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1337
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 4>that's smart for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine?</v>

1338
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in south philly.</v>

1339
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:34.643
<v Speaker 4>We didn't look at anything and if we saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>something we just kept walking to do </v>

1340
01:02:38.551 --> 01:02:39.384
<v Speaker 4>that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eleanor is no more slaves and you don't </v>

1341
01:02:41.611 --> 01:02:45.300
<v Speaker 4>have to ride a horse around taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures around my mom's neighborhood.</v>

1342
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:45.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1343
01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.673
<v Speaker 4>So let me explain to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because let me understand how this </v>

1344
01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:49.240
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

1345
01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.390
<v Speaker 4>you're playing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you're playing it,</v>

1346
01:02:51.391 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 4>like what are you seeing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you seeing on the ground right now?</v>

1347
01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:54.623
<v Speaker 4>I see nothing I'm looking around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see down the street there's </v>

1348
01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:58.763
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some cool places to get more coin or </v>

1349
01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 4>it's called pokey balls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you used to capture.</v>

1350
01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:06.290
<v Speaker 4>So these places exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How they just like,</v>

1351
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.250
<v Speaker 4>they just decided that the things are </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1352
01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.084
<v Speaker 4>It's random,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what they usually do is they take </v>

1353
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:11.784
<v Speaker 4>certain things in Google maps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all their churches are gyms where </v>

1354
01:03:14.281 --> 01:03:17.000
<v Speaker 4>you go to workout and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your pokemons.</v>

1355
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:18.143
<v Speaker 4>Then they take like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like things like the comedy store and </v>

1356
01:03:19.981 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 4>they put certain like they know it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>landmark,</v>

1357
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:23.940
<v Speaker 4>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

1358
01:03:23.941 --> 01:03:26.190
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like last night,</v>

1359
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:27.203
<v Speaker 4>if you go to the comedy store now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you haven't been there in a couple of </v>

1360
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:30.180
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every single person's playing,</v>

1361
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.680
<v Speaker 4>every single person working there is </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing.</v>

1362
01:03:31.681 --> 01:03:32.514
<v Speaker 4>Every comic is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's just out there on their </v>

1363
01:03:33.871 --> 01:03:36.330
<v Speaker 4>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's happened so quick.</v>

1364
01:03:36.331 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1365
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:38.430
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's huge man.</v>

1366
01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:39.264
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just heard about this like maybe two </v>

1367
01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:42.210
<v Speaker 4>days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two days ago,</v>

1368
01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:43.390
<v Speaker 4>I saw a couple of pictures</v>

1369
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:45.303
<v Speaker 5>on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This video of what someone made a fake </v>

1370
01:03:48.401 --> 01:03:49.234
<v Speaker 5>application.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I looked like this and it turned out to </v>

1371
01:03:50.621 --> 01:03:53.950
<v Speaker 5>be a really good idea that someone to </v>
<v Speaker 5>develop,</v>

1372
01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.270
<v Speaker 5>develop now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1373
01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.003
<v Speaker 4>overnight it's doing because it really </v>
<v Speaker 4>hits this nerve in your head of </v>

1374
01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:01.750
<v Speaker 4>collecting things and when you're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1375
01:04:01.751 --> 01:04:02.970
<v Speaker 4>look what I have collected and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>

1376
01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:03.843
<v Speaker 4>where have collectively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's the perfect thing to do when </v>

1377
01:04:05.381 --> 01:04:07.120
<v Speaker 4>you're bored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was in an uber.</v>

1378
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:09.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm just sitting there while we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving by the Hollywood bowl and like,</v>

1379
01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.860
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1392
01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:44.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're walking around explaining this</v>

1393
01:04:44.741 --> 01:04:46.390
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at this person holding their</v>

1394
01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:51.391
<v Speaker 4>hand up so they're walking around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have like a phone open where the.</v>

1395
01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.440
<v Speaker 4>They see the image of what's in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1396
01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:56.080
<v Speaker 4>The pokemon stuff is just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>floating around.</v>

1397
01:04:56.110 --> 01:04:57.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1398
01:04:57.431 --> 01:04:59.290
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you could grow eggs,</v>

1399
01:04:59.291 --> 01:05:00.124
<v Speaker 4>you can share or you can train your </v>
<v Speaker 4>characters to be stronger and then you </v>

1400
01:05:03.851 --> 01:05:06.320
<v Speaker 4>can battle other characters at gyms and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1401
01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:09.820
<v Speaker 4>and this is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just the first version.</v>

1402
01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:10.683
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1403
01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:14.590
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be adding so much to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and what's interesting to note,</v>

1404
01:05:14.591 --> 01:05:19.240
<v Speaker 4>I heard a rumor maybe that the new grand</v>
<v Speaker 4>theft auto is going to be doing the same</v>

1405
01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:20.074
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're going to be playing grand </v>

1406
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:21.634
<v Speaker 4>theft auto using google maps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're going to be at your house and </v>

1407
01:05:23.531 --> 01:05:27.250
<v Speaker 4>your house is going to your house and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just the beginning of this whole</v>

1408
01:05:27.251 --> 01:05:31.320
<v Speaker 4>idea of taking Google's information and </v>
<v Speaker 4>giving the people outside.</v>

1409
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.823
<v Speaker 4>Good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things is that they're </v>

1410
01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:38.560
<v Speaker 4>already saying that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are like kids are complaining about sore</v>

1411
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:43.561
<v Speaker 4>legs and like maybe this will be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>video game that people,</v>

1412
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.100
<v Speaker 4>people who are addicted to video games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:49.503
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the only positive thing I see my </v>

1414
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.100
<v Speaker 4>neurologist hanging around playing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

1415
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is insane.</v>

1416
01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.093
<v Speaker 4>This is like the comedy store than </v>
<v Speaker 4>comicon in San Diego is going to be a </v>

1417
01:05:59.141 --> 01:05:59.974
<v Speaker 4>zoo with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot about stuff like that is </v>

1418
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.083
<v Speaker 4>fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'll just look at her </v>

1419
01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.380
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that from being sore?</v>

1420
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.470
<v Speaker 4>I also heard that they banned it in San </v>
<v Speaker 4>Francisco,</v>

1421
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.110
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't looked to see if that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>true or not.</v>

1422
01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.720
<v Speaker 4>Like some cities are actually banning it</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people are not paying attention.</v>

1423
01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:24.170
<v Speaker 4>Just going into traffic and there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably a lot of them on the four.</v>

1424
01:06:24.171 --> 01:06:25.004
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five today.</v>

1425
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.983
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw somebody.</v>

1426
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:28.210
<v Speaker 4>If you think about it,</v>

1427
01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:32.740
<v Speaker 2>probably just the next step in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're eventually going to get,</v>

1428
01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:36.460
<v Speaker 2>which is some sort of a reality that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can manipulate all the time.</v>

1429
01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.573
<v Speaker 2>Like this is one part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna have little games in the </v>

1430
01:06:39.341 --> 01:06:41.920
<v Speaker 2>regular reality but you have to look </v>
<v Speaker 2>through your phone to see it,</v>

1431
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:45.670
<v Speaker 2>but how long before that's glasses that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wearing like that Microsoft shit.</v>

1432
01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.580
<v Speaker 2>What was already coming up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it called again?</v>

1433
01:06:48.581 --> 01:06:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Magic leap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>

1434
01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:51.523
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the Google one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft Hollow Lens is are they both </v>

1435
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:58.990
<v Speaker 2>with goggles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both augmented reality bit there.</v>

1436
01:06:58.991 --> 01:06:59.824
<v Speaker 2>Both developed around augmented reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>and supposedly magically is supposed to </v>

1437
01:07:02.321 --> 01:07:03.730
<v Speaker 2>be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say better,</v>

1438
01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:07.660
<v Speaker 2>but so no one likes regular reality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>come on if you have a pair of glasses.</v>

1439
01:07:07.661 --> 01:07:10.480
<v Speaker 2>If you just put on a pair of glasses </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you put on a pair,</v>

1440
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.373
<v Speaker 2>like they live style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Jesus Christ they live is going </v>

1441
01:07:13.301 --> 01:07:14.134
<v Speaker 2>to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put on a pair of glasses and then </v>

1442
01:07:17.021 --> 01:07:21.590
<v Speaker 2>you see and you see all kinds of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit what you could use but,</v>

1443
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:25.560
<v Speaker 2>but imagine but you can see real part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this morning</v>

1444
01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:28.660
<v Speaker 4>dragons if you want to like constantly.</v>

1445
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:29.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was google glass or you have a </v>

1446
01:07:32.361 --> 01:07:33.051
<v Speaker 2>pair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1447
01:07:33.051 --> 01:07:33.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1448
01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.140
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the one I saw.</v>

1449
01:07:36.141 --> 01:07:36.974
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing something with the UFC back </v>

1450
01:07:39.141 --> 01:07:40.520
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shogun and Chael Sonnen.</v>

1451
01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:41.863
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing something with the USC </v>

1452
01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:43.424
<v Speaker 2>and they wanted to get footage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed some three 60 rigs going </v>

1453
01:07:46.491 --> 01:07:47.870
<v Speaker 2>around this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what,</v>

1454
01:07:47.871 --> 01:07:49.610
<v Speaker 2>what they're gonna do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just noticed that they were,</v>

1455
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:50.503
<v Speaker 2>there are people walking out with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters and then I noticed during the </v>

1456
01:07:52.671 --> 01:07:55.550
<v Speaker 2>fights it was kind of like planted </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere near the ring.</v>

1457
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:56.803
<v Speaker 2>If you ever want to talk to the guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and be happy to introduce you </v>

1458
01:07:59.151 --> 01:08:02.090
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the best.</v>

1459
01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:04.880
<v Speaker 2>They know what the fuck to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of crazy stuff they've</v>

1460
01:08:04.881 --> 01:08:06.840
<v Speaker 2>tried before that they don't do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1461
01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're doing four k now too.</v>

1462

<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1478
01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.790
<v Speaker 4>I tried it out the other day </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>

1479
01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:53.601
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

01:08:53.601 --> 01:08:54.434
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the one thing that's gonna save </v>

1481
01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:56.414
<v Speaker 4>corn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because after watching it I felt way </v>

1482
01:08:58.431 --> 01:09:00.410
<v Speaker 4>more connected to the girl in the sex.</v>

1483
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.390
<v Speaker 4>It was way better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a masturbation environment and that</v>

1484
01:09:05.391 --> 01:09:06.224
<v Speaker 4>in music videos like his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've seen Jamie's </v>

1485
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:11.180
<v Speaker 4>friend Cameron Gray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you saying way more connected,</v>

1486
01:09:11.181 --> 01:09:14.330
<v Speaker 4>so you felt it wasn't like you were just</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching porn.</v>

1487
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:15.830
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

1488
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm more closer to this girl now because</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I could look at the girl's feet if I</v>

1489
01:09:20.211 --> 01:09:22.100
<v Speaker 4>wanted it to or I could look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the,</v>

1490
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1491
01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:26.373
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like I was more like after I was </v>

1492
01:09:28.521 --> 01:09:29.690
<v Speaker 4>done I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy cow.</v>

1493
01:09:29.691 --> 01:09:33.050
<v Speaker 4>I felt way closer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a way,</v>

1494
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.003
<v Speaker 4>a better step up in porn music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>music videos to like his buddy Kevin </v>

1495
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.410
<v Speaker 4>Gray has a free app that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>download a and it's like you're watching</v>

1496
01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.750
<v Speaker 4>this music video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you could look in the back seat</v>

1497
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:46.140
<v Speaker 4>and see what's going on in the back </v>
<v Speaker 4>seat.</v>

1498
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.053
<v Speaker 4>There's like all these different </v>
<v Speaker 4>storylines going on all around and it's </v>

1499
01:09:50.571 --> 01:09:52.970
<v Speaker 4>so cool if you haven't seen this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his friend is,</v>

1500
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.610
<v Speaker 4>has an amazing music video on the APP </v>
<v Speaker 4>store.</v>

1501
01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:57.110
<v Speaker 4>Cameron Gray.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1502
01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:58.170
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1503
01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:00.320
<v Speaker 4>I think they're probably gonna do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>with comedy shows too,</v>

1504
01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:01.154
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1505
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:02.323
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what when you seeing that </v>

1506
01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:06.980
<v Speaker 4>stuff that the UFC there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably will have it where you can</v>

1507
01:10:06.981 --> 01:10:10.580
<v Speaker 4>just sit there and watch a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights and you can look around.</v>

1508
01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 4>You could see like dns sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could see you yelling.</v>

1509
01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.950
<v Speaker 4>You know what it might be to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1510
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm just just total speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it might be the.</v>

1511
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:19.363
<v Speaker 4>Is this the switch to the halfway?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you move it to the halfway point </v>

1512
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:23.323
<v Speaker 4>that this part right here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in the backseat of a car or you're </v>

1513
01:10:26.251 --> 01:10:27.084
<v Speaker 4>in front seat of a car and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody like catching this right here </v>

1514
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 4>so you can look around and you could see</v>
<v Speaker 4>him get out of the car and you're like,</v>

1515
01:10:34.281 --> 01:10:35.240
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where did he go to?</v>

1516
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:36.840
<v Speaker 4>Broken glass?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1517
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:40.010
<v Speaker 4>he's getting something out of the trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's he getting out in the trunk?</v>

1518
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:44.070
<v Speaker 4>You could just look around and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>so cool.</v>

1519
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:47.330
<v Speaker 4>You could look forward to seeing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

1520
01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:52.610
<v Speaker 4>There's weird and there's camera and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like a lighting something on fire,</v>

1521
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 4>but it's neat to this as an a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

1522
01:10:56.421 --> 01:10:57.254
<v Speaker 4>This is the first step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seeing somebody like a music video do </v>

1523
01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:00.044
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a good example of like it takes </v>

1524
01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:04.070
<v Speaker 4>you to a different level of a music </v>
<v Speaker 4>video.</v>

1525
01:11:04.071 --> 01:11:04.904
<v Speaker 4>You're not watching a music video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to look at whatever you want in </v>

1526
01:11:07.521 --> 01:11:11.120
<v Speaker 4>this music video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the next level of immersion.</v>

1527
01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:12.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't believe that it's going to </v>

1528
01:11:13.621 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 4>take off</v>

1529
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>till they figure out how to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goggles smaller more easier.</v>

1530
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think.</v>

1531
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it.</v>

1532
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>What does a movie going to be like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this becomes the new thing?</v>

1533
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Because like we're used to seeing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to see a great movie,</v>

1534
01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see a raging bull,</v>

1535
01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:30.811
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1536
01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Will you sit down and you're watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>this great movie.</v>

1537
01:11:32.881 --> 01:11:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It all plays out right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

1538
01:11:35.081 --> 01:11:37.320
<v Speaker 1>when it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's all in your head,</v>

1539
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:38.223
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you still want to be around other </v>

1540
01:11:38.851 --> 01:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>people that are experiencing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like then is everybody walking around?</v>

1541
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody sees something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1542
01:11:44.851 --> 01:11:45.684
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gonna be awhile to ever </v>

1543
01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:48.594
<v Speaker 1>gets to movies if ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because if you have the goggles on </v>

1544
01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:53.760
<v Speaker 1>after a certain amount of time you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take them off.</v>

1545
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.230
<v Speaker 1>You're just done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know your eyes.</v>

1546
01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:56.970
<v Speaker 1>It's too much for your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes.</v>

1547
01:11:56.971 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that it's too much because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not good yet?</v>

1548
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:00.533
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that something they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>work around a little bit of that and a </v>

1549
01:12:02.821 --> 01:12:03.654
<v Speaker 1>little bit of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it really fucks with your </v>

1550
01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:07.733
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they say if you look with a shitty </v>

1551
01:12:09.961 --> 01:12:10.794
<v Speaker 1>binoculars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like bad for your eyes look shitty </v>

1552
01:12:13.051 --> 01:12:16.020
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of makes sense.</v>

1553
01:12:16.021 --> 01:12:18.240
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking through this lens at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this image,</v>

1554
01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.770
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be like Swarovski </v>
<v Speaker 1>crystal or some crazy shit.</v>

1555
01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:25.020
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to like free to be really clear for</v>

1556
01:12:25.021 --> 01:12:26.160
<v Speaker 1>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

1557
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Because it's straining like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I also has to be like 90 frames per</v>

1558
01:12:32.371 --> 01:12:35.520
<v Speaker 1>second or it has to be some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>frames per second or it makes you sick.</v>

1559
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 1>So like there's a video game that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out soon for,</v>

1560
01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:39.834
<v Speaker 1>I think x-box replace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget that is a virtual reality game </v>

1561
01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:43.374
<v Speaker 1>or when you wear goggles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have the frame speed up </v>

1562
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.820
<v Speaker 1>fast enough so people are just getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick immediately.</v>

1563
01:12:48.850 --> 01:12:52.980
<v Speaker 1>What I'm just thinking is like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good goggles are really good binoculars.</v>

1564
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:55.130
<v Speaker 1>They're real expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1565
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.153
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you think about how much </v>

1566
01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:04.230
<v Speaker 1>it costs just to buy a pair of </v>
<v Speaker 1>binoculars,</v>

1567
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.150
<v Speaker 1>like a really high end pair of </v>
<v Speaker 1>binoculars,</v>

1568
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:07.343
<v Speaker 1>I think about like how much more it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be for computer attached to that </v>

1569
01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:13.020
<v Speaker 1>thing and lucky to have it look really </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

1570
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the difference between like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a four k?</v>

1571
01:13:15.901 --> 01:13:16.734
<v Speaker 1>What does the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the resolution difference in </v>

1572
01:13:17.911 --> 01:13:22.530
<v Speaker 1>four K it's pretty much like for Hdtvs </v>
<v Speaker 1>make one,</v>

1573
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.930
<v Speaker 1>four k screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've heard that the um,</v>

1574
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.943
<v Speaker 1>is it o l e d that that's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like visual that's like saying nowadays </v>

1575
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:32.730
<v Speaker 1>like plasma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lcd,</v>

1576
01:13:32.731 --> 01:13:33.564
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's a kind of TV or kind of a </v>

1577
01:13:35.631 --> 01:13:36.420
<v Speaker 1>display.</v>

1578
01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.350
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1579
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>led is not anything special.</v>

1580
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:40.613
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just like one of the better </v>

1581
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:46.920
<v Speaker 1>organic led organically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've been told.</v>

1582
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Looks the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1583
01:13:48.811 --> 01:13:50.940
<v Speaker 1>From what I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do they make that in four k,</v>

1584
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:53.190
<v Speaker 1>200 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a weird world,</v>

1585
01:13:53.191 --> 01:13:57.030
<v Speaker 1>aren't we folks I'm waiting for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My TV dies.</v>

1586
01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:57.973
<v Speaker 1>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you give you a TV to like </v>

1587
01:14:00.421 --> 01:14:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Josh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1588
01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice TV.</v>

1589
01:14:03.631 --> 01:14:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1590
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to die so I have a reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a new TV.</v>

1591
01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still a top of the line.</v>

1592
01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have</v>

1593
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.530
<v Speaker 3>a back when they were awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were awesome.</v>

1594
01:14:14.531 --> 01:14:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Ten years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is the same TV.</v>

1598
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:25.510

<v Speaker 3>An old laptop you got laying around.</v>

1606
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:44.770
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1607
01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:45.604
<v Speaker 3>look at this piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just two years ago I got rid of the top </v>

1608
01:14:49.601 --> 01:14:52.130
<v Speaker 3>computer with the big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that called?</v>

1609
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:53.833
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tower.</v>

1610
01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:55.013
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even my boyfriend who doesn't get into </v>

1611
01:14:57.491 --> 01:14:58.324
<v Speaker 3>this at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1612
01:14:58.330 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your Shit's old.</v>

1613
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:03.130
<v Speaker 3>They still use it for like graphic </v>
<v Speaker 3>design and stuff.</v>

1614
01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:03.964
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with like do they still have great </v>

1615
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:08.980
<v Speaker 3>towers towers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's definitely.</v>

1616
01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:11.020
<v Speaker 3>Mine was like a PC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was old,</v>

1617
01:15:11.021 --> 01:15:12.100
<v Speaker 3>ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had a back.</v>

1618
01:15:12.101 --> 01:15:15.220
<v Speaker 3>That's how you seen that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That apple makes it look like a.</v>

1619
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Some sort of like an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>

1620
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:17.613
<v Speaker 3>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that thing called power as the </v>

1621
01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.770
<v Speaker 3>computer things to put my daddy out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

1622
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:26.450
<v Speaker 3>What did you call the Mac pro pro?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1623
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:27.303
<v Speaker 3>but it's like it's a piece of sculpture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you look at it like glue getting </v>

1624
01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.410
<v Speaker 3>bought up by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's weird is they sell that.</v>

1625
01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.273
<v Speaker 3>Would that be a bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they don't sell the display this </v>

1626
01:15:38.381 --> 01:15:39.214
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they sell that but they don't sell </v>

1627
01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.000
<v Speaker 3>display for it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1628
01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:45.580
<v Speaker 3>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Supposed to use the oldest play that you</v>

1629
01:15:45.581 --> 01:15:47.950
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they only want to repeat customers.</v>

1630
01:15:47.951 --> 01:15:48.784
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Price it out to like with the best </v>

1631
01:15:49.961 --> 01:15:51.980
<v Speaker 3>specs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how expensive this thing.</v>

1632
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:53.500
<v Speaker 3>Six hundred and 74 bucks.</v>

1633
01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.590
<v Speaker 3>That's why I've never heard of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>site.</v>

1634
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

1635
01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1636
01:15:57.250 --> 01:16:01.870
<v Speaker 3>I think the last time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like $10,000 or even more</v>

1637
01:16:01.871 --> 01:16:03.520
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the top of the line.</v>

1638
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Would someone use something like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1639
01:16:05.441 --> 01:16:07.220
<v Speaker 3>for like photoshop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>

1640
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:09.550
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>video editing,</v>

1641
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:10.384
<v Speaker 3>four k video editing video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like literally look at that beautiful </v>

1642
01:16:14.831 --> 01:16:16.120
<v Speaker 3>thing yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So beautiful.</v>

1643
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Built for creativity on an epic scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you said?</v>

1644
01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New power structure.</v>

1645
01:16:23.381 --> 01:16:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well come on man.</v>

1646
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:25.533
<v Speaker 3>You opened the top of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me if it doesn't look like </v>

1647
01:16:26.771 --> 01:16:29.770
<v Speaker 3>something Malians made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We found this on another planet.</v>

1648
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.570
<v Speaker 3>We'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1649
01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.613
<v Speaker 3>We found the motherland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This world life is created like a hover </v>

1650
01:16:36.941 --> 01:16:40.450
<v Speaker 3>around it or ship it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a daily folks.</v>

1651
01:16:40.451 --> 01:16:44.020
<v Speaker 3>We are in a fucking science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we really are,</v>

1652
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:48.600
<v Speaker 3>which is just creeping up on us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So slowly it was the um,</v>

1653
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:50.860
<v Speaker 3>what was it that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just showed acoustic levels?</v>

1654
01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Acoustic global media was so quiet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>clear,</v>

1655
01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:56.283
<v Speaker 3>but that was that animation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's printing it out now like </v>

1656
01:16:58.691 --> 01:17:02.110
<v Speaker 3>graphics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get six gigabytes dual amd,</v>

1657
01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.480
<v Speaker 3>a six fuck 10,000 patients looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and thank</v>

1658
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>you for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to monitor.</v>

1659
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.760
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a lot cheaper than board </v>
<v Speaker 1>or monitor with that.</v>

1660
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.560
<v Speaker 1>The difference between what that can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular Imac can do is just time or is</v>

1661
01:17:25.131 --> 01:17:26.420
<v Speaker 1>there anything that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can do that.</v>

1662
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just would not be able to do.</v>

1663
01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:29.173
<v Speaker 5>It's mostly speed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but because of the video card it has to </v>

1664
01:17:32.490 --> 01:17:33.170
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1665
01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:34.880
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I make the best Imac now.</v>

1666
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:36.133
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure it really is just the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best like mobile card you could have </v>

1667
01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.730
<v Speaker 5>because it would fit inside a laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is way beyond that.</v>

1668
01:17:43.731 --> 01:17:44.564
<v Speaker 5>So like I don't think you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get four k display because it's </v>

1669
01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:50.480
<v Speaker 5>a four k display on the Imac,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's still like,</v>

1670
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:53.960
<v Speaker 5>it's the very bottom of it where this </v>
<v Speaker 5>one you can do multiple monitors.</v>

1671
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.360
<v Speaker 5>There's some interesting render it </v>
<v Speaker 5>faster too.</v>

1672
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:59.060
<v Speaker 5>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some interesting benchmarks that</v>

1673
01:17:59.061 --> 01:18:03.980
<v Speaker 5>I read recently that it actually showed </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Imac is faster than that at certain,</v>

1674
01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.700
<v Speaker 5>at video editing and stuff like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>because those graphic cards don't have,</v>

1675
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.480
<v Speaker 5>are those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1676
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.313
<v Speaker 5>processors aren't as fast as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>processor that's in the Imac for some </v>

1677
01:18:12.951 --> 01:18:13.784
<v Speaker 5>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have like the IMF has like speed </v>

1678
01:18:15.021 --> 01:18:19.060
<v Speaker 5>boost technology were the ones in there </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't like.</v>

1679
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:23.340
<v Speaker 5>There was a weird thing I just read </v>
<v Speaker 5>recently about how I was something.</v>

1680
01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.160
<v Speaker 5>This is making me dizzy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This whole conversation.</v>

1681
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.770
<v Speaker 5>Whatever they did here,</v>

1682
01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.640
<v Speaker 1>it was 27 inch Imac with retina five k </v>
<v Speaker 1>display.</v>

1683
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1684
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:35.690
<v Speaker 1>it's much faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1685
01:18:35.691 --> 01:18:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird?</v>

1686
01:18:36.591 --> 01:18:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I just read about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the point in that thing?</v>

1687
01:18:38.721 --> 01:18:39.554
<v Speaker 1>Just to look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to look like I know what I'm </v>

1688
01:18:41.241 --> 01:18:42.750
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to have one of the macros.</v>

1689
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.990
<v Speaker 1>It looks sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1690
01:18:44.991 --> 01:18:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Not Space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gives you more space,</v>

1691
01:18:48.051 --> 01:18:48.884
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

1692
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:52.020
<v Speaker 5>I like space saving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't mean like digital space.</v>

1693
01:18:52.021 --> 01:18:53.940
<v Speaker 5>I meant like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no for your office,</v>

1694
01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:56.620
<v Speaker 1>but that would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually give you more space because</v>

1695
01:18:56.621 --> 01:18:57.730
<v Speaker 1>it's all in one piece.</v>

1696
01:18:58.570 --> 01:18:59.403
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the reason is for </v>

1697
01:19:00.731 --> 01:19:02.080
<v Speaker 5>buying it anymore is.</v>

1698
01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the other thing you would have </v>

1699
01:19:03.491 --> 01:19:04.570
<v Speaker 1>to get a monitor for.</v>

1700
01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:09.800
<v Speaker 5>I have the 27 inch Imac for k retina,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the five k and it's fast as fuck.</v>

1701
01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.440
<v Speaker 5>I've NSSD on there and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It renders so fast.</v>

1702
01:19:13.441 --> 01:19:17.810
<v Speaker 5>I can't even imagine it being faster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's limitations on the processors</v>

1703
01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:20.940
<v Speaker 5>that the IMF could handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This can handle faster processing and it</v>

1704
01:19:20.941 --> 01:19:22.770
<v Speaker 5>would be specific to what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually doing.</v>

1705
01:19:22.771 --> 01:19:24.300
<v Speaker 5>Like you would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we needed one,</v>

1706
01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:26.610
<v Speaker 5>we would have to get it built </v>
<v Speaker 5>specifically to some use.</v>

1707
01:19:26.611 --> 01:19:29.580
<v Speaker 5>We would have to find for it like not </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone really needs these.</v>

1708
01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:30.390
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let</v>

1709
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:32.970
<v Speaker 1>me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does apple sell a monitor anymore?</v>

1710
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Now they just got rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so ridiculous.</v>

1711
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.270
<v Speaker 1>The Imac was the same price as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monitor.</v>

1712
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.960
<v Speaker 1>No steering wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure it out.</v>

1713
01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.910
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't like windshields.</v>

1714
01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Get your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you get it.</v>

1715
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:48.833
<v Speaker 1>Watching a Spanish channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what you guys talking </v>

1716
01:19:51.151 --> 01:19:53.040
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about computer stuff,</v>

1717
01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.430
<v Speaker 1>mainly friends told me that computers </v>
<v Speaker 1>were only have faith.</v>

1718
01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.273
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you guys are talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was your dad like when he had a </v>

1719
01:19:59.401 --> 01:20:02.010
<v Speaker 1>close the typewriter store and give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a dream?</v>

1720
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:03.263
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very upset that it had to be such a </v>

1721
01:20:04.381 --> 01:20:05.214
<v Speaker 1>bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very upset because people who love </v>

1722
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.030
<v Speaker 1>mechanical things,</v>

1723
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.490
<v Speaker 3>typewriters like that when something </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes along and just takes out a way.</v>

1724
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandpa,</v>

1725
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:14.843
<v Speaker 3>he built tools specifically for </v>
<v Speaker 3>typewriters that can only fix </v>

1726
01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:19.890
<v Speaker 3>typewriters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he never marketed them.</v>

1727
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:20.783
<v Speaker 3>He thought he cornered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everybody would come to different </v>

1728
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:27.090
<v Speaker 3>Irish mentality because of like hipsters</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>

1729
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Our typewriters on an upswing now it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>still not bringing it a little.</v>

1730
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:34.890
<v Speaker 3>It's got a tiny little heartbeat but not</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1731
01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Because they buy them and then they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>put them there for decorative feature.</v>

1732
01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:40.500
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1733
01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:44.940
<v Speaker 3>I have to get all these letters out </v>
<v Speaker 3>today or whatever it is.</v>

1734
01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.793
<v Speaker 3>I was actually going to do that very </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing until you just brought it up and </v>

1735
01:20:47.341 --> 01:20:49.020
<v Speaker 3>humiliated my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1736
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:50.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what people do.</v>

1737
01:20:50.881 --> 01:20:52.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have it to my sister,</v>

1738
01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:53.484
<v Speaker 3>Karen has her bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't unless it was someone's </v>

1739
01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:56.310
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

1740
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.370

<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1742
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:07.200

<v Speaker 3>If I could get that from my dad,</v>

1743
01:21:07.201 --> 01:21:09.560
<v Speaker 3>he would play with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would play with that.</v>

1744
01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Let's look it attaches to a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen and old school typewriter.</v>

1745
01:21:15.301 --> 01:21:16.134

<v Speaker 3>can take yours and they can convert it </v>

1746

<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have to send this to my dad's wife </v>

1747
01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:26.190
<v Speaker 3>because she will do that for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking brilliant.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And it's still as the only bought him an</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's typing on that flat thing and it </v>

1751
01:21:33.361 --> 01:21:35.040
<v Speaker 3>still has the ribbon in there.</v>

1752
01:21:35.041 --> 01:21:37.800

<v Speaker 3>The type stroll.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Maybe that'd be fun to type or write on.</v>

1757
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:51.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might still types on paper too.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Turn off your monitor for an authentic </v>

1760
01:21:57.331 --> 01:21:59.580
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What in the fuck are you saying,</v>

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.473
<v Speaker 3>I love this,</v>

1762
01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:04.480
<v Speaker 3>my dad immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1763
01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:05.343
<v Speaker 3>I sent it to his girlfriend and then she</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to explain how to turn it on and </v>

1764
01:22:08.731 --> 01:22:10.170
<v Speaker 3>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll give.</v>

1765
01:22:10.210 --> 01:22:12.700
<v Speaker 3>They give up that guy's email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1766
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:20.340
<v Speaker 3>here comes a funder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

1767
01:22:20.341 --> 01:22:21.570
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh I see.</v>

1768
01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:24.000
<v Speaker 3>So there's different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them works,</v>

1769
01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:28.650
<v Speaker 3>it just goes side to side with an ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the ipad actually pat is what?</v>

1770
01:22:28.651 --> 01:22:29.484
<v Speaker 3>We got them for Christmas so that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a cool thing to teach them to put it </v>

1771
01:22:32.851 --> 01:22:35.880
<v Speaker 3>on there because he literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is saddened by.</v>

1772
01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't progress.</v>

1773
01:22:37.321 --> 01:22:38.154
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was all he knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the woody Allen still types </v>

1774
01:22:41.071 --> 01:22:43.170
<v Speaker 3>on an old typewriter that you had like </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the seventies?</v>

1775
01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:44.243
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always seen that and it's kind of </v>

1776
01:22:46.081 --> 01:22:48.720
<v Speaker 3>interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have heard that a few people,</v>

1777
01:22:48.721 --> 01:22:50.850
<v Speaker 3>Tom Hanks to Tom Hanks is big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1778
01:22:50.851 --> 01:22:54.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he type scripts on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's big on collecting them and some</v>

1779
01:22:54.691 --> 01:22:55.524
<v Speaker 3>of his people were in my dad's </v>
<v Speaker 3>typewriter store like 20 years ago and </v>

1780
01:22:59.191 --> 01:22:59.761
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1781
01:22:59.761 --> 01:23:02.080
<v Speaker 3>we want this because my dad has his old </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1782
01:23:02.081 --> 01:23:04.260
<v Speaker 3>like that's probably worth a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

1783
01:23:04.261 --> 01:23:05.510
<v Speaker 3>but my dad just it like</v>

1784
01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:09.130
<v Speaker 1>it's not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they were like,</v>

1785
01:23:09.131 --> 01:23:09.964
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll buy that from you for a lot of </v>

1786
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:12.040
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they.</v>

1787
01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:15.880
<v Speaker 1>My Dad went and sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perverts cabin here.</v>

1788
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 1>That's my dad's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

1789
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:22.750
<v Speaker 1>And we're hoping with Woody Allen with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his ancient keyboard.</v>

1790
01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:25.830
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting actually because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1791
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.610
<v Speaker 1>he goes over his whole process of how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind it is.</v>

1792
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It uses just regular paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1793
01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1794
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:36.790
<v Speaker 1>The typewriter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it an underwood or is it a royal he.</v>

1795
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:39.140
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he writes on yellow legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers.</v>

1796
01:23:39.141 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I would that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what that looks like?</v>

1797
01:23:40.751 --> 01:23:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Or is it just the lighting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's not big onlining.</v>

1798
01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:45.840
<v Speaker 1>He likes everything in yellow.</v>

1799
01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:51.290
<v Speaker 1>The setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the setup,</v>

1800
01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:54.470
<v Speaker 1>the swing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1801
01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1802
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.903
<v Speaker 1>the coffee yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe we are making a comeback </v>

1803
01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 1>hunter s Thompson type only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1804
01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.350
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to type.</v>

1805
01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:10.023
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That got so many books and he would </v>

1806
01:24:11.891 --> 01:24:13.310
<v Speaker 1>type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finger,</v>

1807
01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.290
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1808
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.170
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1809
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never seen him,</v>

1810
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.823
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to watch Johnny Depp because of </v>

1811
01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:24.220
<v Speaker 1>the amazing impression of him in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1812
01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one was it?</v>

1813
01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.510
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fear and loathing.</v>

1814
01:24:28.511 --> 01:24:30.160
<v Speaker 1>But it was also he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1815
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:32.560
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the narrator of.</v>

1816
01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:37.770
<v Speaker 1>They played it also in the Gonzo life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and times of Dr. Hunter s Thompson.</v>

1817
01:24:38.501 --> 01:24:39.334
<v Speaker 1>That's an IBM selectric for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is how he would write like </v>

1818
01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:43.750
<v Speaker 1>literally like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

1819
01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:47.620
<v Speaker 1>what electric three look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that 100 years,</v>

1820
01:24:47.621 --> 01:24:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I guess the ball or the ball.</v>

1821
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:51.280
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the ball.</v>

1822
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.860
<v Speaker 1>That was like the next step up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1823
01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:55.973
<v Speaker 1>And then Smith Corona came out with kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a word processor that my dad was </v>

1824
01:24:59.201 --> 01:25:01.030
<v Speaker 1>selling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that that's the one that used to get</v>

1825
01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:02.800
<v Speaker 1>mad at because when you put labels </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>

1826
01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:04.023
<v Speaker 1>it would seep through and the Google </v>
<v Speaker 1>would come out and it would make </v>

1827
01:25:06.641 --> 01:25:09.370
<v Speaker 1>everything stick so it would screw up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1828
01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:10.293
<v Speaker 1>That's why my dad said computers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>only a phase because the labels </v>

1829
01:25:13.331 --> 01:25:14.164
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy how quick it </v>

1830
01:25:16.901 --> 01:25:17.734
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the history of the </v>

1831
01:25:18.941 --> 01:25:20.560
<v Speaker 1>typewriter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the typewriter been around,</v>

1832
01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:23.470
<v Speaker 1>how dare you not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1833
01:25:23.670 --> 01:25:24.371
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1834
01:25:24.371 --> 01:25:24.761
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1835
01:25:24.761 --> 01:25:25.720
<v Speaker 1>let's guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

1836
01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:27.430
<v Speaker 1>He was teaching us to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>grenades.</v>

1837
01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Not Kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you,</v>

1838
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.863
<v Speaker 1>if you had to guess?</v>
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

1839
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:32.980
<v Speaker 1>27.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a killer.</v>

1840
01:25:32.981 --> 01:25:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would go lower.</v>

1841
01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who would you go?</v>

1842
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Elena?</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 something?</v>

1843
01:25:38.071 --> 01:25:40.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd probably go with you because</v>

1844
01:25:40.411 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 1>your dad owns a typewriter store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just gonna copy off you.</v>

1845
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:45.580
<v Speaker 1>What did you come up with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1846
01:25:45.581 --> 01:25:47.490
<v Speaker 1>It's probably earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1847
01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1848
01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I could see that one that my dad has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the.</v>

1849
01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Almost at the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had a guest,</v>

1850
01:25:55.090 --> 01:25:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I feel like you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go with 1797.</v>

1851
01:25:59.670 --> 01:26:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Going to ride the line first obtained </v>
<v Speaker 1>patent Britain for a machine</v>

1852
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:07.520
<v Speaker 5>that did something similar to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>typewriter with 17,</v>

1853
01:26:07.521 --> 01:26:10.660
<v Speaker 5>14,</v>
<v Speaker 5>18.</v>

1854
01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:11.031
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>

1855
01:26:11.031 --> 01:26:13.730
<v Speaker 5>One was developed and developed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>18 slash 20.</v>

1856
01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:14.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh eight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1857
01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:17.710
<v Speaker 5>another one was developed but 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15,</v>

1858
01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.553
<v Speaker 5>75 and a titan printmaker named </v>
<v Speaker 5>Francisco [inaudible] invented the </v>

1859
01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 5>scurried into something on a machine </v>
<v Speaker 5>that impresses letters in the paper.</v>

1860
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:28.180
<v Speaker 5>So that's a typewriter base in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>truest.</v>

1861
01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:29.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's basically a typewriter or will </v>

1862
01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:33.720
<v Speaker 2>they have exactly when?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1863
01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like $1,500.</v>

1864
01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:35.971
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>printing.</v>

1865
01:26:35.971 --> 01:26:36.804
<v Speaker 2>Press me press.</v>

1866
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:37.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what he's saying.</v>

1867
01:26:37.971 --> 01:26:40.060
<v Speaker 5>That on the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put the what?</v>

1868
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.360
<v Speaker 5>That is a printing press then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1869
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:45.050
<v Speaker 5>Because the $1,500 a machine that </v>
<v Speaker 5>impressed letters on paper.</v>

1870
01:26:45.051 --> 01:26:47.990
<v Speaker 5>I guess what was the year that 15 slash </v>
<v Speaker 5>75.</v>

1871
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:52.310
<v Speaker 2>When was Martin Luther?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that was one of the things about</v>

1872
01:26:52.311 --> 01:26:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Martin Luther's translation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible,</v>

1873
01:26:54.231 --> 01:26:55.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that he was able to print it.</v>

1874
01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:57.853
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like a stamp that what </v>

1875
01:26:58.911 --> 01:27:01.310
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is just like a stamp,</v>

1876
01:27:01.311 --> 01:27:03.430
<v Speaker 2>not a Typo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like going to Kinko's.</v>

1877
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:06.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1878
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.233
<v Speaker 2>I mean this patent at Jamie's talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about because it's just like putting </v>

1879
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.640
<v Speaker 2>imprint on a paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1880
01:27:11.641 --> 01:27:15.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like a press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

1881
01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hard to remember where.</v>

1882
01:27:21.650 --> 01:27:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that fucking thing is.</v>

1883
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:26.980
<v Speaker 2>It's same scripture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mechanica.</v>

1884
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.943
<v Speaker 2>Can you go full screen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like you see the one in the </v>

1885
01:27:30.651 --> 01:27:31.490
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad has.</v>

1886
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:34.370
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1887
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.233
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would push down on those buttons </v>

1888
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.600
<v Speaker 2>on the top and it would write things </v>
<v Speaker 2>down on the bottom.</v>

1889
01:27:39.601 --> 01:27:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Is that what will go on shift?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how weird that is.</v>

1890
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:46.250
<v Speaker 2>That crank is your shift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1891
01:27:46.251 --> 01:27:47.930
<v Speaker 2>So eleanor fetus through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is.</v>

1892
01:27:47.931 --> 01:27:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Or talk us through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this one.</v>

1893
01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:51.033
<v Speaker 2>It feed the paper into the bottom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm assuming that crank is your </v>

1894
01:27:55.130 --> 01:27:57.300
<v Speaker 2>shift to get you across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1895
01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.660
<v Speaker 2>The one on the bumper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1896
01:27:59.750 --> 01:28:00.740
<v Speaker 2>what's the one on the bottom?</v>

1897
01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:01.893
<v Speaker 5>That's what like the came from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>printing press because that's how you </v>

1898
01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:07.780
<v Speaker 5>would press your paper and turn it down </v>
<v Speaker 5>and let it lay coasts.</v>

1899
01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:09.630
<v Speaker 5>Taught me how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How weird.</v>

1900
01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.360
<v Speaker 5>This place in Columbus called coast side</v>
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

1901
01:28:12.361 --> 01:28:13.194
<v Speaker 5>They have this street to yesteryear and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can literally go and like make wax </v>

1902
01:28:15.921 --> 01:28:18.530
<v Speaker 5>candles and use a printing press.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you make Botha?</v>

1903
01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:20.630
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they have butter there.</v>

1904
01:28:20.631 --> 01:28:25.310
<v Speaker 5>That's another part of Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they don't make butter in Ohio,</v>

1905
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:27.980
<v Speaker 5>but they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's another part of the learned that</v>

1906
01:28:27.981 --> 01:28:28.940
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't at that place.</v>

1907
01:28:29.490 --> 01:28:30.323
<v Speaker 2>Old School stuff is cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this old lady in Montana and this </v>

1908
01:28:34.531 --> 01:28:35.364
<v Speaker 2>historic recreation of a house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like this museum of Bozeman in </v>

1909
01:28:39.001 --> 01:28:39.834
<v Speaker 2>the Museum of Bozeman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these people that are making </v>

1910
01:28:42.511 --> 01:28:47.511
<v Speaker 2>wool yarn and so she's got wool out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's running it through the spindle and</v>

1911
01:28:47.871 --> 01:28:48.704
<v Speaker 2>as she's running through the spindle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's turning it into thread and </v>

1912
01:28:50.371 --> 01:28:51.204
<v Speaker 2>attaching more wool to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was explaining how the wool just </v>

1913
01:28:54.151 --> 01:28:54.984
<v Speaker 2>clings to other wall that it's got some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a tension thing or an </v>

1914
01:28:58.681 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 2>attractant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little barbs or something</v>

1915
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.933
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that sticks out and like and </v>

1916
01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:05.173
<v Speaker 1>you rub the wools together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of cling to each other and so </v>

1917
01:29:07.321 --> 01:29:10.810
<v Speaker 1>she was doing this all by hand and foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>like old school.</v>

1918
01:29:10.811 --> 01:29:12.870
<v Speaker 1>He and making and doing it like in real </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1919
01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:17.760
<v Speaker 1>like she'd pull out these big tufts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this wool that just sheered from a lamb.</v>

1920
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:21.630
<v Speaker 1>She'd take it and she just started </v>
<v Speaker 1>attaching it and she's talking to us and</v>

1921
01:29:21.631 --> 01:29:24.480
<v Speaker 1>pumping this pedal and making this wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad ass man.</v>

1922
01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done that before that.</v>

1923
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:26.383
<v Speaker 4>They do that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of that shit in Ohio and </v>

1924
01:29:28.551 --> 01:29:30.500
<v Speaker 4>they also Williamsburg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>West Virginia,</v>

1925
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:33.800
<v Speaker 4>like that whole town where they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>like real fights.</v>

1926
01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:36.680
<v Speaker 4>They have real blacksmiths and it goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1927
01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get weird what recreation's,</v>

1928
01:29:40.761 --> 01:29:43.820
<v Speaker 1>but that was cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty cool because it is part of</v>

1929
01:29:43.821 --> 01:29:45.020
<v Speaker 1>the history thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get mad.</v>

1930
01:29:45.021 --> 01:29:45.854
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the civil war stuff's weird and </v>

1931
01:29:48.681 --> 01:29:53.000
<v Speaker 1>they recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is uncomfortable for all of us,</v>

1932
01:29:53.210 --> 01:29:55.130
<v Speaker 1>but some of us just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

1933
01:29:55.131 --> 01:29:57.890
<v Speaker 1>it is a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if part of the history,</v>

1934
01:29:57.891 --> 01:30:00.860
<v Speaker 1>so don't you think with the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people recruiting war,</v>

1935
01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:05.540
<v Speaker 1>like we don't know what happened are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming over the top.</v>

1936
01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:08.360
<v Speaker 1>They're pretending to reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to fight to keep their slaves.</v>

1937
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:11.780
<v Speaker 1>They might get shot at my dad shot me </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a musket,</v>

1938
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:13.850
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is that like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1939
01:30:14.210 --> 01:30:17.120
<v Speaker 1>it's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange thing to recreate that,</v>

1940
01:30:17.121 --> 01:30:21.560
<v Speaker 1>but at least I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1941
01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:23.960
<v Speaker 1>But at least this lady Megan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wool,</v>

1942
01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:26.630
<v Speaker 1>like when she's making this wool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know how they did it.</v>

1943
01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Like you could watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I'm watching her do it,</v>

1944
01:30:29.150 --> 01:30:29.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not a lost skill because we </v>

1945
01:30:31.821 --> 01:30:32.720
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1946
01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you know,</v>

1955
01:30:47.650 --> 01:30:50.180
<v Speaker 1>What if you're just sitting in a room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and empty room with a pile of bull?</v>

1956
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:51.223
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to survive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to make star not going </v>

1957
01:30:53.601 --> 01:30:54.560
<v Speaker 1>to make clothes for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1958
01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.420

<v Speaker 1>I'm just.</v>

1959
01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how would you.</v>

1960
01:30:58.731 --> 01:31:00.830
<v Speaker 1>What would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1961
01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:04.820
<v Speaker 1>there I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old spinster.</v>

1962
01:31:05.150 --> 01:31:05.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to think those old William </v>

1963
01:31:07.411 --> 01:31:08.244
<v Speaker 1>were cursing them.</v>

1964
01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:10.670
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beauty came from.</v>

1965
01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:17.880
<v Speaker 4>I really liked my mom and dad used to </v>
<v Speaker 4>click singer sewing machines.</v>

1966
01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:25.780
<v Speaker 4>The old ones were old iron wines and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to like get new rubber stopper.</v>

1967
01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.450
<v Speaker 4>Rubbers gotten bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my could.</v>

1968
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:30.383
<v Speaker 4>In Ohio there's so many barns and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're about to tear down these barns </v>

1969
01:31:32.811 --> 01:31:35.620
<v Speaker 4>and they have barn sales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd just go and like,</v>

1970
01:31:35.621 --> 01:31:36.454
<v Speaker 4>I see anything you want in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Dad would go to them and just take </v>

1971
01:31:38.571 --> 01:31:39.404
<v Speaker 4>all the singer sewing machines because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they always had sewing machines in them </v>

1972
01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:45.110
<v Speaker 4>for that kind of reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like shaving sheep and making.</v>

1973
01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I would be terrified to do that,</v>

1974
01:31:49.041 --> 01:31:51.190
<v Speaker 4>but the people that did it for years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1975
01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:55.650
<v Speaker 4>they did it for a long fucking time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>my sister had bad at that.</v>

1976
01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:58.280
<v Speaker 4>Has that almost exact one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could make clothes,</v>

1977
01:31:58.281 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 4>go back to that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can make</v>

1978
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.730
<v Speaker 3>clothes with that one that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>pumping with your feet.</v>

1979
01:32:01.731 --> 01:32:04.880
<v Speaker 3>And my grandma had one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandma said,</v>

1980
01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.690
<v Speaker 3>pick one like that I think are maybe up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1981
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:10.780
<v Speaker 3>My grandma had a bunch of cool old stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1982
01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:11.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to love just broke down and my </v>

1983
01:32:13.451 --> 01:32:15.910
<v Speaker 3>foot is your grandma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does she do that?</v>

1984
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:18.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't really remember her making any </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes.</v>

1985
01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe she did.</v>

1986
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:21.760
<v Speaker 3>She probably did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't remember.</v>

1987
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:23.950
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1988
01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.900
<v Speaker 3>she was ill like the last years of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1989
01:32:25.901 --> 01:32:26.734
<v Speaker 3>so I mostly remember that unfortunately </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was all during the formative </v>

1990
01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.550
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that thing,</v>

1991
01:32:30.551 --> 01:32:32.740
<v Speaker 3>go back to that Jamie Lukow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

1992
01:32:32.741 --> 01:32:33.574
<v Speaker 3>That thing is like the craftsmanship and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the design and like if you look at the </v>

1993
01:32:37.691 --> 01:32:40.560
<v Speaker 3>gold that's in the a sewing machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing itself,</v>

1994
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.660
<v Speaker 3>it's so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is really cool.</v>

1995
01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:44.523
<v Speaker 3>My sister designed costumes for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her daughter is a dancer and she would </v>

1996
01:32:48.461 --> 01:32:49.294
<v Speaker 3>do a recital every year and Karen also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my older sister would go and like while </v>

1997
01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:57.580
<v Speaker 3>the shows were happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would stitch stuff up as well.</v>

1998
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:58.623
<v Speaker 3>And a couple a years ago she had to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight pins in her and she was like </v>

1999
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:04.690
<v Speaker 3>helping their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2000
01:33:04.691 --> 01:33:05.524
<v Speaker 3>they're young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Karen's like putting all the stuff </v>

2001
01:33:06.761 --> 01:33:07.594
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was fixing somebody's thing and </v>

2002
01:33:08.681 --> 01:33:11.080
<v Speaker 3>somebody called her and she went and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted.</v>

2003
01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:17.490
<v Speaker 3>She swallowed the Pan Pan or long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My crazy sister to do.</v>

2004
01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:21.100
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's shut my mother is like,</v>

2005
01:33:21.101 --> 01:33:21.934
<v Speaker 3>is that big rusting in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to absorb it and somebody's going </v>

2006
01:33:26.411 --> 01:33:28.150
<v Speaker 3>to absorb it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it stainless steel?</v>

2007
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I guess I could take a long foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is she getting into her lung?</v>

2008
01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:34.280
<v Speaker 3>They saw it are open like a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get it out of there.</v>

2009
01:33:34.290 --> 01:33:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut me crazy and making shit.</v>

2010
01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:37.780
<v Speaker 3>It's been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been a while.</v>

2011
01:33:37.781 --> 01:33:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's more than two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying the wrong ones,</v>

2012
01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:45.790
<v Speaker 3>but I remember she had blood work done </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something done and they were like,</v>

2013
01:33:45.791 --> 01:33:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2014
01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:49.090
<v Speaker 3>She was some metal something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2015
01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 3>What about when she goes to the is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened?</v>

2016
01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so crazy.</v>

2017
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:58.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she's had any problem at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the airport.</v>

2018
01:33:58.451 --> 01:34:00.290
<v Speaker 3>It could have got stuck on the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Easy.</v>

2019
01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:05.150
<v Speaker 3>And then in her lung,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something crazy.</v>

2020
01:34:06.250 --> 01:34:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My crazy sister.</v>

2021
01:34:08.591 --> 01:34:09.430
<v Speaker 3>But you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Karen.</v>

2022
01:34:09.431 --> 01:34:11.750
<v Speaker 3>She's always doing like 5 million things</v>
<v Speaker 3>at once.</v>

2023
01:34:11.751 --> 01:34:14.620
<v Speaker 3>So see this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course she did that.</v>

2024
01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Of course they haven't heard czar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but her costumes look great.</v>

2025
01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.433
<v Speaker 3>What a weird feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly walk around with a knowing her </v>

2026
01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:29.710
<v Speaker 3>like we want to put a magnet in her </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth and see if it comes back up,</v>

2027
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.573
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like she could come off </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and could just rip something open </v>

2028
01:34:33.281 --> 01:34:35.500
<v Speaker 3>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God forbid.</v>

2029
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:38.250
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think for the big,</v>

2030
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:42.690
<v Speaker 3>God forbid you cannot think of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did not think about dom arrera.</v>

2031
01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.920
<v Speaker 3>It's true golf a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the South Philly?</v>

2032
01:34:44.921 --> 01:34:45.890
<v Speaker 3>It's how we talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2033
01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:49.620
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's so dom fitbit,</v>

2034
01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:53.380
<v Speaker 3>he used to make fun of my grandma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was saying,</v>

2035
01:34:53.381 --> 01:34:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh God forbid it's a sin and a shame </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that kid.</v>

2036
01:34:55.901 --> 01:34:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Looks like what an awful</v>

2037
01:34:58.270 --> 01:35:00.350
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's knowing what you know now.</v>

2038
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Knowing what you know now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you both this question.</v>

2039
01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Knowing what you know now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what time would you like to go back?</v>

2040
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:07.663
<v Speaker 2>If you could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was a time machine you can go </v>

2041
01:35:08.601 --> 01:35:12.530
<v Speaker 2>back to like the 19 fifties and just run</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit for a little while.</v>

2042
01:35:12.531 --> 01:35:13.364
<v Speaker 2>Those dorks in on enough and back then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just go back and you would know </v>

2043
01:35:18.531 --> 01:35:20.360
<v Speaker 2>what you know now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but going back exactly.</v>

2044
01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What year would it be?</v>

2045
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen teens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50.</v>

2046
01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:27.803
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I could lead a charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could vote in the fifties when he </v>

2047
01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:32.990
<v Speaker 2>was suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what am I saying?</v>

2048
01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:34.540
<v Speaker 2>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to give back.</v>

2049
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:36.700
<v Speaker 2>I want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2050
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:37.603
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

2051
01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just watched it back to the future yet</v>

2052
01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.500
<v Speaker 2>it yesterday and it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2053
01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was fascinating.</v>

2054
01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I saw back to the future two with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids at a movie theater.</v>

2055
01:35:47.001 --> 01:35:48.570
<v Speaker 2>And you thought it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

2056
01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.513
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to live back in that </v>

2057
01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:52.020
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2058
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.620
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that movie.</v>

2059
01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:54.873
<v Speaker 2>The future too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2060
01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever saw it.</v>

2061
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I only saw one.</v>

2062
01:35:58.710 --> 01:35:59.543
<v Speaker 2>I know I did see two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it was great and that was </v>

2063
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:03.650
<v Speaker 2>this year I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2064
01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Like 2015?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2065
01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.340
<v Speaker 2>2015.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

2066
01:36:07.341 --> 01:36:08.270
<v Speaker 2>When you walk into like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2067
01:36:08.271 --> 01:36:09.560
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were in the future.</v>

2068
01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:12.890
<v Speaker 2>It was a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So off they missed everything.</v>

2069
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.863
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody thought it was going to be </v>

2070
01:36:14.331 --> 01:36:15.164
<v Speaker 2>spaceships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thought I was going to be </v>

2071
01:36:16.071 --> 01:36:18.560
<v Speaker 2>hovered for thought I was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical things.</v>

2072
01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:20.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Pokemon pokey.</v>

2073
01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Mon is invaded the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asian of privacy.</v>

2074
01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

2075
01:36:25.461 --> 01:36:29.360
<v Speaker 2>It's some sort of a connection between </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us in a weird,</v>

2076
01:36:29.361 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 2>sneaky way.</v>

2077
01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.733
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get it in with a game and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get used to it just like </v>

2078
01:36:32.361 --> 01:36:33.194
<v Speaker 2>you're used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now people are holding up their phones </v>

2079
01:36:34.491 --> 01:36:37.100
<v Speaker 2>and take pictures of things and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to,</v>

2080
01:36:37.101 --> 01:36:38.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2081
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.550
<v Speaker 2>people texting each other while they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving.</v>

2082
01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Like all this stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

2083
01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:45.530
<v Speaker 2>it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be all a part of us.</v>

2084
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:46.663
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to figure out a way to absorb us </v>

2085
01:36:48.411 --> 01:36:51.290
<v Speaker 2>right now and the best way to suck us in</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a game.</v>

2086
01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:53.160
<v Speaker 2>You don't think it observable absorbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2087
01:36:53.161 --> 01:36:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's even,</v>

2088
01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:56.090
<v Speaker 2>it's deep and it's not going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>

2089
01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:56.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2090
01:36:56.481 --> 01:36:58.280
<v Speaker 2>technology's not gonna stop and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

2091
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:59.323
<v Speaker 2>I think we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've achieved a certain level </v>

2092
01:37:01.491 --> 01:37:03.830
<v Speaker 2>of success with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that they love us.</v>

2093
01:37:03.831 --> 01:37:04.760
<v Speaker 2>They're going to keep us around.</v>

2094
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:05.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody stays there are always looking </v>

2095
01:37:06.741 --> 01:37:08.720
<v Speaker 2>for the next best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you always yell.</v>

2096
01:37:08.721 --> 01:37:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Where are the flying cars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flying cars were in the jet packs.</v>

2097
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Jet Packs all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2098
01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Well what was the mechanical things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What everybody expected?</v>

2099
01:37:17.690 --> 01:37:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Because the mechanical things where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest leaps,</v>

2100
01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:20.773
<v Speaker 2>like think about before there was a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>before there was a car and then </v>

2101
01:37:23.001 --> 01:37:24.590
<v Speaker 2>afterwards a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2102
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:26.540
<v Speaker 2>how nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look what the fuck happened.</v>

2103
01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:27.374
<v Speaker 2>People just came across the country on </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheels and built fucking houses </v>

2104
01:37:30.291 --> 01:37:34.130
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and they drive with shit back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth and they're shipping things on</v>

2105
01:37:34.131 --> 01:37:34.964
<v Speaker 2>trucks and food on trucks and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get food to places that could ever get </v>

2106
01:37:38.181 --> 01:37:39.014
<v Speaker 2>it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a game changer when they </v>

2107
01:37:40.761 --> 01:37:43.280
<v Speaker 2>invented the car and that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

2108
01:37:43.281 --> 01:37:44.114
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all of us growing up in that </v>

2109
01:37:45.381 --> 01:37:46.214
<v Speaker 2>era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in our time we looked at like we </v>

2110
01:37:48.531 --> 01:37:50.900
<v Speaker 2>thought it was going to be a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be some crazy robot.</v>

2111
01:37:50.901 --> 01:37:51.734
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be a jet pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be something that showed </v>

2112
01:37:53.871 --> 01:37:56.340
<v Speaker 2>us that we're living in the jetsons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no state something,</v>

2113
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:57.810
<v Speaker 2>something no one ever saw coming</v>

2114
01:37:57.990 --> 01:38:02.410
<v Speaker 3>information way information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember my grandma telling me she was</v>

2115
01:38:02.411 --> 01:38:07.180
<v Speaker 3>so afraid of cars and the fact that my </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandpa drove like a maniac.</v>

2116
01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:08.830
<v Speaker 3>He probably drank and drove because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

2117
01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:09.753
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago and she was so afraid she </v>

2118
01:38:12.431 --> 01:38:13.264
<v Speaker 3>would lay on the back seat on the floor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just her and her best friend would </v>

2119
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:18.550
<v Speaker 3>lay on the back and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2120
01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Like I would never think to be afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

2121
01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:22.480
<v Speaker 3>You getting anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2122

<v Speaker 4>gravitate towards.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2153
01:39:46.491 --> 01:39:47.324
<v Speaker 3>But Paul Mooney used to tell us crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories and I remember one time we had </v>

2154
01:39:50.511 --> 01:39:52.400
<v Speaker 3>this manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget his name,</v>

2155
01:39:52.401 --> 01:39:53.930
<v Speaker 3>there was so many managers at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>

2156
01:39:53.931 --> 01:39:55.700
<v Speaker 3>but Paul would tell me all these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

2157
01:39:55.701 --> 01:39:59.330
<v Speaker 3>He was raised by his grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was his mom.</v>

2158
01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Her mom was a slave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally.</v>

2159
01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.593
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he would tell stories and if you </v>

2160
01:40:03.591 --> 01:40:04.251
<v Speaker 3>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Paul's in his eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so his grandma could.</v>

01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:39.620
<v Speaker 3>I just walked away from him like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>

2176
01:40:39.621 --> 01:40:40.454
<v Speaker 3>I'm either going to strangle him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he just for me saying that it was </v>

2177
01:40:43.791 --> 01:40:47.150
<v Speaker 3>less than 200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At that point he didn't believe me.</v>

2178
01:40:47.230 --> 01:40:49.280
<v Speaker 3>But there's some things that people say </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

2179
01:40:49.281 --> 01:40:50.114
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that like wasn't that's what you </v>

2180
01:40:51.471 --> 01:40:53.290
<v Speaker 3>want it to be two</v>

2181
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:55.840
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want it to be.</v>

2182
01:40:55.841 --> 01:40:56.674
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why do you think that that's the </v>

2183
01:40:58.181 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 1>case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people say Weird Shit.</v>

2184
01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:01.354
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had a discussion with a guy long </v>

2185
01:41:02.981 --> 01:41:07.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking time ago about the civil war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about the economic impact</v>

2186
01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.190
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to cripple the farms.</v>

2187
01:41:09.191 --> 01:41:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Like is an economic more and they forced</v>
<v Speaker 1>him in a corner where they had.</v>

2188
01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:17.440
<v Speaker 1>It was about slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just about,</v>

2189
01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:18.453
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to pay people and </v>

2190
01:41:20.261 --> 01:41:22.480
<v Speaker 1>you're making them work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's economics.</v>

2191
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.180
<v Speaker 1>People are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like to get paid for work.</v>

2192
01:41:25.181 --> 01:41:27.220
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that sense it was an economic issue,</v>

2193
01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but people repeat that because they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could drink.</v>

2194
01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:31.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2195
01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:32.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least fucking liberals try telling </v>

2196
01:41:33.101 --> 01:41:34.780
<v Speaker 1>that to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear it.</v>

2197
01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:36.490
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about echo.</v>

2198
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:37.533
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who were slaves allow than </v>

2199
01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:41.620
<v Speaker 1>were treated very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have.</v>

2200
01:41:41.621 --> 01:41:43.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that roots,</v>

2201
01:41:43.511 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 1>that propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie,</v>

2202
01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:48.460
<v Speaker 1>that l Ron Hubbard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever wrote that shit,</v>

2203
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:53.250
<v Speaker 1>that guy he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them were good friends with the</v>

2204
01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:55.120
<v Speaker 1>white folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they interbred.</v>

2205
01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:57.213
<v Speaker 1>They often interbred the master would </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick himself a good woman and she would </v>

2206
01:42:01.091 --> 01:42:03.140
<v Speaker 1>be treated better than the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2207
01:42:03.670 --> 01:42:05.590
<v Speaker 1>how much different is that than working </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Burger King?</v>

2208
01:42:06.190 --> 01:42:07.023
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

2209
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:10.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of those dudes out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were always out there.</v>

2210
01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:15.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know we were going to bring my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad back up.</v>

2211
01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:18.400
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2212
01:42:18.630 --> 01:42:19.463
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot of people that are just </v>

2213
01:42:20.490 --> 01:42:21.323
<v Speaker 2>and they booked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is like when a guy says I was </v>

2214
01:42:22.590 --> 01:42:24.720
<v Speaker 2>about economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about economics.</v>

2215
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:25.623
<v Speaker 2>You don't want it to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they want there to be a bunch of </v>

2216
01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:29.980
<v Speaker 2>silly people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

2217
01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:33.090
<v Speaker 2>They don't want like slavery has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>abolished in 18,</v>

2218
01:42:33.091 --> 01:42:36.680
<v Speaker 2>65 and people went to war over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2219
01:42:36.810 --> 01:42:39.870
<v Speaker 2>That's so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

2220
01:42:39.871 --> 01:42:43.140
<v Speaker 2>that's recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I was born in [inaudible] 67.</v>

2221
01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's two years,</v>

2222
01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:48.600
<v Speaker 2>200 years rather before I was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that for 100 years.</v>

2223
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:49.960
<v Speaker 2>One hundred years before I was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2224
01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2225
01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:54.060
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nothing.</v>

2226
01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2227
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:58.170
<v Speaker 2>My grandma was 93 when she died in 1965.</v>

2228
01:42:58.170 --> 01:43:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't even sound right when you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2229
01:43:00.150 --> 01:43:02.730
<v Speaker 2>There was only 140 something years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>

2230
01:43:02.731 --> 01:43:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more than that,</v>

2231
01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:05.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more than that.</v>

2232
01:43:05.731 --> 01:43:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more than that,</v>

2233
01:43:07.291 --> 01:43:08.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2234
01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Crazy creeps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>

2235
01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.313
<v Speaker 2>we had slaves just to fucking couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years ago was I had family that </v>

2236
01:43:17.611 --> 01:43:20.370
<v Speaker 2>lived to be $100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's an easy number.</v>

2237
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

2238
01:43:23.250 --> 01:43:26.130

<v Speaker 2>recent.</v>

2239

<v Speaker 2>And in places where it was like real </v>
<v Speaker 2>prep.</v>

2240
01:43:28.981 --> 01:43:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Now stop and think of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2241
01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Think of places where like slavery was </v>
<v Speaker 2>real prevalent,</v>

2242
01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:35.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People lived on the slavery,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they had it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>shit and they'll think that all goes </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2246
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:46.320
<v Speaker 2>And they got to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all racist,</v>

2247
01:43:46.321 --> 01:43:51.321
<v Speaker 2>grandpappy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist Paul Pol Pot Pie Pie.</v>

2248
01:43:51.610 --> 01:43:52.000

<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what we're going to do.</v>

2251

<v Speaker 1>that first one on netflix where she went</v>

2253
01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and visited places like that where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

2254
01:44:07.730 --> 01:44:09.650
<v Speaker 1>And it was so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

2255
01:44:09.651 --> 01:44:10.484
<v Speaker 1>And she's having conversations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing what you're saying with </v>

2256
01:44:12.570 --> 01:44:14.540
<v Speaker 1>economic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2257
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.070
<v Speaker 1>what the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

2258
01:44:16.071 --> 01:44:18.160
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like trying to schedule that,</v>

2259
01:44:18.170 --> 01:44:19.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

2260
01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:22.120
<v Speaker 1>like this blinders will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't blame,</v>

2261
01:44:22.190 --> 01:44:25.700
<v Speaker 1>don't look into it and that's what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to hear.</v>

2262
01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what they talk about.</v>

2263
01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:30.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating thing when people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2264
01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:34.430
<v Speaker 1>when people don't consider the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of another point of view.</v>

2265
01:44:35.290 --> 01:44:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be that close minded.</v>

2266
01:44:37.131 --> 01:44:37.964
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at how many people </v>

2267
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:42.800
<v Speaker 1>have benefited from slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping,</v>

2268
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:44.343
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that anybody's out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another sample we'll need </v>

2269
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:49.343
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

2270
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Keeping this corn business going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need someone to pick this here corner.</v>

2271
01:44:55.761 --> 01:44:56.594
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't pick it on a cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're trying to keep a family </v>

2272
01:44:59.690 --> 01:45:03.950
<v Speaker 1>friend trying to support community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2273
01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:04.784
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Living in those places like living in </v>

2274
01:45:06.891 --> 01:45:07.724
<v Speaker 1>spots where it was like insanely racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds </v>

2275
01:45:11.031 --> 01:45:11.864
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2276
01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And then to expect that to just shut off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and turn around within our lifetimes,</v>

2277
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:21.260
<v Speaker 1>it's almost amazing that people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>more racist.</v>

2278
01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia's pretty racist.</v>

2279
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Boston's pretty racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only parts of Boston hearts,</v>

2280
01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the center Boston is very liberal,</v>

2281
01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:32.930
<v Speaker 1>democratic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very progressive.</v>

2282
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:38.440
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of townies that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the my parents growing up.</v>

2283
01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:42.950
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't date a Italian Irish yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2284
01:45:42.951 --> 01:45:43.784
<v Speaker 1>they don't like people would freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like people that are </v>

2285
01:45:45.501 --> 01:45:47.900
<v Speaker 1>different than them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get mad and Italian.</v>

2286
01:45:47.901 --> 01:45:48.734
<v Speaker 1>Irish like that was a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I were the dirtiest of the </v>

2287
01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.570
<v Speaker 1>mutts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 percent Irish.</v>

2288
01:45:53.571 --> 01:45:54.404
<v Speaker 1>You think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've had so much dick in you from </v>

2289
01:45:56.061 --> 01:45:56.894
<v Speaker 1>Italian guy.</v>

2290
01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm representing every country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the Olympics and go,</v>

2291
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2292
01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Philly is similar in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Philly,</v>

2293
01:46:11.481 --> 01:46:12.530
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>

2294
01:46:12.531 --> 01:46:13.364
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have like a different feel to </v>

2295
01:46:14.751 --> 01:46:15.584
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's similar is they're hardy </v>

2296
01:46:17.481 --> 01:46:22.190
<v Speaker 1>people that are living in tough climates</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're the children of the children</v>

2297
01:46:22.191 --> 01:46:23.330
<v Speaker 1>of immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the most part.</v>

2298
01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Most of my neighbors growing up spoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian or I mean we came over.</v>

2299
01:46:30.201 --> 01:46:33.470

2302
01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.753
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of the people that I grew </v>

2303
01:46:42.231 --> 01:46:43.064
<v Speaker 1>up with who was always like their dad's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad or someone will say it was my </v>

2304
01:46:46.221 --> 01:46:49.720
<v Speaker 1>grandparents on both sides came from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>my</v>

2305
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.960
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom side,</v>

01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:09.020
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't even supposed to be on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>continent.</v>

2321
01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:42.850
<v Speaker 3>not picnics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

2322
01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:47.010
<v Speaker 3>They didn't like mob scenes like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Park rent a hall.</v>

2323
01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Twenty six people would indoors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many families want?</v>

2324
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:53.370
<v Speaker 3>My mom's mom had four kids.</v>

2325
01:47:53.370 --> 01:47:55.980
<v Speaker 3>She was orphaned at a very early age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had four kids,</v>

2326
01:47:55.981 --> 01:47:58.050
<v Speaker 3>so she wants to have like a real tight </v>
<v Speaker 3>knit family.</v>

2327
01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Four kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>27 grandchildren,</v>

2328
01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:03.420
<v Speaker 3>45 great grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When she passed away 11 years ago,</v>

2329
01:48:03.421 --> 01:48:07.300
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of periods in your only </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2330
01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:12.160
<v Speaker 3>Tampax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Fertile.</v>

2331
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:15.200
<v Speaker 3>You could probably get them from her </v>
<v Speaker 3>other sisters.</v>

2332
01:48:15.210 --> 01:48:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

2333
01:48:16.111 --> 01:48:17.610
<v Speaker 3>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom had a hysterectomy.</v>

2334
01:48:17.611 --> 01:48:20.200
<v Speaker 3>She's still nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like around.</v>

2335
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:22.663
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a giant number of human beings to </v>

2336
01:48:25.561 --> 01:48:26.394
<v Speaker 3>come out of a couple of folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many other people are going to get </v>

2337
01:48:29.101 --> 01:48:30.540
<v Speaker 3>bread out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2338
01:48:30.541 --> 01:48:31.350
<v Speaker 3>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2339
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:32.183
<v Speaker 3>we slowed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we slow because we're 10 and then we </v>

2340
01:48:34.171 --> 01:48:36.090
<v Speaker 3>only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only have 10 nieces and nephews,</v>

2341
01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:41.940
<v Speaker 3>but my little sister did just get </v>
<v Speaker 3>married so my might add on the other.</v>

2342
01:48:42.090 --> 01:48:45.630
<v Speaker 3>My aunt joy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had 10 kids and they have I think 15</v>

2343
01:48:45.631 --> 01:48:48.990
<v Speaker 3>or 17 nieces and nephews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2344
01:48:48.991 --> 01:48:49.824
<v Speaker 3>Like hide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they did the bigger we were half and </v>

2345
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:54.623
<v Speaker 3>half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half of us had kids and half of us </v>

2346
01:48:55.201 --> 01:48:56.850
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half of us were like,</v>

2347
01:48:56.851 --> 01:48:58.520
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to stop this bloodline.</v>

2348
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's why you don't want kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's been around too many people.</v>

2349
01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:04.733
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it could be those bad decisions I </v>

2350
01:49:06.331 --> 01:49:07.500
<v Speaker 3>made with dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2351
01:49:07.530 --> 01:49:08.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

2352
01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:09.990
<v Speaker 3>they're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love kids.</v>

2353
01:49:09.991 --> 01:49:10.824
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2354
01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:12.090
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2355
01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:15.660
<v Speaker 3>We don't have my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I for my own,</v>

2356
01:49:15.661 --> 01:49:16.494
<v Speaker 3>I don't want for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I go home I'm with my nieces </v>

2357
01:49:18.271 --> 01:49:20.910
<v Speaker 3>and nephews all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang out with them all the time.</v>

2358
01:49:20.911 --> 01:49:24.660
<v Speaker 3>I even had my niece Alexa came out here </v>
<v Speaker 3>to live for a little while because she's</v>

2359
01:49:24.661 --> 01:49:29.661
<v Speaker 3>into producing and editing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's just graduated college.</v>

2360
01:49:29.881 --> 01:49:34.000
<v Speaker 3>So like I'm very close with my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call them my kids and uh,</v>

2361
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:35.160
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for myself,</v>

2362
01:49:35.170 --> 01:49:39.000
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to make total sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also the,</v>

2363
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:42.090
<v Speaker 3>just the sheer numbers of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been around for so long,</v>

2364
01:49:42.091 --> 01:49:44.880
<v Speaker 3>you're like enough fucking people making</v>
<v Speaker 3>more people.</v>

2365
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2366
01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how much of that pull to family</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

2367
01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:50.374
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to create some bond with people that </v>

2368
01:49:52.031 --> 01:49:53.950
<v Speaker 3>you're like deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply close to.</v>

2369
01:49:53.951 --> 01:49:54.784
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder if you grow up with so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like you have that bond gets </v>

2370
01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:58.433
<v Speaker 3>drowned out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the way we grew up on top of each </v>

2371
01:50:00.281 --> 01:50:02.380
<v Speaker 3>other by tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are tight.</v>

2372
01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Let's not get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we are tight.</v>

2373
01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.153
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could imagine 10 kids growing up in a </v>

2374
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:09.370
<v Speaker 3>pilot that I bet if one of you gets in </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble,</v>

2375
01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.693
<v Speaker 3>fucking hailstorm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had nobody wanted to fight one </v>

2376
01:50:13.241 --> 01:50:14.074
<v Speaker 3>because she had a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have six brothers so it's like I </v>

2377
01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:16.803
<v Speaker 3>shared a room with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stayed in the most important thing </v>

2378
01:50:18.371 --> 01:50:19.204
<v Speaker 3>growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2379
01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:21.210
<v Speaker 3>People you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2380
01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.950
<v Speaker 3>like if shit goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it was raining out,</v>

2381
01:50:23.951 --> 01:50:25.780
<v Speaker 3>people would knock on our door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's go in there.</v>

2382
01:50:25.781 --> 01:50:28.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like a playground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

2383
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:31.210
<v Speaker 3>There's always something to do in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kerrigan House,</v>

2384
01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was just in the St.</v>

2385
01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:35.800
<v Speaker 3>just never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet you're right,</v>

2386
01:50:35.801 --> 01:50:36.634
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2387
01:50:36.670 --> 01:50:37.503
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that people have two kids and they </v>

2388
01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:40.174
<v Speaker 3>tag out and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just that kids aren't running </v>

2389
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:42.934
<v Speaker 3>around the street.</v>

2390
01:50:45.130 --> 01:50:45.963
<v Speaker 3>That was my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we really were outside and that's </v>

2391
01:50:48.551 --> 01:50:49.384
<v Speaker 3>when I kind of what this pokemon thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited that people are outside and </v>

2392
01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.253
<v Speaker 3>I was home a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will watch these kids fight and play </v>

2393
01:50:56.171 --> 01:50:59.880
<v Speaker 3>in the playground and it was just like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still think certain areas do it.</v>

2394
01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:01.750
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2395
01:51:01.751 --> 01:51:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I think that when.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2396
01:51:03.130 --> 01:51:03.963
<v Speaker 3>definitely not walking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people in New York walk way more </v>

2397
01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:07.054
<v Speaker 3>than the ones out here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like already loves doing sets than </v>

2398
01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:09.963
<v Speaker 3>walking home to his apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my favorite thing to do in New </v>

2399
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.730
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you really?</v>

2400
01:51:12.730 --> 01:51:13.563

<v Speaker 3>all the way the upper west side all the </v>

2401
01:51:16.631 --> 01:51:21.250
<v Speaker 3>way down versus go to the gym and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>have like a normal person did do that.</v>

2402
01:51:21.251 --> 01:51:22.084
<v Speaker 3>I did go to the gym that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go to crunch gym and we kill it and </v>

2403
01:51:26.891 --> 01:51:28.360
<v Speaker 3>then that night I walk home.</v>

2404
01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:29.373
<v Speaker 3>I do enjoy like hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do enjoy like walking up hills in </v>

2405
01:51:32.530 --> 01:51:35.530
<v Speaker 3>nature and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed walking around the streets.</v>

2406
01:51:35.531 --> 01:51:37.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking airs,</v>

2407
01:51:37.450 --> 01:51:40.910

<v Speaker 3>breathing in brake dust,</v>

2408
01:51:43.050 --> 01:51:45.700
<v Speaker 3>texts and drives right into you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 3>walking.</v>

2410
01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:51.940
<v Speaker 3>She and a couple of people running </v>
<v Speaker 3>lights lately.</v>

2411
01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 3>It's Buki.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange.</v>

2412
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:56.500
<v Speaker 3>I stopped me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw a girl get hit by a car.</v>

2413
01:51:57.730 --> 01:52:00.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like we were in the car.</v>

2414
01:52:00.670 --> 01:52:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Guy was making a left girls crossing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>

2415
01:52:03.190 --> 01:52:05.320
<v Speaker 3>This guy obviously in the wrong making </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left.</v>

2416
01:52:06.010 --> 01:52:08.200
<v Speaker 3>She was on her phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

2417
01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:11.320
<v Speaker 3>before she crossed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made the left.</v>

2418
01:52:11.321 --> 01:52:13.960
<v Speaker 3>He must have been on his phone and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>did not hard,</v>

2419
01:52:13.961 --> 01:52:14.794
<v Speaker 3>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he realized and it was just like she </v>

2420
01:52:15.881 --> 01:52:18.070
<v Speaker 3>went down like a sack of potatoes and me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my niece were like,</v>

2421
01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:18.970
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

2422
01:52:18.970 --> 01:52:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we just got out the help because we</v>

2423
01:52:21.311 --> 01:52:23.770
<v Speaker 3>didn't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you not see that?</v>

2424
01:52:23.771 --> 01:52:27.010
<v Speaker 3>How did he not see her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did people sometimes are not fucking</v>

2425
01:52:27.011 --> 01:52:28.510
<v Speaker 3>paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make any sense.</v>

2426
01:52:28.511 --> 01:52:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Just drifting off and people just so </v>
<v Speaker 3>tired.</v>

2427
01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:34.750
<v Speaker 3>They're like barely paying attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing.</v>

2428
01:52:34.751 --> 01:52:36.670
<v Speaker 3>They're just working all day and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>so tired.</v>

2429
01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:41.740
<v Speaker 3>I walk home from the store a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maniac.</v>

2430
01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:46.820
<v Speaker 3>I try to because the parking that dry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I just have a spot at the store,</v>

2431
01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:47.893
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if I do the store in the factory </v>

2432
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:50.810
<v Speaker 3>because then you can walk down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>

2433
01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:53.060
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of times I'll,</v>

2434
01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.220
<v Speaker 3>if I have both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will park at the store,</v>

2435
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:57.320
<v Speaker 3>walk to the factory and then walk back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2436
01:52:57.321 --> 01:52:59.730
<v Speaker 3>sunset is if there's going to be a spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>

2437
01:52:59.870 --> 01:53:00.350
<v Speaker 3>what else?</v>

2438
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Melrose and sunset in Santa Monica </v>
<v Speaker 3>Boulevard.</v>

2439
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:06.060
<v Speaker 3>People walked down there and then people</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk on the promenade,</v>

2440
01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:09.170
<v Speaker 3>that little Santa Monica and they walked</v>
<v Speaker 3>down there.</v>

2441
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Venice people walk around Venice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you walk in Hollywood,</v>

2442
01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:13.970
<v Speaker 3>people look at you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

2443
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:16.550
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like walking around with some hookers.</v>

2444
01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I have a car and I am a hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to make extra money in there.</v>

2445
01:53:20.110 --> 01:53:22.940
<v Speaker 3>It is weird when you're walking around </v>
<v Speaker 3>or driving around in Hollywood,</v>

2446
01:53:22.941 --> 01:53:24.520
<v Speaker 3>you don't see a lot of people walking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2447
01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:25.473
<v Speaker 3>Only on certain areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said at the Hollywood </v>

2448
01:53:27.021 --> 01:53:28.500
<v Speaker 3>boulevard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're going to sightsee,</v>

2449
01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:30.920
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonder how much that's shaped.</v>

2450
01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2451
01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:34.550
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the personality of people that live</v>

2452
01:53:34.551 --> 01:53:38.510
<v Speaker 3>in La is the fact that people were in </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars early on because the transportation</v>

2453
01:53:38.511 --> 01:53:40.340
<v Speaker 3>system sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

2454
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:42.650
<v Speaker 3>But like I didn't have a license when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>first moved here.</v>

2455
01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:44.990
<v Speaker 3>I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no,</v>

2456
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:45.853
<v Speaker 3>I mean I tried to learn how to drive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to get my sister Karen to take </v>

2457
01:53:48.381 --> 01:53:49.214
<v Speaker 3>me to get a license,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she missed the exit and she got </v>

2458
01:53:50.451 --> 01:53:54.110
<v Speaker 3>angry so she literally was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God kill us all.</v>

2459
01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:57.200
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2460
01:53:57.201 --> 01:53:58.580
<v Speaker 3>anger issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously,</v>

2461
01:53:58.581 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 3>I hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So forgive her.</v>

2462
01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I love my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2463
01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:03.653
<v Speaker 3>bring it up to her every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was onstage and I told that story and </v>

2464
01:54:06.951 --> 01:54:07.784
<v Speaker 3>she was here with her daughter visiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>for Mother's Day and I started to tell </v>

2465
01:54:10.821 --> 01:54:12.320
<v Speaker 3>the story and I heard her go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2466
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:16.640
<v Speaker 3>this story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2467

<v Speaker 3>we're tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she was my.</v>

2468
01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:20.840

<v Speaker 3>She taught me everything.</v>

2469
01:54:20.841 --> 01:54:21.674
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Karen,</v>

<v Speaker 3>alike.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And he did he have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2516
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:07.590
<v Speaker 3>a nice little curl going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I know what he did.</v>

2517
01:56:07.650 --> 01:56:10.590
<v Speaker 3>I tell what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not my business.</v>

2518
01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:11.424
<v Speaker 3>So I was just talking to them because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was trying to get you to go to work for </v>

2519
01:56:13.201 --> 01:56:14.034
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2520
01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:16.410
<v Speaker 3>he was literally just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the bus came.</v>

2521
01:56:16.411 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 3>As I went to get on the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pulled me off the bus.</v>

2522
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:20.574
<v Speaker 3>Two undercover cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had him on the ground with guns in </v>

2523
01:56:22.501 --> 01:56:23.490
<v Speaker 3>his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2524
01:56:23.850 --> 01:56:25.820
<v Speaker 3>what's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they grabbed my bags.</v>

2525
01:56:25.821 --> 01:56:27.510
<v Speaker 3>She started going through my bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2526
01:56:27.511 --> 01:56:29.020
<v Speaker 3>you can't go through my bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2527
01:56:29.090 --> 01:56:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I started panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2528
01:56:30.301 --> 01:56:32.820
<v Speaker 3>you can't go through my bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know me?</v>

2529
01:56:32.821 --> 01:56:33.654
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why were you talking to him as he tried </v>

2530
01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:37.260
<v Speaker 3>you work for him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at,</v>

2531
01:56:37.261 --> 01:56:41.090
<v Speaker 3>I have a giant overage size gray sweater</v>
<v Speaker 3>on black tights,</v>

2532
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 3>a comedy store t shirt.</v>

2533
01:56:42.210 --> 01:56:43.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I know?</v>

2534
01:56:43.831 --> 01:56:47.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not working for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that girl with her pussy hanging out</v>

2535
01:56:47.551 --> 01:56:49.110
<v Speaker 3>of her skirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's working for him,</v>

2536
01:56:49.111 --> 01:56:49.944
<v Speaker 3>not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they were on the other side of the </v>

2537
01:56:51.031 --> 01:56:52.260
<v Speaker 3>street and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get down.</v>

2538
01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:55.290
<v Speaker 3>So they're screaming at me and are going</v>
<v Speaker 3>through my bag and I'm like,</v>

2539
01:56:55.291 --> 01:56:56.124
<v Speaker 3>you really can't go through my bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm panicked and then things just </v>

2540
01:56:59.701 --> 01:57:01.410
<v Speaker 3>started screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking questions,</v>

2541
01:57:01.411 --> 01:57:04.410
<v Speaker 3>did you or is he trying to recruit you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you work for him?</v>

2542
01:57:04.590 --> 01:57:06.540
<v Speaker 3>And he's literally on the ground guns </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawn.</v>

2543
01:57:06.541 --> 01:57:07.374
<v Speaker 3>He did nothing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All he did was say I should be in a </v>

2544
01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:10.920
<v Speaker 3>cadillac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

2545
01:57:11.130 --> 01:57:12.030
<v Speaker 3>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2546
01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:14.190
<v Speaker 3>you gotta calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

2547
01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:15.053
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be late for work and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get fired in this God's good </v>

2548
01:57:17.491 --> 01:57:18.324
<v Speaker 3>guns in his face and I'm worried about </v>
<v Speaker 3>my weight and tables at the comedy </v>

2549
01:57:20.971 --> 01:57:21.390
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

2550
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:22.223
<v Speaker 3>So then finally they let him go and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so pissed and I'm getting my stuff </v>

2551
01:57:25.850 --> 01:57:28.410
<v Speaker 3>and put my bag together and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is bullshit.</v>

2552
01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.170
<v Speaker 3>But I was afraid to talk back to a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

2553
01:57:31.230 --> 01:57:33.060
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like inside me.</v>

2554
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.340
<v Speaker 3>And then they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want us to drive you to work?</v>

2555
01:57:35.341 --> 01:57:36.660
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2556
01:57:36.661 --> 01:57:38.220
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to drive me to work.</v>

2557
01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:39.330
<v Speaker 3>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we pull up,</v>

2558
01:57:39.331 --> 01:57:42.750
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell Mitzi shore I got picked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>for prostitution and that's why I had to</v>

2559
01:57:42.751 --> 01:57:47.751
<v Speaker 3>get here late in about 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Debbie,</v>

2560
01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:50.873
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took,</v>

2561
01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.840
<v Speaker 3>I did take the ride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Mitzi wasn't there that night.</v>

2562
01:57:54.841 --> 01:57:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Debbie,</v>

2563
01:57:55.831 --> 01:57:59.050
<v Speaker 3>the manager did see me get out of a cop </v>
<v Speaker 3>car and she's like the,</v>

2564
01:57:59.490 --> 01:58:00.323
<v Speaker 3>she's undercover waitress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why she doesn't get fired even </v>

2565
01:58:03.271 --> 01:58:04.104
<v Speaker 3>though she's late.</v>

2566
01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.033
<v Speaker 3>She's still crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitzi let me be the boss because I was </v>

2567
01:58:08.701 --> 01:58:09.540
<v Speaker 3>always late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2568
01:58:09.541 --> 01:58:10.374
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

2569
01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:11.273
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy story because it shows </v>

2570
01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:14.553
<v Speaker 3>people what it's like to be poor and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealt with by the cops when they know </v>

2571
01:58:17.821 --> 01:58:19.080
<v Speaker 3>that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do anything.</v>

2572
01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:20.770
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2573
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:22.980
<v Speaker 3>it'd be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2574
01:58:23.090 --> 01:58:26.010
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I panicked when they go through your bag</v>

2575
01:58:26.011 --> 01:58:26.844
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything goes through your head and </v>

2576
01:58:28.351 --> 01:58:29.970
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I packing tonight?</v>

2577
01:58:29.971 --> 01:58:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Am I this right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what am I doing?</v>

2578
01:58:31.501 --> 01:58:33.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like scared and,</v>

2579
01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:35.820
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have no rights most of the time.</v>

2580
01:58:35.821 --> 01:58:36.654
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that you don't have any </v>

2581
01:58:37.531 --> 01:58:39.730
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's legal know,</v>

2582
01:58:39.810 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 3>but if you resist and you fight back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to</v>

2583
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:42.910
<v Speaker 1>get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

2584
01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:44.890
<v Speaker 1>I've been thrown in the back of a paddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>wagon.</v>

2585
01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I've tried both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't.</v>

2586
01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I've seen guys get beaten good friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2587
01:58:52.170 --> 01:58:53.003
<v Speaker 1>like and just in a nightclub just from </v>
<v Speaker 1>resisting and it was a stupid thing we </v>

2588
01:58:56.051 --> 01:58:59.450
<v Speaker 1>were doing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seen it.</v>

2589
01:58:59.530 --> 01:59:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I've seen both ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2590
01:59:01.810 --> 01:59:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Jobs are stressed the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2591
01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:08.050
<v Speaker 1>In a bad situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in your situation like that was,</v>

2592
01:59:08.650 --> 01:59:11.200
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you're doing is talking to a guy and</v>

2593
01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:13.480
<v Speaker 1>then you're getting on a bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact they grabbed you like that,</v>

2594
01:59:13.481 --> 01:59:14.314
<v Speaker 1>but how many white girls talked to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that aren't working for them and </v>

2595
01:59:18.611 --> 01:59:21.330
<v Speaker 1>their defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for sure this bitch knows it.</v>

2596
01:59:21.590 --> 01:59:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Look how comfortable she is with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not even freaking out.</v>

2597
01:59:24.341 --> 01:59:26.800
<v Speaker 1>She's got to be a hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2598
01:59:26.801 --> 01:59:28.010
<v Speaker 1>she's joking around with him.</v>

2599
01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:29.530
<v Speaker 1>You got a cadillac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got one.</v>

2600
01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Like they're negotiating terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>

2601
01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.573
<v Speaker 1>He was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they figured if you talking to a </v>

2602
01:59:36.581 --> 01:59:39.250
<v Speaker 1>pimp and you're not freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure,</v>

2603
01:59:39.251 --> 01:59:40.210
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2604
01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he might not get another </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl who's like,</v>

2605
01:59:43.301 --> 01:59:45.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl can be molded.</v>

2606
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Her mind can be molded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2607
01:59:47.670 --> 01:59:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to turn tricks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>overbite.</v>

2608
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:55.270
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden I feel like my overbite </v>
<v Speaker 1>has gotten bigger.</v>

2609
01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:56.133
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2610
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:57.183
<v Speaker 1>The Guy can't take ag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't recruit girls and have them do </v>

2611
02:00:00.581 --> 02:00:01.414
<v Speaker 1>sex for money for him and protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a pimp does to prostitutes </v>

2612
02:00:04.361 --> 02:00:05.680
<v Speaker 1>and prostitutes and illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2613
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>But you could recruit girls to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos of them having sex.</v>

2614
02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Like you can have people that can even </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay you immediate money though.</v>

2615
02:00:18.221 --> 02:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prostitution is like white and taste.</v>

2616
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I can totally be immediate money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make people pay,</v>

2617
02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:28.100
<v Speaker 1>make people pay to have sex with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

2618
02:00:28.330 --> 02:00:29.163
<v Speaker 1>Somebody make a video of it saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just what my point is like </v>

2619
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:34.343
<v Speaker 1>pimps right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the certain pimping that's like the </v>

2620
02:00:36.881 --> 02:00:37.714
<v Speaker 1>word pimping is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you decide that women are too </v>

2621
02:00:41.171 --> 02:00:42.004
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to except a mentor figure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strong sexually overcharged black </v>

2622
02:00:48.011 --> 02:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>man with the feathers and the gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>chains.</v>

2623
02:00:50.590 --> 02:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially with this.</v>

2624
02:00:52.990 --> 02:00:53.823
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he owns like a brothel in like </v>

2625
02:00:58.270 --> 02:01:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Nevada or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's okay.</v>

2626
02:01:01.410 --> 02:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Pay Taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a less dangerous for the girl.</v>

2627
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was poor.</v>

2628
02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:07.473
<v Speaker 1>She could get done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's anything wrong </v>

2629
02:01:09.761 --> 02:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>with any of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

2630
02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prostitution is a fucking weird one.</v>

2631
02:01:14.530 --> 02:01:15.363
<v Speaker 1>It is a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pimping isn't even weirder one because </v>

2632
02:01:17.051 --> 02:01:19.990
<v Speaker 1>that guy's not fucking anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's even weird.</v>

2633
02:01:20.110 --> 02:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>He just got a bunch of friends with </v>
<v Speaker 1>money that likes to give him money.</v>

2634
02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:25.360
<v Speaker 1>He talks to these girls who do stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's illegal.</v>

2635
02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>He does stuff with the girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2636
02:01:29.411 --> 02:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>But he's not doing anything to get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2637
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a real pimp,</v>

2638
02:01:33.190 --> 02:01:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

2639
02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting back,</v>

<v Speaker 3>dudes like pimps up hoes down.</v>

2644
02:01:46.881 --> 02:01:48.560

<v Speaker 3>Nails.</v>

2645
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:49.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had,</v>

2646
02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:50.673
<v Speaker 3>but there was other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other nails were substantially </v>

2647
02:01:51.801 --> 02:01:53.750
<v Speaker 3>longer than the average person works </v>
<v Speaker 3>nine to five job,</v>

2648
02:01:54.730 --> 02:01:57.610
<v Speaker 3>so they have this whole thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they do?</v>

2649
02:01:57.611 --> 02:01:58.444
<v Speaker 3>An illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they're doing illegal as being a </v>

2650
02:01:59.691 --> 02:02:00.920
<v Speaker 3>pimp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>C,</v>

2651
02:02:00.921 --> 02:02:01.754
<v Speaker 3>the actual act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the illegal act is being done by the </v>

2652
02:02:03.831 --> 02:02:07.610
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman is the woman is a prostitute.</v>

2653
02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:08.653
<v Speaker 3>She is deciding as a grown adult to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and have illegal sex with men and </v>

2654
02:02:12.951 --> 02:02:13.784
<v Speaker 3>then comes back and brings the money to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pimp and the pimp did really do </v>

2655
02:02:17.181 --> 02:02:18.014
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just got the girl to give him his </v>

2656
02:02:18.861 --> 02:02:21.140
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times these girls are under age</v>

2657
02:02:21.141 --> 02:02:21.770
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>

2658
02:02:21.770 --> 02:02:22.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>

2659
02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:24.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very different story.</v>

2660
02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:29.270
<v Speaker 3>Only flattering thing about the story is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the guy thought I was under fishes.</v>

2661
02:02:29.271 --> 02:02:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it until it gets manicures.</v>

2662
02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.700
<v Speaker 3>He's fresh look or they're not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fresh.</v>

2663
02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:37.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty long stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Snoop Dogg.</v>

2664
02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.920
<v Speaker 3>He can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can do no wrong.</v>

2665
02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:43.160
<v Speaker 3>What he did the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing the way he led the.</v>

2666
02:02:43.710 --> 02:02:44.543
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a protest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like we're going to go talk to </v>

2667
02:02:46.371 --> 02:02:49.490
<v Speaker 3>our officials and figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how we can make peace,</v>

2668
02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:50.593
<v Speaker 3>how we can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was good because having the </v>

2669
02:02:52.191 --> 02:02:53.930
<v Speaker 3>game did it and a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>followed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That nailed thing is weird though.</v>

2673
02:03:00.081 --> 02:03:03.080
<v Speaker 3>And then yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even my now I don't even get manicures.</v>

2674
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:05.180

<v Speaker 3>hoes down.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Pimps up.</v>

2676
02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:10.370

2680

<v Speaker 3>sitting on the bench and I always </v>
<v Speaker 3>wondered was it him?</v>

2685
02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:32.113
<v Speaker 3>route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rant about how he is just a pimp and </v>

2686
02:03:34.971 --> 02:03:37.730
<v Speaker 3>he's not really a rapper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never really been a rapper.</v>

2687

<v Speaker 3>Reckless eyeballing.</v>

2692
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:59.540
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This show,</v>

2693
02:03:59.570 --> 02:04:00.403
<v Speaker 3>this documentary was one of my favorites</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the other guy we liked film </v>

2694
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:04.640
<v Speaker 3>fillmore slim.</v>

2695
02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:09.110
<v Speaker 3>I just loved how he would come to la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got his.</v>

2696
02:04:09.111 --> 02:04:10.900
<v Speaker 3>All his girls got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2697
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:15.560
<v Speaker 3>you thought that was my first track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got another track quit and he was on a</v>

2698
02:04:15.561 --> 02:04:17.900
<v Speaker 3>payphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He brought into the team.</v>

2699
02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:21.320
<v Speaker 3>They took out the beach here and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent the 18 down second.</v>

2700
02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:22.873
<v Speaker 3>So y'all not the long hose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Ron Hoes like they were playing busy </v>

2701
02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:28.280
<v Speaker 3>booking nam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>

2702
02:04:28.281 --> 02:04:29.330
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2703
02:04:29.331 --> 02:04:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I love this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They played games.</v>

2704
02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:34.520
<v Speaker 3>We were obsessed with that show that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary.</v>

2705
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:35.683
<v Speaker 3>Obviously there's sadness to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no one wants a girl to be a </v>

2706
02:04:37.801 --> 02:04:38.370
<v Speaker 3>prostitute.</v>

2707
02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:43.370
<v Speaker 1>So much sadness to the girl gets zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage.</v>

2708
02:04:43.501 --> 02:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what I remember learning that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2709
02:04:45.451 --> 02:04:46.980
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>

2710
02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:47.843
<v Speaker 1>honestly and truthfully isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't a lot of what's wrong with </v>

2711
02:04:51.361 --> 02:04:52.680
<v Speaker 1>prostitution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>

2712
02:04:52.681 --> 02:04:56.430
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our idea about it like are forbidden,</v>

2713
02:04:56.490 --> 02:04:59.850
<v Speaker 1>taught like it's forbidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's taboo.</v>

2714
02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:00.773
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to get money for sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to the fact that it's illegal </v>

2715
02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:07.260
<v Speaker 1>because if it was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

2716
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:09.990
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the same amount of people would</v>

2717
02:05:09.991 --> 02:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>be doing it no more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more.</v>

2718
02:05:13.730 --> 02:05:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be more the same amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people would be doing prostitution or</v>

2719
02:05:18.270 --> 02:05:20.970
<v Speaker 1>going to prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying doing prostitution,</v>

2720
02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>doing it just would be busier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>busier,</v>

2721
02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:25.113
<v Speaker 1>busier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same be the same people that </v>

2722
02:05:28.491 --> 02:05:29.324
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean?</v>

2723
02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Heidi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling it probably would be more people</v>

2724
02:05:31.051 --> 02:05:32.910
<v Speaker 1>because I know a lot of girls that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

2725
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:34.370
<v Speaker 1>If it was illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2726
02:05:35.230 --> 02:05:36.063
<v Speaker 1>I can calm them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be working with Kim is what I'm </v>

2727
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:46.980
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if it was legal.</v>

2728
02:05:47.210 --> 02:05:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was accepted in legal,</v>

2729
02:05:50.401 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it would definitely more people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do it.</v>

2730
02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:54.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I was a girl,</v>

2731
02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:55.333
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely fuck guys that I was </v>

2732
02:05:57.210 --> 02:06:01.260
<v Speaker 1>attracted to for money track guy and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2733
02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:02.041
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2734
02:06:02.041 --> 02:06:02.874
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give you two grand if you </v>

2735
02:06:06.210 --> 02:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>fucking sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in a relationship.</v>

2736
02:06:11.941 --> 02:06:15.330
<v Speaker 1>One time I remember like getting in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument with my boyfriend because after</v>

2737
02:06:15.331 --> 02:06:20.160
<v Speaker 1>we had sex he gave me money and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate and he was like,</v>

2738
02:06:20.161 --> 02:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was for something and like he was</v>

2739
02:06:22.971 --> 02:06:23.311
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2740
02:06:23.311 --> 02:06:25.740
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go get this today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was.</v>

2741
02:06:26.070 --> 02:06:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was something for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was,</v>

2742
02:06:28.081 --> 02:06:31.230
<v Speaker 1>but it was money yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like prostitute.</v>

2743
02:06:31.231 --> 02:06:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Like when he left I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2744
02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>that didn't feel that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should do this more often.</v>

2745
02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:39.210
<v Speaker 1>If you really liked guys kidding me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in a relationship,</v>

2746
02:06:39.211 --> 02:06:41.010
<v Speaker 1>but it was just a weird moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>

2747
02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:43.920
<v Speaker 1>oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying if you love the guy,</v>

2748
02:06:44.130 --> 02:06:46.350
<v Speaker 1>like you get to things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like Dick and then money.</v>

2749
02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That order.</v>

2750
02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Usually people get paid for jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they love or people can pay for the jobs</v>

2751
02:06:54.301 --> 02:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>that they hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2752
02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:56.730
<v Speaker 1>How about getting paperwork done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love.</v>

2753
02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like movie stars get paid.</v>

2754
02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:00.840
<v Speaker 1>They get paid for being moved and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it.</v>

2755
02:07:00.841 --> 02:07:01.674
<v Speaker 1>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out there acting explosions </v>

2756
02:07:02.911 --> 02:07:04.950
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get more with your pace it out.</v>

2757
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

2758
02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I brought it.</v>

2759
02:07:09.330 --> 02:07:10.163
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that we're going to rally to </v>

2760
02:07:13.681 --> 02:07:16.170
<v Speaker 1>make this legal so that Kim and I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do.</v>

2761
02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:18.563
<v Speaker 1>It's eventually going to be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting and might </v>

2762
02:07:20.281 --> 02:07:22.860
<v Speaker 1>turn to be like a virtual thing before </v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes legal.</v>

2763
02:07:22.861 --> 02:07:23.694
<v Speaker 1>If what I'm been thinking about what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying about the poor and the </v>

2764
02:07:26.551 --> 02:07:29.490
<v Speaker 1>virtual poem with the headsets on being </v>
<v Speaker 1>so interactive and immersive.</v>

2765
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2766
02:07:30.421 --> 02:07:31.254
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just what's going to happen and </v>

2767
02:07:32.341 --> 02:07:33.750
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it.</v>

2768
02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>They're going to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulate your body.</v>

2769
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the only thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing.</v>

2770
02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:38.453
<v Speaker 2>Like once they stimulate your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they will be able to put you in </v>

2771
02:07:40.061 --> 02:07:43.360
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a trance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you feel like it's stimulating your</v>

2772
02:07:43.361 --> 02:07:44.194
<v Speaker 2>body already in a trance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also looking at some thing that they're </v>

2773
02:07:46.331 --> 02:07:47.164
<v Speaker 2>selling really recently got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember this because I </v>

2774
02:07:49.210 --> 02:07:50.590
<v Speaker 2>saved it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't read it,</v>

2775
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:51.783
<v Speaker 2>but it was talking about some new device</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's able to stimulate certain areas </v>

2776
02:07:56.621 --> 02:07:59.470
<v Speaker 2>of the mind from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the outside of your head,</v>

2777
02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:04.660
<v Speaker 2>like they did a whole episode of radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>lab about this sort of technology a long</v>

2778
02:08:04.661 --> 02:08:07.090
<v Speaker 2>time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say like two years ago maybe.</v>

2779
02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And it was really interesting because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was about,</v>

2780
02:08:09.041 --> 02:08:09.874
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they stimulate different parts of </v>

2781
02:08:12.161 --> 02:08:12.994
<v Speaker 2>your scalp and through doing so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows you to remember and learn things </v>

2782
02:08:16.601 --> 02:08:19.590
<v Speaker 2>way quicker through electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is it,</v>

2783
02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:22.190
<v Speaker 2>nine volt nirvana as the episode of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Radio Lab.</v>

2784
02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:24.550
<v Speaker 2>If you guys have never listened to radio</v>
<v Speaker 2>lab,</v>

2785
02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:25.563
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best podcasts in the </v>

2786
02:08:28.211 --> 02:08:30.030
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2787
02:08:30.220 --> 02:08:31.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>

2788
02:08:31.841 --> 02:08:34.780
<v Speaker 2>And this is like one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes because it's about this girl,</v>

2789
02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:36.370
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how it starts off.</v>

2790
02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:38.380
<v Speaker 2>She works for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say woman,</v>

2791
02:08:38.381 --> 02:08:39.610
<v Speaker 2>she's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has a good job.</v>

2792
02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:40.444
<v Speaker 2>She's a</v>

2793
02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:44.170
<v Speaker 5>sure child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not good.</v>

2794
02:08:44.171 --> 02:08:46.740
<v Speaker 5>I say girl boy for adults all the time</v>

2795
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:48.800
<v Speaker 2>and I should fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2796
02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Who Care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Full battery.</v>

2797
02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she went there to um,</v>

2798
02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:57.050
<v Speaker 2>this place that train snipers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snipers skills,</v>

2799
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:58.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2800
02:08:59.150 --> 02:09:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>

2801
02:09:00.201 --> 02:09:02.030
<v Speaker 2>is a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a virtual reality thing.</v>

2802
02:09:02.031 --> 02:09:04.820
<v Speaker 2>So you put on the headset or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2803
02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:05.673
<v Speaker 2>they take her through the thing with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gun and she shoots at all the different </v>

2804
02:09:08.121 --> 02:09:10.520
<v Speaker 2>targets and all these different events </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen in front of her.</v>

2805
02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:14.030
<v Speaker 2>And when it plays out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after it's over,</v>

2806
02:09:14.090 --> 02:09:17.600
<v Speaker 2>they tally up your score.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she does that in a normal way.</v>

2807
02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:20.390
<v Speaker 2>And then they stimulate the outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas of her brain.</v>

2808
02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:21.733
<v Speaker 2>She goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be 20 minutes if they </v>

2809
02:09:24.021 --> 02:09:25.280
<v Speaker 2>end it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

2810
02:09:25.281 --> 02:09:27.260
<v Speaker 2>why'd you guys ended so quick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>

2811
02:09:27.261 --> 02:09:28.970
<v Speaker 2>that was 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

2812
02:09:28.971 --> 02:09:31.190
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she hit every target.</v>

2813
02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

2814
02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:33.273
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she went from being completely </v>

2815
02:09:34.461 --> 02:09:35.294
<v Speaker 2>ineffective to being like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>world class sniper by just them jazzing </v>

2816
02:09:39.441 --> 02:09:43.010
<v Speaker 2>or brain up and she went into the zone </v>
<v Speaker 2>where she didn't even know she was doing</v>

2817
02:09:43.011 --> 02:09:44.240
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So think about that.</v>

2818
02:09:44.241 --> 02:09:47.810
<v Speaker 2>She'd never done this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She sucked at it just a few minutes ago.</v>

2819
02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:48.913
<v Speaker 2>They put these electrodes on their head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give it to her and then all of a </v>

2820
02:09:50.541 --> 02:09:51.130
<v Speaker 2>sudden she's like,</v>

2821
02:09:51.130 --> 02:09:53.660
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like a super soldier.</v>

2822
02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:55.180
<v Speaker 5>Is there any science today?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2823
02:09:55.210 --> 02:09:56.043
<v Speaker 5>is there somebody that's tested this </v>
<v Speaker 5>because why aren't we all just putting </v>

2824
02:09:58.191 --> 02:09:59.780
<v Speaker 5>nine volt batteries on her head?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2825
02:09:59.781 --> 02:10:01.370
<v Speaker 5>they are testing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called,</v>

2826
02:10:01.371 --> 02:10:05.720
<v Speaker 5>what is the actual term?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Transdermal electrical stimulation.</v>

2827
02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:10.490
<v Speaker 5>Dermal cranial volt batteries at home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hold on a second.</v>

2828
02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:11.141
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say it again?</v>

2829
02:10:11.141 --> 02:10:14.720
<v Speaker 5>I lost the word city in a trans </v>
<v Speaker 5>transdermal cranial stimulation,</v>

2830
02:10:14.721 --> 02:10:15.710
<v Speaker 5>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to.</v>

2831
02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that direct current stimulation.</v>

2832
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:19.010
<v Speaker 2>That sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2833
02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is apparently,</v>

2834
02:10:21.850 --> 02:10:22.683
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of guys who hacked </v>

2835
02:10:23.301 --> 02:10:24.430
<v Speaker 2>themselves and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2836
02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:25.293
<v Speaker 2>they make their own little things with </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine volt batteries and shit that you </v>

2837
02:10:27.081 --> 02:10:27.914
<v Speaker 2>could buy from radio shack and they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>slap a little electrodes on their head </v>

2838
02:10:30.771 --> 02:10:35.510
<v Speaker 2>and sap themselves sometimes kills her </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of smell for a week.</v>

2839
02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I cook my sense of smell today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2840
02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:41.300
<v Speaker 2>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not joking like great,</v>

2841
02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:42.163
<v Speaker 2>but they get benefits out of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people were there reporting </v>

2842
02:10:44.451 --> 02:10:45.284
<v Speaker 2>benefits out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like find a spot on the body or the </v>

2843
02:10:48.591 --> 02:10:49.424
<v Speaker 2>brain rather where they get it from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside and it makes some sort of an </v>

2844
02:10:51.591 --> 02:10:54.350
<v Speaker 2>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about your skull,</v>

2845
02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:56.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about your skin and your skull.</v>

2846
02:10:56.150 --> 02:10:56.983
<v Speaker 2>If somebody shaved a part of your head </v>
<v Speaker 2>and attached some shit to the side of </v>

2847
02:10:59.781 --> 02:11:04.310
<v Speaker 2>your head and then shot electricity into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that area,</v>

2848
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:06.530
<v Speaker 2>like your brain's going to be affected </v>
<v Speaker 2>by that.</v>

2849
02:11:06.930 --> 02:11:07.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like pounded on the outside of the </v>

2850
02:11:10.371 --> 02:11:11.204
<v Speaker 2>brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's got to be some of it that's </v>

2851
02:11:12.141 --> 02:11:13.100
<v Speaker 2>going through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2852
02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:16.320
<v Speaker 2>He's got to be some energy that's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through and that brain's like,</v>

2853
02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:18.613
<v Speaker 2>I know Kung Fu like in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting like maybe even like </v>

02:12:43.131 --> 02:12:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time he fucked me up.</v>

2881
02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:50.690
<v Speaker 2>He's just better quake.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is it right here.</v>

2883
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:52.123
<v Speaker 2>This is the newest version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you play in the first person and it </v>

2884
02:12:55.821 --> 02:12:59.810
<v Speaker 2>is fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new ones are unbelievably cool.</v>

2886
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:05.803

2887
02:13:07.491 --> 02:13:09.890
<v Speaker 2>actually playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just magical.</v>

2888
02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Look at this shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

2890

<v Speaker 2>Real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real life.</v>

2891
02:13:16.130 --> 02:13:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Suck my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this way better than real life.</v>

2892
02:13:19.290 --> 02:13:23.570
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't pretend.</v>

2893
02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:24.433
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2894
02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that someone shot,</v>

2895
02:13:27.710 --> 02:13:29.690
<v Speaker 2>oh my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illinois.</v>

2896
02:13:29.691 --> 02:13:34.691
<v Speaker 2>You would be so aggressive with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know you are so aggressive.</v>

2897
02:13:36.250 --> 02:13:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't know.</v>

2898
02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:38.520
<v Speaker 2>We haven't told them yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you are.</v>

2899
02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:43.560
<v Speaker 2>That's how I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this tremendous things.</v>

2900
02:13:43.590 --> 02:13:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it's out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2901
02:13:44.670 --> 02:13:47.550
<v Speaker 2>This is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was an old game you used to play.</v>

2902
02:13:47.551 --> 02:13:48.750
<v Speaker 2>That is now will.</v>

2903
02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:52.140
<v Speaker 2>They will obviously significantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>upgraded the graphics.</v>

2904
02:13:52.141 --> 02:13:55.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not really the game itself.</v>

2905
02:13:55.411 --> 02:14:00.411
<v Speaker 2>This is just the video game engine knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game is based on so this is similar,</v>

2906
02:14:02.190 --> 02:14:04.850
<v Speaker 2>so violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's similar to the solid,</v>

2907
02:14:05.090 --> 02:14:07.290
<v Speaker 2>like in game real footage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

2908
02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stabbed him with a fucking chainsaw.</v>

2909
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:13.143
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How great would that be if you had that </v>

2910
02:14:15.841 --> 02:14:19.950
<v Speaker 2>real life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a lot of trouble.</v>

2911
02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:23.920
<v Speaker 2>When does that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young Jamie just announced it.</v>

2912
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:25.223
<v Speaker 2>I would guess next year just announced a</v>
<v Speaker 2>set of three and this is a big </v>

2913
02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:30.090
<v Speaker 2>announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn,</v>

2914
02:14:30.091 --> 02:14:33.390
<v Speaker 2>that looks they're going to announce it </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

2915
02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that and then there's doom which</v>

2916
02:14:36.331 --> 02:14:39.030
<v Speaker 2>is out and that's what we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the land party plan.</v>

2917
02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a new doom that's based on.</v>

2918
02:14:40.951 --> 02:14:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's full.</v>

2919
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:46.650
<v Speaker 2>So when you say you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying?</v>

2920
02:14:46.650 --> 02:14:48.450
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a land land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2921
02:14:48.451 --> 02:14:51.080
<v Speaker 2>local area network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lan Party.</v>

2922
02:14:51.930 --> 02:14:55.320
<v Speaker 2>A local area network party is you get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of computers.</v>

2923
02:14:55.321 --> 02:15:00.210
<v Speaker 2>You linked them all together so that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have zero ping so there's no latency.</v>

2924
02:15:00.211 --> 02:15:02.610
<v Speaker 2>What that means is like when you play a </v>
<v Speaker 2>game online,</v>

2925
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:05.700
<v Speaker 2>like at least in the older games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting way better at it now and</v>

2926
02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:06.733
<v Speaker 2>internet speeds are way higher anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you would press a button like </v>

2927
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.863
<v Speaker 2>try to shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a delay between the time that </v>

2928
02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:12.953
<v Speaker 2>the signal got to the server that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hosting the game and if you were lucky </v>

2929
02:15:16.111 --> 02:15:19.410
<v Speaker 2>you had like a low paying like guys had </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 30 paying or a 20 page and you're</v>

2930
02:15:19.411 --> 02:15:22.830
<v Speaker 2>like whoa guys got an awesome paying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like then it got even lower so some guys</v>

2931
02:15:22.831 --> 02:15:23.664
<v Speaker 2>get cable modems and shit and it got </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to like 10 and if you were local </v>

2932
02:15:26.701 --> 02:15:28.410
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was zero ping.</v>

2933
02:15:28.590 --> 02:15:31.410
<v Speaker 2>So like if we were all together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're playing in this room,</v>

2934
02:15:31.411 --> 02:15:34.830
<v Speaker 2>we would play against each other in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy three d environment like this.</v>

2935
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.570
<v Speaker 2>This is what we would see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed it.</v>

2936
02:15:36.571 --> 02:15:39.960
<v Speaker 2>This is like a lawn parties and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>real end game footage.</v>

2937
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Game footage is fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

2938
02:15:43.410 --> 02:15:46.470
<v Speaker 2>This is all in game footage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

2939
02:15:46.530 --> 02:15:50.040
<v Speaker 2>And then some of it's not so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're mixing up but it's dope.</v>

2940
02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I played like a weird game with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>niece,</v>

2941
02:15:52.761 --> 02:15:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Shawna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what it was,</v>

2942
02:15:54.031 --> 02:15:57.000
<v Speaker 2>but there was four of us connected on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the I pads.</v>

2943
02:15:57.210 --> 02:16:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do that to tablets and stuff,</v>

2944
02:16:00.871 --> 02:16:01.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2945
02:16:02.070 --> 02:16:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Well they're probably doing that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pokemons,</v>

2946
02:16:03.631 --> 02:16:05.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of.</v>

2947
02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:06.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not direct direct that </v>

2948
02:16:07.770 --> 02:16:10.740
<v Speaker 2>person to person yet so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was cool.</v>

2949
02:16:10.741 --> 02:16:11.371
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2950
02:16:11.371 --> 02:16:12.990
<v Speaker 2>we're all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idiot.</v>

2951
02:16:13.590 --> 02:16:14.730
<v Speaker 2>This is what they're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2952
02:16:14.731 --> 02:16:15.564
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have these things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>these video games like doom and they're </v>

2953

<v Speaker 2>going to have those three d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like virtual reality sets and you're </v>

2954
02:16:21.691 --> 02:16:23.850
<v Speaker 2>going to be playing these things out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the real world.</v>

2955
02:16:23.851 --> 02:16:25.620
<v Speaker 2>That's when people are gonna start </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting run over.</v>

2956
02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to play in the real world</v>

2957
02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:31.773
<v Speaker 4>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Driving people around like Uber Service </v>

2958
02:16:34.630 --> 02:16:35.463

<v Speaker 4>I take Uber every day and that's one of </v>

2960
02:16:42.041 --> 02:16:42.874
<v Speaker 4>the greatest benefits now that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>usually you just sitting in the back of </v>

2961
02:16:44.861 --> 02:16:46.510
<v Speaker 4>an uber going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God go hurry up,</v>

2962
02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:47.373
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now I was just collecting pokemons </v>

2963
02:16:48.730 --> 02:16:50.470
<v Speaker 4>on the way to the comedy store and tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2966
02:16:52.421 --> 02:16:54.040

<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2967
02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:55.270
<v Speaker 4>I almost wanted to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2968
02:16:55.271 --> 02:16:56.800
<v Speaker 4>can you just go slow right here for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>second?</v>

2969
02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:57.813
<v Speaker 4>So as you go slow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would pick up the fact that you were </v>

2970
02:16:59.730 --> 02:17:00.221
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2971
02:17:00.221 --> 02:17:02.710
<v Speaker 4>it's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easier to go.</v>

2972
02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:05.170
<v Speaker 4>If you're going slow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easier to get things.</v>

2973
02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:07.690
<v Speaker 4>I thought I heard that you can't do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>over 30 miles an hour.</v>

2974
02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:10.900
<v Speaker 4>Like it has some sort of you you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2975
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:13.480
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's harder to do like you can't.</v>

2976
02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Like when you can't do your gps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're the driver,</v>

2977
02:17:15.791 --> 02:17:17.170
<v Speaker 4>you can't be doing this while you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving.</v>

2978
02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:19.690
<v Speaker 4>You say you're the passenger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say Shut up.</v>

2979
02:17:19.691 --> 02:17:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Mind Your Business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're probably going to have to change</v>

2980
02:17:22.571 --> 02:17:23.404
<v Speaker 4>because I feel like a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna die and get in car accidents and </v>

2981
02:17:25.721 --> 02:17:26.554
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be a lot of lawsuits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I have a feeling in the near future </v>

2982
02:17:28.541 --> 02:17:29.374
<v Speaker 4>they're probably going to make it so if </v>
<v Speaker 4>it detects that you're going a certain </v>

2983
02:17:31.511 --> 02:17:32.344
<v Speaker 4>speed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just not going to let you do </v>

2984
02:17:32.861 --> 02:17:35.950
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you get laid playing pokemon go?</v>

2985
02:17:36.550 --> 02:17:38.830
<v Speaker 4>Pokemon go is great for my mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>health.</v>

2986
02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I also got laid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2987
02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:46.240
<v Speaker 4>pokemon got me laid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got laid by telling my girl I had</v>

2988
02:17:46.241 --> 02:17:48.370
<v Speaker 4>to go inside or to catch a Pikachu.</v>

2989
02:17:49.690 --> 02:17:54.690
<v Speaker 4>Pokemon used her as a pokey ball for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>electric pokey,</v>

2990
02:17:55.151 --> 02:18:00.151
<v Speaker 4>Mongo Pokemongo hope Jesus Christ </v>
<v Speaker 4>pokemon.</v>

2991
02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:02.313
<v Speaker 4>In the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know any Japanese for pocket </v>

2992
02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:07.510
<v Speaker 4>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monster or something,</v>

2993
02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:08.353
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a cartoon or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a cartoon and then it became a </v>

2994
02:18:12.251 --> 02:18:13.084
<v Speaker 4>very successful line of video games for </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids on Nintendo and game boys and </v>

2995
02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:18.453
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was really all just preparing </v>

2996
02:18:19.421 --> 02:18:21.670
<v Speaker 4>itself for this monstrous for this </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>

2997
02:18:22.190 --> 02:18:23.023
<v Speaker 4>but it brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was dying out so that should </v>

2998
02:18:25.071 --> 02:18:27.070
<v Speaker 4>have worn my pikachu outfit today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2999
02:18:27.071 --> 02:18:27.904
<v Speaker 4>it's obviously didn't raise the stock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you say like $9 billion or </v>

3000
02:18:30.401 --> 02:18:32.140
<v Speaker 4>something crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That nine slash 11.</v>

3001
02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:37.200
<v Speaker 4>I said 11 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>11 stocks are just like they're going to</v>

3002
02:18:37.241 --> 02:18:40.440
<v Speaker 4>have all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stock in Nintendo has been hurting for a</v>

3003
02:18:40.450 --> 02:18:42.880
<v Speaker 4>while too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since have xbox and playstation and this</v>

3004
02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:43.714
<v Speaker 4>is the exact thing they needed was this </v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds like they just made a money </v>

3005
02:18:46.811 --> 02:18:47.770
<v Speaker 4>printing machine.</v>

3006
02:18:48.130 --> 02:18:48.963
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where the money comes in </v>

3007
02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:51.933
<v Speaker 4>because it's a free game now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could buy things in it like that </v>

3008
02:18:54.431 --> 02:18:57.670
<v Speaker 4>thing that you put down on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 4>that attracts pokemon.</v>

3009
02:18:57.671 --> 02:19:01.300
<v Speaker 4>All those things cost money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so just the potential,</v>

3010
02:19:01.690 --> 02:19:03.430
<v Speaker 4>the potential,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the connection that you're having.</v>

3011
02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:06.820
<v Speaker 4>If you all of a sudden created an APP </v>
<v Speaker 4>that beats twitter,</v>

3012
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:08.023
<v Speaker 4>twitter's been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you come up with something that can </v>

3013
02:19:09.671 --> 02:19:10.504
<v Speaker 4>be twitter like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could figure out how to make money </v>

3014
02:19:11.771 --> 02:19:12.850
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my God,</v>

3015
02:19:12.851 --> 02:19:14.180
<v Speaker 4>snapchat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wanted that.</v>

3016
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:17.350
<v Speaker 4>I say this but it hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twitter had that same exact problem.</v>

3017
02:19:17.351 --> 02:19:19.010
<v Speaker 4>They've had a problem like monetizing </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

3018
02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:25.810
<v Speaker 4>Snapchat just surpassed twitter and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think twitter is on their way out.</v>

3019
02:19:25.811 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pokey Mon could</v>

3020
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.903
<v Speaker 1>set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could set up like stops where like </v>

3021
02:19:31.041 --> 02:19:31.874
<v Speaker 1>you could like have places that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>places of business and you could pay to </v>

3022
02:19:36.351 --> 02:19:37.184
<v Speaker 1>have that stop and people have to go in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a certain amount of people </v>

3023
02:19:39.651 --> 02:19:40.484
<v Speaker 1>would just buy things there anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you do deal with a lot of </v>

3024
02:19:42.801 --> 02:19:44.900
<v Speaker 1>fucking nutty people showing up your ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>cream store.</v>

3025
02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:46.840
<v Speaker 1>But now wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

3050
02:20:53.521 --> 02:20:54.354

<v Speaker 4>company like pornhub or somebody famous </v>

3051
02:20:58.801 --> 02:21:03.300
<v Speaker 4>porn companies started snapchat because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they originally wanted to say no.</v>

3052
02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:05.033
<v Speaker 4>They originally wanted to have it as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>app where you can show your Dick and it </v>

3053
02:21:07.651 --> 02:21:09.810

<v Speaker 1>porn his whole life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3173
02:26:39.070 --> 02:26:42.820
<v Speaker 1>that's all from my instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stevie wonder Doobie brothers,</v>

3174
02:26:42.970 --> 02:26:47.620
<v Speaker 1>easy rider and Alice Cooper thinks it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and that's just.</v>

3175
02:26:47.890 --> 02:26:51.590
<v Speaker 1>This is like Elton John Four Times in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year coaching.</v>

3176
02:26:52.930 --> 02:26:53.740
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Just crazy.</v>

3178
02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:59.210
<v Speaker 1>David Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

3179
02:26:59.890 --> 02:27:00.723
<v Speaker 1>Wild Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just those places are so </v>

3180
02:27:02.471 --> 02:27:07.270
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these old old venues,</v>

3181
02:27:07.271 --> 02:27:11.740
<v Speaker 1>they're almost like a museum as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like a place where you see a show.</v>

3182
02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3183
02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean so much went on in place so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could feel it.</v>

3184
02:27:16.570 --> 02:27:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Even being in there during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was still honored.</v>

3185
02:27:19.031 --> 02:27:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I know just wrassling whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was big deal to me,</v>

3186
02:27:22.721 --> 02:27:23.554
<v Speaker 1>like to be a part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the reasons why I </v>

3187
02:27:25.271 --> 02:27:26.104
<v Speaker 1>think like the comedy store has to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of historic designation and </v>

3188
02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:32.230
<v Speaker 1>they should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've tried to get that.</v>

3189
02:27:32.231 --> 02:27:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I remember doing this should happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that,</v>

3190
02:27:34.751 --> 02:27:37.630
<v Speaker 1>that place is like historic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a museum.</v>

3191
02:27:37.631 --> 02:27:38.464
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is from the pictures on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the walls to just the feel of the place </v>

3192
02:27:43.181 --> 02:27:46.690
<v Speaker 1>and how important that is for one </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular art form.</v>

3193
02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:48.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that place is like a fucking museum,</v>

3194
02:27:48.970 --> 02:27:50.320
<v Speaker 1>like a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>

3195
02:27:50.380 --> 02:27:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to it right now.</v>

3196
02:27:52.361 --> 02:27:53.194
<v Speaker 1>Museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we tried to get it as a </v>

3197
02:27:55.210 --> 02:27:59.170
<v Speaker 1>landmark or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't work because it's too many</v>

3198
02:27:59.171 --> 02:28:02.410
<v Speaker 1>bodies underneath something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Chinese theater.</v>

3199
02:28:02.430 --> 02:28:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Like wouldn't you think that that place </v>
<v Speaker 1>it needs to stay around commands.</v>

3200
02:28:05.531 --> 02:28:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Chinese theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this right.</v>

3201
02:28:07.570 --> 02:28:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Considered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it shouldn't be.</v>

3202
02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:10.533
<v Speaker 1>It has to be at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should try to do it before the Mitzi </v>

3203
02:28:14.261 --> 02:28:16.780
<v Speaker 1>passes because so it can't get torn </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3204
02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Well that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was the whole thing.</v>

3205
02:28:18.401 --> 02:28:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was her personal assistant,</v>

3206
02:28:20.681 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 1>we tried to get all kinds of stuff</v>

3207
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:22.963
<v Speaker 3>like that because there was like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were coming after us for different </v>

3208
02:28:24.741 --> 02:28:28.250
<v Speaker 3>things like not being up to date on </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain codes,</v>

3209
02:28:28.370 --> 02:28:31.580
<v Speaker 3>laws and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we were grandfathered in from a</v>

3210
02:28:31.581 --> 02:28:33.800
<v Speaker 3>lot of them and we got away with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them,</v>

3211
02:28:33.801 --> 02:28:34.634
<v Speaker 3>so it was like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember trying to get that and I </v>

3212
02:28:36.141 --> 02:28:39.680
<v Speaker 3>don't know if they ever followed through</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that pos to find that out,</v>

3213
02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:42.250
<v Speaker 3>check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they definitely showed.</v>

3214
02:28:42.290 --> 02:28:43.160
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3215
02:28:43.370 --> 02:28:46.250
<v Speaker 3>it obviously because it was there a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>way longer than Ciro's.</v>

3216
02:28:46.310 --> 02:28:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Ciro's was a hotspot in the back in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

3217
02:28:50.390 --> 02:28:52.580
<v Speaker 3>That was like where Lucille Ball Hong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>

3218
02:28:52.690 --> 02:28:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Like the main room that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a big deal to Hollywood too.</v>

3219
02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:01.310
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know how long that was open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe only five years,</v>

3220
02:29:01.430 --> 02:29:02.990
<v Speaker 3>10 years maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

3221
02:29:03.210 --> 02:29:04.043
<v Speaker 3>But there's so many pictures of Marilyn </v>
<v Speaker 3>Monroe and all Sammy Davis junior and </v>

3222
02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Frank Sinatra.</v>

3223
02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:12.800
<v Speaker 3>They would play there on the weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a regular thing,</v>

3224
02:29:12.870 --> 02:29:16.250
<v Speaker 3>but that logic than it should have never</v>
<v Speaker 3>been allowed to become a comedy store.</v>

3225
02:29:16.251 --> 02:29:17.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3226
02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:21.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure what the etiquette is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably don't remember what that part</v>

3227
02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:23.153
<v Speaker 3>wasn't Ciro's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have to figure that out long </v>

3228
02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:25.473
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't have been as nearly as long </v>

3229
02:29:26.391 --> 02:29:28.570
<v Speaker 3>as it was the store right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when she,</v>

3230
02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:30.450
<v Speaker 3>she got the original roof first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3231
02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:34.430
<v Speaker 3>And then she bought the main room later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when she bought the main room,</v>

3232
02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:37.670
<v Speaker 3>when she bought it for which she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she loved that serious thing,</v>

3233
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 3>that vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3234
02:29:38.781 --> 02:29:43.070
<v Speaker 3>like the big bands and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she would have buddy rich,</v>

3235
02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:44.273
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the weekends at the comedy store </v>

3236
02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:50.030
<v Speaker 3>playing like a big his band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember like dice going,</v>

3237
02:29:50.110 --> 02:29:53.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm 17 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shoot was was 17,</v>

3238
02:29:55.070 --> 02:29:56.420
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>47.</v>

3239
02:29:58.070 --> 02:30:00.440
<v Speaker 3>Transformed a rock and roll club in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>early because he bought it.</v>

3240
02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:05.630
<v Speaker 3>What was the guy that's bought it became</v>
<v Speaker 3>a comedy store and he was a DJ.</v>

3241
02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:08.070
<v Speaker 3>Look at that fucking neon sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how cool that is.</v>

3242
02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have that.</v>

3243
02:30:09.290 --> 02:30:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the neon sign in the basement,</v>

3244
02:30:13.260 --> 02:30:14.093
<v Speaker 3>the basement the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how we do the comedy store </v>

3245
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:18.800
<v Speaker 3>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basement.</v>

3246
02:30:18.801 --> 02:30:23.801
<v Speaker 3>They have that thing I'm thinking of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>big round one we have in the kitchen.</v>

3247
02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:30.200
<v Speaker 3>The kitchen is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she yet all that was in the basement</v>

3248
02:30:30.201 --> 02:30:33.080
<v Speaker 3>when she bought it from the Dj.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the DJC?</v>

3249
02:30:33.081 --> 02:30:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Mcafee was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ran the main room.</v>

3250
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:36.890
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he owned that.</v>

3251
02:30:36.891 --> 02:30:38.540
<v Speaker 3>She bought it from him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

3252
02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

3253
02:30:39.591 --> 02:30:44.360
<v Speaker 3>And that was 78 or 70?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy two.</v>

3254
02:30:44.390 --> 02:30:46.340
<v Speaker 3>And then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around there,</v>

3255
02:30:46.341 --> 02:30:47.660
<v Speaker 3>like 76,</v>
<v Speaker 3>70,</v>

3256
02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:48.523
<v Speaker 3>76 maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She bought the main room and that </v>

3257
02:30:50.931 --> 02:30:51.764
<v Speaker 3>became,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a weird like for link 40 </v>

3258
02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:54.800
<v Speaker 3>years of history.</v>

3259
02:30:54.990 --> 02:30:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a few spots like that in,</v>

3260
02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:00.583
<v Speaker 3>in all of entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're also many things were created or </v>

3261
02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:03.880
<v Speaker 3>the one area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3262
02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:07.970
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a whole lot of those spots</v>
<v Speaker 3>were important.</v>

3263
02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:10.430
<v Speaker 3>She wanted me to help her write a book </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was thinking,</v>

3264
02:31:10.431 --> 02:31:11.264
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitzi wanted me to help her write a </v>

3265
02:31:12.261 --> 02:31:12.950
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3266
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:13.783
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be telling me I can barely </v>

3267
02:31:15.411 --> 02:31:16.244
<v Speaker 3>read a book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try because I was still into the </v>

3268
02:31:18.291 --> 02:31:20.910
<v Speaker 3>comedy store and then she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3269
02:31:21.150 --> 02:31:24.340
<v Speaker 3>what she really wanted to make was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a coffee table book from um,</v>

3270
02:31:24.990 --> 02:31:25.823
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff in Vegas because Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she did go there in the dunes hotel for </v>

3271
02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:34.230
<v Speaker 3>awhile and yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3274
02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Westwood was a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently there was all before my time,</v>

3275
02:31:41.161 --> 02:31:41.994
<v Speaker 3>but Westwood apparently was where guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>would develop Kennison and those guys </v>

3276
02:31:46.111 --> 02:31:46.944
<v Speaker 3>down there they would develop at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Westwood and then they would come over </v>

3277
02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood once we'd already got their </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet under them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>
