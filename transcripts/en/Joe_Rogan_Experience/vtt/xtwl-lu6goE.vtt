47
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>It's totally unrelated.</v>

48
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>They did it in Ferguson to businesses that were owned by black people.</v>

49
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was,</v>

50
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>there were some instances of people burning down businesses that had absolutely</v>

51
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with any of the pro police,</v>

52
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.783
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

54
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>There were people that just lived in the community and then all of a sudden</v>

55
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>everything got smashed in Oakland.</v>

56
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>When when some guy,</v>

57
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>the guy got shot in Oakland,</v>

58
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.583
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

59
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>they smashed up bank and someone wrote fuck capitalism on it.</v>

60
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.091
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

61
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:33.541
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

62
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I really like.</v>

63
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Is that what this is about?</v>

64
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>The fucking cop killing the guy is about Canberra.</v>

65
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Is it the other one that the accident or the quote unquote accident at the train</v>

66
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>station?</v>

67
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:43.794
<v Speaker 1>that was fucked.</v>

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the movie they made of it?</v>

70
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

71
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>They made a movie of it.</v>

72
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I like when they do this with a lot of Hollywood stuff that it's sort of</v>

73
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.881
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

74
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Phoned in thing was if you remember,</v>

75
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 1>if you remember the biggie smalls movies,</v>

76
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>you ever see that one ever saw it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

78
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.831
<v Speaker 1>Did you say?</v>

79
00:01:57.831 --> 00:01:58.310
<v Speaker 1>If I.</v>

80
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

81
00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>it's called notorious.</v>

82
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Played Bass actually was pretty good.</v>

83
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>That previewed look like he did a good job.</v>

84
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

85
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Pull up a fucking Prius</v>

86
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.751
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

87
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>but what was funny was the night he died in the movie,</v>

88
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 1>like he made phone calls to everyone and he's like,</v>

89
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be good too.</v>

90
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 1>You told his mom that money gets.</v>

91
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>They didn't always like things that are not true in that fruitvale station</v>

92
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:22.801
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

93
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>which is about the Oakland guy.</v>

94
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Like they literally made that day like,</v>

95
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:27.211
<v Speaker 1>you know the guy,</v>

96
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>he sold drugs for Kima given drugs and he was like,</v>

97
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

98
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this shit no more better with my daughter.</v>

99
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is like,</v>

100
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>the comedian named Chris Tinkle,</v>

102
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I pointed out because he knew the story.</v>

103
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>He's from that area and he said he was like,</v>

104
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>it's already tragic.</v>

105
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.024
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

106
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>this is a tragic situation where a kid got killed.</v>

107
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:48.541
<v Speaker 1>Whatever was going on,</v>

108
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>he probably deserves to get killed by a cop accidentally or otherwise,</v>

109
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>so it's just like,</v>

110
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>why would you have to add like a.</v>

111
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>and he was going to go back.</v>

112
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>He was going to go to University of Phoenix.</v>

113
00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Online dues.</v>

114
00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

115
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I can</v>

116
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.701
<v Speaker 3>spell it out.</v>

117
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Nice and simple.</v>

118
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly what it is.</v>

119
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.270
<v Speaker 3>There's a very high percentage,</v>

120
00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 3>a very high percentage of the movie business that's filled with wonderful</v>

121
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 3>creative people.</v>

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 3>Was it one of those movements?</v>

131
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 3>The best movies I've ever seen in my life and I don't want to say anything more</v>

132
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

133
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.531
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk.</v>

134
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk about a little bit but,</v>

135
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

136
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

137
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.983
<v Speaker 3>but points,</v>

138
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 3>most of them are trying to do shit like that,</v>

139
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.660
<v Speaker 3>but there are a few out there and those ones will stand out and they will just,</v>

140
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 3>they will just fucking,</v>

141
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 3>just in every soup you gotta add their little fucking spoon to all your ideas</v>

142
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 3>and they fuck everything up man.</v>

143
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 3>And especially it's grows especially gross when they do a real live story.</v>

144
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times they'll do who are still alive and they just butchered this toy.</v>

145
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Like that fucking wrestler movie.</v>

146
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.343
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was that?</v>

147
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about it before.</v>

148

176
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing was like,</v>

177
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here?</v>

178
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.131
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing,</v>

179
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

180
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

181
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the methods because I'm from Philly and that story happened in</v>

182
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia and it was Connecticut,</v>

183
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Fox catcher things in Philly that was outside of Philly,</v>

184
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.481
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania.</v>

185
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:52.991
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

186
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:53.561
<v Speaker 3>Confused.</v>

187
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 3>But I think it was John Du Pont.</v>

188
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.440
<v Speaker 3>It was like a multiple day stay.</v>

189
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Also.</v>

190
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.460
<v Speaker 3>One was interesting.</v>

191
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 3>It was that it was a standoff for days with the cops,</v>

192
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 3>but they made it like he killed the guy and then he walked out of his house and</v>

193
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 3>they just arrested him like it was such like a speed through all the things that</v>

194
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:11.700
<v Speaker 3>are real and interesting to add some weird Hollywood like they have to force in</v>

195
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 3>the fact that maybe he was gay for this guy.</v>

196
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 3>They had nothing to do with anything.</v>

197
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Just decided to make them gay.</v>

198
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Just to make this more fun.</v>

199
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.850
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get me arrowhead and my helicopter</v>

200
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 3>helicopter on each other's sweating.</v>

201
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Do they change shit that they didn't have to change,</v>

202
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 3>like historical shit,</v>

203
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that he was already a world champion,</v>

204
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 3>one of the best wrestlers on earth.</v>

205
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 3>They made him out to be like a guy was failing and falling apart.</v>

206
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 3>They also had him fight in the UFC,</v>

207
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 3>did fight once in the UFC,</v>

208
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 3>but against a white guy in a real UFC.</v>

209
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Fought against a black guy named big Gary Goodrich.</v>

210
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:49.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a historic match.</v>

211
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a historic,</v>

212
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a.</v>

213
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 3>If you're a martial arts historian that matches the historic match because he</v>

214
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 3>was an Olympic gold medalist.</v>

215
00:05:55.991 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 3>He came and just took down one of the best mma fighters at the time at will and</v>

216
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 3>show the difference between like worldclass wrestling and this fucking bullshit</v>

217
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 3>that these guys were doing in the gym.</v>

218
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:04.821
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>

219
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 3>They were infants in comparison to his wrestling skill,</v>

220
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 3>but they changed the timeline of it.</v>

221
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 3>They had him watch the UFC and 87.</v>

222
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>The UFC wasn't even made until 93,</v>

223
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 3>so they just fucked with everything.</v>

224
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Just to gay it up and add a little of this</v>

225
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.763
<v Speaker 3>little fucking.</v>

226
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

227
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

228
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 3>That was my idea is basically the script man.</v>

229
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 3>The story structure just didn't work.</v>

230
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 3>There was something missing.</v>

231
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.353
<v Speaker 3>Gay stuff.</v>

232
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 3>When they get.</v>

233
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 3>When they get those actors,</v>

234
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to like it to just be in independent film theaters,</v>

235
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 3>so they gotta they got Hollywood,</v>

236
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 3>some horse shit story into it all.</v>

237
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.290
<v Speaker 3>It's just so.</v>

238
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 3>It's so depressing.</v>

239
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 3>They do that to a movie.</v>

240
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a real story because then you have in your head,</v>

241
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

242
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 3>well we almost got gay with the guy.</v>

243
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 3>He did coke,</v>

244
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.770
<v Speaker 3>he saw the UFC and 87.</v>

245
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 3>You have all these things in your head and then you start reading and you go,</v>

246
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.281
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

247
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:54.441
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

248
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:54.650
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

249
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

250
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.780
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

251
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>That's not the case.</v>

252
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:57.794
<v Speaker 3>Like there was.</v>

253
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a list on facebook.</v>

254
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Mark Schultz did have all the inaccuracies of the foxcatcher movie.</v>

255
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

256
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.331
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

257
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 3>They just been fucked with everything they know because he was like a consultant</v>

258
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 3>on the movie.</v>

259
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he probably knew a little bit.</v>

260
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is he going to do?</v>

261
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 3>They're probably given him an ass load of money,</v>

262
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.823
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

263
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.053
<v Speaker 3>Tips.</v>

264
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 3>He say he's a wrestler.</v>

265
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Wrestling coach at Brigham Young.</v>

266
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean he had a stop mma fighting because the school that he was teaching</v>

267
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 3>wrestling at didn't want them doing it.</v>

268
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 3>It was a different time.</v>

269
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 3>It was like 96 or 97 or whatever the fuck it was when he fought.</v>

270
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 3>That was right on the end of like USC being like sumo wrestler fights in Ninja.</v>

271
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 3>It was still that still.</v>

272
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Speaker 3>He was still using bare knuckles.</v>

273
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.721
<v Speaker 3>There was still a,</v>

274
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I think he would still wear shoes when I started used to google wear shoes.</v>

275
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't punch the balls when I first got there.</v>

276
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't punch the balls and you couldn't.</v>

277
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could pull hair anymore.</v>

278
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 3>They got rid of that early on.</v>

279
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Fun growing up.</v>

280
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.510

284
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 3>I remember me and my stepfather order the first one ever when it was tournament</v>

285
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 3>style and you have to go out and fight like three times and we thought it was</v>

286
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:11.760
<v Speaker 3>like the greatest thing of all time.</v>

00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:15.880
<v Speaker 3>no gouging,</v>

293
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.813
<v Speaker 3>all these things.</v>

294
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 3>But you have to,</v>

295
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 3>that has to happen.</v>

296
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.850
<v Speaker 3>And then they go,</v>

297
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 3>oh Yay.</v>

298
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Now you can't just,</v>

299
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 3>you can't just break a guy's finger because you're losing.</v>

300
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:24.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

301
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:25.604
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>

302
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 3>it's why can't you,</v>

303
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 3>if you break guys arm,</v>

304
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 3>how come you can't break but what guy's finger like?</v>

305
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:31.274
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

306
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with like all the thoughts about like small joint manipulation</v>

307
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 3>because the reality is if someone's trying to manipulate your joint,</v>

308
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 3>like if say the only way that would really.</v>

309
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 3>The only way that usually works in defense,</v>

310
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 3>like say if a guy,</v>

311
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 3>if you're a,</v>

312
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.470
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to grab a guy and you're trying to choke him and he starts pulling</v>

313
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:46.280
<v Speaker 3>on your fingers,</v>

314
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 3>well you could just pull your fingers away,</v>

315
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

316
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:50.930
<v Speaker 3>it's not like it's an automatic that he's going to break your fingers.</v>

317
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

318
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.820
<v Speaker 3>You just have to be more aware of it.</v>

319
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Like it's realistic.</v>

320
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Like if a guy has to do is pull your finger back to stop you from doing a choke</v>

321
00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.041
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>

322
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Then he did the right thing.</v>

323
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Why are you taking that away from him when it's okay for him to choke you?</v>

324
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:03.861
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

325
00:09:03.861 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 3>You have to like actually get under the hand itself completely.</v>

326
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

327
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 3>But why are you taking away the guy's ability to pull on your fingers?</v>

328
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

329
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 3>we've pulls on your fingers.</v>

330
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 3>You better get your fingers out of there and then try to choke them again.</v>

331
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 3>It just makes sense to me.</v>

332
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I actually thought because it never happens that I thought there was a rule of</v>

333
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 3>no choking in the UFC,</v>

334
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.780
<v Speaker 3>like a direct on choke.</v>

335
00:09:22.781 --> 00:09:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Like you're trying to fight against the wall,</v>

336
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:24.571
<v Speaker 3>but you can do that.</v>

337
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's the most unrealistic move to this same reason.</v>

338
00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 3>No one headlocks like you did in the school yard as a kid where you have the guy</v>

339
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:33.200
<v Speaker 3>got a bulldog position.</v>

340
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.980
<v Speaker 3>Him as like the more that nef that so rarely ever happened to us.</v>

341
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I think you're wrong.</v>

342
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I think it is illegal to grab the neck like that.</v>

343
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I think it's illegal to straight on.</v>

344
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 3>I think it used to be legal,</v>

345
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 3>but now it's illegal.</v>

346
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:46.861
<v Speaker 3>I need.</v>

347
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:47.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

348
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I need to find out about that.</v>

349
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:48.901
<v Speaker 3>There was something about,</v>

350
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:48.991
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

351
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:51.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of weird spots that you can't do.</v>

352
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Like do you know you can't hit a guy in the back of the head,</v>

353
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.640
<v Speaker 3>can't hit a guy in the back.</v>

354
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 3>You get kicked in the back of the head all the time.</v>

355
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 3>When you get hit with a head kick.</v>

356
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about a head kick is you know the shins kind of coming around</v>

357
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 3>here and a lot of times like a high percentage,</v>

358
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.730
<v Speaker 3>that foot in the instep are bang wrapping right around the back of your head way</v>

359
00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 3>fucking harder than you can ever punch like so.</v>

360
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you don't get hit in the back of the head,</v>

361
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy because there's a totally legal shot that's basically the back of the</v>

362
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:20.640
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

363
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Nobody ever gets in trouble for kicking somebody in the back of the head and it</v>

364
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:26.070
<v Speaker 3>happens all the time.</v>

365
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.870
<v Speaker 3>It's just ground and pound.</v>

366
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 3>When you're grounded.</v>

367
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Impounding is usually when guys get in trouble for hitting the back of the head,</v>

368
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:34.410
<v Speaker 3>which is the most ridiculous because that's when guys are moving around.</v>

369
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.803
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to protect them.</v>

370
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.620
<v Speaker 3>All we gotta do is get to the back of your head,</v>

371
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 3>but standup wise,</v>

372
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:40.470
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys get hit in the back of the head.</v>

373
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Speaker 3>They get hit with clubbing punches like when in like in melees.</v>

374
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.160
<v Speaker 3>They never get in trouble for that and there's a lot of elbows that go to the</v>

375
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:50.520
<v Speaker 3>back of the head because you're up against the cage and in areas where you'd get</v>

376
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:52.380
<v Speaker 3>in trouble hitting him somehow and ground and pound,</v>

377
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.890
<v Speaker 3>it seems almost like elbows to the back of the head and punches the back of the</v>

378
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:59.530
<v Speaker 3>head are really only recognize clearly when it's ground and pound wha.</v>

379
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.361
<v Speaker 3>Why Man?</v>

380
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:00.841
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>

381
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

382
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.010
<v Speaker 3>to Diego Sanchez elbowing the top of clay.</v>

383
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.123
<v Speaker 3>Sweetest head.</v>

384
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know how those weren't like illegal.</v>

385
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.211
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me by the rules.</v>

386
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 3>That should have been illegal.</v>

387
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Here's the top is fine.</v>

388
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.480
<v Speaker 3>It's the base of the skull that's supposed to be the real danger area.</v>

389
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 3>It's the back of the head and the base of skull.</v>

390
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.610
<v Speaker 3>You can elbow top of the head was directly on top of the head is fine.</v>

391
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.240
<v Speaker 3>The top of the heads find the sides of the head are fine and there's like a</v>

392
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:25.310
<v Speaker 3>bunch of debate about like,</v>

393
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.570
<v Speaker 3>what is the [inaudible] called?</v>

394
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 3>The Mohawk,</v>

395
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:27.990
<v Speaker 3>the Mohawk,</v>

396
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 3>meaning this is the area that can hit Mohawk in the back of the head like that</v>

397
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:35.850
<v Speaker 3>strip down with a spine is some people extend it more towards the ears and some</v>

398
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 3>people keep it more narrow and some people lower it,</v>

399
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:38.940
<v Speaker 3>so it's just the base.</v>

400
00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Some people think that like right here,</v>

401
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 3>like sort of the mid back of the head,</v>

402
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:42.744
<v Speaker 3>it's fine,</v>

403
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.530
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

404
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:43.930
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

405
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.690
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

406
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 3>it's open to debate,</v>

407
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is ultimately that the base of the spine is very dangerous to hit</v>

408
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 3>and then if you hit someone they're really hard.</v>

409
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 3>You might be able to separate their fucking brain and our spinal column.</v>

410
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.800
<v Speaker 3>It was a big move in the old day.</v>

411
00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:02.060
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

412
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.711
<v Speaker 3>in the old days,</v>

413
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 3>one of the best moves was you'd take guys back and then you would smash the back</v>

414
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 3>of his head with elbows like Henzel Gracie did that too.</v>

415
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Like this judo specialist that he fought and got.</v>

416
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:13.504
<v Speaker 3>I want to say like,</v>

417
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I forget the organization.</v>

418
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:18.160
<v Speaker 3>It might have been Mars or it might have been like one of those,</v>

419
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 3>one of those like really,</v>

420
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:24.510
<v Speaker 3>really young old school martial arts promotions that never really made it so</v>

421
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Hensville gets this guy down,</v>

422
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:27.690
<v Speaker 3>kitces back and just fuck it.</v>

423
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

424
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Just smashes the back of his head because it's totally legal back then and you</v>

425
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 3>realize like that takes away all your rear naked choke,</v>

426
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:37.234
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

427
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.330
<v Speaker 3>That's like not even nearly as effective as doing that.</v>

428
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.660
<v Speaker 3>You've got a guy's head fee.</v>

429
00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:42.990
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>

430
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 3>You got him face down and you're smashing the back of his head with elbows while</v>

431
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 3>you have the back mountain.</v>

432
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 3>There's very little he can do to defend that used to be illegal.</v>

433
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.870
<v Speaker 4>It's funny in that unit goes to.</v>

434
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 4>They take away from the sport.</v>

435
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 4>It still stays a thousand times more interesting than box.</v>

436
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:58.191
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

437
00:12:58.191 --> 00:12:58.730
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

438
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:59.810
<v Speaker 3>everybody says that.</v>

439
00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:00.051
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

440
00:13:00.051 --> 00:13:01.970
<v Speaker 3>But I really found that fight interesting.</v>

441
00:13:01.971 --> 00:13:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm of the minority that thought that it was a really interesting fight.</v>

442
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was mad for this.</v>

443
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 3>With that,</v>

444
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

445
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.110
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

446
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.943
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

447
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.140
<v Speaker 3>As a person who appreciates boxing,</v>

448
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.300
<v Speaker 3>that fight to me was pretty wild.</v>

449
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.270
<v Speaker 3>It was intense to watch because you know manny Pacquiao,</v>

450
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.460
<v Speaker 3>he's been able to get his gloves on everybody.</v>

451
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.390
<v Speaker 3>He fights everybody.</v>

452
00:13:20.391 --> 00:13:20.811
<v Speaker 3>He fights,</v>

453
00:13:20.811 --> 00:13:21.644
<v Speaker 3>he lights up,</v>

454
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.520
<v Speaker 3>he gets a hold of you.</v>

455
00:13:22.521 --> 00:13:26.210
<v Speaker 3>Eventually any lights you up and you might get them like mark has got them,</v>

456
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.840
<v Speaker 3>but before market has got them sound like pack.</v>

457
00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:30.710
<v Speaker 3>Y'All didn't crack them,</v>

458
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

459
00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:32.960
<v Speaker 3>they weren't going back and forth and back and forth.</v>

460
00:13:32.961 --> 00:13:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Just smart cast as a legendary Chin and awesome punching power and eventually</v>

461
00:13:36.801 --> 00:13:37.310
<v Speaker 3>knocked pack,</v>

462
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.790
<v Speaker 3>yell out.</v>

463
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.180
<v Speaker 3>But pack yellow is in these wars with Margarita wars with Kodo,</v>

464
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

465
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.420
<v Speaker 3>just bash the shit out of Chris.</v>

466
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Algeria is real slick and moves real well.</v>

467
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.051
<v Speaker 3>Just gets you.</v>

468
00:13:48.051 --> 00:13:48.920
<v Speaker 3>And he's a pretty boy.</v>

469
00:13:48.921 --> 00:13:49.340
<v Speaker 3>White Guy.</v>

470
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:49.911
<v Speaker 3>He's a pretty boy,</v>

471
00:13:49.911 --> 00:13:50.151
<v Speaker 3>white guy,</v>

472
00:13:50.151 --> 00:13:51.080
<v Speaker 3>but he's a bad motherfucker,</v>

473
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.960
<v Speaker 3>but manny Pacquiao just could not get to floyd.</v>

474
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Then one time he did get them.</v>

475
00:13:55.641 --> 00:13:56.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like nothing,</v>

476
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

477
00:13:56.881 --> 00:13:58.790
<v Speaker 3>it's like floyd just covered up,</v>

478
00:13:58.791 --> 00:13:59.511
<v Speaker 3>uses defense,</v>

479
00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:00.440
<v Speaker 3>kept shaking his head like,</v>

480
00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:00.980
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

481
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.580
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

482
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

483
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Nothing like manny.</v>

484
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.730
<v Speaker 3>We just couldn't get them.</v>

485
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.120
<v Speaker 3>To me that was impressive as fuck the way he was moving.</v>

486
00:14:08.121 --> 00:14:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Like every time manny would come for that blitz,</v>

487
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.780
<v Speaker 3>floyd was gone.</v>

488
00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:12.950
<v Speaker 3>He just wasn't there,</v>

489
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

490
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.730
<v Speaker 3>just suit super slick boxing.</v>

491
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:16.611
<v Speaker 4>I'm from Philly,</v>

492
00:14:16.611 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 4>so I spent a lifetime with Bernard Hopkins just watching him and rooting for him</v>

493
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:22.204
<v Speaker 4>of these,</v>

494
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.660
<v Speaker 4>these really long,</v>

495
00:14:23.661 --> 00:14:24.700
<v Speaker 4>slow flights.</v>

496
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.670
<v Speaker 4>They are like,</v>

497
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.841
<v Speaker 4>they just take for us.</v>

498
00:14:26.841 --> 00:14:28.850
<v Speaker 4>I think floyd mayweather was kind of the same thing for me.</v>

499
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

500
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.160
<v Speaker 4>I just watched again man,</v>

501
00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:34.190
<v Speaker 4>that you see that Tyson documentary on cable all the time,</v>

502
00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:35.450
<v Speaker 4>which is him sitting and talking in the,</v>

503
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.420
<v Speaker 4>in the white shirt when they go to that footage.</v>

504
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.830
<v Speaker 4>Once in a while I'll even watch that.</v>

505
00:14:39.831 --> 00:14:40.551
<v Speaker 4>Fox Sports,</v>

506
00:14:40.551 --> 00:14:41.181
<v Speaker 4>we'll do the,</v>

507
00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:41.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

508
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.730
<v Speaker 4>the all day just Tyson's fights,</v>

509
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.570
<v Speaker 4>but watching that footage of him training and just how fast he wasn't what he</v>

510
00:14:47.571 --> 00:14:48.404
<v Speaker 4>was doing.</v>

511
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.120
<v Speaker 4>How come there isn't.</v>

512
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.460
<v Speaker 4>There hasn't been the Mike Tyson since my Tyson.</v>

513
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 4>There's been arguably six Jordan's since Jordan.</v>

514
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.351
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

515
00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 3>You need a lot of things that come together correctly to make a Mike Tyson.</v>

516
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 3>You need a lot of things.</v>

517
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:03.951
<v Speaker 4>Also that talent,</v>

518
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:07.070
<v Speaker 4>I think in the last decade jumps to mma.</v>

519
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

520
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:08.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

521
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

522
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.861
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

523
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's still a lot of guys who really like boxing.</v>

524
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:12.561
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

525
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:12.621
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

526
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

527
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.641
<v Speaker 3>I got an,</v>

528
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:15.410
<v Speaker 3>a famous argument years back with this guy,</v>

529
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Lou Dibella on espn where I was telling the box he was going to get swallowed up</v>

530
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 3>by the,</v>

531
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.441
<v Speaker 3>by the UFC,</v>

532
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:22.011
<v Speaker 3>by MMA,</v>

533
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 3>by a more dynamic sport,</v>

534
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 3>but I would have never done that if that guy wasn't a dick.</v>

535
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 3>But I like boxing.</v>

536
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I've always liked boxing.</v>

537
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I've been a huge fan since I was a little kid.</v>

538
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:31.041
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

539
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Just always been a fan of it.</v>

540
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.673
<v Speaker 3>There's some.</v>

541
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I also am a big fan of kickboxing.</v>

542
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:40.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big Fan of glory and I'm a big fan of Moitai because I think that there's</v>

543
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Speaker 3>things that you pull off in just straight kickboxing or boxing,</v>

544
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 3>that you just can't do an mma because guys will clinch you the three to the</v>

545
00:15:47.631 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

546
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:48.191
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>

547
00:15:48.191 --> 00:15:49.024
<v Speaker 3>you can't get it off.</v>

548
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.840
<v Speaker 3>You can't do most of this shit.</v>

549
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Floyd mayweather does with leg kicks,</v>

550
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 3>soon as leg kicks were in the mix.</v>

551
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 3>You can't do most of this shit,</v>

552
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.220
<v Speaker 3>but to me what he's doing is incredible.</v>

553
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's so artistic.</v>

554
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.730
<v Speaker 3>He's beating the game.</v>

555
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.970
<v Speaker 3>He's going out at 48 F and o with no brain scrambles me.</v>

556
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 3>There's only been tagged that I can remember twice,</v>

557
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:12.710
<v Speaker 3>three times at maximum.</v>

558
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Never been really fucking battered to the point where you like,</v>

559
00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:19.520
<v Speaker 3>the fight is going to be stopped and he's to come back like goddy ward or</v>

560
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.240
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>

561
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.070
<v Speaker 3>None of that shit.</v>

562
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.310
<v Speaker 4>But if you're going to stay interested in boxing now you have to be a real fan</v>

563
00:16:24.311 --> 00:16:25.660
<v Speaker 4>of like the sweet science.</v>

564
00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:26.051
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

565
00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:29.170
<v Speaker 4>Like the quote unquote because there's just no.</v>

566
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's just not.</v>

567
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.330
<v Speaker 4>People want to see knockout,</v>

568
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:32.560
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

569
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.580
<v Speaker 4>At the end of the day we're all,</v>

570
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.100
<v Speaker 4>I guess the gladiator cage and we don't want to see like,</v>

571
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

572
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.031
<v Speaker 4>people get knocked out.</v>

573
00:16:37.031 --> 00:16:39.940
<v Speaker 4>You want to see that violence that you like.</v>

574
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:45.890
<v Speaker 4>MMA is such a scary thing to the layman that boxing's become less scared.</v>

575
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.361
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

576
00:16:46.361 --> 00:16:47.440
<v Speaker 4>we'll go to the size of those gloves,</v>

577
00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:50.050
<v Speaker 4>like these guys are going multiple rounds and they're getting hit with,</v>

578
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.913
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

579
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.810
<v Speaker 4>it was like a sponge over your fist a little bit,</v>

580
00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:53.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

581
00:16:53.051 --> 00:16:53.884
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

582
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:54.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

583
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.880
<v Speaker 4>let's do it.</v>

584
00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.340
<v Speaker 4>I think it just like draws.</v>

585
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.960
<v Speaker 4>You can't go back with attention more.</v>

586
00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.860
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>

587
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.550
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

588
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.941
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

589
00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:01.271
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>

590
00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not just saying here's what,</v>

591
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:03.670
<v Speaker 4>here's what you'll never.</v>

592
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.670
<v Speaker 4>You'll never have a girl will never go retroactive from UFC to boxing.</v>

593
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.151
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so,</v>

594
00:17:10.151 --> 00:17:10.331
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

595
00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:10.570
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

596
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:10.751
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

597
00:17:10.751 --> 00:17:12.850
<v Speaker 4>but you can get a girl girls very easily.</v>

598
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:14.680
<v Speaker 4>I find getting the UFC really.</v>

599
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.810
<v Speaker 4>I think girls get into UFC very,</v>

600
00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:17.500
<v Speaker 4>very easily.</v>

601
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.440
<v Speaker 4>What do you think that is that some gladiator gene shit,</v>

602
00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:21.910
<v Speaker 4>they want to get some gladiators permanent.</v>

603
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.020
<v Speaker 4>I think there's an actual.</v>

604
00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:23.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

605
00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I think there's like the,</v>

606
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:24.140
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

607
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.790
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

608
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.130
<v Speaker 4>like the machismo of the whole thing.</v>

609
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.330
<v Speaker 4>And then also uh,</v>

610
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.030
<v Speaker 4>in UFC very specifically,</v>

611
00:17:31.031 --> 00:17:31.420
<v Speaker 4>but in,</v>

612
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.450
<v Speaker 4>in most of the televised mma stuff,</v>

613
00:17:34.451 --> 00:17:34.811
<v Speaker 4>I actually really,</v>

614
00:17:34.811 --> 00:17:37.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean UFC really does it like the best.</v>

615
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:42.330
<v Speaker 4>Like if you just give your girl two episodes of the buildup shit like Daniel</v>

616
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Cormier,</v>

617
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.221
<v Speaker 4>Jon Jones,</v>

618
00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:46.054
<v Speaker 4>like she was in,</v>

619
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.400
<v Speaker 4>she invested interest in that because we watched it.</v>

620
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:49.780
<v Speaker 4>I made her go back watch Jon Jones.</v>

621
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 4>Like first thing when he came out,</v>

622
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 4>he was the hero.</v>

623
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.870
<v Speaker 4>She put her out of this course.</v>

624
00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:53.960
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

625
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

626
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.850
<v Speaker 4>I want to say about it made her watch that,</v>

627
00:17:55.851 --> 00:17:55.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

628
00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 4>that half hour thing of him like,</v>

629
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:57.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

630
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 4>I saved the old woman from getting robbed and I was thinking she and his story</v>

631
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 4>and it's kind of hard luck story and growing up.</v>

632
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.691
<v Speaker 4>And she was like,</v>

633
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:03.811
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

634
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:04.491
<v Speaker 4>I really liked this guy.</v>

635
00:18:04.491 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 4>Them again watches things now.</v>

636
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:06.594
<v Speaker 4>Like he just,</v>

637
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.900
<v Speaker 4>his personality is different and he just made himself like the villain sort of.</v>

638
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.221
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

639
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:12.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that the villains,</v>

640
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:14.090
<v Speaker 4>I think villains in actual sports,</v>

641
00:18:14.091 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 4>so not wrestling.</v>

642
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.350
<v Speaker 4>What's funny about that?</v>

643
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 4>I think any kind of sport actually like,</v>

644
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:18.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

645
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.970
<v Speaker 4>even someone who hates the Yankees,</v>

646
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:22.260
<v Speaker 4>like if you meet a rod,</v>

647
00:18:22.261 --> 00:18:23.970
<v Speaker 4>you're probably still like Mr Rodriguez,</v>

648
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:24.480
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

649
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:24.601
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

650
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:24.750
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

651
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.760
<v Speaker 4>you're meeting like a sports celebrity to some degree.</v>

652
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:27.211
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

653
00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:29.460
<v Speaker 4>Like I'd always say like fuck Michael Jordan,</v>

654
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 4>like I'm not like a bulls fan of,</v>

655
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.850
<v Speaker 4>but it'd be amazing to meet Michael Jordan,</v>

656
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

657
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think?</v>

658
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.500
<v Speaker 4>Right now's a great time to get chicks into a two because of Ronda Rousey.</v>

659
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 4>Like there's never been never been a female fighter.</v>

660
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 4>Like Rhonda Rousey a hot check the pizza fuck out of everybody,</v>

661
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 4>but she's so hot and she really assisted video of her</v>

662
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:50.010
<v Speaker 3>with Luke rockhold and she's got Luke rockhold and what we call spider web.</v>

663
00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:51.200
<v Speaker 3>It's when you try to finish Armbar,</v>

664
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Luke rockhold is a fucking monster.</v>

665
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:53.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

666
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.661
<v Speaker 3>He's like six,</v>

667
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:55.790
<v Speaker 3>300.</v>

668
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.220
<v Speaker 3>He cuts down to one 85 is usually way over 200 pounds.</v>

669
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:02.550
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking stud at Jujitsu and Rhonda are.</v>

670
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.190
<v Speaker 3>She completes the arm bar on him like he's defending,</v>

671
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 3>like he's really defending and she completes it and he has to tap.</v>

672
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 3>That's how bad ass she is.</v>

673
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't think,</v>

674
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:11.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

675
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:11.961
<v Speaker 3>like if you,</v>

676
00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:13.380
<v Speaker 3>if you've never been armed guard before,</v>

677
00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:14.730
<v Speaker 3>you don't know how ridiculous that is.</v>

678
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.591
<v Speaker 3>Like a guy that grew,</v>

679
00:19:15.591 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 3>caught luke rockhold,</v>

680
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 3>she'd have like retarded defense,</v>

681
00:19:19.381 --> 00:19:21.710
<v Speaker 3>like he's an ace level MMA black.</v>

682
00:19:21.711 --> 00:19:22.051
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>

683
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:22.740
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>

684
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 3>This is Luke rockhold on the bottom here.</v>

685
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:24.871
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

686
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Luke rockhold again is world class in the UFC at 185 pounds.</v>

687
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 3>Just beat the fuck out of Leo Machida,</v>

688
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:32.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

689
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 3>destroyed him,</v>

690
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.830
<v Speaker 3>took him to the ground,</v>

691
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:35.551
<v Speaker 3>controlled him,</v>

692
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:36.480
<v Speaker 3>smashed him,</v>

693
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.910
<v Speaker 3>finished out the Brown and here he is trying to defend against Ronda Rousey's</v>

694
00:19:41.911 --> 00:19:45.310
<v Speaker 3>arm bar and she's got a bunch of different techniques she uses to uh,</v>

695
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.730
<v Speaker 3>attack the grip that he's using.</v>

696
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.640
<v Speaker 3>She keeps adjusting.</v>

697
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Readjusting.</v>

698
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 3>Now I see how he stepped over her head right there.</v>

699
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.380
<v Speaker 3>That's like fucking defcon four.</v>

700
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Like he knows he's in some serious trouble could if she straightens out his arm,</v>

701
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.450
<v Speaker 3>he's done and he's got a tap.</v>

702
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.600
<v Speaker 3>And she seconds away from straightening out his arm and he's going to get to</v>

703
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:01.321
<v Speaker 3>this situation is tap,</v>

704
00:20:01.321 --> 00:20:01.591
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>

705
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:01.900
<v Speaker 3>tap.</v>

706
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.730
<v Speaker 3>He had a tap.</v>

707
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 3>She fucking tapped him.</v>

708
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

709
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.380
<v Speaker 3>she fights at 1:35 as a woman.</v>

710
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:12.530
<v Speaker 3>He fights 50 pounds heavier as one of the best men in the world.</v>

711
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:16.710
<v Speaker 3>That that's how fucking good her arm bar technique is.</v>

712
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.690
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a fighter in any fucking sport like her before.</v>

713
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.171
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

714
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 3>That's like a total pioneer because she's the one before her,</v>

715
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:26.700
<v Speaker 3>like her.</v>

716
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.010
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

717
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.810
<v Speaker 4>she so impressed me on that last one with cats in Ghana.</v>

718
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

719
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.000
<v Speaker 4>Because I know it was over in 14 seconds,</v>

720
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.060
<v Speaker 4>but watching it just in real time,</v>

721
00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.260
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

722
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.450
<v Speaker 4>that was a series of lucky things that worked.</v>

723
00:20:40.451 --> 00:20:41.710
<v Speaker 4>Effort and live in that position.</v>

724
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.670
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>

725
00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:43.270
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

726
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.560
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

727
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:43.750
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

728
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.530
<v Speaker 4>And then when she said it,</v>

729
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.250
<v Speaker 4>she said in the,</v>

730
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 4>in the interview she have been working on that,</v>

731
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 1>doing the transition.</v>

732
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:51.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't borrow from that transition and she,</v>

733
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

734
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 1>and then when you watch it in slow motion,</v>

735
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.800
<v Speaker 1>you see her make a fucking decision to step over.</v>

736
00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.350
<v Speaker 1>But it was one of the craziest things I've ever seen.</v>

737
00:20:59.351 --> 00:20:59.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

738
00:20:59.501 --> 00:20:59.861
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

739
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:03.250
<v Speaker 1>she's terrifying and she's fun and she's not like a,</v>

740
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg was terrifying,</v>

742
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 1>but so much because of the size.</v>

743
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like any kind of a necessary.</v>

744
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean she had a skill set,</v>

745
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:11.351
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't that,</v>

746
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 1>that was so,</v>

747
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.460
<v Speaker 1>it was just like she was 10 times bigger than that,</v>

748
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:14.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

749
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.730
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a man.</v>

750
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

751
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean let's be at her height way worse than China.</v>

752
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:20.951
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

753
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:22.130
<v Speaker 1>why did we decide big why's?</v>

754
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.530
<v Speaker 1>She was like the side,</v>

755
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 1>but it was different because you are getting to see her actually hit people like</v>

756
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 1>in China was really impressive because she was big and strong and you're like,</v>

757
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

758
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:31.521
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

759
00:21:31.521 --> 00:21:31.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

760
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 1>she was on fear factor.</v>

761
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Like China's yoked.</v>

762
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

763
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:35.770
<v Speaker 1>she's a big girl.</v>

764
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:36.500
<v Speaker 1>If she,</v>

765
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:36.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.400
<v Speaker 1>if you had to wrestle her a goddamn tussle,</v>

767
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.293
<v Speaker 1>that's a big Gal,</v>

768
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:40.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

769
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 1>she's strongly sex tape with wrestling.</v>

770
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Stop Pussy boner.</v>

771
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.440
<v Speaker 1>That's total wrestling.</v>

772
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch the one where she did anal fro one within ones?</v>

773
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.650
<v Speaker 1>It was mostly pro launched.</v>

774
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:56.250
<v Speaker 1>If she'd have professional porns portfolio apart,</v>

775
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.620
<v Speaker 1>but you're still one where it's a back door to China on it.</v>

776
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.350
<v Speaker 1>You did it and I remember having a little bit,</v>

777
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a really famous porn dude went for poor bastard.</v>

778
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Both of them.</v>

779
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.713
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

780
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

781
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.460
<v Speaker 1>but my point was like,</v>

782
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.040
<v Speaker 1>when she,</v>

783
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.170
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to say the sideboard looked like a man,</v>

784
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 1>but when she was beating the fuck out like Gina Carano,</v>

785
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:17.530
<v Speaker 1>she was feeling like a man.</v>

786
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like the classic female body type.</v>

787
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.510
<v Speaker 1>So when she got busted for male steroids,</v>

788
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:23.763
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>

789
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.170
<v Speaker 1>of course she looks different now though,</v>

790
00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

791
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:26.720
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

792
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>she's become more feminine,</v>

793
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Speaker 1>a lot more feminine.</v>

794
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:29.973
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

795
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.530
<v Speaker 1>there's an honest debate as to what,</v>

796
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.470
<v Speaker 1>how much of how much of what you do to your body when you alter it that</v>

797
00:22:36.471 --> 00:22:37.030
<v Speaker 1>severely,</v>

798
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.440
<v Speaker 1>how much you changed this permanent.</v>

799
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they've done these studies on athletes that have taken anabolic steroids</v>

800
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.013
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

801
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 1>they've had permanent effects on the strength,</v>

802
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:48.303
<v Speaker 1>permanent,</v>

803
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 1>not just temporary but permanent,</v>

804
00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 1>like permanent improvements in strength.</v>

805
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 1>And so they wonder like,</v>

806
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 1>how much of her getting off the male hormones?</v>

807
00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Like how much does she lose?</v>

808
00:22:58.361 --> 00:22:59.171
<v Speaker 1>Does she lose all of it?</v>

809
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Is it still fair?</v>

810
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:00.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

811
00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

812
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.260
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

813
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

814
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

815
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:02.321
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

816
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:03.154
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

817
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 1>my stepfather,</v>

818
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a pretty naturally strong guy,</v>

819
00:23:05.821 --> 00:23:07.390
<v Speaker 1>but he did a bunch of steroids when he was younger.</v>

820
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.111
<v Speaker 1>Power lifting,</v>

821
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:08.944
<v Speaker 1>that's what he did.</v>

822
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.323
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

823
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

824
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:12.670
<v Speaker 1>even through his forties and he,</v>

825
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:12.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

826
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.110
<v Speaker 1>he's in his fifties now.</v>

827
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

828
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.380
<v Speaker 1>like I can still go out there and bench on just a day,</v>

829
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 1>throw up like 350 pounds.</v>

830
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean I remember it 30.</v>

831
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.460
<v Speaker 1>He's like doing like 4:55 and,</v>

832
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.250
<v Speaker 1>and he's not,</v>

833
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.083
<v Speaker 1>he always like,</v>

834
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:26.080
<v Speaker 1>a buck 70 bucks,</v>

836
00:23:26.081 --> 00:23:26.590
<v Speaker 1>75.</v>

837
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

838
00:23:26.741 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Those power lifter dudes,</v>

839
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:28.061
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

840
00:23:28.061 --> 00:23:30.250
<v Speaker 1>that's a totally different type of moving your body.</v>

841
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.640
<v Speaker 1>That's like some severe strength that's required to do.</v>

842
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.153
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying,</v>

843
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.430
<v Speaker 1>but the steroids,</v>

844
00:23:36.431 --> 00:23:38.020
<v Speaker 1>I believe like definitely you still,</v>

845
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.310
<v Speaker 1>you still build a base,</v>

846
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:39.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

847
00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:40.151
<v Speaker 1>the thing is what happened.</v>

848
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I think it raises your base.</v>

849
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.900
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean to according to these studies,</v>

850
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.080
<v Speaker 1>but the question is it gets more complicated when it's a woman because it's not,</v>

851
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not even like she took like more of what she already had.</v>

852
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 1>She actually introduced some stuff that she's not supposed to have.</v>

853
00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:54.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

854
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you do have a little bit of testosterone when you're a woman,</v>

855
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like the levels that they take when they get into bodybuilding or</v>

856
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:01.311
<v Speaker 1>power lifting.</v>

857
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Like the women that like even track and field women</v>

858
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.870
<v Speaker 1>people get get caught all the time taking shit because it works.</v>

859
00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean it changes their.</v>

860
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen like bodybuilder porn,</v>

861
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:13.120
<v Speaker 1>like girl bodybuilder,</v>

867
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.200
<v Speaker 1>I was watching one of those,</v>

868
00:24:18.201 --> 00:24:18.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

869
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.850
<v Speaker 1>those are my strange addiction shows and the lady that was addicted to</v>

870
00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:24.050
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding and she,</v>

871
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.240
<v Speaker 1>her sister was on as a point of reference.</v>

872
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting.</v>

873
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:27.621
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

874

00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:29.061
<v Speaker 1>you're getting bigger.</v>

876
00:24:29.061 --> 00:24:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to keep getting bigger?</v>

877
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:30.981
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

878
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I just love it.</v>

879
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.490
<v Speaker 1>This is what I look like now.</v>

880
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

881
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait.</v>

882
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm on how well you know,</v>

883
00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.400
<v Speaker 1>how often do you work out?</v>

884
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.090
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

885
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.301
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

886
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I work out like three days a week.</v>

887
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:39.861
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

888
00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I work out seven hours a day.</v>

889
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 1>She was working out six,</v>

890
00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.311
<v Speaker 1>seven hours a day.</v>

891
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Her fucking head was as big as Tito Ortiz's and my mood together.</v>

892
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.470
<v Speaker 1>She's a giant fucking neck.</v>

893
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Huge traps.</v>

894
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Look at this broad.</v>

895
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.083
<v Speaker 1>Is that her?</v>

896
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that the one from the show yet?</v>

897
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of this lady.</v>

898
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

899
00:24:57.621 --> 00:25:00.560
<v Speaker 1>It's me and I'm the years ago,</v>

900
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe 2005 or something of 2006.</v>

901
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Me and Patrice to the nasty show in Montreal together and after the show there</v>

902
00:25:07.911 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 1>was a bodybuilder chick who was white girl way into him and really thorough and</v>

903
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:13.300
<v Speaker 1>she was.</v>

904
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.540
<v Speaker 1>She was just saying stuff like,</v>

905
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:15.500
<v Speaker 1>so sexy to own.</v>

906
00:25:15.501 --> 00:25:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Patrice was so weird.</v>

907
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean you didn't do anything with it,</v>

908
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.740
<v Speaker 1>but I remember him saying he was like,</v>

909
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.640
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

910
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I might just have to wrestle it as big bitch.</v>

911
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.110
<v Speaker 5>I was with a Jujitsu girl once.</v>

912
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.580
<v Speaker 5>That was very intimidating.</v>

913
00:25:27.581 --> 00:25:27.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

914
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:28.390
<v Speaker 5>but that's it.</v>

915
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.830
<v Speaker 5>She's a regular size gal.</v>

916
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.933
<v Speaker 5>She's an actual.</v>

917
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:31.730
<v Speaker 5>This other one,</v>

918
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you know about that was a different one.</v>

919
00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:33.851
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

920
00:25:33.851 --> 00:25:37.110
<v Speaker 5>there's been with three Jujitsu chicks before.</v>

921
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.020
<v Speaker 5>One was definitely bigger than the other ones and she just had one of those big</v>

922
00:25:41.021 --> 00:25:46.021
<v Speaker 5>bodies and I remember her vagina was very clean and like no hair but yet had</v>

923
00:25:46.031 --> 00:25:47.700
<v Speaker 5>that explosion of Pussy,</v>

924
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:48.190
<v Speaker 5>lips,</v>

925
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.180
<v Speaker 5>Brown Pussy Lips.</v>

926
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.330
<v Speaker 5>They give us like a midi vagina and it was weird.</v>

927
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.193
<v Speaker 5>It was a weird.</v>

928
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I've never even fucked a chick with abs.</v>

929
00:25:56.821 --> 00:26:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think ever had one gal that was a bodybuilder when I was like really</v>

930
00:26:01.411 --> 00:26:01.711
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

931
00:26:01.711 --> 00:26:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I think I was 21 and a day.</v>

932
00:26:04.351 --> 00:26:06.570
<v Speaker 1>This gal from New Hampshire had a six pack.</v>

933
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.890
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

934
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Had its rear body though.</v>

935
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Her legs were incredible.</v>

936
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean that like an like those bodies and dresses look great.</v>

937
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the girls just like abs,</v>

938
00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.321
<v Speaker 1>like bodybuilder.</v>

939
00:26:16.321 --> 00:26:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I was just like a girl who's like toned and strong,</v>

940
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:19.890
<v Speaker 1>but looks like a girl.</v>

941
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a difference in the girls strongholds.</v>

942
00:26:21.541 --> 00:26:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Who girl or a guy like no fence.</v>

943
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.930
<v Speaker 1>The lady in those photographs was most likely on some male hormones.</v>

944
00:26:27.931 --> 00:26:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

945
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.340
<v Speaker 1>you get the fuck out of here.</v>

946
00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:30.990
<v Speaker 1>That's Vito Belfort in Brazil.</v>

947
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>

948
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that chick.</v>

949
00:26:33.361 --> 00:26:35.550
<v Speaker 1>She looks like Mark Coleman when he won the heavyweight title,</v>

950
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.400
<v Speaker 1>but you can even put that male hormone is why their faces.</v>

951
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.370
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't the face she was destined to have.</v>

952
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

953
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.640
<v Speaker 1>she has a man's face.</v>

954
00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

955
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.260
<v Speaker 1>She's very manly.</v>

956
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Mean like monster.</v>

957
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:49.281
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really weird touching a girl also when it's hard as a rock and not</v>

958
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 1>like soft and she and.</v>

959
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

960
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:52.891
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

961
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 1>here's the question.</v>

962
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that better or worse than someone who eats themselves into a gelatinous wall</v>

963
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 1>of meat?</v>

964
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I would take fat over that whale.</v>

965
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Like for a Gal,</v>

966
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:04.010
<v Speaker 1>for your lady friend.</v>

967
00:27:04.011 --> 00:27:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Fat Chicks we're going to come up with are awesome.</v>

968
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

969
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I would hook up.</v>

970
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd hook up with A.</v>

971
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the ones,</v>

972
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.763
<v Speaker 1>for the storage,</v>

973
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd go that direct life.</v>

974
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.930
<v Speaker 1>You think like if you could get her off the sauce,</v>

975
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.730
<v Speaker 1>she could probably woman up a little bit.</v>

976
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

977
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.633
<v Speaker 1>Much.</v>

978
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.630
<v Speaker 1>How much would she woman,</v>

979
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 1>but she would still retain a bunch of it,</v>

980
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

981
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I know because there's a gal that lives in my friend's neighborhood and I go to</v>

982
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:32.900
<v Speaker 1>visit him and she was apparently some Olympia Olympian bodybuilder back in the</v>

983
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.970
<v Speaker 1>day and now she's like in her fifties and she looks like a monster.</v>

984
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Really looks like a monster.</v>

985
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Just faces all.</v>

986
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:39.730
<v Speaker 1>She looks.</v>

987
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:40.563
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

988
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:41.880
<v Speaker 1>when I say monster,</v>

989
00:27:41.881 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean like the worst monster.</v>

990
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean like a.</v>

991
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.030
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be kind of scary?</v>

992
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just what she's,</v>

993
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:54.290
<v Speaker 1>what she did was turn herself into a semi male semi female thing.</v>

994
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Like she changed.</v>

995
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Her appearance has changed and it's become,</v>

996
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

997
00:28:02.111 --> 00:28:05.610
<v Speaker 1>she'd become more male than you're supposed to be or then she was,</v>

998
00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.053
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>

999
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:07.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:28:07.741 --> 00:28:08.574
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1001
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you can't go back either.</v>

1002
00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:10.584
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can.</v>

1003
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that could probably,</v>

1004
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 1>like I saw a Gal,</v>

1005
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 1>her chin shaved down,</v>

1006
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:19.530
<v Speaker 1>she was some big bodybuilder lady power lifter Marshall trying to get something</v>

1007
00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 1>like that Chin shaved down because her chin got too big.</v>

1008
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Trying to get all that,</v>

1009
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.470
<v Speaker 1>try to use to have that square face.</v>

1010
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.470
<v Speaker 1>She changed,</v>

1011
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.330
<v Speaker 1>she became much more feminine when they start opening your skin,</v>

1012
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 1>grinding down your bones.</v>

1013
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Arnold had that done to.</v>

1014
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Arnold had developed a very large um,</v>

1015
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.550
<v Speaker 1>upper brow area.</v>

1016
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Then like there's like before and after liquid,</v>

1017
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:45.480
<v Speaker 1>you look at him and Conan and you look at them skull shaving shaved the skull</v>

1018
00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 1>down to something more reasonable.</v>

1019
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever just a room though?</v>

1020
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.050
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those rumors like the Richard Gere durable and we can never really</v>

1021
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:52.580
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1022
00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:53.130
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1023
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.620
<v Speaker 1>me and my buddy literally just talked about this,</v>

1024
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:54.930
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

1025
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 1>those urban myths like that was actually a,</v>

1026
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.840
<v Speaker 1>the journal up the ass was a specific Philadelphia News.</v>

1027
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.990
<v Speaker 1>They used to say it about in affiliate.</v>

1028
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:03.511
<v Speaker 1>That story,</v>

1029
00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:04.640
<v Speaker 1>that urban legend and we and the,</v>

1030
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.510
<v Speaker 1>and the other one was uh,</v>

1031
00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:06.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1032
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.051
<v Speaker 1>pumping a gallon,</v>

1033
00:29:07.051 --> 00:29:07.884
<v Speaker 1>a comment or.</v>

1034
00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:09.843
<v Speaker 1>But you wouldn't be,</v>

1035
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:10.531
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1036
00:29:10.531 --> 00:29:11.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1037
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:11.821
<v Speaker 1>the origin,</v>

1038
00:29:11.821 --> 00:29:13.120
<v Speaker 1>like where it started from that.</v>

1039
00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the literal we were talking about earlier.</v>

1040
00:29:15.631 --> 00:29:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Was that a like,</v>

1041
00:29:17.071 --> 00:29:22.071
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how that got around so many years before the Internet.</v>

1042
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Like for Shit,</v>

1043
00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.510
<v Speaker 1>for rumors to happen now is simple one person of any kind of like,</v>

1044
00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:27.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1045
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:31.170
<v Speaker 1>who has any kind of ear or already kind of voice for people you know,</v>

1046
00:29:31.171 --> 00:29:32.030
<v Speaker 1>like says something.</v>

1047
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.570
<v Speaker 1>It becomes Gospel to some people.</v>

1048
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1049
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.800
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about it a bunch of times that that's the mother of all rumors like</v>

1050
00:29:39.241 --> 00:29:39.451
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1051
00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 1>No other rumor can close because Eddie Bravo grew up in la.</v>

1052
00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Boston.</v>

1053
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:44.470
<v Speaker 1>We both heard about it at the same time.</v>

1054
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.870
<v Speaker 1>You lived in Columbus so it made its way across.</v>

1056
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 1>But the Rod Stewart one was nothing compared to roster one was he had his</v>

1057
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:52.954
<v Speaker 1>stomach pumped.</v>

1058
00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just throw up.</v>

1059
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Didn't make any sense.</v>

1060
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I had thrown up and went,</v>

1061
00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:57.701
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

1062
00:29:57.701 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 1>How much did he drink?</v>

1063
00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.613
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1064
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1065
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Just puke.</v>

1066
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.990
<v Speaker 1>But you have to go to the computer to possibly been.</v>

1067
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to go to the top hospital and tell him he drank calm.</v>

1068
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Why they going to test it?</v>

1069
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck do they know what it is?</v>

1070
00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 1>You have to tell him it's fucking milk or glue or something.</v>

1071
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 1>But so much that has to come out.</v>

1072
00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:15.690
<v Speaker 1>It was blowing,</v>

1073
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:16.570
<v Speaker 1>blowing Peter North.</v>

1074
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Imagine going into the hospital and just first of all I thought about how much I</v>

1075
00:30:21.491 --> 00:30:23.410
<v Speaker 1>came at the time I was a young,</v>

1076
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:24.100
<v Speaker 1>young boy.</v>

1077
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I was probably like 12 when that rumor came out and I was thinking about how</v>

1078
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 1>much I can come.</v>

1079
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:29.261
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1080
00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:31.900
<v Speaker 1>how much more could a grown adult possibly come?</v>

1081
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make any sense.</v>

1082
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Like how much could it be in my body?</v>

1083
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:40.200
<v Speaker 1>It gives your baby bird come like that's how much come on Carolyn.</v>

1084
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking that back.</v>

1085
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.700
<v Speaker 1>You know nothing to think about it.</v>

1086
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I think this came out when I was 12 so I probably had never come yet.</v>

1087
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Just that weird little shiver.</v>

1088
00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.351
<v Speaker 1>I probably,</v>

1089
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:50.591
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1090
00:30:50.591 --> 00:30:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I probably really didn't even know like what the actual volume would be.</v>

1091
00:30:53.951 --> 00:30:55.000
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't make any sense,</v>

1092
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:58.750
<v Speaker 1>but I just didn't like they said it was like courts or gallons or something like</v>

1093
00:30:58.751 --> 00:30:58.920
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1094
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 1>12 you knew would come was you just knew it wasn't happening to you when you</v>

1095
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.570
<v Speaker 1>can't really find it back then either.</v>

1096
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.770
<v Speaker 1>When did pretty woman come out?</v>

1097
00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:06.461
<v Speaker 1>Because it came out,</v>

1098
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:07.294
<v Speaker 1>that was way later.</v>

1099
00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:07.910
<v Speaker 1>That was way later.</v>

1100
00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 1>They're going to come out after that.</v>

1101
00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:12.040
<v Speaker 1>That's why we all knew who Richard greer gear was.</v>

1102
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.450
<v Speaker 1>He knew who he was before the officer.</v>

1103
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Gentleman off.</v>

1104
00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1105
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:16.870
<v Speaker 1>American Gigolo.</v>

1106
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:18.040
<v Speaker 1>He was in a lot of big movies.</v>

1107
00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Do it seemed like it came out of her.</v>

1108
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty limited,</v>

1109
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.900
<v Speaker 1>but what's to say?</v>

1110
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I just came up again because that was the next big,</v>

1111
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.651
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

1112
00:31:23.651 --> 00:31:24.484
<v Speaker 1>big hit he did.</v>

1113
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.370
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing that it made it all the way across the country like that.</v>

1114
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1115
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:28.001
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1116
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:28.481
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1117
00:31:28.481 --> 00:31:30.790
<v Speaker 1>The word was that he had left scientology,</v>

1118
00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.173
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>

1119
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Where did I get this word?</v>

1120
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Have No,</v>

1121
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.270
<v Speaker 1>it is the most poorly researched,</v>

1122
00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:37.104
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1123
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.930
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I heard is that he left scientology and someone in scientology</v>

1124
00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:41.111
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1125
00:31:41.111 --> 00:31:41.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1126
00:31:41.171 --> 00:31:41.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1127
00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 1>we'll fix that fucker.</v>

1128
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.420
<v Speaker 1>And they put out some crazy rumor that homeboy had a job up his ass.</v>

1129
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I believe that we've been following that whole hbo show going.</v>

1130
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:51.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1131
00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.090
<v Speaker 1>There's only the one documentary right now.</v>

1132
00:31:55.091 --> 00:31:58.150
<v Speaker 1>They're making a documentary about that guy that made the movie.</v>

1133
00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Scientology is.</v>

1134
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:03.940
<v Speaker 1>They're also making a documentary about Louis Thorough Louis Theroux that</v>

1135
00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:05.860
<v Speaker 1>documentary and I love him.</v>

1136
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.140

1137
00:32:08.141 --> 00:32:10.750
<v Speaker 1>so scientology decided to do a documentary on him</v>

1138

1143
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a cool documentary.</v>

1144
00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to be really well.</v>

1145
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Well done in it.</v>

1146

<v Speaker 1>Everything's great.</v>

1147
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:26.460
<v Speaker 1>It's all about roses and I think it's a headpiece,</v>

1149
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:26.861
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1150
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:27.641
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they're doing.</v>

1151
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:30.190
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to intimidate people from bringing attention to them.</v>

1152
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 1>You know what I just watched this morning,</v>

1153
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I woke up on Netflix and I was watching a documentary called tricked about the</v>

1154
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.200
<v Speaker 1>sec guys,</v>

1155
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:38.861
<v Speaker 1>pimp girls.</v>

1156
00:32:38.861 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I get girls like young girls</v>

1157
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 4>and pimp them out and the stuff they say to convince them and the girls giving</v>

1158
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:45.650
<v Speaker 4>their account of what,</v>

1159
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1160
00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 4>what the guy said to them and how they were like,</v>

1161
00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:48.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1162
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.070
<v Speaker 4>to hey,</v>

1163
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.970
<v Speaker 4>I've got invited to a party and then there was no other party.</v>

1164
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.251
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1165
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:52.341
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1166
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:53.091
<v Speaker 4>let's go have some dinner,</v>

1167
00:32:53.091 --> 00:32:53.611
<v Speaker 4>and then like,</v>

1168
00:32:53.611 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1169
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.920
<v Speaker 4>two hours later it was like,</v>

1170
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:56.210
<v Speaker 4>fuck this guy's Dick in a car.</v>

1171
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 4>It's the same when you hear these adults who were out of scientology talking</v>

1172
00:33:01.101 --> 00:33:03.830
<v Speaker 4>about and one thing I was actually laughing a lot in the document is saying</v>

1173
00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:04.011
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1174
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:07.430
<v Speaker 4>I know it sounds so stupid telling it to you that they were like,</v>

1175
00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1176
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.070
<v Speaker 4>if you don't sit in this room for the next three months,</v>

1177
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:11.850
<v Speaker 4>you know you're all going to hell and you're,</v>

1178
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.670
<v Speaker 4>your inner aliens are going to fuck you up or something.</v>

1179
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:15.963
<v Speaker 4>The tetons,</v>

1180
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.120
<v Speaker 4>they came up with it.</v>

1181
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.033
<v Speaker 4>You just get like,</v>

1182
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how someone could talk you into that stupid shit.</v>

1183
00:33:21.411 --> 00:33:22.244
<v Speaker 4>Like I really don't.</v>

1184
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 4>The pimp mentality.</v>

1185
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:23.880
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1186
00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 4>I guess I'm not that a convincing of a speaker to even think that I could do</v>

1187
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:28.664
<v Speaker 4>some shit like that.</v>

1188
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.600
<v Speaker 4>I think you're not a loser and I think there's a lot of people out there and not</v>

1189
00:33:32.601 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 4>saying that everyone who's a prostitute or a scientologist is a loser,</v>

1190
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.190
<v Speaker 3>but let's be honest,</v>

1191
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.900
<v Speaker 3>not so much in your favor,</v>

1192
00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:45.280
<v Speaker 3>but the point being,</v>

1193
00:33:45.281 --> 00:33:48.430
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you're down and out and everybody's been down and out,</v>

1194
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.360
<v Speaker 3>there's certain people that get a different level of down now than you've ever</v>

1195
00:33:52.361 --> 00:33:53.650
<v Speaker 3>been or I or you.</v>

1196
00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.970
<v Speaker 3>That's the reality of it.</v>

1197
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessarily that it's their fault,</v>

1198
00:33:56.591 --> 00:33:59.380
<v Speaker 3>it's just there's levels of down and out and some people,</v>

1199
00:33:59.381 --> 00:34:03.430
<v Speaker 3>your life is shit from the moment you're born,</v>

1200
00:34:03.431 --> 00:34:05.170
<v Speaker 3>you're born into a terrible environment.</v>

1201
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Your parents are fucked up.</v>

1202
00:34:06.881 --> 00:34:08.380
<v Speaker 3>Your family life is fucked up.</v>

1203
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.700
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of abuse.</v>

1204
00:34:09.701 --> 00:34:10.810
<v Speaker 3>There's sexual abuse,</v>

1205
00:34:10.811 --> 00:34:11.740
<v Speaker 3>there's violence,</v>

1206
00:34:11.741 --> 00:34:12.580
<v Speaker 3>there's chaos,</v>

1207
00:34:12.581 --> 00:34:13.420
<v Speaker 3>there's crime,</v>

1208
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.830
<v Speaker 3>there's starvation.</v>

1209
00:34:14.831 --> 00:34:17.650
<v Speaker 3>You never know where your food's coming from and then all of a sudden some dude</v>

1210
00:34:17.651 --> 00:34:21.880
<v Speaker 3>comes along and he's given you love and that is reality and it's not pretty and</v>

1211
00:34:21.881 --> 00:34:22.691
<v Speaker 3>people don't like it,</v>

1212
00:34:22.691 --> 00:34:23.740
<v Speaker 3>but there's levels.</v>

1213
00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:25.510
<v Speaker 3>There's levels of fucked up.</v>

1214
00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.373
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about.</v>

1215
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about all of it.</v>

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:56.810
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1234
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:59.440
<v Speaker 4>You worked on like a used tire farm or something?</v>

1235
00:34:59.800 --> 00:34:59.980
<v Speaker 4>She would</v>

1236
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.150
<v Speaker 3>happen yesterday in Texas.</v>

1237
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:01.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1238
00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.100
<v Speaker 3>they had a drama Hammad contest or draw Mohammed art exhibit.</v>

1239
00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:10.020
<v Speaker 3>So some guys came and started shooting at them and they,</v>

1240
00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:13.990
<v Speaker 3>they killed these two guys that were shooting at this drama.</v>

1241
00:35:13.991 --> 00:35:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Hammad exhibit.</v>

1242
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1243
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:16.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Shooting at people in Texas is like,</v>

1245
00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.793
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1246
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.491
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

1247
00:35:21.491 --> 00:35:23.590
<v Speaker 3>That's like jumping in the water and try to bite a shark.</v>

1248
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.930
<v Speaker 3>It might be one of the dumbest fucking thing around everyone in Texas is armed</v>

1249
00:35:28.931 --> 00:35:29.764
<v Speaker 3>to the tits.</v>

1250
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.630
<v Speaker 3>You can't just be shooting people in Texas,</v>

1251
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.570
<v Speaker 3>especially at a draw Mohammed exhibit,</v>

1252
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 3>they should just have draw Mohammed exhibits and then just like guys</v>

1253
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.340
<v Speaker 5>with police surround it and just wait for somebody to come and it's like a</v>

1254
00:35:41.341 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 5>honeypot,</v>

1255
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:42.211
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1256
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 5>That's like a,</v>

1257
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.040
<v Speaker 5>a trap</v>

1258
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.090
<v Speaker 3>that is a good way to shoot like really radical extremists.</v>

1259
00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.700
<v Speaker 3>But did they think that they can shoot you?</v>

1260
00:35:49.701 --> 00:35:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Because I see this argued on twitter all the fucking time.</v>

1261
00:35:52.731 --> 00:35:53.750
<v Speaker 3>They should've been provoking them.</v>

1262
00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:59.140
<v Speaker 3>If all they have to do to provoke you is draw a picture of a guy.</v>

1263
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:00.850
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1264
00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:01.850
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

1265
00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Like how could anybody beyond there.</v>

1266
00:36:04.311 --> 00:36:07.700
<v Speaker 3>So how could anybody ever formed that argument by saying,</v>

1267
00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.680
<v Speaker 3>oh well maybe they shouldn't be parochial.</v>

1268
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:10.760
<v Speaker 3>They knew what they were doing.</v>

1269
00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:12.320
<v Speaker 3>They're doing that to incite violence.</v>

1270
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:12.831
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1271
00:36:12.831 --> 00:36:14.450
<v Speaker 3>there are drawing.</v>

1272
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.320
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1273
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.160
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>

1274
00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.720
<v Speaker 3>There's something designed to piss off there.</v>

1275
00:36:17.721 --> 00:36:18.430
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think of it.</v>

1276
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:20.960
<v Speaker 3>You don't to get to the point where they want to kill you.</v>

1277
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.070
<v Speaker 3>Just not nothing,</v>

1278
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.551
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1279
00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Your mother could be sucking a gorilla's Dick.</v>

1280
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not good enough.</v>

1281
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.061
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1282
00:36:26.061 --> 00:36:26.281
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1283
00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:26.470
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1284
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.840
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1285
00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.330
<v Speaker 3>your mothers should be jerking off King Kong or Godzilla fucks her mouth well</v>

1286
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.790
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

1287
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:32.541
<v Speaker 3>You could draw that.</v>

1288
00:36:32.541 --> 00:36:33.560
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to want to kill you.</v>

1289
00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.670
<v Speaker 3>But I believe in the thing.</v>

1290
00:36:34.671 --> 00:36:34.881
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1291
00:36:34.881 --> 00:36:35.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1292
00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:35.541
<v Speaker 3>draw.</v>

1293
00:36:35.541 --> 00:36:35.961
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed,</v>

1294
00:36:35.961 --> 00:36:36.510
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

1295
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.080
<v Speaker 3>I think you shouldn't be shown it.</v>

1296
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:38.800
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1297
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.470
<v Speaker 3>we've already been over the shock that people will murder for this.</v>

1298
00:36:41.471 --> 00:36:42.304
<v Speaker 3>So it's Kinda like when,</v>

1299
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.550
<v Speaker 3>when that happens,</v>

1300
00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.520
<v Speaker 3>know it doesn't blow you away as much.</v>

1301
00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you hear about cops,</v>

1302
00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:48.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1303
00:36:48.711 --> 00:36:49.940
<v Speaker 3>being in things where they killed a black kid,</v>

1304
00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:51.230
<v Speaker 3>are you blown away anymore?</v>

1305
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.080
<v Speaker 3>We're desensitized to that story almost at this point.</v>

1306
00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:54.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1307
00:36:54.501 --> 00:36:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1308
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Well I guess we are to a certain extent,</v>

1309
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1310
00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.693
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely,</v>

1311
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.200
<v Speaker 3>we're not as surprised.</v>

1312
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.060
<v Speaker 3>It's still outrageous to people,</v>

1313
00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:03.350
<v Speaker 3>but we're not as surprised,</v>

1314
00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:04.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1315
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:09.290
<v Speaker 3>just the idea that it's somehow or another excusable in any way,</v>

1316
00:37:09.291 --> 00:37:12.140
<v Speaker 3>shape or form that you would think about that you think about.</v>

1317
00:37:12.141 --> 00:37:12.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1318
00:37:12.291 --> 00:37:14.090
<v Speaker 3>what they did is definitely ridiculous.</v>

1319
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.290
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want violence,</v>

1320
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:16.490
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely ridiculous.</v>

1321
00:37:16.491 --> 00:37:18.830
<v Speaker 3>But if that's all it takes to incite violence,</v>

1322
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.600
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck do you in that cycle,</v>

1323
00:37:20.601 --> 00:37:22.850
<v Speaker 3>you just kind of keep perpetuating that to the end of time.</v>

1324
00:37:22.851 --> 00:37:23.631
<v Speaker 3>Is it perfect?</v>

1325
00:37:23.631 --> 00:37:24.950
<v Speaker 3>It never needs any evolution.</v>

1326
00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:25.870
<v Speaker 3>You telling the,</v>

1327
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:30.680
<v Speaker 3>the idea at all that somehow or another it's offensive to draw someone is so</v>

1328
00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:35.390
<v Speaker 3>fucking ridiculous in 2015 that anybody that defends in any way,</v>

1329
00:37:35.391 --> 00:37:37.580
<v Speaker 3>shape or form even like peripherally you're,</v>

1330
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.950
<v Speaker 3>you're way off from.</v>

1331
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.950
<v Speaker 3>You've talked to Dave attell,</v>

1332
00:37:39.951 --> 00:37:43.010
<v Speaker 3>he'll tell you that the whole world is like more nervous than ever.</v>

1333
00:37:43.011 --> 00:37:43.401
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1334
00:37:43.401 --> 00:37:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Like people are more offended than ever.</v>

1335
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.620
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>

1336
00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.640
<v Speaker 3>They are more offended than ever.</v>

1337
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:47.990
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird time for comedy.</v>

1338
00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:48.921
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1339
00:37:48.921 --> 00:37:49.211
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1340
00:37:49.211 --> 00:37:50.670
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of shit that you're not supposed to make you.</v>

1341
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Like people are actually saying.</v>

1342
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1343
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.670
<v Speaker 3>Someone made a joke about Bruce Jenner and people were saying,</v>

1344
00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1345
00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.481
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1346
00:37:56.481 --> 00:37:57.560
<v Speaker 3>it's not cool to make fun of them.</v>

1347
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:57.981
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1348
00:37:57.981 --> 00:37:59.450
<v Speaker 3>it's not the Jamie Foxx.</v>

1349
00:37:59.451 --> 00:38:01.490
<v Speaker 3>And was so like benign.</v>

1350
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.360
<v Speaker 3>It was so benign.</v>

1351
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.330
<v Speaker 3>And then Bill Maher had one too and everybody was upset at it.</v>

1352
00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

1353
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.100
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1354
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:06.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1355
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:08.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever's wrong with him,</v>

1356
00:38:08.361 --> 00:38:12.380
<v Speaker 3>whatever's wrong with Bruce Jenner to say that you can't make fun of that.</v>

1357
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1358
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.720
<v Speaker 3>well then everything funny is off base,</v>

1359
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:19.340
<v Speaker 3>but you got a guy who was an Olympic gold medalist and now become a woman and he</v>

1360
00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:20.570
<v Speaker 3>still wants to be a he,</v>

1361
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:24.050
<v Speaker 3>so he still wants you to refer to them as Bruce until he decides to change that</v>

1362
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.150
<v Speaker 3>he's shooting his lips,</v>

1363
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.740
<v Speaker 3>he's taking hormones that there's no humor in that.</v>

1364
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>

1365
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:28.611
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

1366
00:38:28.611 --> 00:38:29.301
<v Speaker 3>That's perfect.</v>

1367
00:38:29.301 --> 00:38:29.720
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

1368
00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.710
<v Speaker 3>beautiful and peaceful.</v>

1369
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Technically it's not too soon either because he's been wearing panty since like</v>

1370
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.120
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 85 or something.</v>

1371
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:35.531
<v Speaker 3>He said.</v>

1372
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:37.620
<v Speaker 3>So He's been taking hormones for two years,</v>

1373
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.220
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

1374
00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.690
<v Speaker 3>he took hormones back in the late eighties also.</v>

1375
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 3>He's done a interview.</v>

1376
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:45.220
<v Speaker 3>He says that this is the second time he's ever done that.</v>

1377
00:38:45.221 --> 00:38:45.520
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1378
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1379
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 3>so he took,</v>

1380
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.530
<v Speaker 3>he started playing the intellect trolls.</v>

1381
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Just take off all the hair on his face when he was way younger too.</v>

1382
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:52.893
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

1383
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1384
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:55.510
<v Speaker 3>So he went through all this stuff like way,</v>

1385
00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:55.841
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1386
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 3>way younger.</v>

1387
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:56.891
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

1388
00:38:56.891 --> 00:38:58.340
<v Speaker 3>So it's not even like,</v>

1389
00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.233
<v Speaker 3>this is things that,</v>

1390
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:04.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean people were making jokes about him without confirmation from him for</v>

1391
00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:04.811
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1392
00:39:04.811 --> 00:39:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Even when that Kardashians show,</v>

1393
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 3>when you're making the same exact show that people are actually getting,</v>

1394
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:08.880
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1395
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 3>like look at this prophecy when you know,</v>

1396
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:10.921
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1397
00:39:10.921 --> 00:39:12.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't just to throw a name out there.</v>

1398
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:12.611
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1399
00:39:12.611 --> 00:39:12.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1400
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 3>like Dave Chappelle made a joke three years ago about this.</v>

1401
00:39:15.371 --> 00:39:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1402
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.731
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1403
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 3>he's looked like a woman for the past 10 years.</v>

1404
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.350
<v Speaker 3>If someone made a joke about it,</v>

1405
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:21.910
<v Speaker 3>there was a joke on siren or something.</v>

1406
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:22.763
<v Speaker 3>The nineties.</v>

1407
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1408
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:24.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1409
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.660
<v Speaker 3>about like a thing.</v>

1410
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 3>It was a woman from behind and it's Bruce Jenner with the opposite thinking.</v>

1411
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 3>It was Bruce Jenner and it's a woman.</v>

1412
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.590
<v Speaker 3>One of those.</v>

1413
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.460
<v Speaker 3>You didn't watch the,</v>

1414
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:33.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1415
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:34.623
<v Speaker 3>interview at all.</v>

1416
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I watch very little of it.</v>

1417
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.440
<v Speaker 3>There were some really some really great parts in point.</v>

1418
00:39:38.441 --> 00:39:39.310
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember it now.</v>

1419
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:39.910
<v Speaker 3>She tear up.</v>

1420
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1421
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.750
<v Speaker 3>this is the.</v>

1422
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:41.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1423
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hear it.</v>

1424
00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.380
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was.</v>

1425
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing was ridiculous and hilarious.</v>

1426
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to make fun of it,</v>

1427
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:45.491
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1428
00:39:45.491 --> 00:39:50.491
<v Speaker 3>Because you're supposed to be open minded and you're supposed to be supportive</v>

1429
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.770
<v Speaker 3>and kind to someone who's obviously transitioned through a very,</v>

1430
00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.720
<v Speaker 3>very rough and difficult thing that's all well and good and I'm with that.</v>

1431
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:59.703
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

1432
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 3>But if you're not homophobic or transphobic running that and you really don't</v>

1433
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:05.520
<v Speaker 3>have any problem with anybody doing anything,</v>

1434
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.330
<v Speaker 3>they want to do whatever you want to.</v>

1435
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll totally accepted.</v>

1436
00:40:08.321 --> 00:40:09.730
<v Speaker 3>I have zero problem with it at all,</v>

1437
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 3>but to tell me it's not funny.</v>

1438
00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Please get the fuck Outta here.</v>

1439
00:40:14.201 --> 00:40:15.920
<v Speaker 3>You got a guy who's becoming a like.</v>

1440
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.430
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy who's six foot six who's playing college,</v>

1441
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:19.450
<v Speaker 3>women's basketball.</v>

1442
00:40:19.451 --> 00:40:20.350
<v Speaker 3>He's 50.</v>

1443
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1444
00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.350
<v Speaker 3>He was a man most of his life.</v>

1445
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.071
<v Speaker 3>Had Children.</v>

1446
00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Just decided at one point in time that he wanted to be a woman and then found</v>

1447
00:40:27.221 --> 00:40:29.140
<v Speaker 3>out that because he's now a new sex,</v>

1448
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:31.150
<v Speaker 3>he can reenter college sports.</v>

1449
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:35.530
<v Speaker 3>So he played college basketball as a fucking man back in the day and now he's</v>

1450
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:37.570
<v Speaker 3>playing college basketball as a girl,</v>

1451
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:41.640
<v Speaker 3>but he's 50 and he's and he's a giant full exchange,</v>

1452
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 3>full sex change.</v>

1453
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.520
<v Speaker 3>So he's moving around with and then there's people that are freaking out about</v>

1454
00:40:45.521 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 3>it and there's people that are saying you shouldn't make fun of it and you</v>

1455
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:52.801
<v Speaker 3>should just let it be like look to to say this is not controversial is crazy.</v>

1456
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:59.010
<v Speaker 3>You're a crazy person to say there's not some controversy in a six foot 6:50</v>

1457
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:02.560
<v Speaker 3>year old man playing college sports with girls.</v>

1458
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:03.723
<v Speaker 3>I mean what?</v>

1459
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.271
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1460
00:41:04.271 --> 00:41:06.340
<v Speaker 3>now he's a woman so we have to call them a woman now.</v>

1461
00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1462
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.700
<v Speaker 3>But can we just can see that he was a man for 40 fucking years and has a Benz</v>

1463
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 3>frame and is enormous.</v>

1464
00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Like can we can see that being 50 is probably a little old to be playing</v>

1465
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.810
<v Speaker 3>basketball against teenagers?</v>

1466
00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:20.081
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1467
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 3>because you've got to protect people's feelings.</v>

1468
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:22.630
<v Speaker 3>We write letters and shit.</v>

1469
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1470
00:41:23.021 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at the whole thing is like her.</v>

1471
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me,</v>

1472
00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.380
<v Speaker 3>but he went to Bruce Jenner thing.</v>

1473
00:41:29.381 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 3>Where I found so interesting is,</v>

1474
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 3>is that I feel like</v>

1475
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.940
<v Speaker 1>by what people would say,</v>

1476
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd be judged in my life as like phobic,</v>

1477
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 1>whatever that word means.</v>

1478
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Yet I have no pr.</v>

1479
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.451
<v Speaker 1>I think you should be able to,</v>

1480
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:42.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to do,</v>

1481
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:46.580
<v Speaker 1>if you want to cut your dick off to get a pussy made by Dr. get your Dick cut</v>

1482
00:41:46.581 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1483
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think I should be judged because I think that's bonkers.</v>

1484
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.951
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1485
00:41:51.951 --> 00:41:52.731
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to do it,</v>

1486
00:41:52.731 --> 00:41:52.971
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1487
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:53.451
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

1488
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:54.284
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid of it.</v>

1489
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

1490
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't not shake somebody's hand because they were transgender in any of</v>

1491
00:41:57.771 --> 00:41:57.951
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1492
00:41:57.951 --> 00:41:58.221
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1493
00:41:58.221 --> 00:41:58.820
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

1494
00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I still think it's like a fucking.</v>

1495
00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a decision that you probably should have been talked out of by</v>

1496
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:03.021
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

1497
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 1>So maybe and maybe not.</v>

1498
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:05.061
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

1499
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about you dressing like a woman or being gay or feeling this</v>

1500
00:42:08.841 --> 00:42:09.350
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1501
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.183
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1502
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I've made an argument many times and I've got into many arguments about this</v>

1503
00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:17.300
<v Speaker 1>because people just jumped the gun on the words.</v>

1504
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.650
<v Speaker 1>But with gay I'm a,</v>

1505
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1506
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.580
<v Speaker 1>my friend with me as gay here,</v>

1507
00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I've tons of gay friends.</v>

1508
00:42:23.721 --> 00:42:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I have no weirdness with gay people at all,</v>

1509
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.230
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's like a deviate.</v>

1510
00:42:29.231 --> 00:42:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like something that went wrong almost like,</v>

1511
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1512
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.950
<v Speaker 1>to the extent of like webbed fingers or something,</v>

1513
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.870
<v Speaker 1>but there shouldn't be anything wrong with it and people should.</v>

1514
00:42:35.871 --> 00:42:36.740
<v Speaker 1>We have to do whatever they want to do,</v>

1515
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:37.400
<v Speaker 1>who gives a shit,</v>

1516
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.233
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying at all.</v>

1517
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.201
<v Speaker 1>But to start,</v>

1518
00:42:39.201 --> 00:42:42.950
<v Speaker 1>if you're gonna start monitoring your body to do something where it's like,</v>

1519
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.910
<v Speaker 1>even when it's done,</v>

1520
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.620
<v Speaker 1>like no one's,</v>

1521
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.100
<v Speaker 1>no one's really happy from the stuff I've read it.</v>

1522
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Read and watched elise with their new pussy.</v>

1523
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.371
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1524
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:53.510
<v Speaker 1>You could say that you have to</v>

1525
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:56.200
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

1526
00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.033
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1527
00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:57.913
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1528
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 1>said the stuff that I've seen and read two things.</v>

1529
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:02.020
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1530
00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:02.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1531
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.460
<v Speaker 1>the idea that they're all the same,</v>

1532
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.500
<v Speaker 1>like there's levels of,</v>

1533
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.610
<v Speaker 1>of everything you know,</v>

1534
00:43:07.611 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 1>and there's certain people that want to be transgender and they still want to</v>

1535
00:43:10.641 --> 00:43:11.260
<v Speaker 1>keep the,</v>

1536
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:11.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1537
00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:12.573
<v Speaker 1>which is fine too.</v>

1538
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some people that have mental illness and there's some people</v>

1539
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 1>that really do feel like they were born in the wrong body.</v>

1540
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:19.311
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

1541
00:43:19.311 --> 00:43:20.230
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that.</v>

1542
00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Why would I?</v>

1543
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.850
<v Speaker 1>I think because I think it's like a misfire though,</v>

1544
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.630
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I think is very rare that you can cure something mental with</v>

1545
00:43:26.631 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

1546
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.610
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that there's something that doesn't feel right to you,</v>

1547
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 1>which I guess is a mental thing or the,</v>

1548
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1549
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.850
<v Speaker 1>how you view yourself and you could fix that with surgery.</v>

1550
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:39.860
<v Speaker 1>That gets real strange.</v>

1551
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:41.240
<v Speaker 1>That gets real strange.</v>

1552
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Like as far as like just accepting who you are and what you are and what,</v>

1553
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.120
<v Speaker 1>what nature is a term.</v>

1554
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I would never want to be the person to tell someone what to do.</v>

1555
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.731
<v Speaker 1>Like you and I,</v>

1556
00:43:50.731 --> 00:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>we both covered in tattoos.</v>

1557
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:52.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1558
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.490
<v Speaker 1>If someone came along and tell us we couldn't do it.</v>

1559
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I love tattoos.</v>

1560
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I think they look bad ass now,</v>

1561
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

1562
00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1563
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I heard I heard,</v>

1564
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I don't give a fuck man,</v>

1565
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you want to do.</v>

1566
00:44:03.411 --> 00:44:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any problem with it but I don't know what.</v>

1567
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're feeling.</v>

1568
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:13.930
<v Speaker 1>So for me to even comment on it in any way is kinda kind of ridiculous for me to</v>

1569
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 1>assume like I know what's going on,</v>

1570
00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:15.951
<v Speaker 1>whether you're,</v>

1571
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I know you're crazy or whether I know that you were actually really born a woman</v>

1572
00:44:19.611 --> 00:44:20.510
<v Speaker 1>or whether you know,</v>

1573
00:44:20.511 --> 00:44:21.344
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank,</v>

1574
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.050
<v Speaker 1>a variety of reasons to decide you're in the wrong gender.</v>

1575
00:44:24.051 --> 00:44:25.010
<v Speaker 1>You get might get bored.</v>

1576
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.023
<v Speaker 1>Being a dude,</v>

1577
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:29.330
<v Speaker 1>you might have a bunch of women around you that you like more than you like men</v>

1578
00:44:29.331 --> 00:44:30.320
<v Speaker 1>and you wish you were one of them.</v>

1579
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I know a dude who</v>

1580
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.850
<v Speaker 3>for the longest time was telling my wife he's gay.</v>

1581
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:34.051
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1582
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:34.521
<v Speaker 3>he's okay.</v>

1583
00:44:34.521 --> 00:44:34.891
<v Speaker 3>He's okay.</v>

1584
00:44:34.891 --> 00:44:35.281
<v Speaker 3>He's okay.</v>

1585
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:35.641
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1586
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:36.031
<v Speaker 3>He comes out.</v>

1587
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:36.870
<v Speaker 3>He's like 46.</v>

1588
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 3>This poor bastard like wasted his whole fucking life pretending that he wasn't</v>

1589
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:41.250
<v Speaker 3>gay and like,</v>

1590
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.091
<v Speaker 3>this dude is gay.</v>

1591
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:42.924
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you he's gay.</v>

1592
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.400
<v Speaker 3>But he was always around these women.</v>

1593
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:47.670
<v Speaker 3>He would hang around them and talk with them and be one of them.</v>

1594
00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like you were,</v>

1595
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 3>there was the energy in the room.</v>

1596
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Like there's an energy in the room if there's a dude and like maybe his</v>

1597
00:44:53.281 --> 00:44:54.570
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend or a bunch of their friends,</v>

1598
00:44:54.571 --> 00:44:55.231
<v Speaker 3>there's an energy like,</v>

1599
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 3>well there's guys here and he's not going to talk like us,</v>

1600
00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.940
<v Speaker 3>but this dude was in the mix.</v>

1601
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.010
<v Speaker 3>He was in the mix with them about everything.</v>

1602
00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the new bag,</v>

1603
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Speaker 3>like you would do that hand stuff that girls do you know,</v>

1604
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:06.200
<v Speaker 3>he would.</v>

1605
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.680
<v Speaker 3>He would move like them man.</v>

1606
00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:10.350
<v Speaker 3>And if you had gotten a hold of that dude and talked him into it,</v>

1607
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.090
<v Speaker 3>he probably would have become a woman.</v>

1608
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1609
00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>

1610
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I think he could have been hypnotized him made him become a woman,</v>

1611
00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 3>but gay man.</v>

1612
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:19.440
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1613
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.400
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird one.</v>

1614
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 3>I think first of all,</v>

1615
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.920
<v Speaker 3>definitely born that way.</v>

1616
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

1617
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.030
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1618
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think it's like A.</v>

1619
00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a bad thing.</v>

1620
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:28.140
<v Speaker 3>They seem to be enjoying it.</v>

1621
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.560
<v Speaker 3>I think the only way it would be bad is if there wasn't enough people to</v>

1622
00:45:31.561 --> 00:45:32.394
<v Speaker 3>reproduce.</v>

1623
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just a deviation.</v>

1624
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:34.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a deviation.</v>

1625
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Like some people are tall,</v>

1626
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:37.660
<v Speaker 3>but the exact thing is Dva,</v>

1627
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.070
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it's A.</v>

1628
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:40.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a negative,</v>

1629
00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:41.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1630
00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't seem to be negative.</v>

1631
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that would be negative is that they don't have a.</v>

1632
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:45.931
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

1633
00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:46.251
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

1634
00:45:46.251 --> 00:45:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1635
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.000
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1636
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.850
<v Speaker 5>there's this transgender Webcam room that on chatter bait where you can look at</v>

1637
00:45:51.851 --> 00:45:54.500
<v Speaker 5>transgenders doing webcam stuff.</v>

1638
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.620
<v Speaker 5>You just stumbled upon this and I know.</v>

1639
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:56.980
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1640
00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.570
<v Speaker 5>I was with this girl that she's like,</v>

1641
00:45:58.571 --> 00:45:59.590
<v Speaker 5>you gotta check this out.</v>

1642
00:45:59.591 --> 00:45:59.981
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

1643
00:45:59.981 --> 00:46:00.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to look at this.</v>

1644
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:01.121
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

1645
00:46:01.121 --> 00:46:03.010
<v Speaker 5>I want to see a good fake vagina.</v>

1646
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.770
<v Speaker 5>And there was this one guy that was looked like on the top look,</v>

1647
00:46:05.771 --> 00:46:06.604
<v Speaker 5>just like Thompson girl,</v>

1648
00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:11.610
<v Speaker 5>like a normal guy and on the bottom he had a really well done vagina and it was</v>

1649
00:46:11.681 --> 00:46:12.130
<v Speaker 5>deep.</v>

1650
00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:12.610
<v Speaker 5>It was deep.</v>

1651
00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:17.610
<v Speaker 5>She was jealous because he had like this humongous vibrator in him and I didn't</v>

1652
00:46:18.011 --> 00:46:18.480
<v Speaker 5>know some.</v>

1653
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.360
<v Speaker 5>You are haunting.</v>

1654
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.850
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know it was deep though.</v>

1655
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:23.160
<v Speaker 5>That's such a weird throughout.</v>

1656
00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:28.350
<v Speaker 5>I've a world right now with that image of the girl with a giant deep push.</v>

1657
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:32.323
<v Speaker 5>Robert Dawn,</v>

1658
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.740
<v Speaker 5>I thought that like the fake vagina.</v>

1659
00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.430
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a deep thing I thought was just like kind of like outer,</v>

1660
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1661
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.620
<v Speaker 5>you just split a Dick Open.</v>

1662
00:46:38.621 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 5>I always assume it was as deep as long as your dick was almost like it was as</v>

1663
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:45.470
<v Speaker 5>simple as just pushing the dickhead like all the way back.</v>

1664
00:46:45.471 --> 00:46:47.530
<v Speaker 5>And they do like real surgery now.</v>

1665
00:46:47.531 --> 00:46:48.131
<v Speaker 5>If I remember,</v>

1666
00:46:48.131 --> 00:46:50.890
<v Speaker 5>I think they can actually construct a tube in there.</v>

1667
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's advanced,</v>

1668
00:46:52.571 --> 00:46:53.081
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1669
00:46:53.081 --> 00:46:53.840
<v Speaker 5>I've interviewed,</v>

1670
00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.570
<v Speaker 5>he was creamy,</v>

1671
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:55.740
<v Speaker 5>he was creamy like.</v>

1672
00:46:55.741 --> 00:46:59.030
<v Speaker 5>So what's that cream is that code has to be like some lube that.</v>

1673
00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.173
<v Speaker 5>I mean it has to.</v>

1674
00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.920
<v Speaker 5>How much did you watch spirit?</v>

1675
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.950
<v Speaker 5>Do you know that movie x mocking other words?</v>

1676
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.030
<v Speaker 5>They weren't really robots,</v>

1677
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:08.873
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1678
00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:09.680
<v Speaker 5>There's always.</v>

1679
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.630
<v Speaker 5>I've seen fake</v>

1680
00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.990
<v Speaker 3>ges before for sure.</v>

1681
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.040
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some fake dongs torn.</v>

1682
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:14.870
<v Speaker 3>This is one guy.</v>

1683
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>

1684
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.400
<v Speaker 3>every porn he does,</v>

1685
00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:19.340
<v Speaker 3>he keeps his pants on and his fake Dong just comes through the hole.</v>

1686
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.610
<v Speaker 3>They make them like ridiculously strap.</v>

1687
00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.210
<v Speaker 3>It was a fake.</v>

1688
00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:23.661
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1689
00:47:23.661 --> 00:47:25.160
<v Speaker 3>who wants to see this grove?</v>

1690
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Fucking this guy who's a liar.</v>

1691
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.930
<v Speaker 3>I've got a big rubber fake.</v>

1692
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1693
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:31.920
<v Speaker 1>interviewed twice now the uh,</v>

1694
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:37.560
<v Speaker 1>the transgender chick that dated Michael Phelps was born like both sexes.</v>

1695
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1696
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.370
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1697
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:39.761
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1698
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:40.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1699
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:40.900
<v Speaker 1>and became a woman.</v>

1700
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 1>She had a lot of surgery but uh,</v>

1701
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:45.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's not transgendered than just,</v>

1702
00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:46.923
<v Speaker 1>she just,</v>

1703
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:51.520
<v Speaker 1>she just did a porno porno and she told me to look at the trailer.</v>

1704
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I watched the trailer and it's,</v>

1705
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1706
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.360
<v Speaker 1>it's odd looking over jumping.</v>

1707
00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 1>She has a girl's body,</v>

1708
00:47:57.551 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 1>but it is this available online vagina.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pull it up Jimmy.</v>

1712
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:05.030
<v Speaker 1>As long as it doesn't get on the USTREAM,</v>

1713
00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.900
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to get in trouble and it's called going for the gold.</v>

1714
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.823
<v Speaker 1>But if she.</v>

1715
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Well let me ask you this because it's so important.</v>

1716
00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:12.693
<v Speaker 1>If she,</v>

1717
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.160
<v Speaker 1>if she was born with both with.</v>

1718
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:15.701
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1719
00:48:15.701 --> 00:48:16.534
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you,</v>

1720
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 1>if you were born with both,</v>

1721
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:18.550
<v Speaker 1>would you make a decision?</v>

1722
00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:20.560
<v Speaker 1>I think in this day and age you,</v>

1723
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you'd better,</v>

1724
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you'd be better off being that one dude that can do it all.</v>

1725
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean good light.</v>

1726
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1727
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:29.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1728
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:30.221
<v Speaker 1>unless you're home with him,</v>

1729
00:48:30.221 --> 00:48:30.941
<v Speaker 1>he bit decision.</v>

1730
00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I think crazy young,</v>

1731
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a baby parents.</v>

1732
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:36.993
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes</v>

1733
00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:40.880
<v Speaker 1>parents will your Dick awakened gas pump into your</v>

1734
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:49.390
<v Speaker 1>parents would have way too much power to decide which direction a kid would go.</v>

1735
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.350
<v Speaker 1>In that sense.</v>

1736
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:52.720
<v Speaker 1>People argue that the same thing with circumcision.</v>

1737
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1738
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.000
<v Speaker 1>circumcision circumcise and their dick got cut off so they transitioned them to</v>

1739
00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:58.834
<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Like if you didn't enjoy that vagina,</v>

1769
00:49:38.231 --> 00:49:39.100
<v Speaker 1>you're just picky.</v>

1770
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.343
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>

1771
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was their hermaphrodite.</v>

1772
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:43.663
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1773
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.120
<v Speaker 1>well we just saw jerk off on a former male,</v>

1774
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 1>a former male to male female trans.</v>

1775
00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:52.780
<v Speaker 1>The box there,</v>

1776
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.753
<v Speaker 1>they showed it.</v>

1777
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it close up.</v>

1778
00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.570
<v Speaker 1>It looks like that.</v>

1779
00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:00.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like a box with balls.</v>

1780
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:04.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a large stitches area.</v>

1781
00:50:04.721 --> 00:50:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Above the box.</v>

1782
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Whole area lifts or a far left disturbing.</v>

1783
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>It looks like there's balls inside the lips,</v>

1784
00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

1785
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.030
<v Speaker 1>like if you're trapped on a desert island and you get,</v>

1786
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.090
<v Speaker 1>you get mad at this,</v>

1787
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:17.000
<v Speaker 1>you're a picky fuck.</v>

1788
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.290
<v Speaker 1>I trapped in a hotel lobby to give it.</v>

1789
00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a whirl.</v>

1790
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Being we're,</v>

1791
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:25.480
<v Speaker 1>we're all,</v>

1792
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1793
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>we're living in a weird world where there's</v>

1794
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 3>gonna come a time I think if not in our lives and our grandchildren's lives for</v>

1795
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:33.800
<v Speaker 3>sure where they're gonna be able to change your sex.</v>

1796
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Like you're going to be able to simply,</v>

1797
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:35.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1798
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:37.880
<v Speaker 3>they're just going to give you some sort of a genetic alteration.</v>

1799
00:50:37.881 --> 00:50:38.714
<v Speaker 3>You'll be a woman.</v>

1800
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:41.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's going to be outside the realm of possibility within the</v>

1801
00:50:41.901 --> 00:50:42.681
<v Speaker 3>next hundred 50,</v>

1802
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:43.514
<v Speaker 3>200 years.</v>

1803
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.750
<v Speaker 3>They're just so they're so close to fixing so many different things about people</v>

1804
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 3>and then once they fix everything,</v>

1805
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're never gonna fix everything.</v>

1806
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 3>We're always going to have some diseases and colds and flus and shit,</v>

1807
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:56.930
<v Speaker 3>but I think they're going to be able to do some pretty incredible shit to your</v>

1808
00:50:56.931 --> 00:50:59.240
<v Speaker 3>body and then they going to get to a point where people start going,</v>

1809
00:50:59.241 --> 00:51:00.074
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1810
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 3>there's a clinic in Thailand and all you have to do is pay them $50,000 and you</v>

1811
00:51:05.211 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1812
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:06.470
<v Speaker 3>you can become a woman,</v>

1813
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.830
<v Speaker 3>like a real woman and you can turn back if you don't like it.</v>

1814
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:12.380
<v Speaker 3>And they'll show clients that every six years they go back.</v>

1815
00:51:12.381 --> 00:51:12.651
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1816
00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:14.250
<v Speaker 3>I was a man for five years.</v>

1817
00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

1818
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed a lot of lovely things that when I was a girl that you appreciate it</v>

1819
00:51:18.931 --> 00:51:20.760
<v Speaker 3>more and then it's balanced.</v>

1820
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:24.830
<v Speaker 3>My perspective being a man for 30 years and a woman for five than a mannequin,</v>

1821
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 3>I just kind of get it.</v>

1822
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.630
<v Speaker 3>For years I just took off left and right.</v>

1823
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.301
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not.</v>

1824
00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Maybe just if you could yoga,</v>

1825
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:32.870
<v Speaker 3>just live as a girl.</v>

1826
00:51:32.871 --> 00:51:33.190
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1827
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Just do girl shit.</v>

1828
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:34.491
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

1829
00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:35.780
<v Speaker 3>the other thing you're going to have to deal with,</v>

1830
00:51:35.781 --> 00:51:37.370
<v Speaker 3>it's like you see the perfect gal.</v>

1831
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.631
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1832
00:51:37.631 --> 00:51:38.030
<v Speaker 3>you see the fruit,</v>

1833
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:42.770
<v Speaker 3>perfect Gal walking down the street like just big ass and thin waist big Jesus</v>

1834
00:51:42.771 --> 00:51:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Christ.</v>

1835
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Your jeans just call out,</v>

1836
00:51:44.841 --> 00:51:45.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1837
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Like your DNA just goes,</v>

1838
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:47.870
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

1839
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:48.660
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>

1840
00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.030
<v Speaker 3>if a group of guys were like this,</v>

1841
00:51:50.031 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 3>we're not rude,</v>

1842
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1843
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 3>We're not rude people.</v>

1844
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.530
<v Speaker 3>But if we saw some gal and she was outside of Ir Range,</v>

1845
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:55.670
<v Speaker 3>like she was walking down the street,</v>

1846
00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:56.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1847
00:51:56.281 --> 00:51:57.021
<v Speaker 3>you would probably be like,</v>

1848
00:51:57.021 --> 00:51:57.291
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1914
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Well the problem with that is did she always looked like that?</v>

1915
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 1>And if she didn't always look like that,</v>

1916
00:53:57.091 --> 00:53:57.930
<v Speaker 1>how's her house that big?</v>

00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:07.950
<v Speaker 1>So I guess kind of wig.</v>

1923
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:09.211
<v Speaker 1>When I saw it last time,</v>

1924
00:54:09.211 --> 00:54:10.260
<v Speaker 1>she literally looks like a,</v>

1925
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.520
<v Speaker 1>like a battle droid,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just like some kind of like what?</v>

1927
00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Just like tank bottoms,</v>

1928
00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:18.414
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1929
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're in like the nineties.</v>

1930
00:54:20.701 --> 00:54:22.020
<v Speaker 1>We never thought that was hot.</v>

1931
00:54:22.021 --> 00:54:24.160
<v Speaker 1>We were like looking at girls fucking fat ass dude.</v>

1932
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to bring that.</v>

1933
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Not that it was a fast but it wasn't something that everybody aspires to.</v>

1934
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Like I was driving down the street the other day and there was like some ad</v>

1935
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.040
<v Speaker 1>about building a better,</v>

1936
00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:36.060
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1937
00:54:36.061 --> 00:54:40.170
<v Speaker 1>like they're having classes at the gym just to build better butts.</v>

1938
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a two and we're for real.</v>

1939
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It's built by solid but with out here and then you see all these girls squatting</v>

1940
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:46.140
<v Speaker 1>and the back and like,</v>

1941
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:47.130
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1942
00:54:47.131 --> 00:54:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened?</v>

1943
00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:48.923
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1944
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a major shift.</v>

1945
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:55.760
<v Speaker 1>You know what it was black male culture kinda dictated a the fashion and style</v>

1946
00:54:56.461 --> 00:54:58.950
<v Speaker 1>and stuff for white dudes for a long time.</v>

1947
00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Kind of taking over the style of that.</v>

1948
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And now like finally,</v>

1949
00:55:01.651 --> 00:55:05.070
<v Speaker 1>like the black women are now kind of setting the tone for like the body shape.</v>

1950
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the depression.</v>

1951
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I think people were so poor and starving.</v>

1952
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.290
<v Speaker 1>They forgot they liked big assets and then it took a while before they woke up</v>

1953
00:55:13.291 --> 00:55:16.470
<v Speaker 1>and then got through the fifties and sixties and seventies and eighties.</v>

1954
00:55:16.471 --> 00:55:17.790
<v Speaker 1>And then sir mix a lot.</v>

1955
00:55:17.791 --> 00:55:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Came along and he had that one song and everybody was like,</v>

1956
00:55:20.491 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1957
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.133
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1958
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.120
<v Speaker 1>why don't,</v>

1959
00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 1>why is it so great to me?</v>

1960
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:25.020
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

1961
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:25.853
<v Speaker 1>you too,</v>

1962
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:27.301
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1963
00:55:27.301 --> 00:55:28.530
<v Speaker 1>How can we be ignoring this?</v>

1964
00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost like somewhere in there there's a good research and now it's</v>

1965
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:33.774
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

1976
00:55:50.221 --> 00:55:51.090

<v Speaker 1>maybe she'll go back with me.</v>

1984
00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:02.970
<v Speaker 1>It really sucks too when you get close to a girl and then you notice like the</v>

<v Speaker 1>the hump.</v>

2008
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:41.400

<v Speaker 1>what bummed me out when girls all started shaving their heads bald was some girl</v>

<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

2020
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.960
<v Speaker 1>And then she pulled her pants down,</v>

2021
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:54.550
<v Speaker 1>click the top of her class.</v>

2022
00:56:54.551 --> 00:56:55.900
<v Speaker 1>If you call it pussy slit I guess.</v>

2023
00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:57.563
<v Speaker 1>And Gosh,</v>

2024
00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 1>what a good kid.</v>

2025
00:56:58.300 --> 00:56:59.350
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing though,</v>

2026
00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:03.940
<v Speaker 1>how not exciting it was to see that if there was pussy here,</v>

2027
00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:04.390
<v Speaker 1>there you'd be like,</v>

2028
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2029
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not supposed to see that.</v>

2030
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:06.800
<v Speaker 1>But when there's nothing there,</v>

2031
00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:07.630
<v Speaker 1>know what I mean?</v>

2032
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:09.010
<v Speaker 1>It takes away like a.</v>

2033
00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.520
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's maybe you know,</v>

2034
00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm 37 is when I was a kid,</v>

2035
00:57:12.461 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 1>like all porn.</v>

2036
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Everything was like pussy hair and if you,</v>

2037
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:15.900
<v Speaker 1>if you were.</v>

2038
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.520
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's what I'm just drawn to in that way,</v>

2039
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 1>but I find it very like,</v>

2040
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:20.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2041

<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2042
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 1>it really takes away.</v>

2043
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:22.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2044
00:57:22.391 --> 00:57:25.930
<v Speaker 1>when a girl wears those bikinis where it just comes like right above where their</v>

2045
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:26.621
<v Speaker 1>pussy starts,</v>

2046
00:57:26.621 --> 00:57:28.480
<v Speaker 1>like you don't feel like you're seeing anything that weird.</v>

2047
00:57:28.481 --> 00:57:28.750
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

2048
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but if you saw a girl laying down and some pubes are coming out the side of her</v>

2049
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.591
<v Speaker 1>bathing suit,</v>

2050
00:57:35.591 --> 00:57:36.400
<v Speaker 1>that's actually,</v>

2051
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.160
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're seeing more than if you saw all the top of her posts it</v>

2052
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:40.990
<v Speaker 1>album.</v>

2080
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why they were so much more advanced than us with their art.</v>

2081
00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:31.980
<v Speaker 1>That's why the Beatles and shit came from.</v>

2096
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.470
<v Speaker 1>It was toilet paper.</v>

2097
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes some of it stuck around</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's not like trying to figure out solar power,</v>

2111
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:31.030
<v Speaker 1>nose hair trimmers on your eyes.</v>

2124
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:55.060
<v Speaker 1>but your asshole will grow that hair back like wild Bush.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what's the best man?</v>

2139
01:00:37.011 --> 01:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>One Wipe Charlie's.</v>

01:00:45.921 --> 01:00:47.060
<v Speaker 1>but they don't smell like flowers.</v>

2148
01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you just got ass fucked by a flower forest.</v>

2149
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.900

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of does it shoot like high pressure water.</v>

2167
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:19.370
<v Speaker 1>If you're a gal who cleans your vagina,</v>

2175
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I just sat there for a half hour with the one shooting in my asshole because it</v>

2176
01:01:33.681 --> 01:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>just felt so good because it hit like the back wall butthole that long.</v>

2177
01:01:38.001 --> 01:01:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to do it to feel like I was like getting.</v>

2178
01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm still going to have to do paper afterwards.</v>

2179
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2180
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:44.303
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was so clean.</v>

2183
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It was like taking a shower for your butthole.</v>

2184
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:50.743
<v Speaker 1>Pretty meticulous.</v>

2185
01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not doing as good a job.</v>

2186
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:53.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

2187
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>You just smearing.</v>

01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>you just smearing over your hair.</v>

2190
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.701
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2191
01:01:58.701 --> 01:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if I took some shit and I just rubbed into the top of your head.</v>

2192
01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:02.690
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2194
01:02:03.141 --> 01:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I got a baby wipe,</v>

2195
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>but if I had never accept that,</v>

2196
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>if I get in the shower and you would clean your asshole here,</v>

2197
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.770
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

2198
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:14.083

2199
01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>You told me I had 70 baby wipes and a roll of toilet paper.</v>

2200
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd take a shower.</v>

2201
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.773
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

2202

<v Speaker 1>this fork and shit all day too.</v>

2203
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:27.931
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

2204
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I rubbed it with 70 baby wipes.</v>

2205
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's not enough.</v>

2208
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:33.870
<v Speaker 1>You've got to watch this fucking thing.</v>

2209
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get it in the washing machine.</v>

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>just trying to get my method approved.</v>

2214
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>It's still shit.</v>

2215
01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>You'd pick shower after the shower,</v>

2216

<v Speaker 1>I don't go out for the day though until I shower after I stand up or to wipe or</v>

2220
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:57.324

2224
01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:01.351
<v Speaker 1>Sitting down.</v>

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:04.580

<v Speaker 1>I wanted you to do a second minute.</v>

2231
01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:06.961
<v Speaker 1>I stand up.</v>

2232
01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Find a target.</v>

2233
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.461
<v Speaker 1>Not going to stand up.</v>

2234
01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:09.294
<v Speaker 1>Stand up.</v>

2235
01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Stand up.</v>

2236
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I know there's people.</v>

2237
01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Most people sit in</v>

2238
01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:14.880
<v Speaker 1>their sleeves.</v>

2239
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Smeller watch.</v>

2240
01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:17.893
<v Speaker 1>Guaranteed</v>

2241
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.353
<v Speaker 1>is that.</v>

2242
01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:23.281
<v Speaker 1>One of my buddies told me,</v>

2243
01:03:23.281 --> 01:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>he goes from the front,</v>

2244
01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>reaching between his</v>

2245
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:27.541
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>

2246
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:28.374
<v Speaker 1>his balls.</v>

2247
01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.233
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

2248
01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.673
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

2249
01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:31.513
<v Speaker 1>He's going to have.</v>

2250
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.053
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2251
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.380
<v Speaker 1>It is a very specific protocol.</v>

2252
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I imagine when people smelled like when they hadn't figured out wiping and then</v>

2253
01:03:39.871 --> 01:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>someone finally figured out how to just kind of clean the area off a little bit</v>

2254
01:03:43.321 --> 01:03:43.950
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>

2255
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2257
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just be covered with shit all the time.</v>

2258
01:03:47.881 --> 01:03:50.880
<v Speaker 1>When they used to do this poll on when it had red band.com,</v>

2259
01:03:50.881 --> 01:03:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I did this point and I did.</v>

2260
01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:52.861
<v Speaker 1>Who stands up?</v>

2261
01:03:52.861 --> 01:03:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Who sits down and it was almost 50 slash 50,</v>

2262
01:03:55.261 --> 01:03:57.810
<v Speaker 1>don't have red band dot Com forwards now.</v>

2263
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:58.723

2266
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like the dress,</v>

2267
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>the stupid dress take into accounts.</v>

2268
01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Fifty percent of the people that were going to your website.</v>

2269
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a small savages is weird.</v>

2270
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:15.421

01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:17.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to do a good job already.</v>

2330
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Aggressive driveway.</v>

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean I couldn't picture what else would make that happen.</v>

2332
01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 1>We were all asked doctors.</v>

2333
01:05:57.881 --> 01:06:01.610

2340
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it looked like.</v>

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Skittle balls.</v>

2348
01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe we were at the comedy and Magic Club and we're like,</v>

2349
01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:31.651
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

2350
01:06:31.651 --> 01:06:32.081
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2355
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2356
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>that was at the comedy magic club</v>

2357
01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:45.280
<v Speaker 1>already do stunts.</v>

2358
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Like a fucking autistic kid shows your button at the end of the,</v>

2359
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.890
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the Juke clam.</v>

2360
01:06:50.891 --> 01:06:52.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like six months later and you go,</v>

2361
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:53.830
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back,</v>

2362
01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.713
<v Speaker 1>or let's see what is,</v>

2363
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.080
<v Speaker 1>but what it looks like now,</v>

2364
01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and we're in the comedy and magic club and then with or no,</v>

2365
01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 1>this was weird.</v>

2366
01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Penny had skittles attached to his boss.</v>

2367
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.360
<v Speaker 1>His boss were really like,</v>

2368
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.761
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

2369
01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:06.550
<v Speaker 1>they looked like they had egg sacks and them or something like tons of little</v>

2370
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.540
<v Speaker 1>malls wrong with them.</v>

2371
01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2372
01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:08.820
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

2373
01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:09.790
<v Speaker 1>it ends with you going,</v>

2374
01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.670
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's wrong with your balls?</v>

2375
01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I blocked that out like a child molestation</v>

2376
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 1>comics that we liked to show each other our Cox and show each other assholes.</v>

2377
01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I've seen when it comes to like my friend's Dicks,</v>

2378
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I've seen so many of my friends,</v>

2379
01:07:28.271 --> 01:07:31.360
<v Speaker 1>dicks like Chili de is used to pull his dick out all the time and it would be</v>

2380
01:07:31.361 --> 01:07:32.070
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

2381
01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2382
01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin's pulled his dick out.</v>

2383
01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen dog Duncan that voice.</v>

2384
01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It's because you want to cross all the lines that you can,</v>

2385
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:43.810
<v Speaker 1>that you can cross bike possibly,</v>

2386
01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:44.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2387
01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you could.</v>

2388
01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I've got some weird ones,</v>

2389
01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:51.250
<v Speaker 1>red balls out for like almost an entire episode of Opie and Anthony.</v>

2390
01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.880
<v Speaker 1>We gave this gal stocker patty.</v>

2391
01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.550
<v Speaker 1>We gave her a fake breast trip,</v>

2392
01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>was just a regular listerine breath strip and we told her that it was a</v>

2393
01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:02.230
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drug and she took it.</v>

2394
01:08:02.231 --> 01:08:05.590
<v Speaker 1>We told that she's tripping their balls off and so she,</v>

2395
01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:09.400
<v Speaker 1>she's there and he pulls the sack out and we pretend like we don't notice it.</v>

2396
01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.151
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

2397
01:08:10.151 --> 01:08:11.140
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2398
01:08:11.141 --> 01:08:12.810
<v Speaker 1>his balls around.</v>

2399
01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:14.920
<v Speaker 1>What are we,</v>

2400
01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

2401
01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Slow for this whole episode.</v>

2402
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 1>We're pretending that red bar and she is talking about how bad she's tripping</v>

2403
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.250
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2404
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2405
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:23.331
<v Speaker 1>she can't believe.</v>

2406
01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Like it was complete power of suggestion and placebo effect.</v>

2407
01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Like she was tripping her balls off.</v>

2408
01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever show your Dick and balls?</v>

2409
01:08:30.021 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Does anyone at the store early,</v>

2410
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:32.263
<v Speaker 1>early days?</v>

2411
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2412
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Lee's another one.</v>

2413
01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many pictures of bobby tucked like a woman every day.</v>

2414
01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>His pants in the bar area of the comedy store.</v>

2415
01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I've only,</v>

2416
01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>I've only met bobby like four or five times and I've seen his dick and I asked a</v>

2417
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:46.581
<v Speaker 1>couple times.</v>

2418
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I think Jamie only shows me as Joe.</v>

2419
01:08:48.751 --> 01:08:51.360
<v Speaker 1>He's just always Kinda Tago not.</v>

2420
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know guys with real big pieces.</v>

2421
01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.450
<v Speaker 1>We'll pull them out pretty quick too.</v>

2422
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:56.990
<v Speaker 1>That's not true because I've never done it.</v>

2423
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I was going with the fact that I've never done it.</v>

2424
01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I definitely can't say I haven't shown someone.</v>

2425
01:09:04.581 --> 01:09:05.200
<v Speaker 1>My Dick.</v>

2426
01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Kevin pulled it out for whatever reason.</v>

2427
01:09:07.190 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I definitely have done it at least once,</v>

2428
01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a mainstay.</v>

2429
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.211
<v Speaker 1>Like for Joey,</v>

2430
01:09:11.211 --> 01:09:12.650
<v Speaker 1>for years it was a mainstay.</v>

2431
01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Joey would have his pants because you know Joe,</v>

2432
01:09:14.891 --> 01:09:16.400
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't really find belts at work.</v>

2433
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't find pants that fit and so he's always an state.</v>

2434
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

2435
01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:22.670
<v Speaker 1>We can just shake and his pants will drop</v>

2436
01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.740
<v Speaker 1>his balls and Dick or just hanging out in front of everybody.</v>

2437
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Joey did that.</v>

2438
01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many times I got a picture of him carrying a waitress on his</v>

2439
01:09:33.321 --> 01:09:37.280
<v Speaker 1>shoulder and his pants are down by his knees and his balls and his dick is</v>

2440
01:09:37.281 --> 01:09:40.490
<v Speaker 1>hanging out and he's in the back parking lot area of the comedy store.</v>

2441
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

2442
01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.390
<v Speaker 1>this was back when Joey had zero career.</v>

2443
01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Joey gave no fucks even when he was starving.</v>

2444
01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:48.471
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2445
01:09:48.471 --> 01:09:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz has been Joey Diaz since the jump,</v>

2446
01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:52.880
<v Speaker 1>like he's always been a madman.</v>

2447
01:09:52.881 --> 01:09:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Like before he was killed on the road and making great money.</v>

2448
01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.470
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give a fuck.</v>

2449
01:09:57.471 --> 01:10:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Even back then it was barely getting by trying to hustle,</v>

2450
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.040
<v Speaker 1>get gigs together,</v>

2451
01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.990
<v Speaker 1>but he is always been like,</v>

2452
01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:07.640
<v Speaker 1>that's like he's the flag bearer for not giving a fuck on the west coast.</v>

2453
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:09.170
<v Speaker 1>You say you don't give a fuck,</v>

2454
01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 1>but you joey Diaz not give a fuck.</v>

2455
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:12.830
<v Speaker 1>That was always the flag bearer.</v>

2456
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.330
<v Speaker 1>He was always the standard,</v>

2457
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:14.961
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2458
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Where the girls don't just show their pussies more often,</v>

2459
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 1>like they don't just get a check up my pussy just like guys did.</v>

2460
01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:21.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of limits it.</v>

2461
01:10:21.930 --> 01:10:25.070
<v Speaker 1>But how far that's come is way different.</v>

2462
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:25.933
<v Speaker 1>Like fast,</v>

2463
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.130
<v Speaker 1>average girls will pull them pussies out.</v>

2464
01:10:28.131 --> 01:10:29.090
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty crazy.</v>

2465
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2466
01:10:29.421 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of competition now too with all this tinder and all these</v>

2467
01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:35.450
<v Speaker 1>different match.com and all these different dating sites and shit.</v>

2468
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.400
<v Speaker 1>People are just getting laid left and right.</v>

2469
01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Like you get left out in the cold if you try to hold back.</v>

2470
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2471
01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.270

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:42.340
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

2473
01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:45.160
<v Speaker 1>The website's about Madison.</v>

2474
01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2475
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:45.930

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2477
01:10:46.381 --> 01:10:49.180
<v Speaker 1>There's websites where it's like two people to cheat to fuck you and imagined</v>

2478
01:10:49.181 --> 01:10:54.181
<v Speaker 1>dating a girl that her job was like a secretary to work for Ashley Madison.</v>

2479
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.293
<v Speaker 1>Never trusted her.</v>

2480
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I trusted nobody.</v>

2481
01:10:59.061 --> 01:11:00.230
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't trust her.</v>

2482
01:11:00.231 --> 01:11:02.100
<v Speaker 1>No one would trust things are great.</v>

2483
01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.010
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

2484
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2485
01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:04.960
<v Speaker 1>what a great idea.</v>

2486
01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Make a website that helps people cheat and what so smaller than their</v>

2487
01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:09.351
<v Speaker 1>commercials too.</v>

2488
01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:13.130
<v Speaker 1>They have it be a girl getting caught by her husband using Ashley</v>

2489
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.813
<v Speaker 3>and then he goes,</v>

01:11:15.691 --> 01:11:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be celibate anymore.</v>

2493
01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:17.540
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

2494
01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>

2495
01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:19.560

<v Speaker 3>Like you know exactly what you should.</v>

2501
01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:25.410

<v Speaker 3>cops show up.</v>

2505
01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 3>No one wants to go in the house.</v>

2506
01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:30.451

<v Speaker 3>start fires before they figured out lighters.</v>

2557
01:12:50.881 --> 01:12:51.471
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely right.</v>

2558
01:12:51.471 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't so good sitting there with some fucking moss and a stick.</v>

2559
01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:57.150
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely right.</v>

2560
01:12:57.151 --> 01:13:01.020
<v Speaker 3>I guess calc without helps for sure.</v>

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:13:01.281 --> 01:13:01.640
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2563
01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.630
<v Speaker 3>That's if he tried to get her to post strippers,</v>

2564
01:13:03.631 --> 01:13:04.441
<v Speaker 3>they're already cooked up.</v>

2565
01:13:04.441 --> 01:13:05.340
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to worry about it.</v>

2566
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:06.090
<v Speaker 3>Look at you.</v>

2567
01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:06.811
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking ahead.</v>

2568
01:13:06.811 --> 01:13:07.644
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2569
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:08.880

2570
01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.470

2572
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.830
<v Speaker 3>don't you feel like going with the Strip club once it was her first time and she</v>

2573
01:13:13.831 --> 01:13:14.581
<v Speaker 3>did pull a stripper.</v>

2574
01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:15.414
<v Speaker 3>She was great.</v>

2575
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Some guys feel,</v>

2576
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.000
<v Speaker 3>at least that are comics that like the lifestyle,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You go down the road,</v>

2592
01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:44.880
<v Speaker 3>hanging out and going from airport to rental,</v>

2594
01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.820
<v Speaker 3>all the cracking jokes like this.</v>

2595
01:13:47.821 --> 01:13:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Very few people that can relate to that kind of DEBACA.</v>

2596
01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 3>Most people are so tied down to some crazy nine to five corporate life,</v>

2597
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 3>job life,</v>

2598
01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:57.240
<v Speaker 3>business life.</v>

2599
01:13:57.241 --> 01:13:57.361
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2600
01:13:57.361 --> 01:14:00.720
<v Speaker 3>you've got to fucking pretend to be somebody for eight hours a day,</v>

2601
01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:01.531
<v Speaker 3>can't be loose.</v>

2602
01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:06.060
<v Speaker 3>He can't be free and everybody's trying to conform to that in there after work</v>

2603
01:14:06.061 --> 01:14:06.830
<v Speaker 3>life too.</v>

2604
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:11.830
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like this weird fucking father knows best type clone figure</v>

2605
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:13.111
<v Speaker 4>of what a,</v>

2606
01:14:13.111 --> 01:14:15.280
<v Speaker 4>an adult and a family is.</v>

2607
01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.890
<v Speaker 4>And comics were out there living in this weird,</v>

2608
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.450
<v Speaker 4>chaotic life.</v>

2609
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:19.950
<v Speaker 4>But I've,</v>

2610
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:20.190
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2611
01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.880
<v Speaker 4>I've actually very young,</v>

2612
01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:24.820
<v Speaker 4>had the really balanced both those worlds and I did,</v>

2613
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2614
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.170
<v Speaker 4>it was not the right thing to do.</v>

2615
01:14:26.171 --> 01:14:27.010
<v Speaker 4>I guess in many ways,</v>

2616
01:14:27.011 --> 01:14:27.880
<v Speaker 4>and it was done poorly,</v>

2617
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:30.460
<v Speaker 4>but when I got right to the point in comedy,</v>

2618
01:14:30.461 --> 01:14:31.540
<v Speaker 4>it was about like 23.</v>

2619
01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:32.560
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing it for like three,</v>

2620
01:14:32.561 --> 01:14:36.450
<v Speaker 4>four years and I was in a world where now I was like going on the road and like</v>

2621
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 4>if I was opening for a towel or patrice and getting pussy and stuff like that</v>

2622
01:14:40.001 --> 01:14:41.070
<v Speaker 4>and kind of living that lifestyle.</v>

2623
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.500
<v Speaker 4>I also was married with a baby doll,</v>

2624
01:14:44.501 --> 01:14:44.861
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2625
01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:47.170
<v Speaker 4>Like my daughter is 12 now I'm 30,</v>

2626
01:14:47.171 --> 01:14:47.710
<v Speaker 4>so you know what I mean?</v>

2628
01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.560
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

2629
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:51.760
<v Speaker 4>it is weird.</v>

2630
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.530
<v Speaker 4>I did it to do both those worlds.</v>

2631
01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:53.790
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2632
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:56.220

2639
01:15:04.031 --> 01:15:09.030
<v Speaker 4>Like just like it was very weird to straddle those worlds because you also try</v>

2640
01:15:09.031 --> 01:15:13.960
<v Speaker 4>to instill morals and class and to somebody while you're just like anything.</v>

2641
01:15:13.961 --> 01:15:14.351

<v Speaker 3>They don't have the time.</v>

2662
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:54.060
<v Speaker 3>Most people going from college,</v>

2663
01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.880
<v Speaker 3>whatever sexy you can get in college and then you know,</v>

2664
01:15:56.881 --> 01:15:58.770
<v Speaker 3>you're working all the time trying to get your degree.</v>

2665
01:15:58.771 --> 01:15:59.401
<v Speaker 3>Then you get a degree,</v>

2666
01:15:59.401 --> 01:16:00.061

<v Speaker 3>Like where's the time for threesomes?</v>

2671
01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:05.430

<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

2674
01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:10.710
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was gonna say is I like a lot of comics relate to strippers</v>

2675
01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:15.210
<v Speaker 3>because strippers are also live in this crazy sort of de Bockarie filled life as</v>

2676
01:16:15.211 --> 01:16:15.780
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2677
01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:15.991
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2678
01:16:15.991 --> 01:16:17.910
<v Speaker 3>they're making way more money than the average girl.</v>

2679
01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:19.170
<v Speaker 3>They're dancing on Paul's there,</v>

2680
01:16:19.171 --> 01:16:20.390
<v Speaker 3>partying with friends there.</v>

2681
01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.460
<v Speaker 3>They're totally irresponsible and they're fun to hang around with because they</v>

2682
01:16:23.461 --> 01:16:27.480
<v Speaker 3>don't judge you for being a fuck up as much as say a gal who's a lawyer,</v>

2683
01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:27.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2684
01:16:27.901 --> 01:16:30.200
<v Speaker 3>when you're a loser comic and you're,</v>

2685
01:16:30.201 --> 01:16:32.410
<v Speaker 3>you're dating a girl who is a lawyer as well.</v>

2686
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.690
<v Speaker 3>My daughter's mother's a lawyer.</v>

2687
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.820
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

2688
01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:36.540
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty funny.</v>

2689
01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So she went to school.</v>

2691
01:16:38.371 --> 01:16:39.300
<v Speaker 3>She did the whole thing.</v>

2692
01:16:39.301 --> 01:16:40.260
<v Speaker 3>She did the hard work.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2700
01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:51.630
<v Speaker 4>and I tried in years past to Kinda like,</v>

2701

<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2706
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:59.520
<v Speaker 4>And she would.</v>

2707
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:03.510
<v Speaker 4>But I felt like I was corrupting a square to kind of wanting to be.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2709
01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:05.160
<v Speaker 4>That she's a square.</v>

2710
01:17:05.161 --> 01:17:06.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to present like that,</v>

2711
01:17:06.241 --> 01:17:07.650
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like I felt like I was like,</v>

2712
01:17:07.651 --> 01:17:08.070
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>

2713
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't be involved in kind of creepy shit</v>

2714
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.110
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't for me.</v>

2715
01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.870
<v Speaker 3>This isn't where you want to.</v>

2716
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I this.</v>

2717
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.010
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with the term square,</v>

2718
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:18.140
<v Speaker 3>but I agree with you.</v>

2719
01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:19.760
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with being a square to.</v>

2720
01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2721
01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2722
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:21.500
<v Speaker 3>Like if that's what you're into.</v>

2723
01:17:21.501 --> 01:17:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of people that just feel like going home,</v>

2724
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.010
<v Speaker 3>having tea and reading a book like that is a nice night for them.</v>

2725
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:29.083
<v Speaker 3>They could.</v>

2726
01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:30.030
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

2727
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:31.350
<v Speaker 3>If it brings in genuine joy,</v>

2728
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.240
<v Speaker 3>why does it?</v>

2729
01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have to go to a rave?</v>

2730
01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:33.591
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2731
01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2732
01:17:34.210 --> 01:17:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Why do?</v>

2733
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have to go on thrinder mother lost soul.</v>

2734
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Take this dance for lost souls.</v>

2735
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.420
<v Speaker 3>Asian lost souls.</v>

2736
01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean every we just do whatever the fuck you want to do.</v>

2737
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.290
<v Speaker 3>The more people will get over that.</v>

2738
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the things that I really,</v>

2739
01:17:50.001 --> 01:17:52.970
<v Speaker 3>truly have hoped for with this new generation of kids.</v>

2740
01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:53.721
<v Speaker 3>All these people,</v>

2741
01:17:53.721 --> 01:17:54.554
<v Speaker 3>I think growing up,</v>

2742
01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:56.571
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

2743
01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:57.530
<v Speaker 3>growing up with the Internet,</v>

2744
01:17:57.770 --> 01:18:01.370
<v Speaker 3>I think they're just going to have a totally different acceptance of people</v>

2745
01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:02.204
<v Speaker 3>being different.</v>

2746
01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I just think that we grew up in a weird time,</v>

2747
01:18:05.091 --> 01:18:05.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2748
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.350
<v Speaker 3>We grew up.</v>

2749
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm 10 years older than you,</v>

2750
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.480
<v Speaker 3>so I grew up mostly kind of in the early eighties,</v>

2751
01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:11.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2752
01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.870
<v Speaker 3>I went to school in [inaudible] 81 was my first year of high school,</v>

2753
01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:19.910
<v Speaker 3>so I think that we just grew up in a time where we were just guessing nobody,</v>

2754
01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:23.180
<v Speaker 3>nobody kind of knew how many people were out there that were filled with the</v>

2755
01:18:23.181 --> 01:18:24.200
<v Speaker 3>same amount of angst.</v>

2756
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:28.070
<v Speaker 3>You kind of guessed by the movies that we all gravitated towards or you guessed</v>

2757
01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:32.400
<v Speaker 3>by the songs that we all listen to fucking coffee with butter in it too.</v>

2758
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I might have to stop,</v>

2759
01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 3>might have to go straight black heel back to starbucks.</v>

2760
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:37.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going back to starbucks,</v>

2761
01:18:37.131 --> 01:18:38.480
<v Speaker 3>caveman coffee all the way.</v>

2762
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.410
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2763
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:42.950
<v Speaker 3>the butter man is not good pre podcast for the phlegm production.</v>

2764
01:18:43.690 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 3>So the point is we didn't know,</v>

2765
01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:45.500
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2766
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows.</v>

2767
01:18:46.401 --> 01:18:47.234
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>

2768
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:49.310
<v Speaker 3>like if you're like transgender is a perfect example.</v>

2769
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:50.840
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about like people that feel they were.</v>

2770
01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:55.580
<v Speaker 3>If you were a fucking kid and you were growing up in 1984 and you were a woman</v>

2771
01:18:55.581 --> 01:18:56.750
<v Speaker 3>trapped in a man's body,</v>

2772
01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.300
<v Speaker 3>you had no fucking friends.</v>

2773
01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:00.500
<v Speaker 3>You had no recourse.</v>

2774
01:19:00.501 --> 01:19:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Good luck trying to find out other people just like you.</v>

2775
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:06.410
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to join some club somewhere that harbors them where they have</v>

2776
01:19:06.411 --> 01:19:08.090
<v Speaker 3>to come out and admit they're part of this.</v>

2777
01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 3>No Manal you go online,</v>

2778
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.540
<v Speaker 3>you could find a whole community of people.</v>

2779
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2780
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.700

2781
01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.680
<v Speaker 3>for anything you say.</v>

2782
01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:15.171
<v Speaker 3>But even like,</v>

2783
01:19:15.171 --> 01:19:15.501

2787
01:19:20.721 --> 01:19:21.081
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2788
01:19:21.081 --> 01:19:21.914
<v Speaker 3>that's a real,</v>

2789
01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:22.940
<v Speaker 3>that's a real issue.</v>

2790
01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:23.360

2793
01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:33.500
<v Speaker 3>son to be like a sex slave.</v>

2794
01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:37.730
<v Speaker 3>They were bringing his son to all these other grown men.</v>

2795
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:38.541
<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>

2796
01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

2797
01:19:39.471 --> 01:19:39.771
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

2798
01:19:39.771 --> 01:19:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen this guy,</v>

2799
01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:42.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2800
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:44.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to talk about because it's so disturbing.</v>

2801
01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:44.970
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>

2802
01:19:44.970 --> 01:19:45.360
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

2803
01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.140
<v Speaker 3>it was a crazy expos where they followed these,</v>

2804
01:19:48.141 --> 01:19:48.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2805
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:52.820
<v Speaker 3>these guys for a while and they suspected it and apparently they had kept this</v>

2806
01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:57.821
<v Speaker 3>very close knit relationship with all these rich pedophiles over the world and</v>

2807
01:19:57.921 --> 01:20:01.670
<v Speaker 3>they brought their son all around them and he was really young boy and they were</v>

2808
01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:05.090
<v Speaker 3>using him as this sex slave and they had figured it out.</v>

2809
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.811
<v Speaker 3>Somehow or another,</v>

2810
01:20:05.811 --> 01:20:08.790
<v Speaker 3>they figured out how to crack group of tight lipped people.</v>

2811
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:12.810
<v Speaker 3>Eventually someone email slipped out or something and they figured it out and</v>

2812
01:20:12.811 --> 01:20:15.040
<v Speaker 3>eventually brought these guys to put this poor kid.</v>

2813
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.331
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2814
01:20:15.331 --> 01:20:15.991
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck,</v>

2815
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:16.410
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2816
01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:17.550
<v Speaker 3>these are the people that love you,</v>

2817
01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:21.870
<v Speaker 3>your parents and your being paraded around with them like you're the perfect</v>

2818
01:20:21.871 --> 01:20:25.920
<v Speaker 3>family and meanwhile you're bringing this kid around to all these pedophiles and</v>

2819
01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:28.590
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking sociopath or psychopath.</v>

2820
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:30.690
<v Speaker 3>I think that's both right.</v>

2821
01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:30.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2822
01:20:30.991 --> 01:20:35.040
<v Speaker 3>that's a sociopath in that you have no empathy and a psychopath and that you're</v>

2823
01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:35.940
<v Speaker 3>doing damage,</v>

2824
01:20:35.941 --> 01:20:36.241
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2825
01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:36.761
<v Speaker 3>Is that what?</v>

2826
01:20:36.761 --> 01:20:39.330
<v Speaker 3>So what is the difference between sociopath say that?</v>

2827
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:43.920
<v Speaker 3>Although path can feel emotion final right now,</v>

2828
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:45.330
<v Speaker 3>psychopath does feel motion.</v>

2829
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2830
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:47.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like a flashlight that can do chores</v>

2831
01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 3>is a horribly fantastic way to put it.</v>

2832
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:57.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like a room but with a butthole.</v>

2833
01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.201
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2834
01:20:58.201 --> 01:21:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Here's the difference between a psychopath and associate path for.</v>

2835
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:03.383
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2836
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:04.381
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

2837
01:21:04.381 --> 01:21:09.381
<v Speaker 3>This society has conspired with Hollywood to seemingly sexy psychological terms,</v>

2838
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.010
<v Speaker 3>door collective consciousness,</v>

2839
01:21:11.011 --> 01:21:12.180
<v Speaker 3>psychopath and sociopath.</v>

2840
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:17.181
<v Speaker 3>Psychopath and sociopath are pop psychology terms for what psychiatry calls an</v>

2841
01:21:17.311 --> 01:21:19.440
<v Speaker 3>antisocial personality disorder.</v>

2842
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:20.011
<v Speaker 3>Today,</v>

2843
01:21:20.011 --> 01:21:23.880
<v Speaker 3>these two terms are not really well defined in the psychology research</v>

2844
01:21:23.881 --> 01:21:24.690
<v Speaker 3>literature.</v>

2845
01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:25.261
<v Speaker 3>Nonetheless,</v>

2846
01:21:25.261 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 3>there are some general differences between the two types of personality types</v>

2847
01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.570
<v Speaker 3>which will look in this article.</v>

2848
01:21:30.571 --> 01:21:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Both types of personalities have pervasive pattern of disregard for the safety</v>

2849
01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.730
<v Speaker 3>and rights of others.</v>

2850
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 3>Deceit and manipulation are central features to both types of personalities and</v>

2851
01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 3>contrary to popular belief,</v>

2852
01:21:41.461 --> 01:21:45.090
<v Speaker 3>a psychopath or sociopath is not necessarily violent.</v>

2853
01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:46.973
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2854
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.170
<v Speaker 3>so psychopath and sociopath,</v>

2855
01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:50.970
<v Speaker 3>they share a diagnosis.</v>

2856
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:54.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a antisocial personality as someone who has three or more of the</v>

2857
01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:55.710
<v Speaker 3>following traits,</v>

2858
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:58.370
<v Speaker 3>regularly breaks were flaunt the law.</v>

2859
01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Big Jay Oakerson constantly lies and deceives others.</v>

2860
01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Brian Red Band is impulsive and doesn't plan ahead.</v>

2861
01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:08.550
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan can be prone to fighting and aggressiveness.</v>

2862
01:22:08.551 --> 01:22:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan has a little regard for the safety of others.</v>

2863
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Brian red band,</v>

2864
01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 3>irresponsible,</v>

2865
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:16.590
<v Speaker 3>can't meet financial obligations.</v>

2866
01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't feel remorse or guilt.</v>

2867
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:22.253
<v Speaker 3>That's none of us.</v>

2868
01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:23.190
<v Speaker 3>We definitely feel guilt.</v>

2869
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2870
01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:24.550
<v Speaker 3>so Brian,</v>

2871
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:26.100
<v Speaker 3>you're most likely to be a psychopath.</v>

2872
01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.633
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2873
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.740
<v Speaker 3>most likely.</v>

2874
01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.900
<v Speaker 3>One percent of the general population sociopath,</v>

2875
01:22:30.901 --> 01:22:35.901
<v Speaker 3>four percent both suffer from I'm anti social personality disorder.</v>

2876
01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Both lack empathy.</v>

2877
01:22:39.391 --> 01:22:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Both demonstrate complete disregard for the social rules and behavior standards.</v>

2878
01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 3>That's Brian both failed to feel any remorse or guilt.</v>

2879
01:22:47.521 --> 01:22:48.510
<v Speaker 3>That's not you at all.</v>

2880
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:49.740
<v Speaker 3>A are violent.</v>

2881
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:50.760
<v Speaker 3>That's not you at all.</v>

2882
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.200
<v Speaker 3>So that's weird.</v>

2883
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:52.921
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference?</v>

2884
01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2885
01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:54.090
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2886
01:22:54.090 --> 01:22:54.271
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2887
01:22:54.271 --> 01:22:55.440
<v Speaker 3>this is where I zone out.</v>

2888
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:56.160
<v Speaker 3>Pop.</v>

2889
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Pop psychology is a great word too,</v>

2890
01:22:58.321 --> 01:22:59.850
<v Speaker 3>because when it does get into the,</v>

2891
01:22:59.851 --> 01:23:00.684
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2892
01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.530
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to become a part of the collective consciousness is,</v>

2893
01:23:03.531 --> 01:23:04.051
<v Speaker 3>as it says,</v>

2894
01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:06.640
<v Speaker 3>like people just scapegoat those things so much.</v>

2895
01:23:06.641 --> 01:23:08.890
<v Speaker 3>How many people in your life to just call themselves bipolar?</v>

2896
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Look at this key difference.</v>

2897
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Psychopaths are,</v>

2898
01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:16.390
<v Speaker 3>is likely to be educated and have a good career.</v>

2899
01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Sociopath is likely to be uneducated and unable to keep a steady job.</v>

2900
01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:25.290
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking interesting that they did.</v>

2901
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:28.990
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these and psychopaths have controlled behavior.</v>

2902
01:23:28.991 --> 01:23:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Were sociopaths have erratic behavior.</v>

2903
01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.153
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2904
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.600
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

2905
01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:36.013
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2906
01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.500
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking weird,</v>

2907
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:39.060
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2908
01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.730
<v Speaker 3>We either way fucked up both highly manipulative,</v>

2909
01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:43.631
<v Speaker 3>impulsive,</v>

2910
01:23:43.631 --> 01:23:44.440
<v Speaker 3>spontaneous,</v>

2911
01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.131
<v Speaker 3>sociopath,</v>

2912
01:23:45.131 --> 01:23:47.500
<v Speaker 3>more sponsor of a more,</v>

2913
01:23:47.501 --> 01:23:51.060
<v Speaker 3>a spontaneous and psychopath,</v>

2914
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.731
<v Speaker 3>more manipulative.</v>

2915
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:52.564
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

2916
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:53.913
<v Speaker 3>You could find.</v>

2917
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:57.160
<v Speaker 3>You could find yourself in a few of those and then things that are definitely</v>

2918
01:23:57.161 --> 01:23:57.881
<v Speaker 3>not you and all of them.</v>

2919
01:23:57.881 --> 01:23:58.001
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2920
01:23:58.001 --> 01:23:58.331
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2921
01:23:58.331 --> 01:23:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Like I've definitely like,</v>

2922
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:00.220
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely things in there where,</v>

2923
01:24:00.221 --> 01:24:01.054
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2924
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.570
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2925
01:24:02.571 --> 01:24:05.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling a downtrodden.</v>

2926
01:24:05.411 --> 01:24:05.591
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2927
01:24:05.591 --> 01:24:06.041
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2928
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:06.141
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2929
01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:07.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a highly manipulative person.</v>

2930
01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:09.100
<v Speaker 3>It'll make me upset at myself,</v>

2931
01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:09.520
<v Speaker 3>feel good.</v>

2932
01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.300
<v Speaker 3>But that just the next thing under there was like,</v>

2933
01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.550
<v Speaker 3>it's because I have personal tab,</v>

2934
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:14.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hurt people or anything like that.</v>

2935
01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:15.693
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2936
01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:19.720
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like when you break variables down like that to like a two columns,</v>

2937
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:20.350
<v Speaker 3>that's what I mean.</v>

2938
01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:23.050
<v Speaker 3>Four or $5 too much of yourself and none of yourself and all of it.</v>

2939
01:24:23.051 --> 01:24:23.710
<v Speaker 3>None of yourself.</v>

2940
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Your complex man.</v>

2941
01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:25.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're a fucking year,</v>

2942
01:24:25.971 --> 01:24:30.070
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different things and you're a lot of different things from week to</v>

2943
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.370
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

2944
01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:33.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're a different person one week and then the next week you know,</v>

2945
01:24:33.791 --> 01:24:36.880
<v Speaker 3>things might be going way better in your life and you just.</v>

2946
01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean you might interact with the exact same person,</v>

2947
01:24:39.671 --> 01:24:41.860
<v Speaker 3>the exact same moment and a totally different way,</v>

2948
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:46.060
<v Speaker 3>which makes you like pretty much a different person in a lot of ways that you</v>

2949
01:24:46.061 --> 01:24:47.110
<v Speaker 3>change all the time.</v>

2950
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:49.090
<v Speaker 3>I think the real thing is empathy.</v>

2951
01:24:49.091 --> 01:24:50.290
<v Speaker 3>People who lack empathy,</v>

2952
01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:50.990
<v Speaker 3>that really,</v>

2953
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:52.030
<v Speaker 3>really scares us.</v>

2954
01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:56.740
<v Speaker 3>People who will victimize other people grew and other people want to kill.</v>

2955
01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.900
<v Speaker 3>Other people want to do harm to other people.</v>

2956
01:24:58.901 --> 01:25:02.080
<v Speaker 3>Stopped going to be that kind of shit that freaks us out and that's what we're</v>

2957
01:25:02.081 --> 01:25:02.831
<v Speaker 3>really worried about.</v>

2958
01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:05.650
<v Speaker 3>We're worried about someone who goes after someone,</v>

2959
01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:08.380
<v Speaker 3>like someone who tries to harm them,</v>

2960
01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:09.790
<v Speaker 3>especially physically.</v>

2961
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:11.020
<v Speaker 3>That scares the shit out of us.</v>

2962
01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:11.620
<v Speaker 3>Like someone,</v>

2963
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:12.640
<v Speaker 3>someone could just like.</v>

2964
01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:15.760
<v Speaker 3>You've ever seen a video of this guy who was into just stab people in the ass?</v>

2965
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:16.480
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2966
01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:16.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2967
01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:19.150
<v Speaker 3>he stabbed a bunch of people and they got him on a security camera.</v>

2968
01:25:19.151 --> 01:25:20.860
<v Speaker 3>This guy was in like a retail store,</v>

2969
01:25:20.861 --> 01:25:22.150
<v Speaker 3>just walked us some duty tap,</v>

2970
01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:22.350
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>

2971
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:23.980
<v Speaker 3>tap that just shanks.</v>

2972
01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:25.030
<v Speaker 3>This guy in the ass like five,</v>

2973
01:25:25.031 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 3>six times before he even doesn't even know what's happening.</v>

2974
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:28.930
<v Speaker 3>It's a black dude doing it to a white guy too,</v>

2975
01:25:28.931 --> 01:25:30.100
<v Speaker 3>which makes it extra spooky.</v>

2976
01:25:31.150 --> 01:25:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Like you the idea that you could just zig when you should have zagged and then</v>

2977
01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:40.360
<v Speaker 3>you run into some guy who has a buck knife and he just shoving it in your ass in</v>

2978
01:25:40.361 --> 01:25:43.450
<v Speaker 3>a department store like Dax possible.</v>

2979
01:25:43.530 --> 01:25:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Like you could run into that guy.</v>

2980
01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:46.600
<v Speaker 3>That kind of stuff freaks us out.</v>

2981
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:47.140
<v Speaker 3>There was a in the,</v>

2982
01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.080
<v Speaker 3>in the East village maybe a year ago,</v>

2983
01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:52.330
<v Speaker 3>and they've had video of it,</v>

2984
01:25:52.331 --> 01:25:53.510
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty brutal.</v>

2985
01:25:53.511 --> 01:25:57.730
<v Speaker 3>It's just a little old Asian guy walking home like I think it was even that late</v>

2986
01:25:57.730 --> 01:25:57.731
<v Speaker 3>at night,</v>

2987
01:25:57.731 --> 01:25:58.241
<v Speaker 3>maybe like 10,</v>

2988
01:25:58.241 --> 01:25:58.961
<v Speaker 3>11:00 at night.</v>

2989
01:25:58.961 --> 01:25:59.920
<v Speaker 3>And I could be wrong about that,</v>

2990
01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:03.110
<v Speaker 3>but there's this video of this black dude goes up behind them.</v>

2991
01:26:03.111 --> 01:26:03.944
<v Speaker 3>It's a little</v>

2992
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:07.970
<v Speaker 4>old Asian guy and he just starts beating him against the wall.</v>

2993
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.460
<v Speaker 4>He just beat him to death on the middle of street out of nowhere,</v>

2994
01:26:10.461 --> 01:26:11.410
<v Speaker 4>unprovoked it comes,</v>

2995
01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:13.280
<v Speaker 4>comes up behind him and attack him.</v>

2996
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:14.661
<v Speaker 4>The word was,</v>

2997
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:15.390
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

2998
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2999
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 4>all screwed up on drugs.</v>

3000
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:18.500
<v Speaker 4>The kid like whack down on some,</v>

3001
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.393
<v Speaker 4>on something.</v>

3002
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:22.220
<v Speaker 4>But the police station is on my block,</v>

3003
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:23.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3004
01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:23.990
<v Speaker 4>in the East village.</v>

3005
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.711
<v Speaker 4>So they brought them in there.</v>

3006
01:26:24.711 --> 01:26:27.530
<v Speaker 4>So we saw all the news vans and everything out there and you know,</v>

3007
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:28.011
<v Speaker 4>me and my,</v>

3008
01:26:28.011 --> 01:26:28.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3009
01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:33.050
<v Speaker 4>my buddy went over and we just kind of watched the guy come out and like to be a</v>

3010
01:26:33.051 --> 01:26:33.980
<v Speaker 4>part of something like that.</v>

3011
01:26:33.981 --> 01:26:36.050
<v Speaker 4>Like his face when they brought them out was like,</v>

3012
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:38.000
<v Speaker 4>he definitely felt something.</v>

3013
01:26:38.001 --> 01:26:38.541
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

3014
01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:38.970
<v Speaker 4>Like he was,</v>

3015
01:26:38.970 --> 01:26:40.670
<v Speaker 4>he had like a kind of a scowl on his face,</v>

3016
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:42.560
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't seem like remorse.</v>

3017
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.970
<v Speaker 4>Just the face of a guy who was involved with just that violent have an action.</v>

3018
01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a death,</v>

3019
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:50.720
<v Speaker 4>like a death happened and it was all and it wasn't even like a,</v>

3020
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.990
<v Speaker 4>just like the idea of a,</v>

3021
01:26:52.991 --> 01:26:53.824
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3022
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.130
<v Speaker 4>we all fear those things.</v>

3023
01:26:55.131 --> 01:26:56.580
<v Speaker 4>And also I don't see myself do,</v>

3024
01:26:56.581 --> 01:26:57.414
<v Speaker 4>I don't see my,</v>

3025
01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:58.540
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

3026
01:26:58.540 --> 01:26:59.840
<v Speaker 4>I know fight or flight obviously,</v>

3027
01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:01.850
<v Speaker 4>but hitting someone in the head with a hammer,</v>

3028
01:27:01.851 --> 01:27:03.210
<v Speaker 4>like the thought of,</v>

3029
01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.670
<v Speaker 4>of what that would just do,</v>

3030
01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:05.181
<v Speaker 4>like the thing of,</v>

3031
01:27:05.181 --> 01:27:05.271
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3032
01:27:05.271 --> 01:27:07.800
<v Speaker 4>the actual physical action of that is mind blowing.</v>

3033
01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:10.640
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't possibly wrap my brain around just being there.</v>

3034
01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:13.070
<v Speaker 4>Just like how some people are just so smart.</v>

3035
01:27:13.071 --> 01:27:15.290
<v Speaker 4>You could barely understand half the fucking shit they're saying.</v>

3036
01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.610
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you talk to the particle physicist and I'm talking about cern and</v>

3037
01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:19.940
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3038
01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:21.350
<v Speaker 4>these experiments to doing,</v>

3039
01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:22.700
<v Speaker 4>trying to locate the large,</v>

3040
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:23.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3041
01:27:23.181 --> 01:27:23.331
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3042
01:27:23.331 --> 01:27:23.631
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3043
01:27:23.631 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3044
01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:24.280
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3045
01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:24.621
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3046
01:27:24.621 --> 01:27:24.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3047
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:29.080
<v Speaker 4>using the large Hadron collider and tried to locate the Higgs Boson particle,</v>

3048
01:27:29.081 --> 01:27:30.050
<v Speaker 4>like what the fuck,</v>

3049
01:27:30.051 --> 01:27:30.710
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3050
01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:34.910
<v Speaker 4>we really the same thing with this on dude's whose brains go off in a different</v>

3051
01:27:34.911 --> 01:27:36.620
<v Speaker 4>direction in a way that you can't even recommend.</v>

3052
01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3053
01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:40.700
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't even recognize the thought patterns of someone who just walks into a</v>

3054
01:27:40.701 --> 01:27:43.730
<v Speaker 4>walmart with an ax and just starts taking people out.</v>

3055
01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Like those people exist.</v>

3056
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:47.540
<v Speaker 4>The Guy who got on the tower in an Austin,</v>

3057
01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:48.530
<v Speaker 4>Texas that one day,</v>

3058
01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:52.760
<v Speaker 4>the schools in the university and that was back in the sixties or the seventies,</v>

3059
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:57.260
<v Speaker 4>and just started shooting people from the tower pole until they finally took him</v>

3060
01:27:57.261 --> 01:27:57.471
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

3061
01:27:57.471 --> 01:27:58.250
<v Speaker 4>But fuck man.</v>

3062
01:27:58.250 --> 01:28:02.200
<v Speaker 4>Did you know with a Ted what the hell was in Bundy?</v>

3063
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:04.540
<v Speaker 4>And then I said the Charles Whitman.</v>

3064
01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:07.130
<v Speaker 4>So you're talking about the guy going to tower Texas?</v>

3065
01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:07.983
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3066
01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.240
<v Speaker 4>Apparently when he was autopsied he had a tumor on his temporal lobe.</v>

3067
01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:15.010
<v Speaker 4>Took away all of it.</v>

3068
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.490
<v Speaker 4>So when it got big enough,</v>

3069
01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:17.990
<v Speaker 4>it took away all inhibitions.</v>

3070
01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:21.200
<v Speaker 4>He actually killed everything he saw on his way to that tower.</v>

3071
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:21.710
<v Speaker 4>He killed it.</v>

3072
01:28:21.710 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 4>He killed his dog at home.</v>

3073
01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.241
<v Speaker 4>He killed it.</v>

3074
01:28:23.241 --> 01:28:24.080
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe his girl,</v>

3075
01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.520
<v Speaker 4>but he killed a few people on the way.</v>

3076
01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.570
<v Speaker 4>So it was just,</v>

3077
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:29.030
<v Speaker 4>he would actually have been found not guilty today.</v>

3078
01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.780
<v Speaker 4>I've heard arguments about St Louis so he would not be found not guilty day</v>

3079
01:28:32.781 --> 01:28:35.210
<v Speaker 4>because that was actually like a physical problem that guy had.</v>

3080
01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.110
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3081
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:36.760
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3082
01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:37.130
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>

3083
01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:37.963
<v Speaker 4>can you,</v>

3084
01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:39.471
<v Speaker 4>am I saying the right word here?</v>

3085
01:28:39.471 --> 01:28:44.471
<v Speaker 4>Behaviorally a teach someone to become a psychopath because we're in la now too,</v>

3086
01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:49.430
<v Speaker 4>which was always home of the crips,</v>

3087
01:28:49.431 --> 01:28:49.941
<v Speaker 4>bloods,</v>

3088
01:28:49.941 --> 01:28:50.631
<v Speaker 4>gang wars.</v>

3089
01:28:50.631 --> 01:28:54.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean you just take these kids that they're willing to like shoot in the crowds</v>

3090
01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.500
<v Speaker 4>indiscriminately and just kill people.</v>

3091
01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:57.353
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>

3092
01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.790
<v Speaker 4>and later that night play madden.</v>

3093
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:59.750
<v Speaker 4>Well you can,</v>

3094
01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 4>if you raise them in a totally fucked</v>

3095
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.010
<v Speaker 3>up way from the time they're born and the worst possible environment,</v>

3096
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:07.140
<v Speaker 3>people imitate whatever atmosphere they're in.</v>

3097
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:11.460
<v Speaker 3>If you're in an atmosphere that's filled with violence and horrific crime and</v>

3098
01:29:11.461 --> 01:29:15.510
<v Speaker 3>that becomes the norm and you get your respect by committing more violent and</v>

3099
01:29:15.511 --> 01:29:18.900
<v Speaker 3>more horrific crimes so that everyone's afraid of you and you become this bad</v>

3100
01:29:18.901 --> 01:29:21.390
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker with a lollipop would just shoot people in the face.</v>

3101
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.510
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of dudes like that because that's where they get that good feeling</v>

3102
01:29:24.670 --> 01:29:27.420
<v Speaker 3>that you get the good feeling of accomplishment by being the biggest fucking</v>

3103
01:29:27.421 --> 01:29:28.350
<v Speaker 3>psychopath around.</v>

3104
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.330
<v Speaker 3>That's just a total failure of the environment that person's being developed in,</v>

3105
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.810
<v Speaker 3>but that's also what they have to do in warm and</v>

3106
01:29:36.610 --> 01:29:38.940
<v Speaker 3>it was all about the psychopaths.</v>

3107
01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Do you see that fucking thing I posted on instagram today?</v>

3108
01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Look at this thing and pull up.</v>

3109
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:45.540
<v Speaker 3>This image that I posted on instagram was from World War One.</v>

3110
01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Now look at this picture is 20 years before King Kong and the picture is a</v>

3111
01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:55.150
<v Speaker 3>propaganda picture depicting the Germans as savages.</v>

3112
01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.220
<v Speaker 3>This was about Germany CD.</v>

3113
01:29:57.230 --> 01:30:00.750
<v Speaker 3>He's got this club in his hand and the Club says Culture K,</v>

3114
01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:02.190
<v Speaker 3>u l t,</v>

3115
01:30:02.191 --> 01:30:03.060
<v Speaker 3>u r.</v>

3116
01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:04.440
<v Speaker 3>that's a like,</v>

3117
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.700
<v Speaker 3>I guess I say it in Germany.</v>

3118
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

3119
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:07.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3120
01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:10.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's supposed to represent German culture and this was,</v>

3121
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:12.750
<v Speaker 3>this predated King Kong by 20 fucking years,</v>

3122
01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's a gorilla like with like a crown,</v>

3123
01:30:15.871 --> 01:30:16.740
<v Speaker 3>like a German,</v>

3124
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.300
<v Speaker 3>a German helmet with a spike on the top of it and the grill is holding a woman</v>

3125
01:30:21.301 --> 01:30:22.134
<v Speaker 3>and her tits are.</v>

3126
01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Tits are allowed to show tits back then.</v>

3127
01:30:24.751 --> 01:30:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Even in an army propaganda film,</v>

3128
01:30:26.401 --> 01:30:30.030
<v Speaker 3>you've got to protect the tits and this gorilla with this club.</v>

3129
01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:32.520
<v Speaker 3>It says destroy this mad brute.</v>

3130
01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.730
<v Speaker 3>And then it says mayor list US army.</v>

3131
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.130
<v Speaker 3>And if you go to a Joe Rogan on Instagram,</v>

3132
01:30:38.131 --> 01:30:38.790
<v Speaker 3>you could see it.</v>

3133
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:39.571
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty crazy.</v>

3134
01:30:39.571 --> 01:30:42.370
<v Speaker 3>And it's in the sand that says America that I wonder if they,</v>

3135
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:42.740
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3136
01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:43.130
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3137
01:30:43.130 --> 01:30:45.510
<v Speaker 3>they kind of stole the idea for King Kong from that poster.</v>

3138
01:30:45.511 --> 01:30:49.590
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that was a pretty well known poster back in the day and got me the</v>

3139
01:30:49.591 --> 01:30:49.921
<v Speaker 3>writer,</v>

3140
01:30:49.921 --> 01:30:53.490
<v Speaker 3>got the idea from that kid could have grown up seeing that,</v>

3141
01:30:53.491 --> 01:30:53.791
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3142
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:55.650
<v Speaker 3>And then 20 years later made a movie like it.</v>

3143
01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:56.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3144
01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:56.851
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3145
01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:57.810
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of guerrilla,</v>

3146
01:30:57.811 --> 01:30:58.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3147
01:30:58.530 --> 01:30:59.400
<v Speaker 3>at the time there,</v>

3148
01:30:59.450 --> 01:31:01.680
<v Speaker 3>another really interesting point at the time,</v>

3149
01:31:01.681 --> 01:31:04.380
<v Speaker 3>mountain gorillas were not even known to be real,</v>

3150
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:10.030
<v Speaker 3>like mountain gorillas really only became known for sure in the early 19</v>

3151
01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:11.790
<v Speaker 3>hundreds.</v>

3152
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:16.410
<v Speaker 3>So this is a relatively recent animal and a lot of ways like gorillas,</v>

3153
01:31:16.411 --> 01:31:20.550
<v Speaker 3>like there's always been talk of gorillas and different types of primates and</v>

3154
01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:24.600
<v Speaker 3>they've always known that chimpanzees existed and orangutans were very confusing</v>

3155
01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:26.160
<v Speaker 3>to people in the early 18 hundreds.</v>

3156
01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:29.070
<v Speaker 3>But when they were documenting all the different animals,</v>

3157
01:31:29.071 --> 01:31:32.550
<v Speaker 3>they didn't definitively document the mountain gorilla until the early 19</v>

3158
01:31:32.551 --> 01:31:33.384
<v Speaker 3>hundreds.</v>

3159
01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:35.190
<v Speaker 3>So you're looking at something probably if,</v>

3160
01:31:35.191 --> 01:31:37.650
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's supposed to represent a mountain gorilla or some kind of gorilla,</v>

3161
01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:42.270
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at something that was like a relatively recent idea to people.</v>

3162
01:31:42.271 --> 01:31:44.250
<v Speaker 3>This picture of a gorilla and it's also,</v>

3163
01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.990
<v Speaker 3>you're also looking at something that's only probably 50 years after the</v>

3164
01:31:48.991 --> 01:31:50.340
<v Speaker 3>invention of photography.</v>

3165
01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:51.261
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

3166
01:31:51.261 --> 01:31:53.250
<v Speaker 3>So I mean think about 50 years ago,</v>

3167
01:31:53.410 --> 01:31:53.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3168
01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:55.890
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about like 1960 something,</v>

3169
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:56.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3170
01:31:56.490 --> 01:31:57.323
<v Speaker 3>Think of that.</v>

3171
01:31:57.450 --> 01:31:58.051
<v Speaker 3>Think of the 19,</v>

3172
01:31:58.051 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 3>67 and we're still driving 19 sixties cars</v>

3173
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:00.460
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

3174
01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:00.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>

3175
01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Those are classic cars.</v>

3176
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.100
<v Speaker 1>That was when the fucking full photograph was invented for them and here they</v>

3177
01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:09.430
<v Speaker 1>are looking at this image of a gorilla carrying a woman like whoa.</v>

3178
01:32:09.431 --> 01:32:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea of a.</v>

3179
01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:12.250
<v Speaker 1>A gorilla was pretty recent,</v>

3180
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.530
<v Speaker 1>but that's Germany.</v>

3181
01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Getting that crazy like France and England were supposed to be civilization and</v>

3182
01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:20.021
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

3183
01:32:20.021 --> 01:32:23.530
<v Speaker 1>These were mad barbarians from the Roman days.</v>

3184
01:32:23.531 --> 01:32:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what the Germanic tribes.</v>

3185
01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:28.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what we thought of Germans in the 19 hundreds.</v>

3186
01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:30.880
<v Speaker 1>They connected them to barbarians.</v>

3187
01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3188
01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:32.351
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3189
01:32:32.351 --> 01:32:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that amazing?</v>

3190
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.290
<v Speaker 1>So much so that when we went to war with them,</v>

3191
01:32:35.291 --> 01:32:36.670
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't have been more sleek.</v>

3192
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:38.350
<v Speaker 1>It was such like a.</v>

3193
01:32:39.130 --> 01:32:39.730
<v Speaker 1>It was probably,</v>

3194
01:32:39.730 --> 01:32:39.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3195
01:32:39.961 --> 01:32:41.760
<v Speaker 1>they were so advanced in so many words,</v>

3196
01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:44.230
<v Speaker 1>so much engine weaponry and all that shit.</v>

3197
01:32:44.231 --> 01:32:45.400
<v Speaker 1>They were like pretty well.</v>

3198
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:46.151
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

3199
01:32:46.151 --> 01:32:47.830
<v Speaker 1>the automobile industry there,</v>

3200
01:32:47.831 --> 01:32:50.230
<v Speaker 1>their cars are some of the most advanced cars in the world.</v>

3201
01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:52.090
<v Speaker 1>The Germans make Mercedes,</v>

3202
01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.610
<v Speaker 1>they make BMW and they make Porsche.</v>

3203
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:55.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3204
01:32:55.151 --> 01:32:55.984
<v Speaker 1>we're done.</v>

3205
01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Those are like the three,</v>

3206
01:32:57.250 --> 01:32:58.083
<v Speaker 1>like if you've,</v>

3207
01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:01.360
<v Speaker 1>if you had to pick our top three most advanced,</v>

3208
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:04.150
<v Speaker 1>best engineered high end cars,</v>

3209
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:05.410
<v Speaker 1>those are the three.</v>

3210
01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Like those are the top of the Ferrari's are bad ass,</v>

3211
01:33:08.171 --> 01:33:10.330
<v Speaker 1>but everybody knows that fucking thing is going to break.</v>

3212
01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:11.251
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

3213
01:33:11.251 --> 01:33:13.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of those guys bump into someone,</v>

3214
01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.610
<v Speaker 1>you buy a fucking Ferrari like bitch,</v>

3215
01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you know you can't go to vegas and that thing,</v>

3216
01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:20.000
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be halfway in the desert and sudden bang,</v>

3217
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3218
01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Bang one blah blah blah blah blah blah,</v>

3219
01:33:22.331 --> 01:33:22.930
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

3220
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:27.930
<v Speaker 1>If he seen that car that goes on air like blow or belief or something like that,</v>

3221
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:33.970
<v Speaker 1>it goes 100 miles on air and it has a compressor in it that takes four hours to</v>

3222
01:33:35.051 --> 01:33:35.884
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>

3223
01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:40.750
<v Speaker 1>You just plug it in or you can go to a gas station and if they have like the,</v>

3224
01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:41.980
<v Speaker 1>like the compressor for,</v>

3225
01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.990
<v Speaker 1>you could fill it up in four minutes.</v>

3226
01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you got to be kidding now.</v>

3227
01:33:45.941 --> 01:33:48.800
<v Speaker 1>And what's crazy is that it's already big in the UK.</v>

3228
01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:54.090
<v Speaker 1>They're just now making a plant and whole Wiley and it's only cost $10,000.</v>

3229
01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:56.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a game changer.</v>

3230
01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Especially on the.</v>

3231
01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:58.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3232
01:33:58.691 --> 01:34:02.480
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the CEO because on shark tank and they all in it.</v>

3233
01:34:02.490 --> 01:34:03.590
<v Speaker 1>If you have a really strong longer,</v>

3234
01:34:03.630 --> 01:34:04.463
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3235
01:34:05.650 --> 01:34:09.090
<v Speaker 1>That should be like your workout everyday is pumping your car or airplane ramp,</v>

3236
01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:10.560
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you're going to have that.</v>

3237
01:34:10.561 --> 01:34:13.120
<v Speaker 1>That's mostly people in smart cars in New York.</v>

3238
01:34:13.121 --> 01:34:13.954
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

3239
01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.880
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even have two wheels in the front.</v>

3240
01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:16.983
<v Speaker 1>That's a bike.</v>

3241
01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if that's the same one.</v>

3242
01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I saw a bike with a helmet and recall immobile.</v>

3243
01:34:21.970 --> 01:34:22.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

3244
01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.081
<v Speaker 1>The air pod.</v>

3245
01:34:23.081 --> 01:34:24.550
<v Speaker 1>The air part was on shark tank.</v>

3246
01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3247
01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:25.653
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's it.</v>

3248
01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's see a video on this pitch that looks to me like a bike wearing a helmet.</v>

3249
01:34:30.610 --> 01:34:31.443
<v Speaker 1>That's all it looks like.</v>

3250
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:35.020
<v Speaker 1>That does not look real and it doesn't definitely doesn't look like something</v>

3251
01:34:35.021 --> 01:34:38.680
<v Speaker 1>you'd be safe and how does that pass all the crash standards and all that shit,</v>

3252
01:34:38.690 --> 01:34:42.880
<v Speaker 1>but that was one of the things like all the sharks didn't invest in it because</v>

3253
01:34:42.970 --> 01:34:43.803
<v Speaker 1>you know they don't.</v>

3254
01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:47.120
<v Speaker 1>They only have three prototypes of this and there it was just about to go into</v>

3255
01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:47.980
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing.</v>

3256
01:34:47.981 --> 01:34:49.900
<v Speaker 1>So they haven't done the actual test yet.</v>

3257
01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just google it?</v>

3258
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Jamie just googled airpod video because we can't just go on their facebook page</v>

3259
01:34:55.151 --> 01:34:56.020
<v Speaker 1>and click on every link.</v>

3260
01:34:56.021 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get this dog shit.</v>

3261
01:34:57.501 --> 01:34:58.590
<v Speaker 1>This is how we made the seat.</v>

3262
01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:01.693
<v Speaker 1>The seat.</v>

3263
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3264
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:04.460
<v Speaker 1>You can travel a hundred miles from the foam.</v>

3265
01:35:04.461 --> 01:35:06.270
<v Speaker 1>That's very light so we can drive forever.</v>

3266
01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I look at this fucking thing.</v>

3267
01:35:07.671 --> 01:35:08.504
<v Speaker 1>Drive around.</v>

3268
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:10.220
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy too.</v>

3269
01:35:10.221 --> 01:35:11.750
<v Speaker 1>That gets no traction.</v>

3270
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary.</v>

3271
01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you were on black ice in that piece of shit.</v>

3272
01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine taking it?</v>

3273
01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:17.591
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

3274
01:35:17.591 --> 01:35:21.900
<v Speaker 1>If you could pedal pedal something that's probably pretty good,</v>

3275
01:35:21.930 --> 01:35:24.620
<v Speaker 1>but could probably handle a boost the pedal be a boost.</v>

3276
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:26.203
<v Speaker 1>It's a moped.</v>

3277
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Look how you get out though that said Jetson Dick Dat,</v>

3278
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Dat,</v>

3279
01:35:30.570 --> 01:35:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Dat,</v>

3280
01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:32.193
<v Speaker 1>Dat,</v>

3281
01:35:32.710 --> 01:35:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you control it using a joy stick,</v>

3282
01:35:34.671 --> 01:35:35.630
<v Speaker 1>like a video game</v>

3283
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:38.263
<v Speaker 1>trippy.</v>

3284
01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:39.230
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3285
01:35:39.230 --> 01:35:40.760
<v Speaker 1>But what if you want to text and drive?</v>

3286
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:41.511
<v Speaker 1>You can't even do that.</v>

3287
01:35:41.511 --> 01:35:43.130
<v Speaker 1>You need two hands to control this pitch.</v>

3288
01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:43.761
<v Speaker 1>I wonder the middle,</v>

3289
01:35:43.761 --> 01:35:46.460
<v Speaker 1>like maverick from a control of the joystick,</v>

3290
01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:49.550
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a good idea to keep people from texting and driving.</v>

3291
01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Make them a controlled the car with two joysticks.</v>

3292
01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Year one fraternity for grilling.</v>

3293
01:35:55.431 --> 01:35:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Straightened back.</v>

3294
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:57.110
<v Speaker 1>But you can't look slick.</v>

3295
01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're rolling your six four and you got your hand up like this.</v>

3296
01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:03.810
<v Speaker 1>But lending my six full and all the hookers saying,</v>

3297
01:36:06.150 --> 01:36:11.140
<v Speaker 1>let me write that long arm hold onto the top of the steering wheel.</v>

3298
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Sup Boys Suck.</v>

3299
01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:13.753
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3300
01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.080
<v Speaker 1>even with the windows go down.</v>

3301
01:36:15.081 --> 01:36:19.190
<v Speaker 1>The fucking window is blasting yourself with music.</v>

3302
01:36:19.210 --> 01:36:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I think the front wheel,</v>

3303
01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it's about as big as a tic TAC toe.</v>

3304
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Cartwheel.</v>

3305
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:25.243
<v Speaker 1>It's a wagon.</v>

3306
01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Sounded like a child's toy.</v>

3307
01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:27.530
<v Speaker 1>We'll.</v>

3308
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:28.363
<v Speaker 1>We'll.</v>

3309
01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:29.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3310
01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.040
<v Speaker 1>So small.</v>

3311
01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at this weird fucking engine too,</v>

3312
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:35.683
<v Speaker 1>but hey man,</v>

3313
01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 1>do you think it has heat?</v>

3314
01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:38.901
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question,</v>

3315
01:36:38.901 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3316
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Instead of heat doesn't have anything.</v>

3317
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:43.400
<v Speaker 1>How weird is this?</v>

3318
01:36:43.401 --> 01:36:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Watch that thing.</v>

3319
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Fill up with air.</v>

3320
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:48.580
<v Speaker 1>What if someone comes along and just shoots a hole in your air tank and he</v>

3321
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:49.430
<v Speaker 1>fucking explode?</v>

3322
01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:50.953
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3323
01:36:51.170 --> 01:36:52.003
<v Speaker 1>Oxygen,</v>

3324
01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.240
<v Speaker 1>oxygen.</v>

3325
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.760
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting though is that this is even possible.</v>

3326
01:36:55.761 --> 01:36:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine somebody like Porsche or somebody getting behind in this kind of</v>

3327
01:36:58.701 --> 01:37:00.430
<v Speaker 1>idea of we don't have.</v>

3328
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:01.700
<v Speaker 1>We're not even using fuel.</v>

3329
01:37:01.701 --> 01:37:02.511
<v Speaker 1>We're using air.</v>

3330
01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:03.350
<v Speaker 1>That's fun.</v>

3331
01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:04.213
<v Speaker 1>Nuts.</v>

3332
01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3333
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3334
01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:08.420
<v Speaker 1>you know the problem with that and that,</v>

3335
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:10.040
<v Speaker 1>how are you generating that air?</v>

3336
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing to get that compressed air and how much fossil fuels are</v>

3337
01:37:14.451 --> 01:37:19.040
<v Speaker 1>involved in making that air compressor through that process might require some</v>

3338
01:37:19.041 --> 01:37:19.461
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>

3339
01:37:19.461 --> 01:37:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe they can do it with solar.</v>

3340
01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a way to power some sort of a generator with solar that pumps air.</v>

3341
01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:28.940
<v Speaker 1>That seems possible.</v>

3342
01:37:28.941 --> 01:37:29.774
<v Speaker 1>If that's true,</v>

3343
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.201
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

3344
01:37:30.201 --> 01:37:32.120
<v Speaker 1>that would be like the greenest shit of all time,</v>

3345
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:35.790
<v Speaker 1>but it would also be real.</v>

3346
01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:36.141
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

3347
01:37:36.141 --> 01:37:39.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a back seat or no,</v>

3348
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:42.970
<v Speaker 1>it seems like she climbed in the back or is this a different one that was just</v>

3349
01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:44.033
<v Speaker 1>next to each other.</v>

3350
01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:44.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3351
01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:45.371
<v Speaker 1>so there's more.</v>

3352
01:37:45.371 --> 01:37:45.770
<v Speaker 1>More,</v>

3353
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:46.880
<v Speaker 1>more than one model.</v>

3354
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever watch that shark tank show?</v>

3355
01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3356
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:52.460
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a pretty decent.</v>

3357
01:37:52.461 --> 01:37:53.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like find,</v>

3358
01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.280
<v Speaker 1>find a lot of things in there that</v>

3359
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:59.760
<v Speaker 3>are like this company called Bagel bites in New York now,</v>

3360
01:37:59.761 --> 01:38:02.910
<v Speaker 3>like addicted to them and they just send you all these different kinds of bagels</v>

3361
01:38:02.911 --> 01:38:05.970
<v Speaker 3>and they're just like little bagel balls with cream cheese in the middle of</v>

3362
01:38:05.971 --> 01:38:06.071
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3363
01:38:06.071 --> 01:38:06.904
<v Speaker 3>You put in your oven,</v>

3364
01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.430
<v Speaker 3>support that show 100.</v>

3365
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:09.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3366
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I support anybody who is encouraging people to come up with a good thing.</v>

3367
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:13.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3368
01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:15.241
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

3369
01:38:15.241 --> 01:38:15.700
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3370
01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Have you tried it?</v>

3371
01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3372
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:17.583
<v Speaker 3>that's really good.</v>

3373
01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:18.540
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty hard.</v>

3374
01:38:18.570 --> 01:38:19.381
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

3375
01:38:19.381 --> 01:38:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Dallas diamond page.</v>

3376
01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.151
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed a Pto.</v>

3377
01:38:21.151 --> 01:38:21.351
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3378
01:38:21.351 --> 01:38:21.571
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3379
01:38:21.571 --> 01:38:22.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3380
01:38:22.050 --> 01:38:22.900
<v Speaker 3>he gave me a copy of.</v>

3381
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:23.851
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing it on the road.</v>

3382
01:38:23.851 --> 01:38:23.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3383
01:38:23.941 --> 01:38:26.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing to do in hotels in the road to the yoga.</v>

3384
01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Hard workout is hard to do.</v>

3385
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:33.270
<v Speaker 3>I would have left a yoga three years ago and I'll show you a Hixon gracie</v>

3386
01:38:33.271 --> 01:38:34.620
<v Speaker 3>documentary called choke,</v>

3387
01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:37.290
<v Speaker 3>which shows hixon doing yoga and you realize like,</v>

3388
01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:37.651
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3389
01:38:37.651 --> 01:38:41.560
<v Speaker 3>I think I have a weird idea about yoga because I think of all these chicks doing</v>

3390
01:38:41.561 --> 01:38:42.050
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3391
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Yoga is hard,</v>

3392
01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:43.560
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3393
01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.280
<v Speaker 3>It's really good for your body and it's fantastic for your core.</v>

3394
01:38:47.281 --> 01:38:47.700
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3395
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.190
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that they,</v>

3396
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:53.460
<v Speaker 3>and I was guilty of this myself for sure when you work out all sorts of</v>

3397
01:38:53.461 --> 01:38:54.360
<v Speaker 3>different ways,</v>

3398
01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:59.540
<v Speaker 3>but what you don't work out in your body's ability to move as one unit and one</v>

3399
01:39:00.031 --> 01:39:05.031
<v Speaker 3>unit and your flexibility and your body's like balance and sovereignty,</v>

3400
01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:06.991
<v Speaker 3>like where your body.</v>

3401
01:39:06.991 --> 01:39:10.470
<v Speaker 3>You could do whatever you want to do with your body like stand on one foot and</v>

3402
01:39:10.471 --> 01:39:12.180
<v Speaker 3>just stick your leg straight up in the air.</v>

3403
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.590
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that can lift.</v>

3404
01:39:13.591 --> 01:39:15.000
<v Speaker 3>I'll fuck load of weight.</v>

3405
01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:20.060
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that can run upstairs and do laps on this fucking pool</v>

3406
01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:20.830
<v Speaker 3>back and forth,</v>

3407
01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:21.360
<v Speaker 3>back and forth,</v>

3408
01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.380
<v Speaker 3>and they're just animals,</v>

3409
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.660
<v Speaker 3>but ask them to stand on one leg,</v>

3410
01:39:24.661 --> 01:39:27.390
<v Speaker 3>grab their foot and stick their foot straight up in air and then bounced.</v>

3411
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:28.620
<v Speaker 3>They literally can't do it.</v>

3412
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.450
<v Speaker 3>They can't balance their body like that.</v>

3413
01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:35.160
<v Speaker 3>It's because they don't have full control of the body and what Yoga gives you is</v>

3414
01:39:35.161 --> 01:39:38.610
<v Speaker 3>this weird control of your body when you get really good at Yoga,</v>

3415
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:40.590
<v Speaker 3>like Hixon did you know,</v>

3416
01:39:40.591 --> 01:39:43.050
<v Speaker 3>like he was one of the reasons why he was one of the best Jujitsu guys in the</v>

3417
01:39:43.051 --> 01:39:43.380
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3418
01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:46.230
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just that he knew every move there was.</v>

3419
01:39:46.231 --> 01:39:48.840
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just that his dad was Leo Gracie.</v>

3420
01:39:48.841 --> 01:39:50.490
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the greatest Jujitsu artists.</v>

3421
01:39:50.491 --> 01:39:54.210
<v Speaker 3>One of the most important martial arts ever was also his physical abilities were</v>

3422
01:39:54.211 --> 01:39:58.140
<v Speaker 3>superior because he was into all that yoga and all this bodyweight stuff.</v>

3423
01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Like he would do all these crazy exercises.</v>

3424
01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

3425
01:40:01.170 --> 01:40:03.060
<v Speaker 3>He would do all these like balance beam things.</v>

3426
01:40:03.061 --> 01:40:03.780
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty dope.</v>

3427
01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:07.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of him on the beach in Santa Monica and he's doing like these</v>

3428
01:40:07.911 --> 01:40:09.840
<v Speaker 3>pistol squats on a balance beam,</v>

3429
01:40:09.841 --> 01:40:13.650
<v Speaker 3>holding his foot up and sticks his foot right above his head and he's a Jujitsu</v>

3430
01:40:13.651 --> 01:40:14.340
<v Speaker 3>master.</v>

3431
01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Put pull the video up.</v>

3432
01:40:15.271 --> 01:40:16.090
<v Speaker 3>It's hits,</v>

3433
01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:16.480
<v Speaker 3>hits.</v>

3434
01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3435
01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:19.980
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy to see because you think about what you can do with your body and you</v>

3436
01:40:19.981 --> 01:40:22.890
<v Speaker 3>think about like how much effort it would take to be able to do this with this</v>

3437
01:40:22.891 --> 01:40:23.724
<v Speaker 3>guy's doing right.</v>

3438
01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Diamond Dallas page in his fifties,</v>

3439
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:27.121
<v Speaker 3>in the video,</v>

3440
01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:29.280
<v Speaker 3>standing on one leg and holding his leg up in the air.</v>

3441
01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:30.271
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3442
01:40:30.271 --> 01:40:33.630
<v Speaker 3>And the way they pull it out to go up in the middle and you pull it out and it's</v>

3443
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:35.010
<v Speaker 3>really impressive.</v>

3444
01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:35.730
<v Speaker 3>He's kidding.</v>

3445
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Get even close to what he's doing,</v>

3446
01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.560
<v Speaker 3>but he's done is fix a lot of people's bodies.</v>

3447
01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:41.331
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times.</v>

3448
01:40:41.331 --> 01:40:41.990
<v Speaker 3>My back a lot.</v>

3449
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:43.770
<v Speaker 3>My eye real annoying.</v>

3450
01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Lower back problems for like about a year and a half and it's made that much,</v>

3451
01:40:46.921 --> 01:40:47.754
<v Speaker 3>much better.</v>

3452
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:48.660
<v Speaker 3>I bet it would.</v>

3453
01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:50.940
<v Speaker 3>My data would strengthen your entire core.</v>

3454
01:40:50.941 --> 01:40:52.590
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you machine after we get out of here.</v>

3455
01:40:52.590 --> 01:40:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I've got a thing in the back for lower backs.</v>

3456
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:56.170
<v Speaker 3>It's called a reverse hyper.</v>

3457
01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 3>It was made by this Guy Louie Simmons,</v>

3458
01:40:58.301 --> 01:41:02.050
<v Speaker 3>who's a world famous power lifter guru from Columbus,</v>

3459
01:41:02.051 --> 01:41:05.340
<v Speaker 3>Ohio and from west side barbell and westside.</v>

3460
01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Barbells is a organization that he came up with this machine that it works like</v>

3461
01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:13.180
<v Speaker 3>sort of like what your legs are hanging like.</v>

3462
01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.320
<v Speaker 3>You lean your upper body over like a table and your legs are dangling from the</v>

3463
01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:20.950
<v Speaker 3>waist down there dangling and they hook up to these rollers like a leg curl</v>

3464
01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:23.080
<v Speaker 3>machine sort of end with a straight leg.</v>

3465
01:41:23.081 --> 01:41:26.440
<v Speaker 3>You lift your leg all the way up and then you let it go down and as it's going</v>

3466
01:41:26.441 --> 01:41:27.340
<v Speaker 3>down it,</v>

3467
01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:30.010
<v Speaker 3>it pulls on your lower back.</v>

3468
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like an active decompression,</v>

3469
01:41:32.890 --> 01:41:33.860
<v Speaker 3>so you lifted up.</v>

3470
01:41:33.861 --> 01:41:34.601
<v Speaker 3>It's strengthens.</v>

3471
01:41:34.601 --> 01:41:35.620
<v Speaker 3>He lifted down,</v>

3472
01:41:35.650 --> 01:41:37.510
<v Speaker 3>it decompresses lifted up its strength.</v>

3473
01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.040
<v Speaker 3>If you want to look at it folks,</v>

3474
01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:40.300
<v Speaker 3>it's called reverse hyper.</v>

3475
01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.530
<v Speaker 3>You can get it online.</v>

3476
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:44.200
<v Speaker 3>I bought mine from a company called rogue fitness.</v>

3477
01:41:44.690 --> 01:41:46.570
<v Speaker 3>This is all the crossfit stuff.</v>

3478
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.440
<v Speaker 3>They have all that cool shit,</v>

3479
01:41:47.441 --> 01:41:51.280
<v Speaker 3>but I'm telling you this reverse hyper has been amazing for my back.</v>

3480
01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:52.300
<v Speaker 3>It's so good.</v>

3481
01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever done.</v>

3482
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:56.290
<v Speaker 3>I was at my apartment in New York is too small to store one,</v>

3483
01:41:56.291 --> 01:41:59.710
<v Speaker 3>but I want to get an inversion table so have to back there.</v>

3484
01:42:00.210 --> 01:42:01.960
<v Speaker 3>One that you do from the waist down.</v>

3485
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:04.420
<v Speaker 3>You like lean forward on and I'll show you both of them after.</v>

3486
01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:05.733
<v Speaker 3>I'm so curious.</v>

3487
01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Hang upside down like a bad every day.</v>

3488
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:08.091
<v Speaker 3>I do it every,</v>

3489
01:42:08.091 --> 01:42:08.441
<v Speaker 3>every day,</v>

3490
01:42:08.441 --> 01:42:08.921
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>

3491
01:42:08.921 --> 01:42:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I do it every day for five minutes every day.</v>

3492
01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Every day.</v>

3493
01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Every time I work out,</v>

3494
01:42:12.401 --> 01:42:13.300
<v Speaker 3>every time I lift weights,</v>

3495
01:42:13.301 --> 01:42:14.830
<v Speaker 3>especially if I lift anything heavy,</v>

3496
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.740
<v Speaker 3>like if I do squats or anything like that in of when you do it,</v>

3497
01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.690
<v Speaker 3>do it right after I'm done and I do it for as long as I can until I feel</v>

3498
01:42:22.691 --> 01:42:23.380
<v Speaker 3>relaxed.</v>

3499
01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:26.740
<v Speaker 3>I just want my back to open up because everything you feel that happened to you</v>

3500
01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:28.790
<v Speaker 3>actually feel it like it a little ways at all.</v>

3501
01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.390
<v Speaker 3>If you actually feel you pulled out that noise,</v>

3502
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:31.920
<v Speaker 3>see this,</v>

3503
01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.770
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're hoping for.</v>

3504
01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're hoping for?</v>

3505
01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:36.371
<v Speaker 3>A magic cure,</v>

3506
01:42:36.371 --> 01:42:37.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

3507
01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:37.950
<v Speaker 3>That's not really.</v>

3508
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:38.470
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>

3509
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's really happening there.</v>

3510
01:42:39.461 --> 01:42:40.840
<v Speaker 3>That's like nitrogen being released.</v>

3511
01:42:40.841 --> 01:42:42.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not really fixing anything.</v>

3512
01:42:42.610 --> 01:42:43.630
<v Speaker 3>It just sounds cool.</v>

3513
01:42:43.770 --> 01:42:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3514
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I love the sound like when I get go to the chiropractor and I get cracked,</v>

3515
01:42:47.351 --> 01:42:48.184
<v Speaker 3>I love the sound,</v>

3516
01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.350
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is that's not what's fixing anything.</v>

3517
01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:54.870
<v Speaker 3>What's fixing is the adjustment of the spine and what's fixing when you're.</v>

3518
01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:55.600
<v Speaker 3>When you're doing that,</v>

3519
01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.490
<v Speaker 3>that conversion table inversion table,</v>

3520
01:42:57.730 --> 01:43:01.990
<v Speaker 3>it's the decompression of your muscles like your muscles relaxing and stretching</v>

3521
01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:07.260
<v Speaker 3>be so you gotta be able to actually concentrate on relaxing your lower back and</v>

3522
01:43:07.541 --> 01:43:08.470
<v Speaker 3>most people can't.</v>

3523
01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:09.221
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>

3524
01:43:09.221 --> 01:43:12.410
<v Speaker 3>they tense up so even when they lie hanging by their ankles,</v>

3525
01:43:12.411 --> 01:43:12.621
<v Speaker 3>like so,</v>

3526
01:43:12.621 --> 01:43:16.810
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why some doctors erroneously think it's not effective,</v>

3527
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:17.321
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

3528
01:43:17.321 --> 01:43:17.591
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3529
01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:19.420
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to support it with your back anyway.</v>

3530
01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:21.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little,</v>

3531
01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:23.470
<v Speaker 3>but if you understand how your body works,</v>

3532
01:43:23.471 --> 01:43:28.471
<v Speaker 3>you can relax that area and I feel a great difference between holding it tents</v>

3533
01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.430
<v Speaker 3>and relaxing that there.</v>

3534
01:43:30.431 --> 01:43:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I feel the stress on that lower back area and it's lengthening the muscles.</v>

3535
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:38.920
<v Speaker 3>It's pulling them and stretching them in a way that it's very hard to stretch</v>

3536
01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:39.754
<v Speaker 3>those muscles.</v>

3537
01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:41.410
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to stretch them that way.</v>

3538
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:43.870
<v Speaker 3>You know like your body's malleable man,</v>

3539
01:43:43.871 --> 01:43:44.380
<v Speaker 3>like you can.</v>

3540
01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:45.730
<v Speaker 3>The reason why some people are super,</v>

3541
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:46.810
<v Speaker 3>super flexible.</v>

3542
01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.400
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of genetics involved there,</v>

3543
01:43:48.401 --> 01:43:52.170
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of it is just pushing just hard work and pushing on</v>

3544
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:55.100
<v Speaker 1>the flexibility just everyday making it move a little bit more,</v>

3545
01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:56.150
<v Speaker 1>move a little bit more.</v>

3546
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see a dude with crazy holes in their ear,</v>

3547
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:59.623
<v Speaker 1>that's like a.</v>

3548
01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:01.130
<v Speaker 1>You can do that shit to your body.</v>

3549
01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:02.270
<v Speaker 1>You can stretch things out.</v>

3550
01:44:02.271 --> 01:44:03.440
<v Speaker 1>You can put a plate in your lip,</v>

3551
01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

3552
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:05.330
<v Speaker 1>You can do that also,</v>

3553
01:44:05.331 --> 01:44:05.961
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

3554
01:44:05.961 --> 01:44:06.794
<v Speaker 1>Your neck,</v>

3555
01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:07.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3556
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:09.320
<v Speaker 1>you can lengthen your neck with those wires.</v>

3557
01:44:09.321 --> 01:44:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Those crazy ladies put on,</v>

3558
01:44:10.610 --> 01:44:13.730
<v Speaker 1>but you can also kind of stretch your body out that way too.</v>

3559
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.740
<v Speaker 1>There's soft tissue manipulation,</v>

3560
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:17.810
<v Speaker 1>so only certain amount you could get away with,</v>

3561
01:44:17.811 --> 01:44:18.800
<v Speaker 1>but you can,</v>

3562
01:44:18.801 --> 01:44:20.360
<v Speaker 1>if you push it hard enough,</v>

3563
01:44:20.361 --> 01:44:20.781
<v Speaker 1>long enough,</v>

3564
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:21.740
<v Speaker 1>you're really dedicated.</v>

3565
01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:25.460
<v Speaker 1>You can stretch a lot of shit and one of the problems that people have with</v>

3566
01:44:25.461 --> 01:44:28.070
<v Speaker 1>their lower backs especially is their hamstrings.</v>

3567
01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Like if your hamstrings are really tense,</v>

3568
01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.620
<v Speaker 1>that puts a tremendous amount of pressure on your lower back.</v>

3569
01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:35.210
<v Speaker 1>And it also limits your mobility.</v>

3570
01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.990
<v Speaker 1>It limits the way your body can move around and that also puts pressure on your</v>

3571
01:44:38.991 --> 01:44:39.824
<v Speaker 1>lower back.</v>

3572
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:41.200
<v Speaker 1>You stretch it all with your,</v>

3573
01:44:41.201 --> 01:44:42.034
<v Speaker 1>your hamstrings.</v>

3574
01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

3575
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3576
01:44:43.341 --> 01:44:43.671
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

3577
01:44:43.671 --> 01:44:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I've taken a lot more to stretching.</v>

3578
01:44:45.161 --> 01:44:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3579
01:44:45.570 --> 01:44:50.540
<v Speaker 1>I did crossfit for two years and I lost a bunch of weight during which there was</v>

3580
01:44:50.541 --> 01:44:51.560
<v Speaker 1>great in that regard.</v>

3581
01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:53.083
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3582
01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:54.003
<v Speaker 1>the damage,</v>

3583
01:44:54.010 --> 01:44:54.651
<v Speaker 1>like speed,</v>

3584
01:44:54.651 --> 01:44:56.330
<v Speaker 1>power lifting is not a good idea.</v>

3585
01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up your back.</v>

3586
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:58.041
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

3587
01:44:58.041 --> 01:44:58.311
<v Speaker 1>Did it.</v>

3588
01:44:58.311 --> 01:44:58.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3589
01:44:58.611 --> 01:44:59.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean just like,</v>

3590
01:44:59.151 --> 01:44:59.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3591
01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you would be one of them swinging kettle bells sometimes,</v>

3592
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.790
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

3593
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:03.201
<v Speaker 1>not even that.</v>

3594
01:45:03.201 --> 01:45:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think kettle bells were much of the things I,</v>

3595
01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:09.420
<v Speaker 1>for some reason I was kind of able to focus like my stance on kettlebells</v>

3596
01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:11.120
<v Speaker 1>because it was never that heavy,</v>

3597
01:45:11.121 --> 01:45:12.040
<v Speaker 1>but things where they,</v>

3598
01:45:12.170 --> 01:45:12.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3599
01:45:12.321 --> 01:45:13.154
<v Speaker 1>they want you to do like,</v>

3600
01:45:14.230 --> 01:45:14.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3601
01:45:14.530 --> 01:45:19.530
<v Speaker 1>like cleans or like a snatch and then they show you the form for 20 minutes and</v>

3602
01:45:20.421 --> 01:45:22.730
<v Speaker 1>then they go now as fast as you can for eight minutes,</v>

3603
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:22.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3604
01:45:22.990 --> 01:45:25.810
<v Speaker 1>and the best guys done this and you don't want to be a loser like that guy.</v>

3605
01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:26.653
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3606
01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:27.640
<v Speaker 1>be as good as this,</v>

3607
01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:27.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3608
01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:29.000
<v Speaker 1>try to do it fast.</v>

3609
01:45:29.001 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 1>And how many people drop those weights and sacrificed?</v>

3610
01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:34.520
<v Speaker 1>How many people do you see drop weights in their head.</v>

3611
01:45:35.150 --> 01:45:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I actually know all the injuries that.</v>

3612
01:45:36.561 --> 01:45:39.110
<v Speaker 1>So people missing box jumps let's people get hurt with the.</v>

3613
01:45:39.111 --> 01:45:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Most of their shins get busted up on those.</v>

3614
01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3615
01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:43.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3616
01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:46.010
<v Speaker 1>that's the probably the easiest to fix.</v>

3617
01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Assist to cut in a bruise.</v>

3618
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:49.400
<v Speaker 1>The real hard stuff to fix it.</v>

3619
01:45:49.401 --> 01:45:50.180
<v Speaker 1>The back stuff,</v>

3620
01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:55.180
<v Speaker 1>you know when you start doing power lifting in like large repetition movements,</v>

3621
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.450
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>

3622
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:57.680
<v Speaker 1>fast impresses.</v>

3623
01:45:57.710 --> 01:45:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3624
01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:58.760
<v Speaker 1>you lose,</v>

3625
01:45:58.760 --> 01:45:59.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3626
01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.890
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing with power lifting,</v>

3627
01:46:00.891 --> 01:46:02.860
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing is proper form.</v>

3628
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:07.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the most important thing by far and you should never abandoned that ever.</v>

3629
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:09.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that people criticized.</v>

3630
01:46:09.971 --> 01:46:10.611
<v Speaker 1>Crossfit for.</v>

3631
01:46:10.611 --> 01:46:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Steve Maxwell,</v>

3632
01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:13.040
<v Speaker 1>who's a good friend of mine,</v>

3633
01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:14.300
<v Speaker 1>who's a fantastic trainer,</v>

3634
01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:17.420
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the most knowledgeable people I've ever met when it comes to</v>

3635
01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.860
<v Speaker 1>like fitness training,</v>

3636
01:46:19.210 --> 01:46:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it's always on top of the latest modalities,</v>

3637
01:46:21.741 --> 01:46:23.570
<v Speaker 1>different techniques and stuff like that.</v>

3638
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:24.403
<v Speaker 1>He hates it.</v>

3639
01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.810
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that I can see.</v>

3640
01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:27.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3641
01:46:27.110 --> 01:46:27.943
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3642
01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:28.761
<v Speaker 1>I give it.</v>

3643
01:46:28.761 --> 01:46:32.100
<v Speaker 1>It's due because like with the right now,</v>

3644
01:46:32.101 --> 01:46:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I die it much harder and I do more yoga than I would say I do like,</v>

3645
01:46:36.921 --> 01:46:37.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3646
01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:38.000
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight training.</v>

3647
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I try to do more stuff like that,</v>

3648
01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:39.741
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

3649
01:46:39.741 --> 01:46:40.820
<v Speaker 1>like cardio and stuff.</v>

3650
01:46:40.821 --> 01:46:41.654
<v Speaker 1>I definitely,</v>

3651
01:46:42.110 --> 01:46:42.441
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3652
01:46:42.441 --> 01:46:43.310
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

3653
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:44.241
<v Speaker 1>Watch the video though.</v>

3654
01:46:44.241 --> 01:46:45.070
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

3655
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.641
<v Speaker 1>Watch him,</v>

3656
01:46:45.641 --> 01:46:47.630
<v Speaker 1>watch him work out on the beach because it's fucking ridiculous.</v>

3657
01:46:47.631 --> 01:46:48.770
<v Speaker 1>He just pistol squats.</v>

3658
01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:50.580
<v Speaker 1>This is all different things that he's doing,</v>

3659
01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:52.400
<v Speaker 1>but you got to see the um,</v>

3660
01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.420
<v Speaker 1>the gymnastics in Santa Monica.</v>

3661
01:46:54.421 --> 01:46:55.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally different video,</v>

3662
01:46:55.571 --> 01:46:57.480
<v Speaker 1>just like channing tatum and foxcatcher</v>

3663
01:46:59.360 --> 01:46:59.700
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

3664
01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:00.533
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

3665
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:01.890
<v Speaker 1>this is from choke.</v>

3666
01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.970
<v Speaker 1>This is a different one.</v>

3667
01:47:02.971 --> 01:47:03.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3668
01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:04.350
<v Speaker 1>it's different footage.</v>

3669
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3670
01:47:05.370 --> 01:47:05.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3671
01:47:05.650 --> 01:47:08.210
<v Speaker 1>it's him on the balance bar in Santa Monica beach.</v>

3672
01:47:08.211 --> 01:47:09.240
<v Speaker 1>He's doing that kind of shit,</v>

3673
01:47:09.241 --> 01:47:11.160
<v Speaker 1>but he's doing it while he's walking on a balance bar.</v>

3674
01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.190
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

3675
01:47:12.190 --> 01:47:13.140
<v Speaker 1>But also those,</v>

3676
01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 1>those kind of like applied</v>

3677
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:16.790
<v Speaker 1>like muscle skills or greg,</v>

3678
01:47:17.110 --> 01:47:18.650
<v Speaker 1>like American Ninja Warrior.</v>

3679
01:47:18.651 --> 01:47:20.890
<v Speaker 1>That's such a cool show or the original.</v>

3680
01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't think any units need like this stuff,</v>

3681
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:25.930
<v Speaker 1>like mixing Gracie to American warriors.</v>

3682
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

3683
01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Such a cool show.</v>

3684
01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:28.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3685
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:30.640
<v Speaker 1>not just the idea that you could like,</v>

3686
01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:34.310
<v Speaker 1>like the concept of hanging off the side of a building terrifies me because</v>

3687
01:47:34.311 --> 01:47:39.020
<v Speaker 1>there's no chance I'll pull myself up if I catch a ledge by my fingertips and</v>

3688
01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:39.320
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

3689
01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:44.320
<v Speaker 1>those guys can send on their fingertips is fucking bonkers.</v>

3690
01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Those free climbers are fucking spooky that those guys are doing.</v>

3691
01:47:48.531 --> 01:47:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Like that dude we had on Alex Honnold,</v>

3692
01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:53.690
<v Speaker 1>the guy who goes up the side of mountains backwards.</v>

3693
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:55.280
<v Speaker 1>That guy's insane.</v>

3694
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:56.143
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen me?</v>

3695
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:57.223
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever</v>

3696
01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:01.430
<v Speaker 1>park horror to good way to break your neck?</v>

3697
01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the Russian guys that go on the crane and just do like chiclets</v>

3698
01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:05.780
<v Speaker 1>we played every one of those.</v>

3699
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:07.760
<v Speaker 1>It makes my legs quiver.</v>

3700
01:48:07.761 --> 01:48:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Watching the videos.</v>

3701
01:48:08.751 --> 01:48:08.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3702
01:48:08.871 --> 01:48:09.704
<v Speaker 1>My feet go numb.</v>

3703
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't even imagine trying to do that whole body starts shaking because I'm</v>

3704
01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:17.820
<v Speaker 1>watching them says video the other day of this guy that goes out on this ledge</v>

3705
01:48:17.821 --> 01:48:18.600
<v Speaker 1>of this hotel,</v>

3706
01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:23.600
<v Speaker 1>like super high up and he just starts jumping from one like patio,</v>

3707
01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:26.030
<v Speaker 1>like had that like this little part on it.</v>

3708
01:48:26.031 --> 01:48:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Just from one to another.</v>

3709
01:48:27.150 --> 01:48:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Talking about that new cell phone video.</v>

3710
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>

3711
01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:29.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3712
01:48:29.811 --> 01:48:33.890
<v Speaker 1>it's for the Samsung Galaxy is the galaxy note or galaxy s six.</v>

3713
01:48:33.930 --> 01:48:38.540
<v Speaker 1>That was a Neil Brennan doing the jump into fucking park cooler master.</v>

3714
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:39.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3715
01:48:39.021 --> 01:48:42.980
<v Speaker 1>The guy like he straps the video camera eight straps the camera on him and then</v>

3716
01:48:42.981 --> 01:48:45.800
<v Speaker 1>turns the video on and then jumps from building to building.</v>

3717
01:48:45.801 --> 01:48:46.700
<v Speaker 1>But it might be bullshit.</v>

3718
01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.170
<v Speaker 1>It might be CGI and I'm not exactly sure because he's doing some fucking insane</v>

3719
01:48:51.171 --> 01:48:51.501
<v Speaker 1>jumps.</v>

3720
01:48:51.501 --> 01:48:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure if he's really doing those jobs right here.</v>

3721
01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:56.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

3722
01:48:56.901 --> 01:48:57.210
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

3723
01:48:57.210 --> 01:48:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Hide it.</v>

3724
01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:58.790
<v Speaker 1>That's never seen this.</v>

3725
01:48:59.120 --> 01:48:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this.</v>

3726
01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3727
01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:00.901
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3728
01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:02.720
<v Speaker 1>This is an edge camera video.</v>

3729
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Look at this fucking guy,</v>

3730
01:49:03.651 --> 01:49:04.484
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3731
01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:04.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3732
01:49:04.881 --> 01:49:05.714
<v Speaker 1>it seems real.</v>

3733
01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:08.090
<v Speaker 1>This is the one I'm talking about right here.</v>

3734
01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:08.953
<v Speaker 1>This</v>

3735
01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:16.480
<v Speaker 1>takes a photo of their food guys jumping off of buildings and shit taking photos</v>

3736
01:49:16.481 --> 01:49:17.200
<v Speaker 1>of food,</v>

3737
01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but would you jump?</v>

3738
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:21.680
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely jump,</v>

3739
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:22.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3740
01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:24.770
<v Speaker 1>four feet with a run.</v>

3741
01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.720
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely jump four feet without a doubt.</v>

3742
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:29.150
<v Speaker 1>You can do that so you can jump.</v>

3743
01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.510
<v Speaker 1>You can jump over a distance of four feet.</v>

3744
01:49:31.511 --> 01:49:31.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3745
01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:32.361
<v Speaker 1>for a fact.</v>

3746
01:49:32.361 --> 01:49:33.440
<v Speaker 1>You should absolutely do that.</v>

3747
01:49:34.190 --> 01:49:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't jump four feet from building the building by me.</v>

3748
01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:38.353
<v Speaker 1>I just got.</v>

3749
01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:38.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3750
01:49:38.841 --> 01:49:39.540
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a,</v>

3751
01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:40.281
<v Speaker 1>an amount of money.</v>

3752
01:49:40.281 --> 01:49:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I guess I will do that for I suppose,</v>

3753
01:49:42.141 --> 01:49:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but I mean like I would still be married.</v>

3754
01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I'd still be emotionally panicked,</v>

3755
01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:49.600
<v Speaker 1>like going to do it.</v>

3756
01:49:49.601 --> 01:49:50.321
<v Speaker 1>Even if I know,</v>

3757
01:49:50.321 --> 01:49:51.310
<v Speaker 1>even though I know I can jump</v>

3758
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:53.830
<v Speaker 1>significantly further,</v>

3759
01:49:53.831 --> 01:49:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm checking my feet.</v>

3760
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.690
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

3761
01:49:55.690 --> 01:49:57.400
<v Speaker 1>how many feet wide do you think this table is?</v>

3762
01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:58.393
<v Speaker 1>It's three.</v>

3763
01:49:58.510 --> 01:49:58.871
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

3764
01:49:58.871 --> 01:50:00.890
<v Speaker 1>This is not more than three.</v>

3765
01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:02.350
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

3766
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Four feet wide?</v>

3767
01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:03.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3768
01:50:03.971 --> 01:50:04.211
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3769
01:50:04.211 --> 01:50:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I could definitely jump over that with avant and everything like that.</v>

3770
01:50:07.110 --> 01:50:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3771
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Even just standing broad jump.</v>

3772
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Definitely jump over that.</v>

3773
01:50:10.151 --> 01:50:13.700
<v Speaker 1>But if below was like hundred store.</v>

3774
01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3775
01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:15.053
<v Speaker 1>that's what I mean.</v>

3776
01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:16.570
<v Speaker 1>My hands are sweating dude.</v>

3777
01:50:16.571 --> 01:50:21.571
<v Speaker 1>I just said that my hands started sweating because then I'd have to assume it's</v>

3778
01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:22.770
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

3779
01:50:22.770 --> 01:50:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I have to assume is that Brian's video will make you faint and I gave it to</v>

3780
01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

3781
01:50:28.570 --> 01:50:28.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3782
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:29.920
<v Speaker 1>but this is the one I'm talking about.</v>

3783
01:50:29.921 --> 01:50:30.731
<v Speaker 1>Look how high that is.</v>

3784
01:50:30.731 --> 01:50:35.170
<v Speaker 1>And he just starts jumping from one corner to one coronary and at the end he has</v>

3785
01:50:35.171 --> 01:50:36.610
<v Speaker 1>to stop at.</v>

3786
01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you have that?</v>

3787
01:50:37.710 --> 01:50:38.281
<v Speaker 1>But you could,</v>

3788
01:50:38.281 --> 01:50:38.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3789
01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3790
01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:40.900
<v Speaker 1>have you ever in your.</v>

3791
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I guess probably if you go on really hard,</v>

3792
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:45.040
<v Speaker 1>but if you've fallen off of a chin up bar ever know,</v>

3793
01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.920
<v Speaker 1>but you still would not want to like take that.</v>

3794
01:50:47.921 --> 01:50:48.430
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

3795
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:49.241
<v Speaker 1>you're confident in your,</v>

3796
01:50:49.241 --> 01:50:49.571
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

3797
01:50:49.571 --> 01:50:50.410
<v Speaker 1>in your pull ups.</v>

3798
01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And you wouldn't want to do it over those.</v>

3799
01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Just land on your feet.</v>

3800
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.391
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

3801
01:50:55.391 --> 01:50:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Check this.</v>

3802
01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3803
01:50:56.801 --> 01:50:57.011
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3804
01:50:57.011 --> 01:50:57.990
<v Speaker 1>he's not doing this.</v>

3805
01:50:58.490 --> 01:50:59.323
<v Speaker 1>What is he doing?</v>

3806
01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:00.753
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3807
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:03.400
<v Speaker 1>this is fucked up.</v>

3808
01:51:06.250 --> 01:51:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3809
01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3810
01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

3811
01:51:14.630 --> 01:51:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3812
01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:16.120
<v Speaker 1>they're dripping.</v>

3813
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:17.680
<v Speaker 1>My hands are dripping.</v>

3814
01:51:18.490 --> 01:51:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Feel my hands.</v>

3815
01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:21.220
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking soaking wet right now.</v>

3816
01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:22.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a real anxiety.</v>

3817
01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:24.130
<v Speaker 1>But it says for a guy you don't know where anything was.</v>

3818
01:51:24.131 --> 01:51:26.770
<v Speaker 1>The fact that that guy's out of his mind.</v>

3819
01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:27.873
<v Speaker 1>The fuck is he?</v>

3820
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:33.780
<v Speaker 1>How much would someone have to pay you to do this?</v>

3821
01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

3822
01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:34.601
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

3823
01:51:34.601 --> 01:51:35.080
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3824
01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I would faint.</v>

3825
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:36.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3826
01:51:36.431 --> 01:51:36.641
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

3827
01:51:36.641 --> 01:51:38.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no amount of money for that.</v>

3828
01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:39.473
<v Speaker 1>I would suck Dick.</v>

3829
01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have that much faith in my coordination.</v>

3830
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Which sect?</v>

3831
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.960
<v Speaker 1>X before doing that?</v>

3832
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:44.651
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

3833
01:51:44.651 --> 01:51:44.921
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3834
01:51:44.921 --> 01:51:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3835
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.230
<v Speaker 1>How many dicks have as many as they want?</v>

3836
01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:48.753
<v Speaker 1>You know</v>

3837
01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:50.813
<v Speaker 1>you can't die.</v>

3838
01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:51.680
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to.</v>

3839
01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.100
<v Speaker 1>You would know halfway through the deck.</v>

3840
01:51:53.101 --> 01:51:54.160
<v Speaker 1>This deck is spoiled,</v>

3841
01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:55.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3842
01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.633
<v Speaker 1>Sir?</v>

3843
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you have on?</v>

3844
01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Because I am not going to get tricky gnosis from your dicks or a gun.</v>

3845
01:52:05.230 --> 01:52:06.280
<v Speaker 1>There is nuts for a stamp.</v>

3846
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:10.020
<v Speaker 1>The date stamp fucking Gardia from your,</v>

3847
01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:12.130
<v Speaker 1>your your Dick Dying.</v>

3848
01:52:12.730 --> 01:52:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Transgenders that have fake pussy.</v>

3849
01:52:14.241 --> 01:52:14.501
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3850
01:52:14.501 --> 01:52:17.440
<v Speaker 1>if they feel like they can't get a period that they're like,</v>

3851
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3852
01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:20.270
<v Speaker 1>only if I could get it to do something else.</v>

3853
01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:20.651
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3854
01:52:20.651 --> 01:52:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm super thrilled with it.</v>

3855
01:52:21.641 --> 01:52:26.641
<v Speaker 1>And also there's that weird thing is because it does it being made where the Deq</v>

3856
01:52:27.191 --> 01:52:27.521
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

3857
01:52:27.521 --> 01:52:27.871
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

3858
01:52:27.871 --> 01:52:32.050
<v Speaker 1>it's also an oddly placed vagina usually also it's kind of like high up.</v>

3859
01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It's where the decal seen one in real life.</v>

3860
01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they'd put just chip packets in there and they squeezed us to make</v>

3861
01:52:38.201 --> 01:52:38.860
<v Speaker 1>it feel like,</v>

3862
01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:39.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3863
01:52:39.071 --> 01:52:42.160
<v Speaker 1>like I think they probably pretend here's Hickson crazy.</v>

3864
01:52:42.161 --> 01:52:44.410
<v Speaker 1>As crazy as that sounds crazy that sounds.</v>

3865
01:52:44.590 --> 01:52:44.921
<v Speaker 1>Do that.</v>

3866
01:52:44.921 --> 01:52:45.754
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like</v>

3867
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:46.641
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>

3868
01:52:46.641 --> 01:52:47.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3869
01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:48.320
<v Speaker 1>girls who want to become men.</v>

3870
01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Wear a fucking fake Dick all day.</v>

3871
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3872
01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Look at this difference.</v>

3873
01:52:51.170 --> 01:52:51.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3874
01:52:51.381 --> 01:52:52.214
<v Speaker 1>that is true.</v>

3875
01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:53.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of girls who do do that.</v>

3876
01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe putting some may want to put</v>

3877
01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:58.910
<v Speaker 1>exploding blood packs and the vagina.</v>

3878
01:53:00.250 --> 01:53:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Those things thinking she wanted to be a vampire or when you were a kid,</v>

3879
01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:03.920
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking balance.</v>

3880
01:53:03.921 --> 01:53:04.610
<v Speaker 1>This guy has.</v>

3881
01:53:04.610 --> 01:53:06.020
<v Speaker 1>He just sat down on it.</v>

3882
01:53:06.050 --> 01:53:07.920
<v Speaker 1>He's putting his foot down and then watch.</v>

3883
01:53:07.921 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 1>He's going to stand up for working for it though too.</v>

3884
01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:11.510
<v Speaker 1>He's not watch this,</v>

3885
01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:14.480
<v Speaker 1>but he's because he's standing up on one day from his ass down.</v>

3886
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd also like a rounded pole.</v>

3887
01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Looks like.</v>

3888
01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:16.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3889
01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:17.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3890
01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:18.050
<v Speaker 1>That's flat on top.</v>

3891
01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Like balls.</v>

3892
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Doe.</v>

3893
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Now Watch how he does this though.</v>

3894
01:53:20.681 --> 01:53:21.514
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>

3895
01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:23.773
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3896
01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.180
<v Speaker 1>He stands up and then once he gets all the way to the top,</v>

3897
01:53:26.210 --> 01:53:27.043
<v Speaker 1>then he doesn't split.</v>

3898
01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:28.013
<v Speaker 1>He grabs his foot.</v>

3899
01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:29.293
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3900
01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:31.550
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking balance is amazing</v>

3901
01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:34.010
<v Speaker 1>and that was why one of the.</v>

3902
01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.110
<v Speaker 1>You mean one of the reasons why he was so good,</v>

3903
01:53:36.111 --> 01:53:37.520
<v Speaker 1>like he had a combination of everything.</v>

3904
01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:38.341
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3905
01:53:38.341 --> 01:53:38.840
<v Speaker 1>get that.</v>

3906
01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of here,</v>

3907
01:53:39.741 --> 01:53:40.574
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3908
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:42.050
<v Speaker 1>That dude's doing a split.</v>

3909
01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:42.913
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shit.</v>

3910
01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Standing on a balance beam.</v>

3911
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:45.663
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3912
01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Speaker 1>that's like the ultimate control of your body right there.</v>

3913
01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:49.670
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that,</v>

3914
01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:50.870
<v Speaker 1>you could basically do anything.</v>

3915
01:53:51.650 --> 01:53:55.780
<v Speaker 1>He's the greatest Jujitsu fighter of all time to like widely recognized by</v>

3916
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:57.490
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody ever as being a great,</v>

3917
01:53:57.491 --> 01:53:58.270
<v Speaker 1>greatest gracie.</v>

3918
01:53:58.270 --> 01:54:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a coincidence that it's also he can do ridiculous things with</v>

3919
01:54:02.361 --> 01:54:03.340
<v Speaker 1>his body that like,</v>

3920
01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I bet Lebron James can't do that.</v>

3921
01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I bet coby Brian can't do that,</v>

3922
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3923
01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:08.690
<v Speaker 1>but what he can do,</v>

3924
01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:09.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a very unusual.</v>

3925
01:54:09.891 --> 01:54:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't bet a GSP could probably do that.</v>

3926
01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I think things similar to close.</v>

3927
01:54:16.010 --> 01:54:16.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3928
01:54:16.251 --> 01:54:17.750
<v Speaker 1>George is a pretty amazing athlete.</v>

3929
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:22.040
<v Speaker 1>He jumps up on those little messages in between them and used.</v>

3930
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.870
<v Speaker 1>It goes up and down.</v>

3931
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3932
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.923
<v Speaker 1>that's like.</v>

3933
01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3934
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Well he also,</v>

3935
01:54:25.130 --> 01:54:26.360
<v Speaker 1>he's very flexible too.</v>

3936
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:27.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a big flexibility move.</v>

3937
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:30.290
<v Speaker 1>You have to be really flexible just to be able to hold your leg up there like</v>

3938
01:54:30.291 --> 01:54:30.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3939
01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:31.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3940
01:54:31.221 --> 01:54:32.390
<v Speaker 1>George is pretty flexible.</v>

3941
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the Pacquiao?</v>

3942
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:35.623
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather fight?</v>

3943
01:54:35.650 --> 01:54:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3944
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3945
01:54:37.190 --> 01:54:38.023
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think?</v>

3946
01:54:38.370 --> 01:54:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>

3947
01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:41.420
<v Speaker 1>it was just boring.</v>

3948
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I thought you said you liked it.</v>

3949
01:54:43.671 --> 01:54:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3950
01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:45.390
<v Speaker 1>But I think that uh,</v>

3951
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:46.610
<v Speaker 1>most people were disappointed,</v>

3952
01:54:46.611 --> 01:54:47.444
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3953
01:54:47.490 --> 01:54:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I just was bored.</v>

3954
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I just call.</v>

3955
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I called it very easily from the beginning.</v>

3956
01:54:52.041 --> 01:54:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I never believe I asked you if you're already talking.</v>

3957
01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:56.730
<v Speaker 5>I know it seems like that UFC has.</v>

3958
01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:00.000
<v Speaker 5>MMA is really spoiled boxing for me because I,</v>

3959
01:55:00.001 --> 01:55:00.660
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

3960
01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not like Mike Tyson days.</v>

3961
01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:04.240
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't exciting like that where you know,</v>

3962
01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:05.360
<v Speaker 5>not going to be,</v>

3963
01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:07.740
<v Speaker 5>but that was the best at their best.</v>

3964
01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:10.470
<v Speaker 5>That's the best boxers right now.</v>

3965
01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:11.640
<v Speaker 5>And if that's your best,</v>

3966
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:12.301
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

3967
01:55:12.301 --> 01:55:13.740
<v Speaker 5>Why are we watching 100 bucks?</v>

3968
01:55:13.741 --> 01:55:15.420
<v Speaker 5>That's twice as much as UFC.</v>

3969
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:17.450
<v Speaker 5>The UFC $60.</v>

3970
01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:17.970
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3971
01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:19.180
<v Speaker 5>Let's still deaf.</v>

3972
01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:20.520
<v Speaker 5>It's a million fights.</v>

3973
01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:22.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3974
01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:23.040
<v Speaker 5>tons of.</v>

3975
01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:23.671
<v Speaker 5>Over the course of the night,</v>

3976
01:55:23.671 --> 01:55:24.790
<v Speaker 5>you get free fights,</v>

3977
01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:26.281
<v Speaker 5>but don't you think?</v>

3978
01:55:26.281 --> 01:55:27.000
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody says,</v>

3979
01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:27.451
<v Speaker 5>fuck this.</v>

3980
01:55:27.451 --> 01:55:28.530
<v Speaker 5>I never watched boxing again.</v>

3981
01:55:28.590 --> 01:55:29.640
<v Speaker 5>I think that's bullshit.</v>

3982
01:55:29.641 --> 01:55:31.080
<v Speaker 5>I think they will still watch it,</v>

3983
01:55:31.081 --> 01:55:32.700
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not going to pay 100 bucks ever,</v>

3984
01:55:32.730 --> 01:55:34.150
<v Speaker 5>but who's going to be a real?</v>

3985
01:55:34.650 --> 01:55:35.071
<v Speaker 5>Who's gonna?</v>

<v Speaker 5>like a Tyson.</v>

3989
01:55:38.941 --> 01:55:39.421
<v Speaker 5>That's what you need.</v>

3990
01:55:39.421 --> 01:55:41.990
<v Speaker 5>You need somebody with that kind of vicious knockout,</v>

3991
01:55:41.991 --> 01:55:43.590
<v Speaker 5>so you need to bring excitement to it.</v>

3992
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:44.130

01:58:44.711 --> 01:58:46.030
<v Speaker 1>And like not crazy long after that.</v>

4106
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:47.420
<v Speaker 1>He died in a motorcycle accident.</v>

4107
01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:48.543

4114
01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:58.930
<v Speaker 1>I was just starting my charity work.</v>

4147
01:59:57.190 --> 01:59:57.460

4148
01:59:57.460 --> 02:00:00.080
<v Speaker 1>most of the shit they're saying they just did not see it.</v>

4149
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you try to not leave town or,</v>

4150
02:00:02.621 --> 02:00:03.350
<v Speaker 1>or hang up on it?</v>

4151
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.441
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4152
02:00:03.441 --> 02:00:04.031
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

4154
02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I think any girlfriend I've ever had or if it's like,</v>

4155
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>let's not let me not leave town.</v>

4156
02:00:10.331 --> 02:00:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Getting on a plane while we're in a fight.</v>

4157
02:00:12.221 --> 02:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Like I've thrown that all away.</v>

4158
02:00:13.810 --> 02:00:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I will absolutely get on a plane.</v>

4159
02:00:15.310 --> 02:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>And then while I'm on the plane,</v>

4160
02:00:16.151 --> 02:00:16.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4161
02:00:16.301 --> 02:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>if this plane goes down,</v>

4162
02:00:17.171 --> 02:00:19.480
<v Speaker 1>let's get a fucking ruin the rest of her life.</v>

4163
02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:20.613
<v Speaker 1>Fuck her.</v>

4164
02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.360
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

4165
02:00:22.930 --> 02:00:24.760
<v Speaker 1>So this Baltimore thing,</v>

4166
02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:26.080
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>

4167
02:00:26.081 --> 02:00:26.914
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4168
02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:28.930
<v Speaker 1>what did they do to this guy?</v>

4169
02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a catalyst.</v>

4170
02:00:30.551 --> 02:00:31.480
<v Speaker 1>You mean like the world was a,</v>

4171
02:00:31.690 --> 02:00:32.011
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4172
02:00:32.011 --> 02:00:33.610
<v Speaker 1>he died in a police van,</v>

4173
02:00:33.611 --> 02:00:34.444
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4174
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>They injured his,</v>

4175
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>they hurt his back,</v>

4176
02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:40.180
<v Speaker 1>his neck and spinal cord failure,</v>

4177
02:00:40.181 --> 02:00:40.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4178
02:00:40.690 --> 02:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4179
02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but I had read from a very</v>

4180
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>non credible source that he was already injured.</v>

4181
02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:52.083
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

4182
02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

4183
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>So he died from an injury he sustained in.</v>

4184
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>So all the stuff that everybody has said about it being all the fake rumors,</v>

4185
02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:02.140
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers with their fake stories.</v>

4186
02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous.</v>

4187
02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:07.300
<v Speaker 1>My broken heart of that was hearing other guys that were in the,</v>

4188
02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>in the van to like the other criminals or you know,</v>

4189
02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>alleged criminals that were in the van with them,</v>

4190
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:15.880
<v Speaker 1>like giving their account of it was always great because it goes,</v>

4191
02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>it was welcome him and hurt him himself</v>

4192
02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>was of course the cups did.</v>

4193
02:01:23.501 --> 02:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>He can't hurt himself like that.</v>

4194
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4195
02:01:26.290 --> 02:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>That's not the guy you want to kill himself.</v>

4196
02:01:29.650 --> 02:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>NBC News Dot Com says disputed report and then Freddie Gray hurt himself in</v>

4197
02:01:35.861 --> 02:01:36.671
<v Speaker 1>police van.</v>

4198
02:01:36.671 --> 02:01:37.504
<v Speaker 1>Question Mark.</v>

4199
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:39.440
<v Speaker 1>That is not journalism.</v>

4200
02:01:39.710 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't</v>

4201
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:41.053
<v Speaker 3>be able to do that.</v>

4202
02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:46.100
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be able to say disputed report and then the title,</v>

4203
02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Freddie Gray hurt himself in police van.</v>

4204
02:01:49.131 --> 02:01:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Question Mark,</v>

4207
02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:55.820
<v Speaker 3>He tried to get clicks before you've done the work.</v>

4208
02:01:55.821 --> 02:01:56.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't know if that story.</v>

4209
02:01:56.901 --> 02:01:57.734
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

4210
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:58.760
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

4211
02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Like that sneaky shit for NBC News Dot Com.</v>

4212
02:02:02.331 --> 02:02:05.150
<v Speaker 3>That's really sneaky shit because that's not a story.</v>

4213
02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:06.290
<v Speaker 3>You know what that is.</v>

4214
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:08.870
<v Speaker 3>This disputed report on a new site.</v>

4215
02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:10.760
<v Speaker 3>How about you do some fucking journalism.</v>

4216
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:13.100
<v Speaker 3>How about you follow up and get an actual report?</v>

4217
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:13.820
<v Speaker 3>How will your.</v>

4218
02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:16.100
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is if you say something like that,</v>

4219
02:02:16.101 --> 02:02:19.070
<v Speaker 3>people like me just read the headline and start repeating it.</v>

4220
02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:19.801
<v Speaker 3>I already,</v>

<v Speaker 3>The best guy hurt himself in the van.</v>

02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:07.040
<v Speaker 3>A 13 year old kid or it was 19 year old kid is crying for his mom armed crime</v>

4247
02:03:07.041 --> 02:03:08.840
<v Speaker 3>for his mommy before he fucking died.</v>

4248
02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:11.630
<v Speaker 3>The cops thought they thought he had a gun,</v>

4249
02:03:11.631 --> 02:03:13.280
<v Speaker 3>shot him through a fucking screen window.</v>

4250
02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Like there's som,</v>

4251
02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:14.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4252
02:03:14.871 --> 02:03:15.700
<v Speaker 3>you standing there,</v>

4253
02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:16.550
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna be on bang.</v>

4254
02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:17.593
<v Speaker 3>They just shoot them.</v>

4255
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:18.720
<v Speaker 3>It just wasn't doing anything.</v>

4256
02:03:18.721 --> 02:03:19.970
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't a criminal at all.</v>

4257
02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:24.830
<v Speaker 3>Total accidental death from some incompetent person that happened to be a police</v>

4258
02:03:24.831 --> 02:03:25.664
<v Speaker 3>officer.</v>

4259
02:03:25.670 --> 02:03:26.360
<v Speaker 3>And now this,</v>

4260
02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:26.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4261
02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:28.100
<v Speaker 3>well hideous can become police officers.</v>

4262
02:03:28.110 --> 02:03:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Suppose Got Duke Lacrosse thing is a good example because people still say use</v>

4263
02:03:31.831 --> 02:03:35.810
<v Speaker 3>that as an example of like a rapey situations like telling Duke Lacrosse team.</v>

4264
02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:36.820
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

4265
02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:37.380
<v Speaker 3>didn't happen.</v>

4266
02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:40.730
<v Speaker 3>And they're always kind of like things people still say that,</v>

4267
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:45.140
<v Speaker 3>well people are terrified of fraternities actually doing something like that.</v>

4268
02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:47.750
<v Speaker 3>So the Duke Lacrosse case is just one of those.</v>

4269
02:03:47.751 --> 02:03:48.920
<v Speaker 3>But like the Uva,</v>

4270
02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:52.220
<v Speaker 3>the University of Virginia thing that rolling stone printed this huge article</v>

4271
02:03:52.221 --> 02:03:53.510
<v Speaker 3>about never happened.</v>

4272
02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:55.400
<v Speaker 3>They just did shit journalism.</v>

4273
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:59.150
<v Speaker 3>They failed at every level when it comes to dirt and this goddamn rolling stone.</v>

4274
02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:03.200
<v Speaker 3>But because it's such a sensitive subject and people are really sensitive about</v>

4275
02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:08.080
<v Speaker 3>calling out someone that may have actually been a victim like being wrong and.</v>

4276
02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:08.391
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

4277
02:04:08.391 --> 02:04:08.571
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

4278
02:04:08.571 --> 02:04:08.871
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

4279
02:04:08.871 --> 02:04:11.840
<v Speaker 3>And saying you were in a victim and it turns out there were people are so</v>

4280
02:04:11.841 --> 02:04:15.260
<v Speaker 3>terrified of that that they actually skirt away from the real journalism,</v>

4281
02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:15.910
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4282
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:17.380
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's happened because you.</v>

4283
02:04:17.381 --> 02:04:17.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4284
02:04:17.511 --> 02:04:17.871
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

4285
02:04:17.871 --> 02:04:18.800
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to get like,</v>

4286
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:20.330
<v Speaker 3>you don't wanna get in trouble because if they're right.</v>

4287
02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4288
02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:21.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4289
02:04:21.381 --> 02:04:21.550
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

4290
02:04:21.550 --> 02:04:21.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4291
02:04:21.681 --> 02:04:23.870
<v Speaker 3>that thing that the Duke Lacrosse case,</v>

4292
02:04:23.871 --> 02:04:25.610
<v Speaker 3>that was one of Nancy graces pets,</v>

4293
02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:27.020
<v Speaker 3>those bars,</v>

4294
02:04:27.021 --> 02:04:27.501
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4295
02:04:27.501 --> 02:04:28.880
<v Speaker 3>That girl,</v>

4296
02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.030
<v Speaker 3>they tit,</v>

4297
02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:33.140
<v Speaker 3>that girl did terrible things.</v>

4298
02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4299
02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:34.880
<v Speaker 3>she never apologized to them.</v>

4300
02:04:34.881 --> 02:04:37.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean she was flat out accusing them of that on television.</v>

4301
02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:38.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4302
02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:39.220
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

4303
02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:40.470
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of the same thing.</v>

4304
02:04:40.471 --> 02:04:41.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not journalism.</v>

4305
02:04:41.611 --> 02:04:42.900
<v Speaker 3>A story's not done.</v>

4306
02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Did you don't know unless you were there,</v>

4307
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:48.240
<v Speaker 3>you got to fuck and get all your ducks in a row.</v>

4308
02:04:48.241 --> 02:04:48.901
<v Speaker 3>And even then,</v>

4309
02:04:48.901 --> 02:04:49.170
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4310
02:04:49.170 --> 02:04:50.160
<v Speaker 3>people lie.</v>

4311
02:04:50.370 --> 02:04:52.240
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird shit going on when,</v>

4312
02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:56.030
<v Speaker 3>whenever there's a story and then there's two different sides of that story.</v>

4313
02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:56.913
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

4314
02:04:56.970 --> 02:04:57.900
<v Speaker 3>this gets tricky.</v>

4315
02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Trying to figure out who's telling the truth and who's not telling the truth and</v>

4316
02:05:01.531 --> 02:05:03.450
<v Speaker 3>what is what like fuck man.</v>

4317
02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Just to like all the only witnesses were the or the groups that were there.</v>

4318
02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:10.860
<v Speaker 4>But those behind closed doors,</v>

4319
02:05:10.861 --> 02:05:12.590
<v Speaker 4>accusations are fucking meth.</v>

4320
02:05:12.670 --> 02:05:13.620
<v Speaker 4>That's so man.</v>

4321
02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:14.580
<v Speaker 4>Never want to be on those.</v>

4322
02:05:15.170 --> 02:05:15.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4323
02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:16.420
<v Speaker 3>no shit.</v>

4324
02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:16.991
<v Speaker 3>And it's also,</v>

4325
02:05:16.991 --> 02:05:21.610
<v Speaker 3>it's weird the difference in like the stories that catch,</v>

4326
02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:22.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4327
02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:26.500
<v Speaker 3>there's stories that catch fire and then everybody wants to walk in the street</v>

4328
02:05:26.501 --> 02:05:28.330
<v Speaker 3>and protest like this kid in La,</v>

4329
02:05:28.570 --> 02:05:31.390
<v Speaker 3>this is not catching fire for whatever reason,</v>

4330
02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:32.800
<v Speaker 3>you're barely hearing about this.</v>

4331
02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Baltimore's burning down.</v>

4332
02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Baltimore is burning down and the guy who was in police custody is an admitted</v>

4333
02:05:39.731 --> 02:05:40.270
<v Speaker 3>criminal,</v>

4334
02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:40.601
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4335
02:05:40.601 --> 02:05:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody's kind of admitting that this guy has done crimes before and this</v>

4336
02:05:44.321 --> 02:05:46.900
<v Speaker 3>is just simply a police brutality issue.</v>

4337
02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:51.310
<v Speaker 3>But this kid who got shot in La isn't even a criminal.</v>

4338
02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:52.420
<v Speaker 3>He's just a kid.</v>

4339
02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:55.420
<v Speaker 3>It was just a mistake like this is.</v>

4340
02:05:55.450 --> 02:05:59.200
<v Speaker 3>That's terrifying to me that just willing to shoot that 12 year old boy in</v>

4341
02:05:59.201 --> 02:06:00.034
<v Speaker 3>Cleveland,</v>

4342
02:06:00.070 --> 02:06:01.150
<v Speaker 3>the guy gets out of the car,</v>

4343
02:06:01.151 --> 02:06:03.280
<v Speaker 3>a cop who was taken off of a,</v>

4344
02:06:03.290 --> 02:06:07.600
<v Speaker 3>a different police squad because he was dangerous because they didn't.</v>

4345
02:06:07.630 --> 02:06:08.440
<v Speaker 3>They just like.</v>

4346
02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:08.741
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

4347
02:06:08.741 --> 02:06:09.850
<v Speaker 3>you gotta get the fuck out of here.</v>

4348
02:06:10.030 --> 02:06:12.820
<v Speaker 3>They kicked them off and another department hires this guy.</v>

4349
02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.040
<v Speaker 3>He gets out of a car in two seconds.</v>

4350
02:06:15.041 --> 02:06:17.290
<v Speaker 3>He's shooting at a 12 year old with a gun.</v>

4351
02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:21.310
<v Speaker 3>And not saying that being a cop isn't a fucking insanely difficult job.</v>

4352
02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:22.510
<v Speaker 3>And not saying that I,</v>

4353
02:06:22.511 --> 02:06:22.720
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4354
02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I've said many times I don't think anybody can do it right.</v>

4355
02:06:24.761 --> 02:06:27.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just way too much stress and way too much pressure.</v>

4356
02:06:27.790 --> 02:06:32.380
<v Speaker 3>But my point is how weird is it that some stories catch at some stories don't</v>

4357
02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:33.641
<v Speaker 3>like some stories.</v>

4358
02:06:33.641 --> 02:06:34.474
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

4359
02:06:34.630 --> 02:06:35.530
<v Speaker 3>they just slip right by.</v>

4360
02:06:35.531 --> 02:06:38.290
<v Speaker 3>You hear about the guy getting shot by the cops and there's no protests and</v>

4361
02:06:38.291 --> 02:06:38.950
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

4362
02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:40.280
<v Speaker 3>It just becomes another story.</v>

4363
02:06:40.281 --> 02:06:43.270
<v Speaker 3>It just becomes another statistic and then Freddie Gray boom,</v>

4364
02:06:43.271 --> 02:06:45.370
<v Speaker 3>or that kid in Ferguson,</v>

4365
02:06:45.490 --> 02:06:46.120
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

4366
02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Michael Brown,</v>

4367
02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:47.321
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

4368
02:06:47.321 --> 02:06:50.080
<v Speaker 3>It's just like catches and then the fucking protest.</v>

4369
02:06:50.081 --> 02:06:52.810
<v Speaker 3>It gets crazy and everybody just goes nuts over say cleveland.</v>

4370
02:06:52.811 --> 02:06:53.381
<v Speaker 3>So that kind of town.</v>

4371
02:06:53.381 --> 02:06:56.380
<v Speaker 3>But it is about the South Carolina one where the guy got shot.</v>

4372
02:06:56.740 --> 02:06:57.370
<v Speaker 3>They didn't burn.</v>

4373
02:06:57.370 --> 02:06:57.671
<v Speaker 3>They didn't.</v>

4374
02:06:57.671 --> 02:06:57.951
<v Speaker 3>Bri,</v>

4375
02:06:57.951 --> 02:06:59.410
<v Speaker 3>that guy got shot in the back.</v>

4376
02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

4377
02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:02.620
<v Speaker 3>that guy shot in the back and there's a fucking video of it,</v>

4378
02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:06.040
<v Speaker 3>but there's no crazy riots like there are in Baltimore.</v>

4379
02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:07.730
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

4380
02:07:07.730 --> 02:07:09.020
<v Speaker 4>it's mob mentality,</v>

4381
02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:09.290
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4382
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:14.290
<v Speaker 4>If he can get them off to to start like calming each other down like it spreads</v>

4383
02:07:15.081 --> 02:07:15.710
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>

4384
02:07:15.710 --> 02:07:16.071
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

4385
02:07:16.071 --> 02:07:17.600
<v Speaker 4>Like let's take this to the streets.</v>

4386
02:07:17.630 --> 02:07:18.450
<v Speaker 4>Peaceful pro.</v>

4387
02:07:18.450 --> 02:07:22.400
<v Speaker 4>But if like if the controlling interest of people start going out there and just</v>

4388
02:07:22.401 --> 02:07:24.380
<v Speaker 4>like kicking in cop car windows,</v>

4389
02:07:24.381 --> 02:07:25.370
<v Speaker 4>that's the way it's going to go.</v>

4390
02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:29.060
<v Speaker 4>I that found that like I don't think there's anything good about the method that</v>

4391
02:07:29.061 --> 02:07:29.960
<v Speaker 4>was terrifying.</v>

4392
02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.950
<v Speaker 4>Watching people like.</v>

4393
02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:31.853
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

4394
02:07:32.330 --> 02:07:34.480
<v Speaker 4>if this was so much wrapped around like we're,</v>

4395
02:07:34.610 --> 02:07:36.280
<v Speaker 4>we're writing because we're</v>

4396
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:36.821
<v Speaker 3>pissed off,</v>

4397
02:07:36.821 --> 02:07:37.810
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to take it anymore.</v>

4398
02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Like high five.</v>

4399
02:07:39.370 --> 02:07:40.600
<v Speaker 3>You see people laughing,</v>

4400
02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:44.590
<v Speaker 3>eating candy in the background while they're stomping on fucking cop cars.</v>

4401
02:07:44.591 --> 02:07:46.660
<v Speaker 3>And it's such like a.</v>

4402
02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:48.580
<v Speaker 3>It really is terrifying.</v>

4403
02:07:48.581 --> 02:07:49.260
<v Speaker 3>It's third world,</v>

4404
02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:50.080
<v Speaker 3>the third world.</v>

4405
02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:51.520
<v Speaker 3>I think the cops leave those cars there.</v>

4406
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:52.833
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

4407
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:56.230
<v Speaker 3>I think they leave those cards there as like something to take their anger out</v>

4408
02:07:56.231 --> 02:07:56.860
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

4409
02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:57.693
<v Speaker 3>Leave them a ca.</v>

4410
02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean in street fighter is if you give them a cop car to destroy and they have</v>

4411
02:08:05.351 --> 02:08:06.250
<v Speaker 3>those cars are insured,</v>

4412
02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:07.960
<v Speaker 3>it's a bonus level and they,</v>

4413
02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:09.610
<v Speaker 3>it gives them something to destroy.</v>

4414
02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:10.720
<v Speaker 3>And I really think that.</v>

4415
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I really think that that's probably a strategy and a lot of ways.</v>

4416
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Take a cop car,</v>

4417
02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:16.490
<v Speaker 3>leave it in an area where you know,</v>

4418
02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.390
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be some protests and just let him fuck it up.</v>

4419
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.823
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4420
02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Baltimore mayor gave those who wish to destroy space to do that.</v>

4421
02:08:25.071 --> 02:08:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I got in trouble for saying that,</v>

4422
02:08:26.171 --> 02:08:27.280
<v Speaker 3>but okay.</v>

4423
02:08:27.281 --> 02:08:31.270
<v Speaker 3>But what she said was she was criticized because they thought that she was</v>

4424
02:08:31.271 --> 02:08:35.200
<v Speaker 3>actually giving the green light to go ahead and riot by a mayor,</v>

4425
02:08:35.201 --> 02:08:37.330
<v Speaker 3>not trying to calm people down,</v>

4426
02:08:37.331 --> 02:08:39.040
<v Speaker 3>but instead by saying something like that,</v>

4427
02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:43.540
<v Speaker 3>the the interpretation was that what she did was she almost gave them like a</v>

4428
02:08:43.541 --> 02:08:45.670
<v Speaker 3>license to go out and smash it.</v>

4429
02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:47.271
<v Speaker 3>She's a black lady.</v>

4430
02:08:47.271 --> 02:08:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4431
02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:48.333
<v Speaker 3>she's cute.</v>

4432
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:52.540
<v Speaker 3>We gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.</v>

4433
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:53.623
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

4434
02:08:53.950 --> 02:08:54.461
<v Speaker 3>She's black,</v>

4435
02:08:54.461 --> 02:08:54.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4436
02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:55.653
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4437
02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Why You keep having to bring that up,</v>

4438
02:08:56.771 --> 02:08:57.080
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4439
02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:58.000
<v Speaker 3>because she asked because she,</v>

4440
02:08:58.050 --> 02:08:58.811
<v Speaker 3>I don't see color.</v>

4441
02:08:58.811 --> 02:09:00.280
<v Speaker 3>I feel because I feel bad.</v>

4442
02:09:00.281 --> 02:09:03.370
<v Speaker 3>She has to answer like for so many things also.</v>

4443
02:09:03.371 --> 02:09:04.204
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

4444
02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:05.253
<v Speaker 3>Let me read that again.</v>

4445
02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:05.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4446
02:09:05.741 --> 02:09:05.891
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4447
02:09:05.891 --> 02:09:06.724
<v Speaker 3>I hear you.</v>

4448
02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Look at what's in this quote though,</v>

4449
02:09:08.770 --> 02:09:12.910
<v Speaker 3>because while trying to make sure that we are protected from the cars and other</v>

4450
02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:14.170
<v Speaker 3>things that were going on,</v>

4451
02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:18.640
<v Speaker 3>we gave those who wish to destroy space to do that as well and we worked very</v>

4452
02:09:18.641 --> 02:09:22.300
<v Speaker 3>hard to keep that balance and to put ourselves in the best position to</v>

4453
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:23.260
<v Speaker 3>deescalate.</v>

4454
02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:26.230
<v Speaker 3>That sounds to me that she's very pragmatic.</v>

4455
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:26.801
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

4456
02:09:26.801 --> 02:09:28.750
<v Speaker 3>know what I read it in context,</v>

4457
02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:32.530
<v Speaker 3>what that sounds to me like she's a pragmatic woman and what she did was she</v>

4458
02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:36.310
<v Speaker 3>made a calculation and decided that these guys are going to destroy things and</v>

4459
02:09:36.311 --> 02:09:39.490
<v Speaker 3>maybe that was admitting that they left some cop cars.</v>

4460
02:09:39.491 --> 02:09:40.900
<v Speaker 3>They're too smart.</v>

4461
02:09:40.901 --> 02:09:41.734
<v Speaker 3>Move Right?</v>

4462
02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Take a loss for the greater good.</v>

4463
02:09:43.210 --> 02:09:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you know,</v>

4464
02:09:43.890 --> 02:09:44.610
<v Speaker 3>but there's the,</v>

4465
02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:45.401
<v Speaker 3>you mean the greater good?</v>

4466
02:09:45.401 --> 02:09:47.050
<v Speaker 3>But they burnt a lot of shit.</v>

4467
02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:48.490
<v Speaker 3>They smashed a lot of things.</v>

4468
02:09:48.820 --> 02:09:50.140
<v Speaker 3>A lot of cops got injured.</v>

4469
02:09:50.650 --> 02:09:50.951
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

4470
02:09:50.951 --> 02:09:51.820
<v Speaker 3>Being a cop man.</v>

4471
02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:54.040
<v Speaker 3>It's too hard this day in age.</v>

4472
02:09:54.041 --> 02:09:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

4473
02:09:54.730 --> 02:09:55.450
<v Speaker 3>We need them though.</v>

4474
02:09:55.450 --> 02:09:56.283
<v Speaker 3>That's what's crazy.</v>

4475
02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:57.091
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4476
02:09:57.091 --> 02:09:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm really going to say this is one of the things like,</v>

4477
02:09:58.541 --> 02:09:58.661
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4478
02:09:58.661 --> 02:10:00.530
<v Speaker 3>who's going to do it a certain size,</v>

4479
02:10:00.531 --> 02:10:02.350
<v Speaker 3>certain personality that's going to go do it.</v>

4480
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:04.833
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4481
02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

4482
02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I guess there's multiple ports now I can do it,</v>

4483
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:11.620
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of times ends up being the same guy.</v>

4484
02:10:11.621 --> 02:10:12.454
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4485
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.880
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4486
02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:13.920
<v Speaker 3>it can you know,</v>

4487
02:10:13.921 --> 02:10:16.930
<v Speaker 3>and obviously the abusive people or when it becomes a problem,</v>

4488
02:10:16.931 --> 02:10:18.190
<v Speaker 3>but the really calm people,</v>

4489
02:10:18.490 --> 02:10:19.510
<v Speaker 3>they're super valuable,</v>

4490
02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:21.580
<v Speaker 3>super valuable asset to the community.</v>

4491
02:10:21.581 --> 02:10:24.580
<v Speaker 3>If you have a really good calm cop who actually can deal with shit,</v>

4492
02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:26.380
<v Speaker 3>good luck finding one of those.</v>

4493
02:10:26.590 --> 02:10:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Good luck being that guy too.</v>

4494
02:10:27.731 --> 02:10:30.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard road and you're not going to get nearly the respect that you feel</v>

4495
02:10:30.431 --> 02:10:33.440
<v Speaker 3>like you deserve or putting your fucking life on the line on a daily basis,</v>

4496
02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 3>breaking</v>

4497
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:39.160
<v Speaker 1>up family disputes and stopping crime and break ins and fucking car jackings and</v>

4498
02:10:39.861 --> 02:10:42.080
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of crazy shit you have to deal with.</v>

4499
02:10:42.081 --> 02:10:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's lying to you.</v>

4500
02:10:43.581 --> 02:10:44.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of the worst things.</v>

4501
02:10:44.661 --> 02:10:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the.</v>

4502
02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:50.160
<v Speaker 1>When a cop really does buddy up to you and starts like opening up his weird</v>

4503
02:10:50.271 --> 02:10:52.010
<v Speaker 1>moral like world,</v>

4504
02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:53.780
<v Speaker 1>like where his morals are to you.</v>

4505
02:10:53.781 --> 02:10:54.011
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4506
02:10:54.011 --> 02:10:55.370
<v Speaker 1>it always blows my mind.</v>

4507
02:10:55.371 --> 02:10:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I've had them say things like,</v>

4508
02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:56.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4509
02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:58.820
<v Speaker 1>it sucks these fucking homeless around here.</v>

4510
02:10:58.821 --> 02:10:58.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4511
02:10:58.970 --> 02:11:00.440
<v Speaker 1>we used to be able to beat their ass,</v>

4512
02:11:00.441 --> 02:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>but now it's like they're watching us everywhere.</v>

4513
02:11:02.461 --> 02:11:02.840
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4514
02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:03.673
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

4515
02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him say a one guy was bragging to me that he's never had even tried</v>

4516
02:11:08.970 --> 02:11:09.710
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

4517
02:11:09.710 --> 02:11:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I was smoking weed in his presence and he was a guy I wish I could smoke again,</v>

4518
02:11:13.670 --> 02:11:13.851
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4519
02:11:13.851 --> 02:11:14.151
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4520
02:11:14.151 --> 02:11:15.410
<v Speaker 1>they just test this all the time.</v>

4521
02:11:15.410 --> 02:11:15.651
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4522
02:11:15.651 --> 02:11:16.970
<v Speaker 1>but you can check my arrest records,</v>

4523
02:11:16.971 --> 02:11:17.121
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4524
02:11:17.121 --> 02:11:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a never arrested anyone for.</v>

4525
02:11:19.611 --> 02:11:21.530
<v Speaker 1>We'd never arrested for a Dui.</v>

4526
02:11:21.650 --> 02:11:22.300
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4527
02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:22.870
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4528
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Like no man,</v>

4529
02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>like every Dui.</v>

4530
02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:27.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4531
02:11:27.611 --> 02:11:27.931
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

4532
02:11:27.931 --> 02:11:30.210
<v Speaker 1>It be trying to court make some correlation to me that I,</v>

4533
02:11:30.211 --> 02:11:32.620
<v Speaker 1>that I saw got drunk on the road there at night,</v>

4534
02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:35.300
<v Speaker 1>pretty short drunk sinking or whether or not she'd call them.</v>

4535
02:11:35.301 --> 02:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>And so I got beside him in the lane,</v>

4536
02:11:37.610 --> 02:11:39.530
<v Speaker 1>backed up and stayed behind them,</v>

4537
02:11:39.590 --> 02:11:41.300
<v Speaker 1>watching them weave in and out of the land.</v>

4538
02:11:41.301 --> 02:11:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't tell if he was drunk or he's tired because you keep it up for awhile</v>

4539
02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:47.360
<v Speaker 1>and then he would drift and then they come back in and keep it up.</v>

4540
02:11:47.361 --> 02:11:48.194
<v Speaker 1>And then he was good.</v>

4541
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:49.431
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to tell,</v>

4542
02:11:49.431 --> 02:11:50.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's disturbing.</v>

4543
02:11:50.451 --> 02:11:51.050
<v Speaker 1>It's fuck.</v>

4544
02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:54.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like all these cars are flying around going 70 miles an hour and this one</v>

4545
02:11:54.261 --> 02:11:56.390
<v Speaker 1>guy is not fully in control.</v>

4546
02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I had to call a few times just because every time I come home it's that time,</v>

4547
02:12:00.591 --> 02:12:04.220
<v Speaker 1>you know the bars are closing and so once in a while you just have to do it</v>

4548
02:12:04.221 --> 02:12:05.480
<v Speaker 1>because you see how bad it is.</v>

4549
02:12:05.481 --> 02:12:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Like all right,</v>

4550
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.920
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

4551
02:12:06.921 --> 02:12:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I called in once,</v>

4552
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.901
<v Speaker 1>called him once,</v>

4553
02:12:08.901 --> 02:12:09.820
<v Speaker 1>coming down the one-on-one.</v>

4554
02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking guy was just taking two,</v>

4555
02:12:12.441 --> 02:12:13.580
<v Speaker 1>three lanes at a time,</v>

4556
02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:17.690
<v Speaker 1>just go straight across and then back on straight for a little bit,</v>

4557
02:12:17.691 --> 02:12:21.410
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of wiggle drift to the right back on straight,</v>

4558
02:12:21.411 --> 02:12:21.741
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

4559
02:12:21.741 --> 02:12:22.240
<v Speaker 1>straight way.</v>

4560
02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was fucked up and I knew that that guy was going to crash and I called</v>

4561
02:12:26.531 --> 02:12:27.290
<v Speaker 1>the cops.</v>

4562
02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:28.123
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened,</v>

4563
02:12:28.250 --> 02:12:29.030
<v Speaker 1>never saw it.</v>

4564
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I did watch a guy.</v>

4565
02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I was going 70 miles an hour and this guy fucking flew by me on the highway the</v>

4566
02:12:35.301 --> 02:12:35.631
<v Speaker 1>other day,</v>

4567
02:12:35.631 --> 02:12:36.840
<v Speaker 1>just one long.</v>

4568
02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4569
02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:38.990
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

4570
02:12:38.991 --> 02:12:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4571
02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:39.860
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4572
02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:43.040
<v Speaker 1>it was a crowded highway and dude had to be going a buck 20,</v>

4573
02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:43.880
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>

4574
02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:48.880
<v Speaker 1>easy buck 20 and then right behind him the fucking cops were racing him the</v>

4575
02:12:50.391 --> 02:12:51.171
<v Speaker 1>entire time.</v>

4576
02:12:51.171 --> 02:12:55.490
<v Speaker 1>This asshole like thought he was like being Joe Slick and driving fast with a</v>

4577
02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:57.470
<v Speaker 1>car behind him and that car was a cop car.</v>

4578
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.350
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

4579
02:12:58.350 --> 02:13:00.150
<v Speaker 1>they hit the lights and they're right behind them.</v>

4580
02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:01.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4581
02:13:01.761 --> 02:13:03.860
<v Speaker 1>He was driving so fast because I was watching this.</v>

4582
02:13:03.861 --> 02:13:04.131
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4583
02:13:04.131 --> 02:13:06.470
<v Speaker 1>this is not like an empty road on the way to Vegas.</v>

4584
02:13:06.471 --> 02:13:08.510
<v Speaker 1>There's no one in front of you and your fucking listening to radar.</v>

4585
02:13:08.511 --> 02:13:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Love this.</v>

4586
02:13:10.070 --> 02:13:11.930
<v Speaker 1>This is the one on one in Hollywood,</v>

4587
02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:12.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4588
02:13:12.501 --> 02:13:13.700
<v Speaker 1>at 7:30 at night,</v>

4589
02:13:13.701 --> 02:13:16.970
<v Speaker 1>very crowded road and this guy was following Elian.</v>

4590
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.170
<v Speaker 1>It's so that the scientists in on that shit.</v>

4591
02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:21.951
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

4592
02:13:21.951 --> 02:13:22.784
<v Speaker 1>Like those things,</v>

4593
02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:23.390
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

4594
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:24.440
<v Speaker 1>They end bad a lot.</v>

4595
02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:24.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4596
02:13:24.861 --> 02:13:25.694
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

4597
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Car Chases are fucking terrifying for cops to imagine if you're a company</v>

4598
02:13:29.721 --> 02:13:32.740
<v Speaker 1>plowing or someone and kill them when you're trying get some bad guy flood.</v>

4599
02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:33.743
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

4600
02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course it happens with your fucking going 150 miles an hour,</v>

4601
02:13:37.170 --> 02:13:39.350
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell you going going around corners and how,</v>

4602
02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:41.430
<v Speaker 1>how good exactly as they're driving.</v>

4603
02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Did you oversee the,</v>

4604
02:13:43.261 --> 02:13:44.094
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4605
02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:49.340
<v Speaker 1>those videos of cops getting hit by cars while they're like checking ids and</v>

4606
02:13:49.771 --> 02:13:49.921
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

4607
02:13:49.921 --> 02:13:50.460
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

4608
02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:51.230
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>

4609
02:13:51.230 --> 02:13:51.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4610
02:13:51.451 --> 02:13:53.100
<v Speaker 1>where they stand for that is ridiculous.</v>

4611
02:13:53.101 --> 02:13:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Almost most of them don't do that anymore.</v>

4612
02:13:54.991 --> 02:13:56.130
<v Speaker 1>They stand on the outside,</v>

4613
02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:57.690
<v Speaker 1>they go on the other side.</v>

4614
02:13:58.110 --> 02:14:00.300
<v Speaker 1>But there's a danger issue,</v>

4615
02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:00.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4616
02:14:00.941 --> 02:14:02.610
<v Speaker 1>like when you're approaching cars,</v>

4617
02:14:02.611 --> 02:14:03.840
<v Speaker 1>you've got to see someone's hands.</v>

4618
02:14:03.841 --> 02:14:06.180
<v Speaker 1>You got to make sure that they don't have any weapons on them.</v>

4619
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Every cop has to approach every car.</v>

4620
02:14:08.341 --> 02:14:08.551
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4621
02:14:08.551 --> 02:14:10.740
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy that might keep you from seeing your family.</v>

4622
02:14:10.741 --> 02:14:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

4623
02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:13.140
<v Speaker 1>that's just a crazy job,</v>

4624
02:14:13.141 --> 02:14:13.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4625
02:14:13.890 --> 02:14:15.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy way to make a living.</v>

4626
02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:17.160
<v Speaker 1>It is a shame because they said those videos.</v>

4627
02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:18.360
<v Speaker 1>That's why I said I've,</v>

4628
02:14:18.370 --> 02:14:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I've actually never had cops be very helpful to me or nice to me ever.</v>

4629
02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare.</v>

4630
02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4631
02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:24.961
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>

4632
02:14:24.961 --> 02:14:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

4633
02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:25.993
<v Speaker 1>Well Look at you.</v>

4634
02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:27.360
<v Speaker 1>You look like a fucking monster.</v>

4635
02:14:27.450 --> 02:14:27.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4636
02:14:27.730 --> 02:14:28.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4637
02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:30.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking torture basement.</v>

4638
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:32.350
<v Speaker 1>This brass again.</v>

4639
02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:32.881

4642
02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:34.160

<v Speaker 1>Philippians boys were pulled from a trunk and this man's do from pope fixing</v>

<v Speaker 1>You one of the guys,</v>

4651

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4652
02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.400
<v Speaker 1>A grown man with long hair.</v>

4653
02:14:47.401 --> 02:14:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4654
02:14:47.730 --> 02:14:48.540
<v Speaker 1>hm.</v>

4655
02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:50.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't follow the rules,</v>

4656
02:14:50.490 --> 02:14:51.180
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>

4657
02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:52.900
<v Speaker 1>What else do you not follow the rules on,</v>

4658
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:53.430
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>

02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:54.480
<v Speaker 1>It's usually the button which is.</v>

4660
02:14:54.481 --> 02:14:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I do play by the rules in a button.</v>

4661
02:14:58.880 --> 02:14:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the new rule.</v>

4662
02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.800
<v Speaker 1>You get a man thing the top,</v>

4663
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:03.390
<v Speaker 1>like a pony pony.</v>

4664
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of the girl up here and you heard the newest trend for women is</v>

4665
02:15:06.721 --> 02:15:11.700
<v Speaker 1>actually putting it in Old Lady Hair Bun and actually dying your hair graze</v>

4666
02:15:11.730 --> 02:15:11.940
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4667

<v Speaker 1>People are always exhausted with the options that are available and they're just</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're so hot.</v>

4699
02:15:53.281 --> 02:15:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck if they have gray hair,</v>

4700
02:15:54.541 --> 02:15:55.374
<v Speaker 1>you shave your head.</v>

4701
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:56.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4702
02:15:56.071 --> 02:15:58.080
<v Speaker 1>like I was say like when someone say,</v>

4703
02:15:58.110 --> 02:15:59.490
<v Speaker 1>do you think girls attractive?</v>

4704
02:15:59.970 --> 02:16:01.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of girls that are undeniably attractive,</v>

4705
02:16:01.891 --> 02:16:03.870
<v Speaker 1>but do they pass the shaved head?</v>

4706
02:16:03.871 --> 02:16:04.770
<v Speaker 1>No shirt test.</v>

4707
02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And if a girl passes the shaved head,</v>

4708
02:16:07.441 --> 02:16:08.280
<v Speaker 1>no shirt tests,</v>

4709
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:10.770
<v Speaker 1>that's a ridiculously hot girl,</v>

4710
02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:11.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4711
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:12.810
<v Speaker 1>All these girls in this,</v>

4712
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:14.220
<v Speaker 1>in this montage,</v>

4713
02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:15.660
<v Speaker 1>past these shaved head,</v>

4714
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:17.520
<v Speaker 1>no shirt test like this.</v>

4715
02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:18.541
<v Speaker 1>I can't say.</v>

4716
02:16:18.541 --> 02:16:19.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised.</v>

4717
02:16:19.301 --> 02:16:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't say.</v>

4718
02:16:20.281 --> 02:16:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised that granting Harrison,</v>

4719
02:16:22.530 --> 02:16:22.921
<v Speaker 1>they're hot,</v>

4720
02:16:22.921 --> 02:16:23.440
<v Speaker 1>they're hot.</v>

4721
02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a fuck.</v>

4722
02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:25.020
<v Speaker 1>They have black eyelashes.</v>

4723
02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:25.831
<v Speaker 1>That's what's my point.</v>

4724
02:16:25.831 --> 02:16:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not even granny hair.</v>

4725
02:16:27.570 --> 02:16:28.021
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>

4726
02:16:28.021 --> 02:16:29.800
<v Speaker 1>if they're that hot take,</v>

4727
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:34.180
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take on that look like they want to like slow it down a little there</v>

4728
02:16:34.181 --> 02:16:35.014
<v Speaker 1>too hot,</v>

4729
02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:36.213
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4730
02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Try to put some roadblocks in the way.</v>

4731
02:16:37.950 --> 02:16:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4732
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just,</v>

4733
02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:39.820
<v Speaker 1>just too many dudes.</v>

4734
02:16:39.821 --> 02:16:40.654
<v Speaker 1>You're hitting on me.</v>

4735
02:16:41.070 --> 02:16:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fail her to suck his Dick for ready.</v>

4736
02:16:46.301 --> 02:16:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I've got too many dicks coming my way.</v>

4737
02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that episode of workaholics that they talk about?</v>

4738
02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:53.680
<v Speaker 1>That was so fucking good.</v>

4739
02:16:53.681 --> 02:16:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I've never watched that show before.</v>

4740
02:16:54.911 --> 02:16:56.170
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious.</v>

4741
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4742
02:16:56.470 --> 02:16:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch it.</v>

4743
02:16:57.460 --> 02:16:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I saw some of the clips online,</v>

4744
02:16:58.841 --> 02:16:59.571
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't watch it.</v>

4745
02:16:59.571 --> 02:17:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And how much of this show is dedicated to making fun of a.</v>

4746
02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:03.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot.</v>

4747
02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:08.070
<v Speaker 1>What happens is they eat pod and throughout the thing they just,</v>

4749
02:17:09.710 --> 02:17:10.510
<v Speaker 1>and then.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then there was some like silly quotes we're going to like know Joe Rogan</v>

<v Speaker 1>I laughed my ass off.</v>

4753
02:17:20.691 --> 02:17:22.210
<v Speaker 1>It's called a pea pod.</v>

4758
02:17:26.771 --> 02:17:27.520
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

4759
02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:28.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny show,</v>

4761
02:17:29.050 --> 02:17:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I just haven't had a chance to watch it.</v>

4762
02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:30.551
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just too fucking busy these days.</v>

4767
02:17:36.041 --> 02:17:36.130
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

4768
02:17:36.130 --> 02:17:40.020
<v Speaker 1>seth rogen and all the time we need to Joe Rogan at once in a while.</v>

4769
02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:42.250
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

4770
02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:43.241
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

4771
02:17:43.241 --> 02:17:44.074
<v Speaker 1>That's an honor.</v>

4772
02:17:44.170 --> 02:17:45.003
<v Speaker 1>That's an honor.</v>

4773
02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:46.173
<v Speaker 1>That's really cool.</v>

4774
02:17:46.990 --> 02:17:47.801
<v Speaker 1>When I saw it online,</v>

4775
02:17:47.801 --> 02:17:48.041
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4776
02:17:48.041 --> 02:17:48.281
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

4777

<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

4778
02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It's funny when you go either way,</v>

4779
02:17:50.910 --> 02:17:52.240
<v Speaker 1>when you're referenced in the show.</v>

4780
02:17:52.241 --> 02:17:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I was talking,</v>

4781
02:17:53.171 --> 02:17:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to already laying,</v>

4782
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4783
02:17:55.710 --> 02:17:56.890
<v Speaker 1>like two weeks ago or something.</v>

4784
02:17:56.891 --> 02:17:57.280
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

4785
02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:58.150
<v Speaker 1>and he told me that,</v>

4786
02:17:58.151 --> 02:17:58.984
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4787
02:17:59.570 --> 02:18:00.430
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was an honor,</v>

4788
02:18:00.431 --> 02:18:03.640
<v Speaker 1>but you've got a reference on Cleveland show one time,</v>

4789
02:18:03.670 --> 02:18:04.031
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

4790
02:18:04.031 --> 02:18:04.930
<v Speaker 1>the reference was a,</v>

4791
02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I guess the,</v>

4792
02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:08.170
<v Speaker 1>the mom was buying food one day at a time.</v>

4793
02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:08.411
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

4794
02:18:08.411 --> 02:18:10.240
<v Speaker 1>nobody buys food one day at a time,</v>

4795
02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:12.190
<v Speaker 1>except for already my God.</v>

4796
02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:14.810
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a weird way to have like a punchline.</v>

4797
02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Shitty.</v>

4798
02:18:15.650 --> 02:18:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4799
02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:17.530

02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:24.910
<v Speaker 1>It's really well written.</v>

4807
02:18:25.090 --> 02:18:25.531
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

4808
02:18:25.531 --> 02:18:28.180
<v Speaker 1>It was surprising because I never had watched it before.</v>

4809
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Now that in a broad city,</v>

4810
02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:31.180
<v Speaker 1>have you ever watched that?</v>

4811
02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:31.421
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4812
02:18:31.421 --> 02:18:31.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4813
02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:32.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4814
02:18:32.410 --> 02:18:34.030
<v Speaker 1>sorry man,</v>

4815
02:18:34.031 --> 02:18:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen amy Schumer's show either.</v>

4816
02:18:35.890 --> 02:18:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I keep hearing really good things about Amy Schumer show.</v>

4817
02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:39.453
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen it?</v>

4818
02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:40.270

<v Speaker 1>the cool thing about broad city,</v>

4821
02:18:41.801 --> 02:18:43.540
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like sex and the city,</v>

4822
02:18:43.541 --> 02:18:48.010
<v Speaker 1>but our generation and they just smoke weed and like do gross shit,</v>

4823
02:18:48.180 --> 02:18:50.290
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds like sex in the city at all.</v>

4824
02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:51.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not city.</v>

4825
02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:55.600
<v Speaker 1>It's about two girls and it's just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4845
02:19:22.601 --> 02:19:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch breaking bad.</v>

4846
02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:23.831
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

4847
02:19:23.831 --> 02:19:24.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a good hair.</v>

4848
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

4849
02:19:24.430 --> 02:19:24.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4850
02:19:24.930 --> 02:19:25.600
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

4851
02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I watched the first season and it was really good,</v>

4852
02:19:28.161 --> 02:19:29.180
<v Speaker 1>but I just kept busy.</v>

4853
02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:31.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of just totally a matter of being busy.</v>

4854
02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I made through dexter and that got really disappointed at the end.</v>

4855
02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I gave up on text.</v>

4856
02:19:35.810 --> 02:19:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I finished it and it disappointing.</v>

4857
02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Super disappointed.</v>

4858
02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Well it got when I talked about this 100 times when John Lithgow killed a</v>

4859
02:19:43.051 --> 02:19:45.560
<v Speaker 1>chicken a bathtub and gave her a shitty rear naked choke.</v>

4860
02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:48.050
<v Speaker 1>He put her in like a lame rear naked choke.</v>

4861
02:19:48.051 --> 02:19:48.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4862
02:19:48.291 --> 02:19:48.501
<v Speaker 1>Piss,</v>

4863
02:19:48.501 --> 02:19:51.530
<v Speaker 1>you are not choking anybody with that fuck this show.</v>

4864
02:19:51.531 --> 02:19:52.220
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

4865
02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I literally got rid of the legitimacy of mixed martial arts moves so you can't</v>

4866
02:19:57.861 --> 02:19:58.370
<v Speaker 1>just fake.</v>

4867
02:19:58.370 --> 02:20:01.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you were doing a documentary and Jimi Hendrix and you plant a fake</v>

4868
02:20:01.431 --> 02:20:03.350
<v Speaker 1>guitar and you didn't really know what you're doing,</v>

4869
02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I could tell you didn't know what you're doing.</v>

4870
02:20:04.611 --> 02:20:04.881
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

4871
02:20:04.881 --> 02:20:05.900
<v Speaker 1>fuck this documentary.</v>

4872
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:06.740
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4873
02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:09.320
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel about John Lithgow and his shitty run naked choke.</v>

4874
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Plus when you choke somebody,</v>

4875
02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>they fight back like they try.</v>

4876
02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:13.430
<v Speaker 1>They try to stay alive.</v>

4877
02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:14.540
<v Speaker 1>They're freaking the fuck out.</v>

4878
02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:16.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't just stay in place so you could do it.</v>

4879
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:17.631
<v Speaker 1>They fight,</v>

4880
02:20:17.631 --> 02:20:18.560
<v Speaker 1>they kicked their legs,</v>

4881
02:20:18.561 --> 02:20:19.970
<v Speaker 1>they fucking thrash around.</v>

4882
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:23.030
<v Speaker 1>It looks like Elizabeth Berkley in that coke seen the pool,</v>

4883
02:20:23.031 --> 02:20:25.220
<v Speaker 1>which was trying to bang kyle mclachlan.</v>

4884
02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Whenever she's flying around,</v>

4885
02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:28.790
<v Speaker 1>really look like if someone's,</v>

4886
02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:29.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to choke somebody,</v>

4887
02:20:29.901 --> 02:20:30.711
<v Speaker 1>they would start kicking.</v>

4888
02:20:30.711 --> 02:20:32.480
<v Speaker 1>They've realized their life is in danger.</v>

4889
02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:33.643
<v Speaker 1>They don't just</v>

4890
02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:37.730
<v Speaker 1>join third rock and kill me.</v>

4891
02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:38.541
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

4892
02:20:38.541 --> 02:20:40.730
<v Speaker 1>And Harry and the Hendersons the fuck Outta here.</v>

4893
02:20:40.731 --> 02:20:41.540
<v Speaker 1>He's not a killer.</v>

4894
02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Stop too much.</v>

4895
02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:43.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4896
02:20:43.881 --> 02:20:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to typecast the man,</v>

4897
02:20:44.991 --> 02:20:46.280
<v Speaker 1>but the fuck out of here.</v>

4898
02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:49.070
<v Speaker 1>You didn't like him in that at all that you know.</v>

4899
02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

4900
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:50.151
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>

4901
02:20:50.151 --> 02:20:50.984
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4902
02:20:51.300 --> 02:20:54.170
<v Speaker 1>my favorite season to couldn't get past the Shitty Jujitsu technique.</v>

4903
02:20:56.200 --> 02:20:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that.</v>

4904
02:20:57.081 --> 02:20:58.520
<v Speaker 1>I wish they would redo it.</v>

4905
02:20:58.530 --> 02:20:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Like Greek or deny it.</v>

4906
02:20:59.870 --> 02:21:00.703
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars.</v>

4907
02:21:00.770 --> 02:21:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Who shot first or something?</v>

4908
02:21:01.911 --> 02:21:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Just a fixed that scene for you?</v>

4909
02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

4910
02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:05.233
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

4911
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4912
02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:06.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4913
02:21:06.051 --> 02:21:06.441
<v Speaker 1>was he good?</v>

4914
02:21:06.441 --> 02:21:06.951
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

4915
02:21:06.951 --> 02:21:08.060
<v Speaker 1>the show was already know the show.</v>

4916
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:09.870
<v Speaker 1>The show got shitty right from there.</v>

4917
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much what happened.</v>

4918
02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:13.160
<v Speaker 1>It was so good at one point in time,</v>

4919
02:21:13.161 --> 02:21:17.030
<v Speaker 1>but something happened and it just got really off the rails every year.</v>

4920
02:21:17.031 --> 02:21:20.740
<v Speaker 1>They kept exposing like an end of series secret and then.</v>

4921
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:24.260
<v Speaker 1>And then when they get another season they'd have to incorporate that into the</v>

4922
02:21:24.261 --> 02:21:24.650
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

4923
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:25.101
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

4924
02:21:25.101 --> 02:21:28.850
<v Speaker 1>So it was like his sister was never supposed to find out he did that and then it</v>

4925
02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:31.450
<v Speaker 1>was like multiple seasons of her knowing he was a,</v>

4926
02:21:31.650 --> 02:21:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

4927
02:21:32.130 --> 02:21:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Like they got over it very quickly as a cop killed his spoiler alert when it</v>

4928
02:21:36.891 --> 02:21:37.820
<v Speaker 1>killed his wife.</v>

4929
02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:39.111
<v Speaker 1>When it goes wife,</v>

4930
02:21:39.111 --> 02:21:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4931
02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:41.770
<v Speaker 1>when I think a lot of people always like that,</v>

4932
02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:46.280
<v Speaker 1>should've mentioned when John Lithgo killed his wife.</v>

4933
02:21:46.281 --> 02:21:47.114
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4934
02:21:47.390 --> 02:21:48.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that ups</v>

4935
02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:51.433
<v Speaker 1>the ending of that.</v>

4936
02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Here's the Shitty rear naked choke lit piss poor Jujitsu techniques or you're</v>

4937
02:21:57.261 --> 02:21:58.220
<v Speaker 1>not even flexing.</v>

4938
02:21:58.310 --> 02:21:59.240
<v Speaker 1>He's not even a flexing.</v>

4939
02:21:59.241 --> 02:22:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I just had a bathtub that I could do that in person.</v>

4940
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:04.910
<v Speaker 1>That bathtub.</v>

4941
02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It'd be way easier to get a bath tub to do that and then to do that.</v>

4942
02:22:07.881 --> 02:22:08.301
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

4943
02:22:08.301 --> 02:22:09.081
<v Speaker 1>you have to kill somebody.</v>

4944
02:22:09.081 --> 02:22:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4945
02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a good math?</v>

4946
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4947
02:22:10.731 --> 02:22:11.564
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you do.</v>

4948
02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:12.533
<v Speaker 1>Good bath.</v>

4949
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4950
02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:14.031
<v Speaker 1>Get a bath tub,</v>

4951
02:22:14.031 --> 02:22:14.300
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

4952
02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:14.510

<v Speaker 6>comes to mind.</v>

4999
02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:04.880
<v Speaker 6>Like Tina Turner</v>

5022
02:25:41.650 --> 02:25:42.040
<v Speaker 3>The son,</v>

02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:46.550
<v Speaker 3>but freestyle know that there's not sec roast roast jokes,</v>

5024
02:25:46.551 --> 02:25:47.570
<v Speaker 3>but how about the fact?</v>

5025
02:25:47.571 --> 02:25:47.901
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

5026
02:25:47.901 --> 02:25:48.734
<v Speaker 3>it's not freestyle</v>

5027
02:25:50.300 --> 02:25:51.133
<v Speaker 3>freestyle.</v>

5028
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Those were written rhymes.</v>

5029
02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:53.780
<v Speaker 3>He freestyles are.</v>

5030
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:54.703
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them are,</v>

5031
02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:58.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's like being able to flow like on the point and then have the right</v>

5032
02:25:58.400 --> 02:25:59.270
<v Speaker 3>things to say,</v>

5033
02:25:59.660 --> 02:26:00.290
<v Speaker 3>but that's just.</v>

5034
02:26:00.290 --> 02:26:02.030
<v Speaker 3>You just got to appreciate what he just did.</v>

5035
02:26:02.031 --> 02:26:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

5036
02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:03.860
<v Speaker 3>He just did a microphone.</v>

5037
02:26:03.930 --> 02:26:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Old schooling microphone.</v>

5038
02:26:05.091 --> 02:26:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Like Chris Rock,</v>

5039
02:26:05.770 --> 02:26:07.090
<v Speaker 3>one of those posters.</v>

5040
02:26:07.230 --> 02:26:08.810
<v Speaker 3>You Know Lenny Bruce,</v>

5041
02:26:08.811 --> 02:26:09.870
<v Speaker 3>those old ones.</v>

5042
02:26:09.890 --> 02:26:10.723
<v Speaker 3>He's got one of those.</v>

5043
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:14.360
<v Speaker 3>He's standing on a corner in front of a grocery store on the street and there's</v>

5044
02:26:14.361 --> 02:26:18.320
<v Speaker 3>people all around them and there's an actual rap rap battle going on on the</v>

5045
02:26:18.321 --> 02:26:19.154
<v Speaker 3>corner.</v>

5046
02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:19.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean that.</v>

5047
02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:21.460
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the greatest video.</v>

5048
02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:25.280
<v Speaker 3>A Korean guy just loading buck shots into a flooded in bedstuy.</v>

5049
02:26:25.310 --> 02:26:28.040
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the greatest videos in the history of pop culture.</v>

5050
02:26:28.041 --> 02:26:31.340
<v Speaker 3>You want to talk about a talented motherfucker in his environment,</v>

5051
02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:32.121
<v Speaker 3>the environment.</v>

5052
02:26:32.121 --> 02:26:32.691
<v Speaker 3>When we were,</v>

5053
02:26:32.691 --> 02:26:36.780
<v Speaker 3>he developed and grew and you see how good he is and in his hand he's got notes,</v>

5054
02:26:36.781 --> 02:26:38.420
<v Speaker 3>stewed and his left hand.</v>

5055
02:26:38.421 --> 02:26:39.620
<v Speaker 3>He's got his fucking lyrics,</v>

5056
02:26:39.621 --> 02:26:39.980
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5057
02:26:39.980 --> 02:26:41.300
<v Speaker 3>Most likely look at that.</v>

5058
02:26:41.330 --> 02:26:41.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5059
02:26:41.481 --> 02:26:42.710
<v Speaker 3>whatever he's holding in his hand.</v>

5060
02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:45.260
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that that's probably as notes.</v>

5061
02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5062
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:49.460
<v Speaker 3>I never even noticed that in the sand before the cash.</v>

5063
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:50.431
<v Speaker 3>It could be cash,</v>

5064
02:26:50.431 --> 02:26:51.151
<v Speaker 3>but it's weird shape.</v>

5065
02:26:51.151 --> 02:26:51.351
<v Speaker 3>Money.</v>

5066
02:26:51.351 --> 02:26:52.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like Bolivian money or some shit.</v>

5067
02:26:54.470 --> 02:26:54.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5068
02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:55.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean it doesn't look like cash.</v>

5069
02:26:55.761 --> 02:26:56.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5070
02:26:56.390 --> 02:26:57.380
<v Speaker 3>It looks like notes.</v>

5071
02:26:57.410 --> 02:27:00.290
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he's got a notepad or maybe it might be one towel.</v>

5072
02:27:00.291 --> 02:27:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5073
02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:01.940
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing.</v>

5074
02:27:01.941 --> 02:27:02.930
<v Speaker 3>He always was sweaty.</v>

5075
02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:05.810
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker dude.</v>

5076
02:27:05.811 --> 02:27:09.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just amazing to see how good his flow was at 17.</v>

5077
02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:10.220
<v Speaker 3>He's my all time.</v>

5078
02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:11.870
<v Speaker 3>My all time favorite rapper.</v>

5079
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.890
<v Speaker 3>That's right there.</v>

5080
02:27:12.890 --> 02:27:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Him and Nas.</v>

5081
02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Nas is like my all time best lyricist.</v>

5082
02:27:16.370 --> 02:27:19.220
<v Speaker 3>I think Nas was like the most complex and the most like,</v>

5083
02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:21.330
<v Speaker 3>like I would listen to Nas lyrics and girl,</v>

5084
02:27:21.410 --> 02:27:22.430
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

5085
02:27:22.431 --> 02:27:23.270
<v Speaker 3>this dude's brilliant.</v>

5086
02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:24.920

02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:26.443

5136
02:28:25.671 --> 02:28:26.504
<v Speaker 1>Ninety one,</v>

5137
02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:29.150
<v Speaker 1>91 man.</v>

5138
02:28:29.151 --> 02:28:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I was out of the loop.</v>

5139
02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:35.180
<v Speaker 1>That was like when I was struggling hardcore as a comedian dog.</v>

5140
02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:37.250
<v Speaker 1>That was three years into my comedy career.</v>

5141
02:28:37.251 --> 02:28:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I was doing nothing but doing standup.</v>

5142
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

5143
02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to any clubs where I would ever hear this.</v>

5144
02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:42.650
<v Speaker 1>If you want to chuckle,</v>

5145
02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:46.370
<v Speaker 1>play the first verse of Hip Hop Junkies.</v>

5146
02:28:46.430 --> 02:28:48.170
<v Speaker 1>It's reasonable about lyrics.</v>

5147
02:28:48.770 --> 02:28:50.580
<v Speaker 1>He says everything is nonsequitor.</v>

5148
02:28:50.730 --> 02:28:52.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not a cool thing.</v>

5149
02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:54.180
<v Speaker 1>He just says words that rhyme there.</v>

5150
02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:55.460
<v Speaker 1>That's like zero.</v>

5151
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Nothing makes any sense.</v>

5152
02:28:57.500 --> 02:28:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Ninety one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's lived in that rock and roll lifestyle.</v>

5259
02:32:06.500 --> 02:32:07.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:18.500
<v Speaker 1>It was like wild widely decided that that was good,</v>

5269
02:32:18.860 --> 02:32:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but he was so fucking good and soundgarden,</v>

5270
02:32:21.140 --> 02:32:23.000
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to imagine it was bad in anything,</v>

5271
02:32:23.630 --> 02:32:24.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5272
02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:27.050
<v Speaker 1>listen to blow up the outside world and go look.</v>

5273
02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:29.090
<v Speaker 1>That kind of gets a pass forever.</v>

5274
02:32:29.330 --> 02:32:30.530

5285
02:32:45.291 --> 02:32:45.891
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

5286
02:32:45.891 --> 02:32:47.300
<v Speaker 1>there was there one like you know,</v>

5287
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:49.880
<v Speaker 1>sort of radio hit and then they were like,</v>

5288
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.481
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>

5289
02:32:50.481 --> 02:32:50.920

5291
02:32:55.470 --> 02:32:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5292
02:32:56.090 --> 02:32:58.340
<v Speaker 1>How did that guy wind up on entertainment?</v>

5293
02:32:58.341 --> 02:33:00.740
<v Speaker 1>News reporter has to look at.</v>

5294
02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:02.170
<v Speaker 1>He's beautiful to look at,</v>

5295
02:33:02.190 --> 02:33:03.620
<v Speaker 1>but he was a really good musician,</v>

5296
02:33:04.340 --> 02:33:05.770
<v Speaker 1>but I think he probably wanted to.</v>

5297
02:33:05.771 --> 02:33:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I bet he doesn't believe in it.</v>

5298
02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:11.000
<v Speaker 1>If your heart heart's probably in the music you don't succeed with if you're.</v>

5299
02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:12.140
<v Speaker 1>That happens to you.</v>

5300
02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:14.330
<v Speaker 1>So he changed that style of music.</v>

5301
02:33:14.331 --> 02:33:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I just want to fly.</v>

5302
02:33:15.201 --> 02:33:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's what he wanted to,</v>

5303
02:33:16.190 --> 02:33:17.000
<v Speaker 1>if you hear his,</v>

5304
02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:17.620
<v Speaker 1>the original,</v>

5305
02:33:17.620 --> 02:33:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but they have like videos of like the original way the band was and they changed</v>

5306
02:33:23.181 --> 02:33:23.840
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

5307
02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I heard incubus did that too though.</v>

5308
02:33:25.341 --> 02:33:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I was not.</v>

5309
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:29.150

5310
02:33:29.151 --> 02:33:32.330
<v Speaker 1>but like my by my body tells me all the time,</v>

5311
02:33:32.331 --> 02:33:34.510
<v Speaker 1>but they were like a pretty like big into psychedelics.</v>

5312
02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Like psychedelic metal band.</v>

5313
02:33:35.751 --> 02:33:36.280

<v Speaker 1>What made them change money?</v>

5321

<v Speaker 3>It looks in the early nineties.</v>

5364
02:34:59.080 --> 02:34:59.740
<v Speaker 3>These guys,</v>

5365
02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:04.740
<v Speaker 3>someone needs to take them out for a hard night somewhere outside of Orange</v>

<v Speaker 4>For some reason,</v>

5375
02:35:24.821 --> 02:35:28.030
<v Speaker 4>I believe like Maroon five was always Maroon five though they've actually</v>

5376

<v Speaker 4>evolved with the times to go towards more popular music.</v>

5386
02:35:39.060 --> 02:35:39.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5387
02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:40.440
<v Speaker 3>just with the camera.</v>

5388
02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:41.910
<v Speaker 3>It's the angle of the camera,</v>

5389
02:35:41.911 --> 02:35:42.181
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5390
02:35:42.181 --> 02:35:42.960
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

5391
02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:46.470
<v Speaker 3>It is also a whole drum kit and it's very possible we'll find out.</v>

5392
02:35:46.490 --> 02:35:46.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5393
02:35:46.650 --> 02:35:47.040
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

5394
02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:50.760
<v Speaker 3>That totally is 100 percent stairs on each side.</v>

5395
02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:52.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it's not,</v>

5396
02:35:52.321 --> 02:35:54.030
<v Speaker 3>it's a very similar design.</v>

5397
02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Now it's the same dick.</v>

5398
02:35:55.351 --> 02:35:57.050
<v Speaker 3>A lot lights inside.</v>

5399
02:35:57.060 --> 02:35:57.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5400
02:35:57.211 --> 02:35:57.511
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

5401
02:35:57.511 --> 02:35:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I just was full with the camera in.</v>

5402
02:35:59.070 --> 02:35:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5403
02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:01.710
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>

5404
02:36:03.090 --> 02:36:04.080
<v Speaker 3>That comedy store,</v>

5405
02:36:04.110 --> 02:36:07.170
<v Speaker 3>main room stage has seen all a lot of shit.</v>

5406
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:10.820
<v Speaker 3>That's what Richard Pryor film live at the sunset strip right at that,</v>

5407
02:36:10.821 --> 02:36:12.000
<v Speaker 3>so I'm pretty sure.</v>

5408
02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Pull that.</v>

5409
02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:14.940
<v Speaker 3>Richard Pryor live at the sunset strip.</v>

5410
02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:16.950
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm almost positive.</v>

5411
02:36:16.951 --> 02:36:18.210
<v Speaker 3>It was filmed at the comedy store.</v>

5412
02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:19.770
<v Speaker 3>One of them was filmed at the comedy store.</v>

5413
02:36:19.790 --> 02:36:20.623
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5414
02:36:21.180 --> 02:36:23.350
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't say the roxy.</v>

5415
02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5416
02:36:23.550 --> 02:36:24.840
<v Speaker 3>the kinison done one.</v>

5417
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:27.300
<v Speaker 3>The Hbo Special was filmed at the roxy,</v>

5418
02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:29.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5419
02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:29.970
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

5420
02:36:29.970 --> 02:36:32.970
<v Speaker 3>probably banned from the comedy store when it went down because he was always</v>

5421
02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:33.813
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5422
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:37.680
<v Speaker 3>they fucking repaired the bullet hole in the back sign.</v>

5423
02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:38.191
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5424
02:36:38.191 --> 02:36:39.960
<v Speaker 3>why did you do that?</v>

5425
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.411
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

5426
02:36:40.411 --> 02:36:41.670
<v Speaker 3>why would you do that?</v>

5427
02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:43.800
<v Speaker 3>We'll fix that from Kennison.</v>

5428
02:36:44.220 --> 02:36:47.430
<v Speaker 3>Kenny shot a gun in the parking lot to scare dice.</v>

5429
02:36:47.790 --> 02:36:50.880
<v Speaker 3>He shot the fucking sign and there was always a bullet hole in it.</v>

5430
02:36:51.290 --> 02:36:51.690
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5431
02:36:51.690 --> 02:36:53.010
<v Speaker 3>why would you fix that?</v>

5432
02:36:53.011 --> 02:36:53.221
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

5433
02:36:53.221 --> 02:36:54.870
<v Speaker 3>we didn't know thought was a good idea to fix it.</v>

5434
02:36:54.871 --> 02:36:55.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5435
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:57.331
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>

5436
02:36:57.331 --> 02:36:58.410
<v Speaker 3>How could you fix that?</v>

5437
02:36:58.430 --> 02:36:58.680
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

5438
02:36:58.680 --> 02:36:58.831
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5439
02:36:58.831 --> 02:37:00.210
<v Speaker 3>there's still the whole in the back of it.</v>

5440
02:37:00.211 --> 02:37:00.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5441
02:37:00.420 --> 02:37:01.440
<v Speaker 3>not good enough.</v>

5442
02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:02.873
<v Speaker 3>Not good enough.</v>

5443
02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:04.590
<v Speaker 3>You need to leave the whole whole,</v>

5444
02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:05.633
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>

5445
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Where was it?</v>

5446
02:37:06.330 --> 02:37:06.691
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood,</v>

5447
02:37:06.691 --> 02:37:07.524
<v Speaker 3>palladium,</v>

5448
02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:09.500
<v Speaker 3>palladium on the rest of them.</v>

5449
02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:10.710
<v Speaker 3>Carlos,</v>

5450
02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:11.543
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

5451
02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:12.533
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5452
02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:13.733
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

5453
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Live on the sunset</v>

5454
02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:19.190
<v Speaker 1>was all done at a different place except for one part of it.</v>

5455
02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:20.630
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

5456
02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:23.750
<v Speaker 1>So wasn't on the sunset strip and a year later.</v>

5457
02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:25.293
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

5458
02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:27.080
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>

5459
02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:28.093
<v Speaker 1>Two months later.</v>

5460
02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Wikipedia though.</v>

5461
02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:31.700
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it could or how is that possible?</v>

5462
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:33.740
<v Speaker 1>I can get lost on,</v>

5463
02:37:33.950 --> 02:37:35.990
<v Speaker 1>on looking at track listing names of comedy.</v>

5464
02:37:35.991 --> 02:37:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Albums are always the.</v>

5465
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:37.730
<v Speaker 1>But these aren't so bad,</v>

5466
02:37:37.731 --> 02:37:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they are just hilarious.</v>

5467
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:40.170
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

5468
02:37:40.170 --> 02:37:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Did one of the funniest show pull up a video of it.</v>

5469
02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:46.190
<v Speaker 1>You know that one of the funniest a track listings that you know Nate Barr,</v>

5470
02:37:46.191 --> 02:37:47.024
<v Speaker 1>gatsy.</v>

5471
02:37:47.570 --> 02:37:48.710
<v Speaker 1>He's very funny car.</v>

5472
02:37:48.711 --> 02:37:49.530
<v Speaker 1>My neighbor gets.</v>

5473
02:37:49.530 --> 02:37:50.301
<v Speaker 1>He has a special.</v>

5474
02:37:50.301 --> 02:37:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Actually it was on comedy central.</v>

5475
02:37:51.621 --> 02:37:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I heard this this last week,</v>

5476
02:37:53.031 --> 02:37:54.440
<v Speaker 1>but his album,</v>

5477
02:37:54.830 --> 02:37:55.940
<v Speaker 1>the tracks are just called.</v>

5478
02:37:55.941 --> 02:37:56.320
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

5479
02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:56.820
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

5480
02:37:56.820 --> 02:37:59.710
<v Speaker 1>good start to get them to.</v>

5481
02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:03.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like starting to lose them to how the crowd was reacting to just fucking</v>

5482
02:38:03.500 --> 02:38:04.160
<v Speaker 1>pretty high.</v>

5483
02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:05.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a funny thing.</v>

5484
02:38:05.300 --> 02:38:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Losing them now.</v>

5485
02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:06.981
<v Speaker 1>Funny he's up.</v>

5486
02:38:06.981 --> 02:38:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Got Him back.</v>

5487
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5488
02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:09.053
<v Speaker 1>got them back.</v>

5489
02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Did you find it?</v>

5490
02:38:10.330 --> 02:38:13.730
<v Speaker 1>It is really weird how the east coast comics in the west coast comics rarely</v>

5491
02:38:13.731 --> 02:38:14.564
<v Speaker 1>know each other,</v>

5492
02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:16.430
<v Speaker 1>makes us crazy,</v>

5493
02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:17.270
<v Speaker 1>so this is.</v>

5494
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:21.530
<v Speaker 1>He probably wore the same suit everywhere and did it a bunch of different</v>

5495
02:38:21.531 --> 02:38:22.364
<v Speaker 1>locations,</v>

5496
02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:26.780
<v Speaker 1>but decided not to use the ones on the sunset strip for most of the recording.</v>

5497
02:38:26.810 --> 02:38:31.460
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy and you can't really tell because he's in a dark stage.</v>

5498
02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:33.560
<v Speaker 1>He made it just like a regular show.</v>

5499
02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:35.210
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that was really smart,</v>

5500
02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:38.960
<v Speaker 1>like he didn't make the audience all lit up like they do in these new comedy</v>

5501
02:38:38.961 --> 02:38:39.830
<v Speaker 1>central specials.</v>

5502
02:38:40.010 --> 02:38:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Those motherfuckers are obsessed with lighting the room up.</v>

5503
02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:44.630
<v Speaker 1>They want a light everybody up like,</v>

5504
02:38:44.631 --> 02:38:44.781
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

5505
02:38:44.781 --> 02:38:45.230
<v Speaker 1>fuck head.</v>

5506
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:47.720
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it looks at a comedy show and when you do that,</v>

5507
02:38:47.721 --> 02:38:48.650
<v Speaker 1>the audience gets weird.</v>

5508
02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:49.531
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5509
02:38:49.531 --> 02:38:49.691
<v Speaker 1>see?</v>

5510
02:38:49.691 --> 02:38:49.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5511
02:38:49.851 --> 02:38:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of tell that's not the store.</v>

5512
02:38:52.290 --> 02:38:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5513
02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I did think it was.</v>

5514
02:38:54.470 --> 02:38:55.710
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen this in a while.</v>

5515
02:38:55.980 --> 02:39:00.350
<v Speaker 1>This'll probably one of the all time greatest comedy document.</v>

5516
02:39:00.351 --> 02:39:00.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5517
02:39:00.531 --> 02:39:05.531
<v Speaker 1>not probably one of the all time greatest comedy specials ever and just a</v>

5518
02:39:06.771 --> 02:39:08.180
<v Speaker 1>documentary as well,</v>

5519
02:39:08.181 --> 02:39:09.080
<v Speaker 1>kind of because you're,</v>

5520
02:39:09.081 --> 02:39:09.914
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of,</v>

5521
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you're looking back into this time and to 1982 when Richard Pryor was on fire.</v>

5522
02:39:16.611 --> 02:39:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5523
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:18.740
<v Speaker 1>just literally and physically,</v>

5524
02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:19.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5525
02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:21.480
<v Speaker 1>This is after he freebasing what do you know?</v>

5526
02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:26.500
<v Speaker 1>He did really get burnt and freebase accident said he did lit himself on fire.</v>

5527
02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:31.490
<v Speaker 1>The reality is he threw some liquor on him and lit himself on fire.</v>

5528
02:39:31.730 --> 02:39:33.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what actually happened to make a steevo way or like,</v>

5529
02:39:33.831 --> 02:39:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to end it all right now.</v>

5530
02:39:34.751 --> 02:39:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

5531
02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:35.271
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

5532
02:39:35.271 --> 02:39:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Now just,</v>

5533
02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:38.360
<v Speaker 1>just down in the deepest,</v>

5534
02:39:38.361 --> 02:39:38.900
<v Speaker 1>deepest,</v>

5535
02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:40.790
<v Speaker 1>darkest hole after freebasing.</v>

5536
02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:42.021
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

5537
02:39:42.021 --> 02:39:42.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5538
02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:43.400
<v Speaker 1>he admitted it later,</v>

5539
02:39:43.430 --> 02:39:44.270
<v Speaker 1>later in life,</v>

5540
02:39:44.390 --> 02:39:44.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5541
02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:46.610
<v Speaker 1>that he had tried to kill himself,</v>

5542
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:49.520
<v Speaker 1>that he lit himself on fire and they look just after that.</v>

5543
02:39:49.521 --> 02:39:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Here he is on stage killing and everybody loved him.</v>

5544
02:39:53.860 --> 02:39:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Talk about balance.</v>

5545
02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5546
02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:56.773
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

5547
02:39:58.260 --> 02:39:58.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5548
02:39:58.910 --> 02:40:02.480
<v Speaker 1>to be normal and have it goes cohesive thoughts and put those things together</v>

5549
02:40:02.481 --> 02:40:02.901
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

5550
02:40:02.901 --> 02:40:07.730
<v Speaker 1>And then at one point this year or a year or so before this,</v>

5551
02:40:07.731 --> 02:40:09.740
<v Speaker 1>you're just in that kind of down that rabbit hole.</v>

5552
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Look at backup a little bit.</v>

5553
02:40:11.391 --> 02:40:11.751
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

5554
02:40:11.751 --> 02:40:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Backup to that side view of him again.</v>

5555
02:40:13.470 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I want to point</v>

5556
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:14.873
<v Speaker 3>something out here.</v>

5557
02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Watch the way he moves.</v>

5558
02:40:16.351 --> 02:40:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Like pay attention to his hands as he's talking because we can't hear what he's</v>

5559
02:40:19.381 --> 02:40:19.960
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

5560
02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Look at the rhythm to the.</v>

5561
02:40:21.450 --> 02:40:22.283
<v Speaker 3>He's like doing.</v>

5562
02:40:22.380 --> 02:40:24.570
<v Speaker 3>He's putting on a show with his hands,</v>

5563
02:40:24.780 --> 02:40:26.280
<v Speaker 3>like while he's performing,</v>

5564
02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:31.350
<v Speaker 3>his hands are moving in this delicate controlled way that are.</v>

5565
02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:35.520
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of cool to watch and it accentuates the material itself.</v>

5566
02:40:35.521 --> 02:40:37.020
<v Speaker 3>It accentuates the joke.</v>

5567
02:40:37.380 --> 02:40:39.570
<v Speaker 3>He's moving his hands through the air.</v>

5568
02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:40.800
<v Speaker 3>Then it's like,</v>

5569
02:40:40.801 --> 02:40:42.060
<v Speaker 3>it's weird to watch.</v>

5570
02:40:42.061 --> 02:40:45.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's doing a little dance while he's also telling the joke,</v>

5571
02:40:45.390 --> 02:40:48.600
<v Speaker 3>his hands going up above his head to emphasize things.</v>

5572
02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Hands moving around.</v>

5573
02:40:49.981 --> 02:40:50.161
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5574
02:40:50.161 --> 02:40:50.341
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5575
02:40:50.341 --> 02:40:50.551
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5576
02:40:50.551 --> 02:40:50.941
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

5577
02:40:50.941 --> 02:40:52.660
<v Speaker 3>It's performers hands is.</v>

5578
02:40:52.661 --> 02:40:54.610
<v Speaker 3>He's just a really great standup.</v>

5579
02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.010
<v Speaker 3>This is not a guy just standing in front of a microphone talking.</v>

5580
02:40:59.660 --> 02:41:01.470
<v Speaker 3>There's a way that he's moving.</v>

5581
02:41:01.471 --> 02:41:02.400
<v Speaker 3>That was also funny.</v>

5582
02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:02.760
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

5583
02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:04.140
<v Speaker 3>it's cool to watch,</v>

5584
02:41:04.590 --> 02:41:07.920
<v Speaker 3>like there's a rhythm to the way he would like go and,</v>

5585
02:41:07.921 --> 02:41:10.320
<v Speaker 3>and now like he's relaxing you by walking.</v>

5586
02:41:10.530 --> 02:41:11.820
<v Speaker 3>He's in between bits,</v>

5587
02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:12.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5588
02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:14.730
<v Speaker 3>and now he's starting another one of the hands start moving again.</v>

5589
02:41:15.060 --> 02:41:16.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's doing a puppet show or something,</v>

5590
02:41:18.210 --> 02:41:18.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5591
02:41:18.730 --> 02:41:19.620
<v Speaker 3>look at the way he moves.</v>

5592
02:41:19.621 --> 02:41:22.200
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not hearing them so we can only see him,</v>

5593
02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:27.440
<v Speaker 3>but we can hear the rhythm in the type of material he wasn't doing just by the</v>

5594
02:41:27.691 --> 02:41:31.010
<v Speaker 3>way he's moving his hands and there was like,</v>

5595
02:41:31.050 --> 02:41:32.370
<v Speaker 3>that was part of what,</v>

5596
02:41:32.940 --> 02:41:33.601
<v Speaker 3>what his,</v>

5597
02:41:33.601 --> 02:41:34.680
<v Speaker 3>his act was.</v>

5598
02:41:34.860 --> 02:41:35.161
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

5599
02:41:35.161 --> 02:41:37.530
<v Speaker 3>His actual physical movements were funny.</v>

5600
02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:39.060
<v Speaker 3>They were vulnerable,</v>

5601
02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:39.561
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

5602
02:41:39.561 --> 02:41:39.890
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>

5603
02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:40.980
<v Speaker 3>there were gentle.</v>

5604
02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:44.580
<v Speaker 3>They were rhythmic and they were hypnotic like you could use.</v>

5605
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:47.460
<v Speaker 3>There was a hypnotic aspect to the way he actually moved,</v>

5606
02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:49.570
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't I guess.</v>

5607
02:41:49.571 --> 02:41:50.231
<v Speaker 4>I guess not all of them,</v>

5608
02:41:50.231 --> 02:41:55.231
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of good comics have that element I think because you have to stay</v>

5609
02:41:55.961 --> 02:42:00.961
<v Speaker 4>captivating for all time and then there's the people who get called on like</v>

5610
02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:02.351
<v Speaker 4>there for you.</v>

5611
02:42:02.351 --> 02:42:02.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5612
02:42:02.501 --> 02:42:03.850
<v Speaker 4>that was like the dig on.</v>

5613
02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:06.760
<v Speaker 4>I came in comedy at a time where like,</v>

5614
02:42:07.690 --> 02:42:09.760
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know Dane Cook enough to be like,</v>

5615
02:42:09.850 --> 02:42:11.470
<v Speaker 4>oh that assholes making it,</v>

5616
02:42:11.471 --> 02:42:12.850
<v Speaker 4>but there was a lot of around me,</v>

5617
02:42:12.910 --> 02:42:13.500
<v Speaker 4>people that,</v>

5618
02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:13.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5619
02:42:13.691 --> 02:42:13.871
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

5620
02:42:13.871 --> 02:42:14.111
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5621
02:42:14.111 --> 02:42:18.400
<v Speaker 4>he's just hurricane and jerking around on stage and that's all it is and a bunch</v>

5622
02:42:18.401 --> 02:42:19.001
<v Speaker 4>of nonsense.</v>

5623
02:42:19.001 --> 02:42:19.361
<v Speaker 4>But I was like,</v>

5624
02:42:19.361 --> 02:42:19.610
<v Speaker 4>mom,</v>

5625
02:42:19.610 --> 02:42:20.470
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something to it.</v>

5626
02:42:20.471 --> 02:42:20.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5627
02:42:20.651 --> 02:42:22.260
<v Speaker 4>there was definitely an element of what he did with that.</v>

5628
02:42:22.270 --> 02:42:24.540
<v Speaker 4>That was something to what he did.</v>

5629
02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:25.330
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

5630
02:42:25.330 --> 02:42:25.751
<v Speaker 4>I'd be,</v>

5631
02:42:25.751 --> 02:42:27.640
<v Speaker 4>I'd be lying if I said Dane Cook and make me laugh.</v>

5632
02:42:27.641 --> 02:42:28.960
<v Speaker 4>I man my life through a bunch of stuff.</v>

5633
02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Will,</v>

5634
02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:31.730
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people enjoyed his movements,</v>

5635
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:32.061
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5636
02:42:32.061 --> 02:42:35.300
<v Speaker 3>But there's a thing about that style of comedy and like,</v>

5637
02:42:35.301 --> 02:42:35.631
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

5638
02:42:35.631 --> 02:42:36.080
<v Speaker 3>here's another,</v>

5639
02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:36.980
<v Speaker 3>here's a better example,</v>

5640
02:42:36.981 --> 02:42:37.431
<v Speaker 3>like emo,</v>

5641
02:42:37.431 --> 02:42:38.264
<v Speaker 3>Philips,</v>

5642
02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:38.841
<v Speaker 3>Emo,</v>

5643
02:42:38.841 --> 02:42:39.261
<v Speaker 3>Philips.</v>

5644
02:42:39.261 --> 02:42:41.570
<v Speaker 3>That Shit works when you're 25,</v>

5645
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:43.490
<v Speaker 3>that shit works when you're 35,</v>

5646
02:42:43.850 --> 02:42:46.130
<v Speaker 3>but when you're 45 people start going,</v>

5647
02:42:46.131 --> 02:42:46.581
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

5648
02:42:46.581 --> 02:42:48.050
<v Speaker 3>why you talking like that?</v>

5649
02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:48.591
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5650
02:42:48.591 --> 02:42:49.820
<v Speaker 3>like why you doing that?</v>

5651
02:42:49.821 --> 02:42:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that that I'm pretending,</v>

5652
02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:54.190
<v Speaker 3>especially when that I know,</v>

5653
02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:57.920
<v Speaker 3>especially when you pull the curtain and you do interviews and shit.</v>

5654
02:42:57.921 --> 02:42:58.754
<v Speaker 3>Like bobcat.</v>

5655
02:42:58.790 --> 02:43:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Bobcat had abandoned his,</v>

5656
02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:01.940
<v Speaker 3>his early persona.</v>

5657
02:43:02.090 --> 02:43:03.080
<v Speaker 3>He's pretty open about that.</v>

5658
02:43:03.081 --> 02:43:04.070
<v Speaker 3>He talks about it but his,</v>

5659
02:43:05.740 --> 02:43:06.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5660
02:43:06.450 --> 02:43:07.283
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5661
02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:07.940
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>

5662
02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 3>he would have this crazy wild fucking pulling his hair</v>

5663
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:15.080
<v Speaker 1>and screen and innovate really funny shit it.</v>

5664
02:43:15.270 --> 02:43:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5665
02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And you could watch that one.</v>

5666
02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:18.251
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was called,</v>

5667
02:43:18.251 --> 02:43:19.084
<v Speaker 1>but I remember running into.</v>

5668
02:43:19.090 --> 02:43:21.390
<v Speaker 1>We used to when I was younger is that he's wearing like a,</v>

5669
02:43:21.430 --> 02:43:24.910
<v Speaker 1>like a sleeveless cowboy shirt almost on the cover of it and he's like super</v>

5670
02:43:24.911 --> 02:43:27.610
<v Speaker 1>sweaty and he areas area can tab Kohl's,</v>

5671
02:43:27.611 --> 02:43:30.850
<v Speaker 1>but he actually stops doing.</v>

5672
02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:33.400
<v Speaker 1>He never announces it just somewhere in the middle of the set.</v>

5673
02:43:33.401 --> 02:43:34.000
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

5674
02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.460
<v Speaker 1>that fades away that the character is doing.</v>

5675
02:43:36.461 --> 02:43:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

5676
02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:40.930
<v Speaker 1>We'd probably got annoyed with it after awhile and putting it in the middle of</v>

5677
02:43:40.931 --> 02:43:42.090
<v Speaker 1>that actual set as well.</v>

5678
02:43:42.130 --> 02:43:43.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean he still had the long hair and everything.</v>

5679
02:43:43.631 --> 02:43:44.464
<v Speaker 1>It was like a.</v>

5680
02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:45.320
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

5681
02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:45.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5682
02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Just stops doing in the middle.</v>

5683
02:43:46.451 --> 02:43:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Which I thought was interesting was odd,</v>

5684
02:43:48.851 --> 02:43:51.580
<v Speaker 1>but when you commit to that character full time at you and you have to worry</v>

5685
02:43:51.581 --> 02:43:52.180
<v Speaker 1>about the emo.</v>

5686
02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Philips is a good example.</v>

5687
02:43:53.081 --> 02:43:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I wonder about a Mitch Fatel,</v>

5688
02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Mitch.</v>

5689
02:43:56.440 --> 02:43:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Very much like A.</v>

5690
02:43:57.881 --> 02:44:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I've worked with him and recently it's a.</v>

5691
02:44:01.810 --> 02:44:03.190
<v Speaker 1>When you starting to show age on your face,</v>

5692
02:44:03.191 --> 02:44:04.570
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to be at the Manchild,</v>

5693
02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:05.201
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

5694
02:44:05.201 --> 02:44:07.010
<v Speaker 1>It's still tiny guy so it works and everything,</v>

5695
02:44:07.470 --> 02:44:10.490
<v Speaker 1>but I just like how long will it like right there.</v>

5696
02:44:10.530 --> 02:44:12.220
<v Speaker 1>There might be a very definitive</v>

5697
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:14.663
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>

5698
02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:15.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5699
02:44:15.701 --> 02:44:17.350
<v Speaker 1>like a bomb shelter type ceiling.</v>

5700
02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:18.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

5701
02:44:18.491 --> 02:44:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Like the Emo,</v>

5702
02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Phillips was the big one.</v>

5703
02:44:21.670 --> 02:44:24.190
<v Speaker 1>That was a big one because I remember watching him all of a sudden just do</v>

5704
02:44:24.191 --> 02:44:25.270
<v Speaker 1>regular standup and I was like,</v>

5705
02:44:26.020 --> 02:44:28.990
<v Speaker 1>but I've watched like a transitionary time where he wasn't just doing regular</v>

5706
02:44:28.991 --> 02:44:33.520
<v Speaker 1>standup was kind of like doing a softer version of his old self the way he used</v>

5707
02:44:33.521 --> 02:44:34.360
<v Speaker 1>to do comedy.</v>

5708
02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:35.080
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

5709
02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:35.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5710
02:44:35.441 --> 02:44:37.120
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on at midnight doing it,</v>

5711
02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:38.261
<v Speaker 1>which was weird.</v>

5712
02:44:38.261 --> 02:44:39.070
<v Speaker 1>He was doing it on,</v>

5713
02:44:39.070 --> 02:44:40.000
<v Speaker 1>on that show.</v>

5714
02:44:40.001 --> 02:44:40.490
<v Speaker 1>He was tall.</v>

5715
02:44:40.490 --> 02:44:41.323
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

5716
02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:43.600
<v Speaker 1>just very,</v>

5717
02:44:43.601 --> 02:44:44.434
<v Speaker 1>very weird.</v>

5718
02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:45.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5719
02:44:45.011 --> 02:44:46.210
<v Speaker 1>you can't fault that if it works.</v>

5720
02:44:46.260 --> 02:44:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Hi Chris Hardwick.</v>

5721
02:44:49.950 --> 02:44:52.510
<v Speaker 1>How do you properly dispose a bacon grease?</v>

5722
02:44:52.900 --> 02:44:55.670
<v Speaker 1>You gotta throw in the garbage or you know the garbage or.</v>

5723
02:44:56.230 --> 02:44:56.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5724
02:44:56.471 --> 02:44:57.251
<v Speaker 1>you can throw it in the garbage.</v>

5725
02:44:57.251 --> 02:44:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Not In the pipes.</v>

5726
02:44:58.210 --> 02:44:58.440
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

5727
02:44:58.440 --> 02:44:58.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5728
02:44:58.651 --> 02:44:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't throw the pipes.</v>

5729
02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:00.371
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5730
02:45:00.371 --> 02:45:01.150
<v Speaker 1>um.</v>

5731
02:45:01.150 --> 02:45:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like Flash,</v>

5732
02:45:02.860 --> 02:45:03.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5733
02:45:03.101 --> 02:45:04.930
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you aren't going to get rid of fat,</v>

5734
02:45:05.050 --> 02:45:05.980
<v Speaker 1>how would you get rid of fat?</v>

5735
02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Throw it outside.</v>

5736
02:45:08.531 --> 02:45:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5737
02:45:09.090 --> 02:45:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean why would you put it on a tree?</v>

5738
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:12.820
<v Speaker 1>You mean under a tree?</v>

5739
02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like fertilizer.</v>

5740
02:45:14.530 --> 02:45:15.363
<v Speaker 1>Just dry my dog.</v>

5741
02:45:15.370 --> 02:45:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Next.</v>

02:45:16.661 --> 02:45:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Like fight club dude bro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5747
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Human fat from a liposuction clinic.</v>

5748
02:45:27.450 --> 02:45:30.130
<v Speaker 1>I think you want to fight club to that comic book.</v>

5749
02:45:30.900 --> 02:45:32.410
<v Speaker 1>He wrote the book.</v>

5750
02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:33.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5751
02:45:33.071 --> 02:45:33.940
<v Speaker 1>he just wrote the book.</v>

5752
02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:34.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5753
02:45:34.481 --> 02:45:35.314
<v Speaker 1>is it done?</v>

5754
02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:37.980
<v Speaker 1>It just came out or it's about to come out here.</v>

5755
02:45:38.650 --> 02:45:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Did the cover artwork really?</v>

5756
02:45:41.410 --> 02:45:42.243
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>

5757
02:45:42.490 --> 02:45:44.200
<v Speaker 1>So are they going to make another movie?</v>

5758
02:45:44.290 --> 02:45:45.123
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

5759
02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Best movie ever it was.</v>

5760
02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:50.680
<v Speaker 1>There's a part two that was so not the best movie I love.</v>

5761
02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Have you rewatch that horse?</v>

5762
02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:52.910
<v Speaker 1>I rewatched.</v>

5763
02:45:52.910 --> 02:45:54.010
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>

5764
02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I liked the movie heat a lot,</v>

5765
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:57.430
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to heat too.</v>

5766
02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:01.270
<v Speaker 1>It's fun up until the moment where you find out that he's the same guy and</v>

5767
02:46:01.271 --> 02:46:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

5768
02:46:01.690 --> 02:46:03.630
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>

5769
02:46:03.631 --> 02:46:03.970
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

5770
02:46:03.970 --> 02:46:04.890
<v Speaker 1>You watch memento.</v>

5771
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Memento is good.</v>

5772
02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:10.490
<v Speaker 1>You hate it that you hated the Switcheroo so stupid.</v>

5773
02:46:10.491 --> 02:46:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5774
02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:10.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5775
02:46:10.881 --> 02:46:11.950
<v Speaker 1>you're the same guy.</v>

5776
02:46:11.951 --> 02:46:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Is this guy that you've been falling around and he's been teaching you to fight.</v>

5777
02:46:14.781 --> 02:46:15.614
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>

5778
02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:17.660
<v Speaker 1>You just forgot and now you remember,</v>

5779
02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:18.340
<v Speaker 1>oh great,</v>

5780
02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:20.920
<v Speaker 1>now you're going to blow up a building or something stupid like the fuck out.</v>

5781
02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:22.830
<v Speaker 1>When I've watched it,</v>

5782
02:46:23.810 --> 02:46:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I've been convinced to enjoy it much more as a.</v>

5783
02:46:26.890 --> 02:46:31.070
<v Speaker 1>But when I saw it in the theater the first time and that was like one of the</v>

5784
02:46:31.071 --> 02:46:35.390
<v Speaker 1>first movies in the theater I saw that was like a little odd and different.</v>

5785
02:46:35.391 --> 02:46:35.781
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

5786
02:46:35.781 --> 02:46:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I usually just kind of went saw,</v>

5787
02:46:37.191 --> 02:46:38.630
<v Speaker 1>like whatever the blockbusters were.</v>

5788
02:46:38.631 --> 02:46:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty middle of the road on my movie tastes at that age,</v>

5789
02:46:41.421 --> 02:46:42.380
<v Speaker 1>but like when I went to go see that,</v>

5790
02:46:42.381 --> 02:46:42.591
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5791
02:46:42.591 --> 02:46:43.840
<v Speaker 1>it was so bizarre at the ending.</v>

5792
02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:44.121
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5793
02:46:44.121 --> 02:46:44.751
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of law.</v>

5794
02:46:44.751 --> 02:46:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even get it for me,</v>

5795
02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was a safe person,</v>

5796
02:46:47.161 --> 02:46:47.990
<v Speaker 1>but I was just like,</v>

5797
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:50.660
<v Speaker 1>there's just like a weird shit at the end of the movie and also for me falls</v>

5798
02:46:50.661 --> 02:46:53.630
<v Speaker 1>into that same sort of categories of fake Jimi Hendrix guitar thing.</v>

5799
02:46:53.860 --> 02:46:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching people beat the shit out of each other and like,</v>

5800
02:46:55.550 --> 02:46:56.180
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

5801
02:46:56.180 --> 02:46:57.950
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to fuck beat out of them.</v>

5802
02:46:57.951 --> 02:47:00.440
<v Speaker 1>You certainly not going to get a whole basement of dudes willing to beat the</v>

5803
02:47:00.441 --> 02:47:01.280
<v Speaker 1>fuck out of each other.</v>

5804
02:47:01.281 --> 02:47:02.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to happen.</v>

5805
02:47:02.241 --> 02:47:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>

5806
02:47:02.620 --> 02:47:03.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5807
02:47:03.030 --> 02:47:04.040
<v Speaker 1>will die for you.</v>

5808
02:47:04.420 --> 02:47:05.061
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>

5809
02:47:05.061 --> 02:47:08.240
<v Speaker 1>You get hit once you get really bare knuckled once in the face,</v>

5810
02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:10.850
<v Speaker 1>very unlikely you're going to keep doing that.</v>

5811
02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Very unlikely.</v>

5812
02:47:12.530 --> 02:47:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Showing up at work with black eyes all the time.</v>

5813
02:47:14.811 --> 02:47:14.991
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5814
02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:15.620
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

5815
02:47:15.620 --> 02:47:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you just learn how to fight it?</v>

5816
02:47:17.301 --> 02:47:18.081
<v Speaker 1>A martial arts school?</v>

5817
02:47:18.081 --> 02:47:18.914
<v Speaker 1>You fucking idiot.</v>

5818
02:47:19.180 --> 02:47:21.500
<v Speaker 1>You got to meet with some asshole in a parking lot.</v>

5819
02:47:21.501 --> 02:47:23.180
<v Speaker 1>You guys are going to beat each other's brains out.</v>

5820
02:47:23.380 --> 02:47:24.390
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get on top of you.</v>

5821
02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:25.430
<v Speaker 1>You're pretty anymore.</v>

5822
02:47:25.550 --> 02:47:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Remember that with jared Leto to beat them bloody until his fucking face was can</v>

5823
02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:30.733
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

5824
02:47:31.130 --> 02:47:31.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a good movie.</v>

5825
02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:32.703
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

5826
02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:34.060
<v Speaker 1>what'd you feel about.</v>

5827
02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:34.900
<v Speaker 1>What'd you feel about?</v>

5828
02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I thought one of the dumbest scenes to me was,</v>

5829
02:47:36.831 --> 02:47:37.664
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5830
02:47:38.830 --> 02:47:41.660
<v Speaker 1>when Edward Norton was that 25th hour.</v>

5831
02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that at the end when he's like,</v>

5832
02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I can't go and look in this pretty so beat me up.</v>

5833
02:47:45.951 --> 02:47:46.370
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5834
02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:49.100
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be pretty again in a couple of weeks.</v>

5835
02:47:49.980 --> 02:47:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Was going to buy your butthole like four weeks.</v>

5836
02:47:52.180 --> 02:47:55.940
<v Speaker 1>It just go and pretty and fight that guy like to tried to fuck your.</v>

5837
02:47:55.941 --> 02:47:57.480
<v Speaker 1>But how stupid is that?</v>

5838
02:47:58.640 --> 02:47:59.600
<v Speaker 1>He's that certain.</v>

5839
02:47:59.610 --> 02:48:01.730
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get fucked in the ass right away.</v>

5840
02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee that some more Hollywood fuckery that some stores has never been</v>

5841
02:48:06.231 --> 02:48:08.750
<v Speaker 1>punched and I think you should go and beat up.</v>

5842
02:48:08.751 --> 02:48:09.080
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna.</v>

5843
02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Get his buddy to beat him up.</v>

5844
02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:11.790
<v Speaker 1>This is the big term,</v>

5845
02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:13.190
<v Speaker 1>mercifully by the way,</v>

5846
02:48:13.210 --> 02:48:13.670
<v Speaker 1>it was like a.</v>

5847
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It was like a crazy bad.</v>

5848
02:48:14.851 --> 02:48:16.510
<v Speaker 1>You lose your vision from those sometimes.</v>

5849
02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:17.031
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you lose.</v>

5850
02:48:17.031 --> 02:48:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Your sense of smell is guys lose their tastes.</v>

5851
02:48:19.821 --> 02:48:22.490
<v Speaker 1>They can't taste things after they get punched in the head.</v>

5852
02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:24.550
<v Speaker 1>It literally don't know what things taste like.</v>

5853
02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Like this idea that someone's just going to punch you and you just get a little</v>

5854
02:48:27.171 --> 02:48:28.010
<v Speaker 1>bruised up a little.</v>

5855
02:48:28.130 --> 02:48:29.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not a Charley horse.</v>

5856
02:48:29.151 --> 02:48:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5857
02:48:29.460 --> 02:48:31.070
<v Speaker 1>He's punched in your fucking brain,</v>

5858
02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:33.320
<v Speaker 1>punching where you store your brain.</v>

5859
02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:36.620
<v Speaker 1>This is the container where your brain's in and it only has so many times.</v>

5860
02:48:36.621 --> 02:48:37.790
<v Speaker 1>It could even move like that.</v>

5861
02:48:37.850 --> 02:48:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Getting bounced off the curb the fuck out of here.</v>

5862
02:48:41.090 --> 02:48:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just ridiculous.</v>

5863
02:48:43.010 --> 02:48:48.010
<v Speaker 1>The trivialization of brain hemorrhaging and brain trauma and beat downs like</v>

5864
02:48:48.111 --> 02:48:48.351
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

5865
02:48:48.351 --> 02:48:49.184
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5866
02:48:49.310 --> 02:48:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I can't go along with that.</v>

5867
02:48:50.511 --> 02:48:51.171
<v Speaker 1>I know too much.</v>

5868
02:48:51.171 --> 02:48:54.110
<v Speaker 1>I've seen too many people get the fucking brains beaten out of them.</v>

5869
02:48:54.140 --> 02:48:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it too many times,</v>

5870
02:48:55.820 --> 02:48:56.810
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't like fight club,</v>

5871
02:48:57.170 --> 02:48:59.300
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't like it.</v>

5872
02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:00.413
<v Speaker 1>You like warrior?</v>

5873
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

5874
02:49:01.220 --> 02:49:02.390
<v Speaker 1>but it was bullshit.</v>

5875
02:49:02.650 --> 02:49:04.010
<v Speaker 1>You can't fight two days in a row,</v>

5876
02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:06.980
<v Speaker 1>you just can't be so fucked up from the first fight.</v>

5877
02:49:06.990 --> 02:49:07.823
<v Speaker 1>No one gets</v>

5878
02:49:08.430 --> 02:49:09.630
<v Speaker 3>fired back to back.</v>

5879
02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5880
02:49:10.170 --> 02:49:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I would take back in one day.</v>

5881
02:49:11.791 --> 02:49:12.660
<v Speaker 3>Any day over that.</v>

5882
02:49:13.380 --> 02:49:13.591
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5883
02:49:13.591 --> 02:49:17.100
<v Speaker 3>I think fight club is a better movie than warrior is definitely a better as a</v>

5884
02:49:17.101 --> 02:49:17.460
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

5885
02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:18.293
<v Speaker 3>Well better,</v>

5886
02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:19.261
<v Speaker 3>much better movie.</v>

5887
02:49:19.261 --> 02:49:19.940
<v Speaker 3>It's just that,</v>

5888
02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:24.240
<v Speaker 3>that one reveal I can almost deal with the idea that these guys like were filled</v>

5889
02:49:24.241 --> 02:49:25.051
<v Speaker 3>with angst so much.</v>

5890
02:49:25.051 --> 02:49:27.360
<v Speaker 3>They were wanting to beat each other up just so they could feel alive.</v>

5891
02:49:27.900 --> 02:49:29.580
<v Speaker 3>I could kind of get that for a little bit,</v>

5892
02:49:30.090 --> 02:49:30.790
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

5893
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:31.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5894
02:49:31.150 --> 02:49:31.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5895
02:49:31.370 --> 02:49:31.580
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5896
02:49:31.580 --> 02:49:32.790
<v Speaker 3>no one had any technique,</v>

5897
02:49:32.850 --> 02:49:36.060
<v Speaker 3>no one that doesn't make any sense to me that guys wouldn't actually learn how</v>

5898
02:49:36.061 --> 02:49:38.220
<v Speaker 3>to fight sweet little titties.</v>

5899
02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:39.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5900
02:49:39.330 --> 02:49:40.280
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

5901
02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:41.233
<v Speaker 3>what was I gonna say?</v>

5902
02:49:42.470 --> 02:49:43.303
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5903
02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:46.440
<v Speaker 3>you bought into the fact that they were just at the turnaround,</v>

5904
02:49:46.590 --> 02:49:47.270
<v Speaker 3>the flip,</v>

5905
02:49:47.270 --> 02:49:47.431
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5906
02:49:47.431 --> 02:49:51.930
<v Speaker 3>the reveal that it was the same guy was just so dumb and if it gets cold,</v>

5907
02:49:52.890 --> 02:49:54.570
<v Speaker 3>you can't pretend that he was just,</v>

5908
02:49:54.571 --> 02:49:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5909
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:59.760
<v Speaker 3>it was just a dream to make your whole movies based on like a switcheroo.</v>

5910
02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole movie is a big switcheroo.</v>

5911
02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Did not see that latest episodes of grey's anatomy.</v>

5912
02:50:04.430 --> 02:50:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Then when.</v>

5913
02:50:05.010 --> 02:50:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Mr. Don't worry about that.</v>

5914
02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:12.900
<v Speaker 3>You do a Switcheroo oh there's that thousand horrible switcher in that you do</v>

5915
02:50:13.801 --> 02:50:16.110
<v Speaker 3>not have to worry about me watching.</v>

5916
02:50:16.111 --> 02:50:16.944
<v Speaker 3>That's what the,</v>

5917
02:50:16.970 --> 02:50:18.360
<v Speaker 3>the ending of Dexter.</v>

5918
02:50:18.660 --> 02:50:18.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5919
02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:20.570
<v Speaker 3>just to the shittiest thing of all time.</v>

5920
02:50:20.610 --> 02:50:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it to me so much.</v>

5921
02:50:21.990 --> 02:50:22.823
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>

5922
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:25.080
<v Speaker 3>It was horrible.</v>

5923
02:50:25.230 --> 02:50:28.470
<v Speaker 3>Well that was one of the things that I really appreciated about the movie is</v>

5924
02:50:28.471 --> 02:50:29.310
<v Speaker 3>there's none of that.</v>

5925
02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:30.660
<v Speaker 3>Every scene in that movie.</v>

5926
02:50:30.690 --> 02:50:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Did you see it now?</v>

5927

<v Speaker 3>It's so smart.</v>

5931
02:50:36.511 --> 02:50:39.390
<v Speaker 3>It's so well done that you buy every step of the way.</v>

5932
02:50:39.391 --> 02:50:40.860
<v Speaker 3>Like there's never one part in the movie.</v>

5933
02:50:40.861 --> 02:50:43.050
<v Speaker 3>We like get the fuck outta here because they're dark flick.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

02:51:03.661 --> 02:51:06.720
<v Speaker 3>very affordable solar power battery that he's invented.</v>

5953
02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:08.410
<v Speaker 3>There's 3,500 bucks.</v>

5954
02:51:08.411 --> 02:51:09.960
<v Speaker 3>They could charge a fucking whole house.</v>

5955
02:51:10.050 --> 02:51:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5956
02:51:10.570 --> 02:51:12.330
<v Speaker 3>A total game changer.</v>

5957
02:51:12.510 --> 02:51:13.171
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen this shit,</v>

5958
02:51:13.171 --> 02:51:14.004
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

5959
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.970
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

5960
02:51:14.971 --> 02:51:15.631
<v Speaker 3>There's a video,</v>

5961
02:51:15.631 --> 02:51:16.464
<v Speaker 3>if you go on.</v>

5962
02:51:16.650 --> 02:51:20.490
<v Speaker 3>My twitter feed is a video that I retweeted that somebody sent me a youtube</v>

5963
02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:21.810
<v Speaker 3>video of him explaining it.</v>

5964
02:51:22.410 --> 02:51:27.410
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking complete total game changer when it comes to batteries and a wall</v>

5965
02:51:29.101 --> 02:51:30.030
<v Speaker 3>mounted units.</v>

5966
02:51:30.210 --> 02:51:33.600
<v Speaker 3>You can stack as many as nine of these wall mounted units.</v>

5967
02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:34.890
<v Speaker 3>That 3,500 bucks,</v>

5968
02:51:34.891 --> 02:51:36.420
<v Speaker 3>which is solar power,</v>

5969
02:51:36.421 --> 02:51:38.670
<v Speaker 3>was like really prohibitively expensive for most people.</v>

5970
02:51:38.670 --> 02:51:39.151
<v Speaker 3>Like super,</v>

5971
02:51:39.151 --> 02:51:39.811
<v Speaker 3>super expensive.</v>

5972
02:51:39.811 --> 02:51:40.644
<v Speaker 3>Those batteries,</v>

5973
02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:42.390
<v Speaker 3>the techs all fucked up.</v>

5974
02:51:42.391 --> 02:51:43.021
<v Speaker 3>They stink.</v>

5975
02:51:43.021 --> 02:51:44.130
<v Speaker 3>They're all they overheat.</v>

5976
02:51:44.131 --> 02:51:44.964
<v Speaker 3>They're dangerous,</v>

5977
02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:46.860
<v Speaker 3>but apparently this fucking dude is nailed it.</v>

5978
02:51:47.370 --> 02:51:48.203
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5979
02:51:48.280 --> 02:51:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5980
02:51:48.520 --> 02:51:50.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously not a fucking expert on batteries,</v>

5981
02:51:50.970 --> 02:51:52.170
<v Speaker 3>but people are very,</v>

5982
02:51:52.171 --> 02:51:53.730
<v Speaker 3>very excited about this fucking thing.</v>

5983
02:51:54.260 --> 02:51:55.420
<v Speaker 3>That cars.</v>

5984
02:51:55.470 --> 02:51:56.930
<v Speaker 3>We'll take our air corps to go Baltimore.</v>

5985
02:51:57.080 --> 02:51:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5986
02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:58.321
<v Speaker 3>Give us some volume.</v>

5987
02:51:58.321 --> 02:52:00.310
<v Speaker 3>We'll close out with this because we've got to get the fuck out of here.</v>

5988
02:52:00.390 --> 02:52:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Twenty minutes long will give us just a little bit of volume here.</v>

5989
02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:03.180
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

5990
02:52:03.180 --> 02:52:03.931
<v Speaker 3>Play a little bit of.</v>

5991
02:52:03.931 --> 02:52:05.590
<v Speaker 3>It was a beautiful man.</v>

5992
02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful Iron man type motherfucker.</v>

5993
02:52:08.090 --> 02:52:12.200
<v Speaker 6>We call the Tesla powerwall and if you look back against that wall,</v>

5994
02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:14.660
<v Speaker 6>you'll see a whole bunch of them as well in different colors.</v>

5995
02:52:16.020 --> 02:52:17.730
<v Speaker 3>How long for this guy makes an iron man suit?</v>

5996
02:52:17.731 --> 02:52:19.020
<v Speaker 3>You can pick your favorite color.</v>

5997
02:52:19.710 --> 02:52:20.330
<v Speaker 3>He's Ironman</v>

5998
02:52:20.330 --> 02:52:22.640
<v Speaker 6>and it looks like a beautiful sculpture on the wall.</v>

5999
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:25.530
<v Speaker 6>So it's very important.</v>

6000
02:52:25.700 --> 02:52:29.000
<v Speaker 6>I want to point out a few things that are very important about this.</v>

6001
02:52:29.270 --> 02:52:30.103
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

6002
02:52:30.320 --> 02:52:32.450
<v Speaker 6>the fact that it's wall mounted is,</v>

6003
02:52:32.470 --> 02:52:36.230
<v Speaker 6>is vital because it means you don't need to have a battery room.</v>

6004
02:52:36.620 --> 02:52:39.470
<v Speaker 6>He don't have to have some room filled with nasty batteries.</v>

6005
02:52:40.490 --> 02:52:45.490
<v Speaker 6>It means that a normal household can mount this on their garage or on the</v>

6006
02:52:45.771 --> 02:52:49.490
<v Speaker 6>outside wall of their house and it doesn't take up any room.</v>

6007
02:52:50.520 --> 02:52:50.790
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

6008
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:51.000
<v Speaker 6>it's.</v>

6009
02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:52.580
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's flat against the wall.</v>

6010
02:52:52.581 --> 02:52:53.060
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

6011
02:52:53.060 --> 02:52:55.370
<v Speaker 6>it has all of the integrated safety systems,</v>

6012
02:52:55.410 --> 02:52:56.660
<v Speaker 6>the incredibles</v>

6013
02:52:57.420 --> 02:52:58.253
<v Speaker 3>dcdd</v>

6014
02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:00.473
<v Speaker 3>design.</v>

6015
02:53:01.080 --> 02:53:01.913
<v Speaker 3>Something</v>

6016
02:53:03.710 --> 02:53:05.440
<v Speaker 3>like this guy is like a guy in a movie.</v>

6017
02:53:05.470 --> 02:53:05.810
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

6018
02:53:05.810 --> 02:53:07.220
<v Speaker 3>it addresses all the needs,</v>

6019
02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:08.301
<v Speaker 3>so watch that.</v>

6020
02:53:08.301 --> 02:53:08.540
<v Speaker 3>Folks,</v>

6021
02:53:08.540 --> 02:53:09.890
<v Speaker 3>do you want to watch because we're out of time here,</v>

6022
02:53:10.570 --> 02:53:12.350
<v Speaker 3>but this guy's like a guy in the movie.</v>

6023
02:53:12.351 --> 02:53:17.351
<v Speaker 3>He's like a super billionaire genius inventor from a movie mean makes a car that</v>

6024
02:53:17.541 --> 02:53:18.530
<v Speaker 3>everybody falls in love with.</v>

6025
02:53:18.531 --> 02:53:20.420
<v Speaker 3>It's got a God damn laptop in the middle of it.</v>

6026
02:53:20.610 --> 02:53:21.620
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen those?</v>

6027
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6028
02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:23.890
<v Speaker 3>My friend got one.</v>

6029
02:53:23.891 --> 02:53:24.724
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

6030
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.710
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

6031
02:53:25.710 --> 02:53:27.320
<v Speaker 3>there's no feeling of shift at all.</v>

6032
02:53:27.321 --> 02:53:28.640
<v Speaker 3>It's just this acceleration.</v>

6033
02:53:28.730 --> 02:53:30.460
<v Speaker 3>There's a new one that comes out next year though.</v>

6034
02:53:30.461 --> 02:53:31.490
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be a lot better.</v>

6035
02:53:31.491 --> 02:53:32.210
<v Speaker 3>I heard.</v>

6036
02:53:32.210 --> 02:53:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Well she forgot.</v>

6037
02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:34.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's next year.</v>

6038
02:53:34.770 --> 02:53:36.710
<v Speaker 3>His a new tesla or tesla.</v>

6039
02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:39.690
<v Speaker 3>We had a new model that he gave you that's unbelievably fast.</v>

6040
02:53:39.730 --> 02:53:41.840
<v Speaker 3>Zero to 60 in like three something seconds.</v>

6041
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.823
<v Speaker 3>All Electric,</v>

6042
02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:43.873
<v Speaker 3>all electric,</v>

6043
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:45.230
<v Speaker 3>but they still can't go to vegas.</v>

6044
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Still can't go to vegas.</v>

6045
02:53:47.060 --> 02:53:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

6046
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:48.343
<v Speaker 3>You have to stop.</v>

6047
02:53:48.520 --> 02:53:51.650
<v Speaker 3>Stopped halfway there and charge up in the middle of fucking desert at some</v>

6048
02:53:51.651 --> 02:53:52.061
<v Speaker 3>creep.</v>

6049
02:53:52.061 --> 02:53:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Head fucking Weirdos.</v>

6050
02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Stop where you plug in and you got to wait for half an hour while they circle</v>

6051
02:53:58.191 --> 02:54:00.500
<v Speaker 3>you like buzzards because they know you can't go anywhere.</v>

6052
02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:01.101
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>

6053
02:54:01.101 --> 02:54:02.650
<v Speaker 3>you can't even drive with that right now.</v>

6054
02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:04.730
<v Speaker 3>If you gone drive with that and right now,</v>

6055
02:54:04.731 --> 02:54:05.930
<v Speaker 3>how far do you think you get?</v>

6056
02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:07.033
<v Speaker 3>How long does it last?</v>

6057
02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:07.930
<v Speaker 3>How long does it last?</v>

6058
02:54:08.330 --> 02:54:12.200
<v Speaker 3>You might get 350 miles out of a tank.</v>

6059
02:54:12.730 --> 02:54:13.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6060
02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:14.000
<v Speaker 3>a charge rather.</v>

6061
02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:14.893
<v Speaker 3>You might.</v>

6062
02:54:15.020 --> 02:54:17.810
<v Speaker 3>But if you're driving fast you won't be driving fast.</v>

6063
02:54:17.811 --> 02:54:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Is gonna eat it?</v>

6064
02:54:18.350 --> 02:54:20.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm usually more having a bunch of apps open.</v>

6065
02:54:20.730 --> 02:54:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6066
02:54:21.140 --> 02:54:21.980
<v Speaker 3>it's going to eat it up.</v>

6067
02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:27.160
<v Speaker 3>So like when it starts slowing a DMZ inside lights does all the shit do a.</v>

6068
02:54:28.100 --> 02:54:32.360
<v Speaker 3>like Aubrey has won the almost almost died out on his way home one night because</v>

6069
02:54:32.361 --> 02:54:33.830
<v Speaker 3>he left it at his office.</v>

6070
02:54:33.831 --> 02:54:35.180
<v Speaker 3>And when you leave it somewhere,</v>

6071
02:54:35.181 --> 02:54:36.560
<v Speaker 3>it slowly drains the battery.</v>

6072
02:54:36.561 --> 02:54:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6073
02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't leave it and just go away for three weeks and come back to fully.</v>

6074
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:40.401
<v Speaker 3>It'll be typed up.</v>

6075
02:54:40.401 --> 02:54:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Battery.</v>

6076
02:54:41.210 --> 02:54:45.440
<v Speaker 3>It'll be hurting having your iphone and just leaving it on the kitchen table for</v>

6077
02:54:45.441 --> 02:54:45.780
<v Speaker 3>a week.</v>

6078
02:54:45.780 --> 02:54:46.660
<v Speaker 3>Leaving it on.</v>

6079
02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:47.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6080
02:54:47.230 --> 02:54:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6081
02:54:47.810 --> 02:54:48.643
<v Speaker 3>because it's also,</v>

6082
02:54:48.650 --> 02:54:49.700
<v Speaker 3>it's also an iphone,</v>

6083
02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:50.111
<v Speaker 3>like a.</v>

6084
02:54:50.111 --> 02:54:51.320
<v Speaker 3>not like a cell phone.</v>

6085
02:54:51.321 --> 02:54:52.700
<v Speaker 3>It's got a three g connection,</v>

6086
02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:53.810
<v Speaker 3>only three g,</v>

6087
02:54:53.810 --> 02:54:54.643
<v Speaker 3>which is wack.</v>

6088
02:54:54.950 --> 02:54:57.170
<v Speaker 3>But it's constantly connected to the Internet.</v>

6089
02:54:57.171 --> 02:55:02.171
<v Speaker 3>So like you could say google a flock of seagulls and it'll pull up flock of and</v>

6090
02:55:03.381 --> 02:55:04.100
<v Speaker 3>you'll start play</v>

6091
02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:08.380
<v Speaker 1>flock of seagulls and we'll give you some options and you just start with a far</v>

6092
02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:09.440
