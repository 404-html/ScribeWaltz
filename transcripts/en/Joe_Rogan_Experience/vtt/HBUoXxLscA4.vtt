00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.520
This is episode 500 of the,
you know my name,

2
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.700
podcast 500 can't say my name anymore.

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.820
I've decided that it's very dueschy.
If you say your own name

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.240
as much as you possibly can avoid,

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.670
this episode is brought to you by legal zoom.
Any legal troubles,
Tom,

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.750
who wrote that lately?

7
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.290
Doug's 10 hope not have legal troubles like say if you want.

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.670
Well,
here's the best use of it.
Not Troubles,

9
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:36.090
but issues like incorporation you can incorporate with legal zoom.

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.510
Did you know that?
Yes,
I know that.
Did you know you can do it cheap?

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.540
You could form an LLC for just under 99 bucks or just 99 bucks and up before I

12
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:46.920
fuck a girl on the road,

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.930
I have paperwork that's printed off from legal zoom.com saying that she is

14
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:54.690
consenting to be here.
You're going gonna need that someday.

15
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.540
We're going to need videotape confessions.
It's very important.

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.890
So does legals and taking that first step option.

17
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.820
Maybe we can ask him.
You know what?
I think it's,
I think it's a project.

18
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:09.000
They're working on it.
It's in moe cane in there.
What are you doing?

19
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.150
Cause it just said you.
What are you searching for?
And just what's Mccain,

20
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.020
mushrooms and cocaine.
Oh,
do you think the legal zoom knows about that?

21
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.700
They say don't put that in the commercial.

22
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:20.550
They're not actual legal representatives,

23
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:24.150
but they do provide a fantastic service so you can be your own legal

24
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:28.680
representative.
Douglas.
Dan Hope such a good pitch man.
On top of that,

25
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:31.470
you would probably the best ever.
And uh,
on top of that,

26
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.800
they can connect you to an attorney if you panic a third party attorney.

27
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.180
So if the shit hits the fan,

28
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:38.760
you're feeling out the legal zoom paperwork and you're like,
you know what?

29
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.200
I feel very Jaylee.
I feel like I'm going to jail.
I'm feeling kind.

30
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.040
You can call that emergency number from legal zoom.
They'll look out that window,

31
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:51.290
read a billboard and send you to some solid good breaking ball.
The fucker.

32
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.581
No,

33
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:58.560
there won't be that solid Goodman did a hell of a job in that goddamn attorney.

34
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.440
Anyway,
this month,
legal zoom,

35
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.660
this is the part that I'm supposed to read this month.

36
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:06.540
Legal Zoom celebrates innovation by helping you launch your dream.

37
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.990
How do you do that?
Legal Zoom.
Maternity is my favorite.
What about you Tom?
Oh,

38
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.690
fraternity lawsuits.
You ever been a kid isn't in a paternity suit?
No,
I haven't.

39
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.280
I was about 10 years ago.
It was frightening.
Boof.
That's rough.

40
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.860
If we have time to the story,
we still will come right after the commercial.

41
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.610
I want to hear it.
I want to hear you.
Let's see.
Got a bump me out,

Doug.

47
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:51.750
Stan hope you know you want to.
Hey,

48
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:55.560
you know that collection of fucking Chewbacca is and other star wars
memorabilia.

49
00:02:55.561 --> 00:03:00.180
That's your only valuables.
Who's going to get that if you,
okay.

50
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.840
Were you hanging out with us?
We're also brought talking to the listeners.
Yeah,

51
00:03:05.841 --> 00:03:08.560
they,
I don't think there's a lot of dudes out.

52
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.300
Your stepmother getting those collectibles.
Go to legal zoom.
Get a will.

53
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.530
What if they're signed?
Who's who is Chewbacca?
Everybody knows who Han Solo was.

54
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.140
You know?
Everybody knows it's hair.
Oh,
I haven't been the death pool.

55
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.870
Stand up celebrity death pool.
Hey,
I get a plug.
Yeah,
please.

56
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.650
Actual like seven foot dude that's aging now and I was going to take him on my

57
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:33.550
death pool and then Joe be the guy who runs it,
said I already got him.
Oh,

58
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.690
he did some in Saturday.
I can't all have the same guys.
They're like,
Great Danes.

59
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:41.790
Seven foot guys at 60 years old.
No,
no,
you're not around for long.

60
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.210
But somebody asked that to wilt Chamberlain.
He went up to wilt Chamberlain.

61
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.090
It was having a conversation with them.
It's like,
you know guys that are,

62
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:52.480
this is talls you.
They don't really live forever and apparently well chamber,

63
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.600
it was like,
hey man,
fuck you.
Was it stuttering John?
I don't know who it was,

64
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.680
but it was rude and true.
Apparently tarred,

65
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.710
pump all that blood up into that ticker.
Seven foot tall dude,

66
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.690
five seven foot tall.
I'd be in bed right now.
Does it by my legs,
over my heart.

67
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.310
This is a reverse work.
If you're like a small person,
do you live longer?
No,
no.

68
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:13.510
They tie quick too.

69
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.460
I went a lot of Guinness Book and my last death pool picks what's,

70
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.340
what are you changing?

71
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.600
Budgets will make it to a hundred and that would be like what's like the good

72
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.550
like size to live long.
It's like five four,
five.

73
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.940
What's the world average is right.
The Chinese tend to live a long time.

74
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:35.620
I know Brian by fucking filthy Scotsman manager is chomping at the bit because

75
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:37.330
he knows all these dumb facts,

76
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.630
but he said Mediterranean people tend to live the longest,

77
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:44.590
but I would say that diet thing though,
right?
That Asians and also like fish,

78
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.830
they get around a lot of other nice people.
They have these villages,

79
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:51.280
they all know each other's the level of love that apparently actually extends

80
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:54.950
lifespan,
less stress,
a lot less trust.
Very be like Doug.

81
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:59.020
Stan hope a lot of things that they don't account for when they just generalize

82
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:02.320
people.
Exactly.
They say Asians don't get a lot of lung cancer,

83
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:05.710
but they have no dairy in their diet,
so they take those two things and you go,

84
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.090
oh,
I love that.
I go,
well,

85
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:11.050
I won't drink milk and eat cheese and I'll just keep chain smoking and I'll be

86
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.950
Japanese forever.
I don't know what you're talking about,

87
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.090
but we're also brought to you by tank and if you go to rogan.ting.com you can

88
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.570
save yourself some money and some excellent cell phone service ducks.

89
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:25.160
Dan Hope these 10 uses the sprint backbone,
which means that this,

90
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.380
these sounds so goofy when you're doing them in the middle.

91
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.760
We should have when you have to look at your friends when you're doing

92
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.320
[inaudible] frankly and roller.

93
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.400
I'm Russell while he does the commercial,
I'm not embarrassed to do it.

94
00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:41.580
God damn commercial hub,
dare you.
Hey,
the only way,

95
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.690
the only way you get paid is if someone does.
You do a commercial.

96
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.710
They have that new a galaxy s five on there though with the thumbprint scanner

97
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:52.000
and all that heart rate monitor that you can do that on an iPhone too.

98
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.320
I just found out that a lot,
actually,

99
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:56.620
you do that in almost any phone that has a camera.
They have these applications.

100
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.360
Read a,
it reads the flash.
Jamie showed it to me.

101
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.850
It reads the flash from the phone,

102
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.440
apparently lights up your thumb and through that the camera can see the actual

103
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:09.860
blood pumping in your finger and so that's how it reads your,

104
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:12.470
your actual heartbeat from an application on regular phone.

105
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.170
I don't want to stay alive to see what Shit is like in 20 years.

106
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:17.180
If the technology is so incredible now,

107
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.610
what's it going to be like in 20 years later?
My cigarettes?
I don't know.

108
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.290
How accurate is that you got,
I'm like,
is they're super accurate?
Yeah,

109
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:28.240
it's dead on.
I've,

110
00:06:28.241 --> 00:06:31.370
I've tried it with that in a heart rate monitor at the same time.
It's dead on.

111
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.190
It's crazy.
You know what I've heard about ting?
Is there fantastic.
Oh,

112
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.310
you haven't heard that?
I don't bullshit people.

113
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.900
Doug Stanhope trending on Twitter.

114
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.070
What Tim does is they rent time on the sprint backbone,

115
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.990
but they do it in a way where you can cancel anytime you want.

116
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.640
You own your phone Sunday bullshit where you have to pay them back 300 bucks

117
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:53.600
because college financing,
no contract fucking scamp biggest scam in the world.

118
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.690
Not only that,
no early termination fees,
which is another big scam.

119
00:06:56.691 --> 00:07:00.350
Here's another scam.
The actual minutes,
when they charge you x minutes,

120
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:03.080
you get 50 minutes per month and you know this amount of data.

121
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.460
The reality is a lot of times you pay for way more than you're using.

122
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.900
You're not using a lot of your minutes with Ting.
You only pay for what you use.

123
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.470
It really is a great way to do it.
Like you don't have to,
like you don't have a,

124
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.920
you know,
$250 a month bill or whatever the fuck it is.

125
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.750
It's like if you were out of the country,

126
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:23.300
if you are only making a few calls in a week,
if you say,
you know what,

127
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.930
I'm not even fucking texting people anymore.
You Shit will drop down to nothing.

128
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.880
10 is like a good bookie.
He said it's 20 bucks.
Just let it ride.

129
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.880
Well they know well everybody,
you need your phone,
Doug.
Stan,
hope you can.

130
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:36.290
You could live out in the middle of nowhere,

131
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:39.140
but you're going to have a fucking phone on you and even you switched over to a

132
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.650
smartphone.
Publish Pastor.
Yes I did.
Do you hung into that flip phone?

133
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.640
I get turned down at Uber but Uber doesn't work right,
so it's not me.

134
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.380
Brian put Uber on my phone and he goes,
no,

135
00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:52.730
I'll put it on your phone cause he does.
Is it cheap?
Fuck.
That's a good insight.

136
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.030
God is Jackson,
but it doesn't wizard with that accident.
Perfect.
Brian.

137
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.610
Brian Hennigan doesn't even have a proper Scottish accent.
What's it doing Doug?

138
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.090
He talks like it doesn't tell.
It does.
It tells me I'm somewhere else.
Yeah,

139
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:08.660
I can show me.
I was in fucking north Hollywood when I was in West Hollywood.

140
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.580
I can fish out.
You have to fix that for you.
Yeah,

141
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.380
there's probably something wrong with you.
You probably look,

142
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:14.930
we're hiding some shit from the government so it doesn't know exactly where you

143
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:18.500
are.
That's what it is like you hide some of those location services because you

144
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:22.450
worried they're going to fucking close in on you.
Like the physical department.

145
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.990
Yeah.
Living off the grid is as easy as not knowing how to use your fucking self.

146
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.890
It really is.
It's go bust.
This guy,
he's in north Hollywood.
No,
I'm not.

147
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.900
I just don't know how to use Uber.
Yeah,

148
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:35.450
go to [inaudible] Dot [inaudible] Dot Com and save 25 bucks.

149
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.190
I love Tang rogan.ting.com.
All right.

150
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.410
We don't need any more commercials.
Get the cell phone they used in space.
No,

151
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:49.280
they didn't hang.
Sorry.
Oh,
you funny.
But we're good

152
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.630
experience.
Try by day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

153
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.670
All Day.
Not to be confused with Tang Tang.

154
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.530
Remember when we were a kid was that was hard.
Big thing partnered up.
Dang.

155
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.820
You could sip this delicious juice while you know you're a cop.

156
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.710
Doubles as a phone your tank up,
your pimp style tank,

157
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.830
cups or rhinestones around him.
Remember when we were kids.

158
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:23.660
Tang was like the big thing.
Yeah,
it came from the space program.
They go,
oh look,

159
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.320
it made it good.
Ting was fucking terrible dog shit.
Fake orange shoes,

160
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.540
Mre.
Is this a great dinner?
That was one of the first commercial.

161
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:36.840
That was one of the first product placement things that Tang people.
Totally,

162
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.120
I mean that wasn't good for people.
It's ridiculous.

163
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.870
And they sold that is like the astronaut drinks.
So like attrition,
you know,

164
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.780
generations of Americans dreads a shit.

165
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:48.990
Homemade Gatorade down shitty gate.

166
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.520
The electrolytes.
Yeah.
Tags.

167
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:57.890
I'm going to be an astronaut is still around this tank still around.
I'm sure.

168
00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.640
Yeah,
that's fine.
Off tank still around.

169
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.980
You know if poor people somewhere drinking it,
they're so unimpressed.

170
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.580
If you know,
if Tang was like,
yeah,
this astronaut program,
they're like pitch,

171
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.080
what'd you Astros now?
Right.

172
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.250
It's like youtube comments like where's your astronauts?
Who's going to the moon?

173
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.540
Yeah.

174
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.200
The last famous astronaut was a stocker racing from Florida to use them to stab

175
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:22.170
a lover or something.
Well I've been doing a bit there in a diaper.

176
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.790
She was wearing a diaper so she didn't have to stop and go learn that trick.

177
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.580
She drove the entire time and she shit herself.
She was an astronaut.

178
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:35.400
She was crazy.
Oh yeah.
Bitch was crazy.
Tang.
The drink,

179
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.270
it seems like it's still around.
Hmm.
Most of that shit.
If you look it up,

180
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:43.130
you can buy it if it,
if you can't find it in a store,
you can find it online.

181
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.540
Quispe Cereal and
candy.
Okay.

182
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.080
Talking about marathon bars,

183
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:54.081
that was an original Tang Tang is sold in both powdered and ready to drink for

184
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.180
him.
Oh,
new Tang is where they jumped the shark.

185
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.180
They say if you could find the original tank now,
yeah.

186
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:04.830
You could actually buy like a sugar free version of tank containing aspartame.

187
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.150
Wow.
Hmm.
Oh,
let's put more cancer in your diabetes.

188
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.620
Hey listen,
Doug Stanhope,

189
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:14.670
there's 10% of the RDA of vitamin A,

190
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.940
calcium and vitamin E and riboflavin,

191
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.970
10% 10% so 10 glasses at Tang and you're covered.

192
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.220
That's almost half what cocoa puffs has.

193
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.580
It's um,
it's got 100% of your vitamin C.
Oh,
that's actually pretty good.

194
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.430
I 100% of your vitamin C is not that much though.

195
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.980
The people that think you should take vitamin C thank you.
Should take a look.

196
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:41.430
A good amount of it like take that shit all the time.

197
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:44.790
But Doug Stanhope you just take cigarettes and you're fine.

198
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.040
I this week I've been bad but I had quit a lot.

199
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.980
He quit a lot.
You held it back.
Have you ever tried the electronic route?
Yeah,

200
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.760
<v 1>we've talked about this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Red Band said he was coughing up blood.</v>

201
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.290
They're there.
There are a lot better now.
Like the newer ones aren't.

202
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.550
They're terrible cause I just got quit a month ago and I made it two weeks and I

203
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:07.510
tried like four different brands and I was sucking on them constantly and I was

204
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:11.170
off to six for a couple of weeks but my lungs were killing me at one point and

205
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:13.000
then it comes a point where you're like well fuck,

206
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:16.570
give me a cigarette cause you're just getting like blast and blast of nicotine

207
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.510
like more nicotine than you would be getting from just having a cigarette.

208
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.490
I did great when I was at home alone,

209
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.150
I had like six weeks off and I mean there's full weeks.

210
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:29.920
I didn't smoke and then sometimes someone would show up at my house that smokes

211
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:30.970
and I'd steal a cigarette.

212
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:35.971
So I'd smoke a couple and then six weeks of 95% quit smoking went on the road.

213
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:38.470
And I'm like,
all right,

214
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.290
now I'm just going to bump them from the fucking opening acts,

215
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.540
find outside smoking.

216
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:47.830
I sent Bingo out to go get me a couple of cigarettes before the show and this

217
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.640
week it's just after the fucking first night of party and we were talking about

218
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.340
I'm buying packs bucket.
But once you say fuck it,
and that's the,

219
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.160
<v 0>the problem with being a comic is you're inclined to say fuck it more often than</v>

220
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:03.100
not because it seems like the comic choice,
you know,

221
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:05.410
and you're in that situation,
you're like,
come on.
What's that?

222
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.580
<v 1>The show must go on.
I think there's a point that I made it,</v>

223
00:13:08.581 --> 00:13:12.540
I quit a month ago and I made it two weeks and I wasn't working and it was once

224
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:16.110
I went back and I did shows in Atlanta and I was bumming them off to staff.

225
00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:20.190
And then I was in Minneapolis the next weekend after that and like snuck a pack

226
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.640
and then just said fuck it.
I mean I think cause I,
cause I,

227
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.910
cause I was doing shows and that's my rhythm and having a cig and get on stage.

228
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.910
I don't want to influence the kids.
Ah,
but like before and after

229
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.750
<v 0>and that was a thing where at the comedy store it was a big deal because guys</v>

230
00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:39.390
would smoke on stage and the audience members couldn't smoke

231
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.270
<v 1>cause there was a provisional,
right?
Yeah.</v>

232
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.220
As a part of the performance you're allowed to smoke.
But uh,

233
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.980
I think they dropped that.
I don't think they allow a lot of places.

234
00:13:48.981 --> 00:13:52.520
I remember cause I would,
I,
I did that the uh,

235
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.630
immediately I was doing that when they passed it in California.

236
00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.250
Once I found out about that law and I was doing it in Minneapolis and then a bar

237
00:14:01.251 --> 00:14:05.540
started doing that as a night where a smoker's could be on stage.

238
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.640
And so that place is just all spoken.

239
00:14:07.641 --> 00:14:11.690
But you had to have everyone thought of the performance so far into their face

240
00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:15.290
that they changed the law.
And I think most places have changed the law.
Yeah,

241
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:17.170
that sucks.
They fucked it up.

242
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.430
Remember when we started the clubs where everyone smoked and the in the 80s and

243
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.180
I didn't mind back then.
I loved it and I smoke with dancing.
The spotlight.

244
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.690
You're on stage.
It was sexy.
It was like filming a war movie.

245
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.940
<v 0>Got It man.
And pool halls as well.
I don't like it.
I don't like cigarettes.</v>

246
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:37.810
I think they're disgusting and it scares me when I see my friends smoke cause I

247
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:41.080
know you're going to die ugly.
I know you're going to die ugly.
And I loved it.

248
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.540
I tell this guy all the time,
I love him,

249
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:47.310
but he smokes and when I see him smoke I get scared.
I get scared that you're,

250
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:52.100
you're locked up in a wrestling match with a dragon.
It's a dark demon.

251
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:55.670
It's gonna slowly rot you out from the insides and it tricks you into doing it.

252
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.520
It sucks you into its web with habit and novelty.
And the idea that it lets,

253
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:05.510
it's beautiful,
the fucking smoke and so good.
I know that's one thing.

254
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.200
And then the other thing is,
becomes part of your body.
It becomes a part of you.

255
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:11.710
You,
you need it.
It becomes your system.
Your,

256
00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:15.620
your body gets integrated into accepting this.
I feel like I got my appointment.

257
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.220
I don't know.
Some of that having a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on me,

258
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.580
you know?
Well listen,
I'm not judging.
You know,
I have friends that

259
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.640
<v 2>telling them you're secure.
You know,
I got what I need,
retirement.
Fuck that.</v>

260
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.100
I got a carton and I'm a hypocrite

261
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.630
<v 0>smoking weed.
And I don't think smoking weed is bad for you.</v>

262
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.430
It's certainly not bad for you in the same way.
And I did not.

263
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.780
Once the cigarette companies get ahold of it either way,

264
00:15:39.781 --> 00:15:42.030
I don't think it's the best thing for you.
This is it.

265
00:15:42.031 --> 00:15:45.100
The best thing in the world for you to smoke a plant,
you know,
it's like,

266
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.680
I thought you went straight to vaporizer and edibles.
Those two.
Yeah.

267
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:55.470
I just watched you smoke,
so no,
no,
I do that too.

268
00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.810
Oh yeah.
But I'm,
I'm hypocritical in that sense of cause like smoking,

269
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.480
it's not good.
It's not good to smoke something,
you know,
anything.
We like Diaz,

270
00:16:03.481 --> 00:16:07.800
I'm like,
stop smoking.
He only eats it and use a vaporizer because he said he's,

271
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.410
he's long started feeling way better once he did that.

272
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.181
<v 2>But I believe it.</v>

273
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:14.990
And the animal law edibles as someone who doesn't live in California,

274
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:19.980
the edibles here are ridiculous.
You got every candy,
Jolly Rancher,
candy.
We'd uh,

275
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.510
you know,
a York peppermint patties.
Anything you can think of,

276
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:27.320
they've duplicated exactly like a candy or,

277
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.150
<v 0>well,
there's a bit of an issue.
There is a little bit of an issue with it.</v>

278
00:16:31.151 --> 00:16:32.320
It's beautiful that exists.

279
00:16:32.321 --> 00:16:35.050
And I'm a complete libertarian and the idea that you should be able to,

280
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.720
you almost let your filter.
Yeah,
but this place is,

281
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.760
the weed culture in California is so more evolved in Amsterdam.
Well it's,

282
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.840
they're so powerful that it's really like an intense psychedelic.

283
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.420
If you eat one of these pot brownies or these Chuba choose Chiba Chews,

284
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.260
they have these Chiba chews that are like seven.
How many,
what's the milligrams?

285
00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:01.000
Uh,
take one fourth.
If you don't want to die as they are insane.

286
00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:04.930
If you tank the whole,
it's one candy.
And if you take that one candy,

287
00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.350
you will reexperience here.

288
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.170
<v 2>Higher life from,
from the moment you,
you,</v>

289
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.670
you were up an egg in the comm,

290
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:18.671
washed over you and turned you into two eggs and you are cell started dividing.

291
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.570
That's the right looking for these candies.
Could you take,
say,

292
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:27.140
one of these candies.
Say you already have a preexisting condition,

293
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.750
a mental illness saying,

294
00:17:28.751 --> 00:17:32.820
and say you're at a rock star's house trying to get a podcast and you're doing

295
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.850
incredible amounts of blow and you go home with a little bit of that blow and

296
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:42.020
then you do the rest of that blow while your boyfriend sleeping,

297
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:43.940
preparing for the bill burp podcast.

298
00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:48.320
And you also eat an edible while you have a preexisting condition.

299
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:52.980
Could you spiral into such a catatonic state that the landlord from the air B

300
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:53.730
and B,

301
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.000
that you're staying in comes in to talk to you and you won't respond to them.

302
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.470
So your boyfriend and your tour manager have to put you in bed where you piss

303
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:06.471
the bed in your first Ab Airbnb and it takes you 24 hours to come out and said,

304
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:11.190
Ken atonic state.
Uh,
if I had to guess,
I could say that hypothetically,

305
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.170
did Marilyn Manson give you a gift bag when you left and edibles?
It wasn't me,

306
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.470
wasn't me.
Skin moisturizer wasn't me.
You gotta be careful with that shit.

307
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.660
I had to check her text messages and it said,
well,
Hey,

308
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:29.250
we're uh,
we'll be there on time.

309
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.660
I just stand up sleeping and I just ate a pod candy and then I see an empty

310
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:36.690
Baggie and I'm like,
you did all that and now

311
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.670
<v 3>they can get you,
they can get you and take you on a ride that you're just not,</v>

312
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.420
you're not going to be capable of going out just doing things,

313
00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:48.600
going to the airport,
getting your clothes on.
You're not going to be capable.

314
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.600
And that's the gist.
You could buy it at any store.

315
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.650
Go buy one of these cupcakes by one of these rocket cookies.

316
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.740
Take cookie and go right to the center of the fucking universe.
I mean,

317
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:02.550
they're intense psychedelics.
We've talked about it before,
but the,

318
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.750
the chemical processes when you,

319
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.980
<v 2>wait,
is this a,
is this ground already worked over on the Joe Rogan experience?</v>

320
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.960
I've cookies.
We've talked about it a few times.
I know it sounds crazy.

321
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:13.830
It seems so novel.

322
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.910
I was at Dick Clubs in La at home or gone back to go back to ting.

323
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.290
If you eat that shit,
it's,
it'll,
it'll hurt you.
It'll hurt you.

324
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.530
You gotta be real careful.
I've seen comedians all over la with those little pen.

325
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.280
Does your fries are things different?
That's not an eating it when you eating it

326
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.220
all the different varieties.

327
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.420
I always assumed those were ecigarettes that everyone has.

328
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:44.040
There's a lot of those are little weed vaporizer.
Oh whoa.
Like a motherfucker.

329
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.230
They do hit like a motherfucker,
but there's both.

330
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.720
That's why I think it's a product I want to endorse.

331
00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:51.980
That should be their slogan hits like a motherfucker.

332
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.410
I don't think that's a good move.
If I read hits like a motherfucker be like,

333
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:57.830
who is the guy that's making this?
That's all he could come

334
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.660
in podcasting.

335
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:05.661
You could probably get copy like that all you have to be like your mother

336
00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:09.360
fucker,
the balls like a motherfucker.
You should buy this.

337
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.500
This will take you on a ride to the center of the universe.
My man,

338
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.290
<v 3>my man would be highlighted,
you know,
feel free to use your own colloquialism.</v>

339
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.740
<v 2>It's,
it's funny when you were about to start red band said,</v>

340
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.610
okay,
uh,
we're alive and you go,
Oh shit,
we're live.
Oh,

341
00:20:27.611 --> 00:20:30.610
don't say anything that you were making a joke like,
oh,
don't say anything.

342
00:20:30.611 --> 00:20:33.220
We're live.
It's opposite.

343
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:38.200
Yesterday I had fell in love with a man fucking Bert Kreischer.

344
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.700
He's a great man.
I fucking like,
I clicked with him so quickly.

345
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.590
I'll get some,
let me met him.
No,
I've met him before but we never really hung.
Oh,

346
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:48.190
he's the best.

347
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.570
<v 1>He's a sweetie and I knew that.
Yeah,
he's just walking.</v>

348
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.960
Wicked man crush right away.
His house is just like my house down to the,

349
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.770
I walked in,
I knew exactly where his booze stash was.
I'm like,

350
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:02.640
I'm just going to make a drink.
Anyway.

351
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.410
Fucking fell in love with a guy by the sweetie.
We had to,

352
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:10.360
we had to pause and go to break where we talk about like shit that and then we'd

353
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:15.010
come back on the air and like certain stuff,
you can't take trash talking.

354
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:17.290
Other comics come back on the air.

355
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:18.221
<v 0>Well,</v>

356
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:22.150
he's on the travel channel two and the travel channel is owned by some religious

357
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:25.750
folks.
Oh yeah.
Not like that,
but,
but that is a problem.

358
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.000
But he's got to be real careful about what he does.

359
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:31.000
Or I'm trying to make a drink.
He doesn't smoke weed,

360
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.740
but if he did,
he wouldn't do it on Ustream.
You know what I'm saying?

361
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.430
Who owns the travel channel is some somebody that loves the baby.
Jesus.

362
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.090
Allegedly.
I might be just talking shit.
I don't know.
I just,

363
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:44.680
what I've read from Anthony Bordain.
Okay.

364
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.700
Certain conversations I might've had with him.

365
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.260
And what did you ordain on the show?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Wow.
He's a good dude.
His,

366
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:57.130
you know,
his wife is a,
a Jujitsu fanatic.
That's my end.

367
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.680
That's how I got to Mile Dane

368
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:03.840
<v 1>and followed me or retweeted me or something.
And it was a,
I was so starstruck.</v>

369
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.400
Oh,
he's the best.

370
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.320
<v 0>He's a sweetie.
If you met the guy,
you would love him.
He's just</v>

371
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.160
<v 1>his show.
Is it,
since he's gone to CNN,
I guess they had,
you know,</v>

372
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.590
a visa access to like his shows just gone to a whole different level.

373
00:22:16.591 --> 00:22:17.940
Now I can mirror and Mar.

374
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.060
<v 0>Yeah,
we're going to Allen Brian,
by the way.</v>

375
00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.220
I got plans and one of the plans is flying to New York to do podcasts with

376
00:22:25.221 --> 00:22:27.310
people that we can't get to fly out here.
So like,

377
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.840
I can't keep asking people to just come out here.

378
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.690
So guys like board day and I'm gonna find out when he's going to be there and

379
00:22:32.691 --> 00:22:35.360
I'll just drive and haven't come under Bisbee I'm going to use,

380
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:40.100
try to use the serious,
cause we were on serious.
We're not serious.

381
00:22:40.101 --> 00:22:43.040
I don't know if you know that.
I listened to it all the time.
It's the weirdest,

382
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.610
but,
um,
so I'll,
I'll,

383
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.580
I wanted to get like Bordain a few other guys that live there.
I C k.
Yeah.
Yeah.

384
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.430
Well Louise just so fucking busy.
I feel bad asking him yet,

385
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.380
but he's on opie and Anthony all the time,
but that's like,
you know,

386
00:22:54.381 --> 00:22:58.550
when he can in the morning I'll ask him.
But,
um,
I know he's crazy,

387
00:22:58.551 --> 00:23:03.050
but he's the most ridiculously busy person I've ever met.
He's got a,

388
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.280
he does a great bit that I saw that someone made a clip of him talking about it

389
00:23:08.311 --> 00:23:09.170
was,
it's really funny.

390
00:23:09.171 --> 00:23:13.880
It starts him talking about nut allergies and he compares like things that you

391
00:23:13.881 --> 00:23:18.710
know to be true.
But there's always this too,
but maybe like,
it's like,
but I know,

392
00:23:18.711 --> 00:23:22.790
but maybe it's fucking really funny man.
It's really funny.

393
00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:27.791
I hadn't seen one see case bits is new bits off of his new special God damn.

394
00:23:28.011 --> 00:23:32.620
It was good.
It was really funny.
New special not,
yeah,
the new one.
Where's he?

395
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.830
He was in Phoenix and the theater in the round.
It's really,
really good stuff,

396
00:23:36.831 --> 00:23:39.110
man.
It's like you,
you,
you,
you listened to it,

397
00:23:39.111 --> 00:23:41.510
you read it and you watch it rather and you're like,
fuck,

398
00:23:41.511 --> 00:23:44.630
I want to go write something.
Like this is like,
maybe want to go right.

399
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.130
It was good.
Yeah.

400
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:46.760
<v 3>You know,</v>

401
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.430
that's the best thing about like I used to always think that about like when

402
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:53.110
Chappelle would come to the store,
I got always a longer run home and right.
Yeah.

403
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.560
Anything that gives you that,
that little juice like you want to create too.

404
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.470
Cause you know how good it made you feel.
Why?

405
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:03.140
Like I last time I saw Chappelle at the story,

406
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.100
it was like the height of his popularity before,
uh,
he,
uh,

407
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.830
he'd quit the comedy central show and he was just,

408
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.670
he would just show up like maybe like the day before they would schedule this

409
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.750
and it would just be mob and he was in the main room and uh,
he,

410
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:23.450
it was so funny and so like I hadn't seen him in like six months and it was all

411
00:24:23.451 --> 00:24:28.430
new shit.
It was like 100% new and it's like a new hour and you'll you left,

412
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:31.990
there you go.
Just go on.
God Damn,
I need to go to work.
Yeah.

413
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.780
<v 1>I want to go.
He had that gift,
I think,</v>

414
00:24:34.781 --> 00:24:38.890
say it very fucking stupid way.
But he's one of those guys,

415
00:24:38.891 --> 00:24:42.580
he talks funny.
Anyway,
so we already has a leg up.

416
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.930
This is Joey said yes,
you said it best.
The Ds could read the phone book.
Right,

417
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.230
right.
So he has that already but he can write too.

418
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.150
So if it's new shit,
what,

419
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.640
what would you know be filler to him would be a closer to me.

420
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:02.280
<v 3>Yeah.
Diaz has,
I mean I don't,
I don't want to give up any of this material,</v>

421
00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:05.580
but he's got this bit about this chick named Lucy snore Bush.

422
00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.220
He's told the story about on the podcast,

423
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.140
but now he's turning to a bid in his act,

424
00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:12.570
a true story about him sneaking into her house,

425
00:25:12.571 --> 00:25:14.880
climbing into her window and eating her pussy in the middle of the night and

426
00:25:14.881 --> 00:25:19.170
then escaping.
I don't think I've ever laughed as hard in my life.

427
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.190
We just did Santa Barbara together and W W I was watching him on stage and he's

428
00:25:23.191 --> 00:25:26.700
doing this Lucy snore Bush thing and I'm having a hard time catching my breath,

429
00:25:26.701 --> 00:25:29.010
like are legitimately having a hard time catching my breath.

430
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.520
<v 1>I see.
So d as in San Francisco and he was doing that bit where he's like,</v>

431
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.160
are you like punches?
Uh,

432
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.020
and the audience is dying in San Francisco.

433
00:25:39.021 --> 00:25:42.010
They're like usually really touchy about like,
what are you going to believe?

434
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.870
What the WIG and a black guy,
there's no support groups where these people,

435
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.850
he's one of the best ever.
He's like as far as like Lisa Snell,
Bush,

436
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:59.270
Bush,
Lucy snoring.
What's her name?
Lucy snore Bush.
It was so,
it was,

437
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.630
it was painfully funny.
It's painfully funny.
He's my all time favorite.

438
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.780
<v 3>Well,
I've ever seen that made me laugh.
The hardest is not a,</v>

439
00:26:07.781 --> 00:26:10.690
not a single person has ever made me laugh harder than Diaz

440
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.210
<v 1>me and see hurt me and Chrysler.</v>

441
00:26:12.211 --> 00:26:17.211
We're picking our ultimate fo Forman tour with a wildcard fuck up.

442
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.810
He picked,
he picked Diaz.
This is fuck up.

443
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:25.900
<v 3>I have to see him.</v>

444
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.700
I Diaz is so good that I started taking two guys on the road with me during the

445
00:26:30.701 --> 00:26:34.640
dark days when Diaz would just go vanish in the middle of the night.
But I,
I,

446
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.900
he was so good that I said,
okay,
I need a backup opener.

447
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.610
So it would bring two openers because there's too many times,

448
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.140
D has just vanished.
He just would disappear.
It just,
you couldn't

449
00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.930
<v 0>call him.
I got booked like that w for auto and George where they wanted a book,</v>

450
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:52.350
auto and George,
but they needed to co headline himself.
He didn't show up.

451
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.670
There was another x rated act that could fit the fucking marquee.

452
00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:00.750
You got to do that man.
Unfortunately with some guys,
but they're worth it.

453
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.910
And now he's super reliable.
Now he's just say every gig.
He's,
he's there.

454
00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.240
Well,
he's just into comedy now.

455
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.820
I think it's just the front for the first time in his life,

456
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:16.970
he's being recognized for what he does and he's enjoying creating new shit.

457
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.500
He's enjoying being a comic.
Like when I talk to him about it,

458
00:27:20.501 --> 00:27:21.690
he's got a lot of other success.

459
00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:25.020
Like he's always getting called into movies and shit.
And you know,
he did that.

460
00:27:25.021 --> 00:27:29.100
Uh,
I sat,
I sat through the grudge match just because I knew he was in it.

461
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.200
He's having a lot of those that are happening to them.

462
00:27:31.201 --> 00:27:34.400
But the big thing is his stand up man,
his standup,

463
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.780
he's selling out everywhere he deserves and yeah,
he,
fuck,
yeah.

464
00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:39.510
What a difference when the audience already loves you,

465
00:27:39.511 --> 00:27:42.780
when you get there you can win them over different animal.
Dude,

466
00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:45.400
he went on stage and Santa Barbara when we work together and I,

467
00:27:45.401 --> 00:27:49.560
I've taken some of his openings where I introduced them and then I film it like

468
00:27:49.561 --> 00:27:52.950
watching them go on stage.
I put them on youtube cause they're so ridiculous.

469
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:58.310
He goes on stage and people standing up like bowing to him screaming like 2000

470
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:02.220
people screaming and bowing to Joey Diaz as so good.

471
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:06.120
And for a guy like that to finally get that,
you know,
dude,
I,

472
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:09.780
I always go to see a guy that age.
Yeah,

473
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.280
he deserves how many church he's,
he's an animal dude.
He's an animal.

474
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.550
He's an animal.
If I could,
if I could hire a 24 hour nurse to keep them alive,

475
00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:21.550
I would just don't think you would get the fuck out of it.
Listen,
I'm Cuban,

476
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.630
I'm never gonna die.
Get outta here,
bitch.
You kick him out of his house.

477
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.550
You got to like find out like a guy like that.

478
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:28.290
I get to take care of in a gentle fashion.

479
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.250
You got to figure out how to keep them alive.
But wiki check them.
Yeah.

480
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.500
I'm going to put that pill and a piece of cheese,

481
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:39.530
find some fucking new drugs and put it in his ice cream to take it and put it in

482
00:28:40.231 --> 00:28:42.000
something,
some new thing.

483
00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:46.830
Regenerative tissue thing of the government and fence.
Just throw it in his food.

484
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.030
Hey,
uh,

485
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.760
Bryan told me the other night you're getting your blood reinjected was that

486
00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:54.160
bullshit?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's true.
Well,

487
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:57.270
it's not your blood reinjected it's a,
it's called Regina King.

488
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.020
It was invented by this German guy.
It's,
it's your blood.

489
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.240
They spin it in a centrifuge and they heat it up.

490
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:08.130
So you take your blood and in this summer we're doing an ad copy again.
No,

491
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:12.720
Regina chain.
Dot.
There's a guy named doctor Peter Weller,

492
00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:16.920
I believe his name is.
He developed this process for us.
Any Robo cause,

493
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.100
inflammation.
That's the other guy.
You know you might be right.

494
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.770
I might have the wrong guy.
Hold on a second.
That's it.

495
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.420
I'll do the ad while you look it up.
It's like,

496
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.190
are you tired of looking at those center genics guys half naked in a skymall

497
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.270
catalog.
Oh,
does it make your face young to ooze?

498
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.300
Anybody that's in pain,
it can be a tremendous help.

499
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:43.520
It's the most potent anti inflammatory that I figured out.
Well,

500
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:47.200
I did it a few times.
It's amazing.
Was all these professional athletes,

501
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.670
inflammatory jug.
It's called alcoholism and it works on my penis.

502
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:58.540
I don't think it works.
It hasn't been inflamed in years.
I'm sure Peter Welling.

503
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:03.490
You're right.
It's not.
It's welling.
Robocop.
I said Weller.
No,
no.

504
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:07.330
What did she say?
Right.
You're right sweetie.
I love you.
You're right.
Always.

505
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.390
I'm blessed.
Refer to you more than I refer to myself.
How about that?

506
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.270
But he was a guy in Germany who figured this shit out.

507
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:14.410
They take your blood and they,

508
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:18.580
they heat it and your blood has a reaction while it's still viable.

509
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.400
It has a reaction to the heat as if it's got a fever.

510
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.130
And it creates this intense anti inflammatory response.

511
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:27.200
So it's in the very blood itself.
They take it out of your body that heated,

512
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.460
they spin it and then it creates this yellow shit and it's yellow shit.

513
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.510
They pull it out and they,
they call it something Regena keen serum,

514
00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:37.270
I don't know the technical and then they squirt it into anywhere you have

515
00:30:37.271 --> 00:30:40.510
arthritis and in where you have uh,
any kind of swelling,

516
00:30:40.511 --> 00:30:43.810
inflammation and it has like a magical response.

517
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.210
That's why all these athletes like um,
it's,

518
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.310
we've got paint manning battened back into football.

519
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.480
He had two neck surgeries and he was fucked and he went to Germany and he got

520
00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:55.900
this procedure done in his neck and it just fixed it.
Shot out.
I was using,

521
00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:58.470
I was talking to Sean Rouse,
I don't know if you knew him.
Yeah.

522
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.230
He has serious arthritis and he wants to talk to you about it because he loved

523
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:02.740
to talk.
Yes.

524
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.840
I mean if you look at his hands he needs to like break all his hands like good.

525
00:31:05.841 --> 00:31:09.410
It is operations and you know,
no,
he's got some serious right.

526
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.890
<v 4>Yeah.
Cause he's got the most crippling arthritis,
uh,
which,
uh,</v>

527
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.100
I should say because of Sean Rouse,

528
00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:20.210
I saw a young comedian get knocked the fuck out the other night at the comedy

529
00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:21.690
store.
Somebody got knocked out by it.

530
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.760
I was sitting there with a Sha Jason Rouse,

531
00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.990
Canadian guy who lived in London and Jj Whitehead,

532
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:34.700
a Canadian guys at the other end.
And then Sean and he was plastered man,

533
00:31:34.701 --> 00:31:39.080
and who was Sean rouse?
And he's,
yeah,
he's sitting there.

534
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.190
The story is just lost all credibility.
I'm talking to,
there's a guy from Boston,

535
00:31:43.191 --> 00:31:45.150
Mike favor men or whatever,
uh,

536
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.740
this tall young open mic comedian.

537
00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:50.600
We found out he was an open miker later comes up.

538
00:31:50.601 --> 00:31:54.140
I thought he knew Jason had Jay Jay because of the way he's making fun of,

539
00:31:54.141 --> 00:31:56.170
and one guy at Jason's got a lot of tats.
He said,
hey,

540
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.370
always making me stupid tattoo jokes.

541
00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:04.030
And I'm kind of talking to Mike from Boston.
Charlie there.
No,
no,
no,

542
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:08.360
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Uh,
he would surely wasn't a,
he had left,
uh,
earlier,
uh,

543
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:12.770
we heard that Ross was really fucked up,
wrapped Hayley plastered.
So anyway,

544
00:32:12.771 --> 00:32:17.630
this topic,
roads,
bronze medalist and story editing,
this comedian,
the guy,

545
00:32:17.631 --> 00:32:20.480
he turns to Sean very grandly to the table and he goes,

546
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.130
I'm sorry to bother you gentlemen.

547
00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.920
I just couldn't pass up the chance to meet Mobi.

548
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.060
And he like sticks his hand out to Sean who's all fucked up and can barely lift

549
00:32:29.061 --> 00:32:29.690
his head.

550
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:34.160
This kid was a fucking Douche and Mike from Boston's got like to kind of taxi

551
00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:39.161
driver knew Stan Guy Hat on and then the kid grandly turns table of veteran

552
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:40.370
comedian

553
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.340
<v 2>sitting here.
Grandly turns to Mike and he goes,</v>

554
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:48.090
I'll be seeing you in the morning when I come to pick up my newspaper.
Oh,

555
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:52.160
amen.
You sent it to favor,
favor,
favor men doesn't play.

556
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.010
I turned and this kid was being such and I was,

557
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.300
I was joking around when I said it,
I turned to Mike,
I'll go,

558
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.970
I'll give you $20.
You've punched this kid in the face.

559
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.740
And with his comedic timing was brilliant.
He didn't miss just bomb.

560
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.910
And this kid went back and it was,
who all hell broke loose

561
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:16.940
name,
but he's a legit savage.

562
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.050
He's the wrong guy to fuck with.
Well,
I mean who?
This guy and then the all this,

563
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:23.480
you know.
And then he's on the sidewall showroom.
No,
no.

564
00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:26.000
Out on the patio bar February.
It's like the wild west.

565
00:33:26.001 --> 00:33:30.610
There has a story about fucking this made sit up.

566
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.030
Never heard my picture of favor,
man.
Listen,
do you don't have to.

567
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.550
I just don't know if I,
well,
you know Mike favor men?
No,
really?
I don't know.

568
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.740
I just met him recently.
He's a great dude.

569
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.850
<v 0>He had this story about,</v>

570
00:33:44.851 --> 00:33:48.660
he was beaten off in his hotel room and the made opened up the door and the maid

571
00:33:48.661 --> 00:33:51.690
freaked out.
He was like,
oh,
come on,
shut the door,
shut the door.
Shut the door.

572
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:56.820
He's like the only guy ever to get caught beating off and fucking a maid like

573
00:33:56.821 --> 00:34:01.590
ever.
Like you really did it.
He said,
I go,
what?
Did she do?
Hair?
No,
no.

574
00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.890
I go,
I go,
what do you wish she looked like?
She goes,
it wasn't no prize.

575
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:10.190
<v 2>Right.
It looks like Feynman.
Mike's a good dude.
He's a good dude.</v>

576
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:13.550
He's a very good cook.
Oh wait.
He's the guy that's functional shifts.

577
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:18.080
Punchy and Ray Donovan.
He doesn't that picture.

578
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.490
I know the picture.
It's the hat,
man.
Whatever it was.
It was.

579
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.460
It was like a movie scene.
This kid.
And he was just,
you know,

580
00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:29.360
favor men will punch you in your fucking face.
He's crazy.
He's always been crazy.

581
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:34.150
He's a good dude though.
The wife beater right there.
He is with the homeboy

582
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.700
<v 0>from the radio.
What's his name?
Uh,</v>

583
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.720
oh yeah.
Uh,
uh,
Frazier.
Smith.
Frazier's man and Dom Barris.

584
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:46.940
He's a Boston guy.
Frazier Smith used to have a radio show here.
No,
no,
no.

585
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.420
Yeah.
He's favor missing originally.
Yeah.
Favorite mint.

586
00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.210
It's just going to say he looked like the funniest guy at the barbecue.

587
00:34:54.211 --> 00:34:57.960
And you switched to a picture of barbecue with favor men.

588
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.120
Joey Diaz and Ralphie May.

589
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:04.800
The day nine 11 happened the day they shut down all the flights,

590
00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.450
the day the shit hit the fan.
We all got high.
We went to Baja fresh.

591
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.320
We ate some Burrito's and we stared at the sky.
It's like two,
there's no planes,

592
00:35:13.321 --> 00:35:14.370
there's no fucking planes.

593
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:19.520
And then we went over to Ralphie's place and Ralphie and favor men lived like in

594
00:35:19.741 --> 00:35:24.690
the same area and famously a gardener then fibrin.
No.
Ralphy.
Uh,

595
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.980
it was Gardner coach and horses.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Actually,

596
00:35:28.981 --> 00:35:30.780
you know what we went to,
I'm sorry.

597
00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.300
We went to favorites place and Ralphie came over to buy weed.
Just favor.

598
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.100
<v 2>That was your September 11 cause you used to live in that</v>

599
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.840
<v 0>same building.
Yeah.</v>

600
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.050
This guy in the world because this is Armageddon and we're going to need to eat

601
00:35:43.051 --> 00:35:46.740
someone famous and had some good weed.
No,
he had some good weed and we were like,

602
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:49.770
well the world is ending.
Let's go get fucked up.
So we went and got high.

603
00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:51.930
It was me and Diaz and favor,

604
00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:56.940
Ben and Ralphie May and it was 2001 it was the day when we were,

605
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.080
we were just sitting around smoking weed talking about how crazy it was like

606
00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:02.940
this might be where it might be in the middle of a war.

607
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.850
We were thinking at that moment in time that this is just the beginning.

608
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.120
The planes flew into buildings,
but what of Shit starts happening left and right.

609
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.580
Like what if we start seeing missiles headed to la?

610
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.220
What if we see la hit with a nuke?
Like fuck,

611
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:19.170
oh that's just as likely as two planes flying into buildings and the same day.

612
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.160
So we were freaking out and we're all getting high together.
So

613
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.010
<v 4>I was in Amsterdam at the zoo,</v>

614
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.970
three o'clock at the zoo and Amsterdam is feeding time.

615
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.280
That's 3:00 PM is 9:00 AM in New York City.

616
00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.400
And I had been there before for it and I knew I wanted to be in front of the

617
00:36:34.401 --> 00:36:36.590
lion cages when a,

618
00:36:36.591 --> 00:36:39.890
at three o'clock when they're throwing the meat out and like it's cool to lions

619
00:36:39.891 --> 00:36:40.580
start,

620
00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:45.020
they can smell the demeanor and the back and they'd start getting start pacing

621
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:46.360
and Growlin and,
and uh,

622
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.800
there's these metal doors and they're scratching on it and shit.

623
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.820
It was pretty cool.

624
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.880
And then they opened the metal doors and they grabbed the meat.
So when the,

625
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.470
when the,
when the planes hit,
I was watching the lions rip raw meetup.

626
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:57.391
<v 0>Oh,
see I,</v>

627
00:36:57.391 --> 00:37:01.180
I would assumed all the animals would have run for the hills knowing nine 11 it.

628
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.520
<v 5>How come they</v>

629
00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.940
<v 0>come?
They don't do that.
The Netherlands is so open minded.</v>

630
00:37:10.941 --> 00:37:14.210
Why don't they feed those animals animals?
Why do they have to feed him?
Well,

631
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.680
they want to eat animals more important.
Why is Baja fresh open on nine 11

632
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.000
our troops need to fuel up.

633
00:37:23.001 --> 00:37:27.020
They were a part of healthy carbs.
That's what it is.

634
00:37:27.021 --> 00:37:28.430
Our troops need to fuel up.

635
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.990
We need beans and the beans and Jalapenos

636
00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.150
by first supports the troops.
Mike favorite walking,

637
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:42.980
the guy that actually put together that boxing match with all the comics.
Oh,

638
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:51.050
one of the guys had cerebral palsy and I was like,
that's not good.

639
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:55.280
If it's Josh blue against crazy legs,
Fon Saika.

640
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.240
Either one of those guys should not be hitting each other and then maybe falling

641
00:37:59.241 --> 00:38:02.450
on each other and headbutting each other on the way down in a chair.

642
00:38:02.451 --> 00:38:05.180
How far can they fall?
They're both going to get fucked up.
Shit.

643
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.320
I not hear about a comedy boxing match.
And when did this happen?
Oh,

644
00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:10.700
it's spilling too.
He filmed it.

645
00:38:10.701 --> 00:38:13.810
He's like make trying to make it a show and it's really good.
How many boxes?

646
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.350
I know too much about brain damage,
but how did this happen?
When did this happen?

647
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.650
<v 4>Yeah,
if they were men.
And a rusty</v>

648
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.150
<v 0>spot.
Who?
Rusty?
Rusty.</v>

649
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:28.330
Duly best six pack and a all of comedy kids shredded.
No doubt.

650
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.520
I have two,
three packs.
I got to vernal hernia,
ventral ventral hernia.

651
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:36.340
Do you really have my,
my six pack split.
Did she get that shit fixed?

652
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.050
<v 2>Yeah,
I uh,
Bravo had one of those heady.
Oh really?
Yeah,
he did two of them.</v>

653
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:44.180
One on each side.
He got it fixed.
You can't ever had a problem I guess.
Yeah.

654
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.590
Ventral just means front.
I've found out through my doctor Google.

655
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.430
It's pretty intense.
They uh,
they put like a,
like a Web Mesh.
Yeah.

656
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:54.580
Mesh and in your skin and they sell it in and they,
so the,
uh,

657
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:58.720
the area that's wounded comes more strong at that.
And my umbilical hernia.

658
00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:03.160
Then I coughed myself into a groin hernia that I haven't had fixed and now I

659
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:06.580
have a ventral hernia.
I showed it to Christ.
You're on his podcast.

660
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:09.430
He took pictures,
so that'll be up next week.
Jesus,

661
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.280
excited alien bursting out of your chest.
What is it?

662
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.730
What is it from your six pack?
A rots in your guts.

663
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.330
Start to only in a position.

664
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:24.220
I was trying to stretch my back like I was doing sit ups off.
No,
no.

665
00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:27.580
That's how I noticed it.
It doesn't work or anything and you don't feel anything?

666
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.430
No,
no.
I was trying to lean off the back of a bed,

667
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.210
like what my most of my body and I leaned down and then my fucking,

668
00:39:34.211 --> 00:39:39.211
this hump comes out of my chest like alien and Bingo looked down at it and it

669
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.620
audibly screamed and I'm like,
Oh shit.
That can't be good dude,
dude.
Seriously.

670
00:39:44.621 --> 00:39:46.990
Imagine if you were really possessed,

671
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:52.710
what would you do if like [inaudible] bed and I'd be fine if you,

672
00:39:52.811 --> 00:39:55.330
you sat back and you're like,
what the fuck?

673
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:58.150
And it's like a little jack-o-lanterns underneath your skin,

674
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.280
moving around your stomach.
What would you do,

675
00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:02.620
Doug Stanhope would you go to Jesus?

676
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:07.420
I do exactly what I'm doing with this hernia and the other 90 is ignore it.

677
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.130
Oh,
you can't ignore a fucking jack-o-lantern deem and living in your gut.

678
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.670
I have you saw poking through skin and moving around and laughing at you.

679
00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:20.440
You'd have to address it.
No,
I would drink.
And then as Tom,
when you drink,

680
00:40:20.441 --> 00:40:24.400
it's easy to ignore.
Obvious.
But that's,
that's been my life medical plan.

681
00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:27.490
Like my family,
we know you don't go to the doctor unless you got a bullet wound.

682
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:32.440
Right.
And a,
I just got insurance.
Tented,
the phrase,

683
00:40:32.441 --> 00:40:33.850
it's just a flesh wound.

684
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.830
<v 4>Uh,
I just got health insurance,
uh,
under the deadline.
Uh,</v>

685
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.290
and I actually,
uh,
I,
I stopped drinking January 1st.

686
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:47.830
I blacked out in Philadelphia.
Oh,
good story.
Busted my head open.

687
00:40:47.831 --> 00:40:51.910
I got six stitches.
See a nice scar.
Whoa.
Yeah.

688
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.030
Uh,
and I didn't,
I,
you know,
it's too bad.

689
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.440
<v 2>W was the figure out what caused it.
I got drunk and fell down.</v>

690
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.640
So just hang on.
I've heard the story,

691
00:41:02.641 --> 00:41:05.790
so I'm going to use this opportunity to piss.
So you,
you,

692
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.650
so you blacked out just because you were drunk and he fell down.

693
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:13.390
Does it ever happened before?
I mean,
I've,
I've,
I've,
I've uh,
for,
uh,
for a second,

694
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:15.630
over the years it's happened a couple times,
but man,

695
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.860
getting drunk and falling down,
it's one thing.

696
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:20.620
But if you did you black out or I kind of black,

697
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:25.410
<v 4>I was not working.
I was,
I did helium in Philadelphia for New Year's Eve.</v>

698
00:41:25.411 --> 00:41:30.180
Great Room,
had three,
uh,
sold out shows,
fantastic fucking night.

699
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.320
Uh,
it wasn't New Year's Eve night.
I had a,

700
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.730
cause New Year's eve was on a Wednesday.

701
00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:36.680
They had me do those stay for the Friday.
Saturday,

702
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:41.450
I'm off January 1st and I went out by myself.

703
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:45.110
I actually stayed in and worked all day and then I went out about eight,

704
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:50.140
nine o'clock and I watched the fiesta bowl and I had 10 Sierra Nevada's.

705
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:54.140
My brother was at the game and,
uh,
I texted my brother,

706
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:57.050
I was texting my brother Greg game,
love you,
Bro.
And just,
uh,

707
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.650
fell forward off a stool.
And His fucking hit the tile ground.

708
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.130
And this guy grabs my arm and he's put,
lifted me up and he goes,

709
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:07.850
we got to call an ambulance.
And I go,
fuck that.
I don't have health insurance.

710
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.240
I woke up once my head hit the ground by the way,
but this guy goes,

711
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:13.820
we got to call an ambulance.
I go,
fuck that.
I don't have health insurance.

712
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.940
Don't you dare call an ambulance.
I go,
how far is the hospital?

713
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.060
He said two blocks.
I go two blocks and you were going to call an ambulance.

714
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.440
It's like 15 grand.
Oh my gosh.
You know,
and I,
so I walked to the hospital,

715
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:27.650
but you know,
I didn't have health insurance and uh,
you know,

716
00:42:27.651 --> 00:42:30.110
had the Obama deadline been January 1st that have been covered?

717
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:35.830
<v 2>What?
Does anybody understand this?
Oh,
do you know anything about it?
No.
I got a,</v>

718
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.490
at some points I met,
uh,

719
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.500
insurance person and I have like catastrophic insurance.

720
00:42:43.501 --> 00:42:48.050
So if I get like really fucked up in a car wreck,
they'll cover that.
I don't,

721
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.190
again,
I don't go to doctors.
It's just not something that I don't either.

722
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.930
It's probably a good move,
so I don't have any idea how health insurance works.

723
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.730
Yeah,
know if I,
if I need to get out of a social situation really badly,

724
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.640
I'll go to a doctor because I know that they're going to go,
oh,

725
00:43:04.641 --> 00:43:07.490
this do you have to be admitted right away and I'm going to,
sorry honey,

726
00:43:07.491 --> 00:43:10.660
I can't go to bed and breakfast with your parents like I promised when I was

727
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:15.220
drunk.
That's a fucking great strategy.
As long as you can keep the wheels on.

728
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.200
It's a great strategy because there's a lot of cars to keep rolling down the

729
00:43:18.201 --> 00:43:21.530
hill and they make a lot of squeaky noises and but they still get there somehow.

730
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.970
How many surgeries have you had?
Many.
How many,
and you're in perfect Europe.

731
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:29.700
What kind of insurance do you have that you can get your blood drip,
drip.

732
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:34.220
The point is,
he's in perfect physical condition,
doesn't smoke cigarettes.

733
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:34.940
He said,

734
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:39.940
I've had one surgery that I got for free on a trade out by asking for it on my

735
00:43:40.161 --> 00:43:44.780
website.
Hey listen,
I'm not a,
I'm not denying that.
You make a lot of good points.

736
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.440
I would never tell anybody to take the path that I've taken.

737
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.770
Like physically.
It's not a good move.
Yes he would.

738
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.640
I wouldn't unless you really want it to,
but if you,
you,

739
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.080
you tear your knee doing something,
don't keep doing it.

740
00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.420
You get six months of Rehab.

741
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:03.200
I just couldn't wait for the six [inaudible] mad when I see a friend that's into

742
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.250
MMA because I know he's going to die an ugly death.
You know,

743
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.570
all bullshit aside.

744
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.580
I'm s I am sad when I see a guy who doesn't know that he shouldn't be doing it.

745
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:17.720
There's a lot of guys that like wind up,
not Jujitsu.
Jujitsu is for anybody.

746
00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:20.360
Anybody can do Jujitsu but competitive MMA,

747
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.490
there's some guys that just shouldn't be doing it.
Good.

748
00:44:22.491 --> 00:44:23.870
Cause at the end of this podcast,

749
00:44:23.871 --> 00:44:26.510
Tom and I are going to Jujitsu each other in a death match.

750
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:31.410
It's going to be the biggest girls'
slap fight

751
00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.940
<v 3>I'm getting hit.
It's a complete different story though.
You know,
I've had a,</v>

752
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.180
I've had two knee surgeries,
I've had nose surgery.

753
00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:42.190
Those are the two big nose surgery.

754
00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.620
I'm actually a three knee surgeries now that I think about it.

755
00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:47.770
Cause I had two on one knee,
had an ACL,
reconstructed,

756
00:44:47.771 --> 00:44:49.600
and then I hadn't been a minute meniscus scoped.

757
00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.630
And the other one I had the ACL reconstructed.

758
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.460
And then I had my nose opened up cause I had a,

759
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.370
<v 2>when you fernet surgeries,
I remember my cousin did a pilot.</v>

760
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:04.970
My cousin did a pilot in 1984 with Christopher Lloyd and he's the guy from

761
00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.590
Massachusetts.
You just,
you,

762
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:12.000
your snapshot was in the paper in the back row of a thing.

763
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:15.630
Everyone talks about it.
So it was a big deal.
And I moved to La.

764
00:45:15.631 --> 00:45:19.920
I saw Christopher Lloyd at the bar,
at the Improv,
and I went up.
I go,
hey,

765
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.530
I don't know if you remember,
I don't want to approach you,

766
00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:24.660
but grant Forzberg is my cousin.

767
00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:29.010
And you did a television pilot with them in the 80s and he goes,
oh no,

768
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:32.970
I did a lot of TV shows.
How do you get that fucking,
yeah,

769
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:37.500
well fuck that.
You forget a TV show.
But when you forget surgeries,

770
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.340
we think about how many TV shows that guy's hat.
I've only had four surgeries,

771
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:45.750
but you are pretty manual.
But you forgot one.
Actually,
now that I think about it,

772
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:50.550
it's three knee surgeries.
Well it's,
you start treating your body like your car,

773
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.430
<v 3>you know,
you blow out a tire,
you go,
all right,
you've got to get another tire.</v>

774
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.260
Can they fix it?
As long as they can fix it.

775
00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.320
But shit that gets weird is like spinal shit.

776
00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:02.100
And that's why I've been getting this Regina King Shit.
The Regena keen stuff.

777
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:07.430
<v 2>You haven't stopped disc,
mixed martial arts.
Well Not Jujitsu.</v>

778
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:11.520
I haven't stopped you just gotten into Regina cane from some Nazi doctor

779
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:17.370
Mengele Jr has got you on the yellow stuff.
I had to take a break,

780
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:18.540
the yellow shear,

781
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.490
<v 3>uh,
from Jujitsu because of this injury.</v>

782
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:24.180
So I'm trying to get back in shape to do it again is just too much fun.
You know,

783
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:27.000
it's like,
that's why I sympathize with you guys smoking cigarettes.

784
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:31.350
I understand what you're doing.
You're just my,
my,
uh,
what I do,
the risks.

785
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.020
<v 2>I take a seat Africana physical.</v>

786
00:46:33.021 --> 00:46:36.650
You're going to see Shawn Rao shaking and anally scratching his arm.

787
00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.920
It needs some more.
The yellow shit man.
Heat my blood.

788
00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:44.180
I need more of the yellow shit.
It's not cheap.
That's the other problem.

789
00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.540
You think your house making money.
Do you think Obamacare was heck your Dick,
man,

790
00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:49.710
Sean,
you're not that young anymore.
I saw,

791
00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.460
yeah,
I don't think it is.
I don't think it's covered by any insurance.

792
00:46:55.461 --> 00:46:59.950
It's what's called off label.
I saw you can only buy it in bitcoin.

793
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.760
It's that
Dojo

794
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:08.040
<v 3>coin.
You could use doge coin too.
They accept now accepting Doge coin.
I made,
uh,</v>

795
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:12.450
from the,
uh,
that thing with that dude is over 2000 bucks.
That's amazing.

796
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.690
2100 bucks going to him.
Yeah.
We uh,
we had,

797
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:19.350
he will donate bitcoin and I would treat the bitcoin like it was real money and

798
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:23.430
then I would take whatever anybody donated in Bitcoin and send it to my friend

799
00:47:23.431 --> 00:47:27.150
who's living in the Congo.
And uh,
he's helping pygmies in the Congo.

800
00:47:27.151 --> 00:47:30.370
It was like building the wells and shit.
So he's going to send a,

801
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.730
you know it's going to be real actually.
Fuck it.
I'll double it.
Whatever it is.

802
00:47:33.731 --> 00:47:37.090
I'll go wherever they have.
All right.
Whatever other people put in,
I'll,

803
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:39.850
I'll put in the exact same amount.
So I think it's like 2100 bucks.

804
00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:43.340
It's pretty cool because the guys living in the Congo,
you know,
I mean key.

805
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.470
He used to be a mixed martial arts fighter and he just went down there for like

806
00:47:47.471 --> 00:47:49.620
a vacation just to see what it was like.
You know,

807
00:47:49.621 --> 00:47:51.490
sue and he fell in love with these people.

808
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:54.040
Like this idea that these people in the Congo,

809
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:57.460
these pygmies are these like really suppressed people that are forced to work in

810
00:47:57.461 --> 00:48:01.000
mines and they don't have any,
no one's taking care of them.
There's no medicine,

811
00:48:01.001 --> 00:48:02.410
there's no water.
Then I'm clean water.

812
00:48:02.411 --> 00:48:06.400
So he's building them house and shit and it's really amazing.
It's amazing shit.

813
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:08.390
<v 6>Judge.
Do you want to put a disclaimer though?</v>

814
00:48:08.391 --> 00:48:10.700
Like I'm a maximum amount cause you don't want it to be like,

815
00:48:10.701 --> 00:48:15.470
I don't want no more than like 50 grand.
You can go fuck yourself.
That's crazy.

816
00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.520
I like the pygmies,
but come on.
Yeah,
because I mean it's bitcoin.

817
00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.500
Some guys just going like,
Oh yeah,
here's the two h is the,

818
00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:24.870
that's what's weird about it.
It was

819
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:29.760
<v 3>like,
it varies.
Like one day it will be worth 2,900 bucks or a 1900 bucks.</v>

820
00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:33.420
The other day it'd be worth 2100 bucks.
It totally varies from day to day.

821
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.980
It's strange.
It's like,
um,
it's like,

822
00:48:37.981 --> 00:48:40.050
it makes a lot of sense if you don't know what it is.

823
00:48:40.051 --> 00:48:42.720
Do you know what it is at all?
You ever follow it?
The bitcoin thing,

824
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:47.760
it's really hard to follow.
No,
I can't.
I can't do basic math.
Well,

825
00:48:47.761 --> 00:48:49.020
it's not even that we had this guy,

826
00:48:49.021 --> 00:48:53.360
Andreas Antonopoulos explain it to us in very clear terms.

827
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:58.160
We still were like,
these are
beers.

828
00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:03.240
He explained it,
but essentially it's got a very,

829
00:49:03.241 --> 00:49:06.210
a set number of bitcoins that exist.

830
00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:10.230
And so inflation is sort of removed from the equation.
Gold Standard.

831
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:14.070
Sort of similar,
but it's all an understanding.
Understand either.

832
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:18.450
But it's all done on computers.
It's all like ones and Zeros,
you know?

833
00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.600
I don't know if it's a good idea.
I don't know if it's a bad idea,

834
00:49:21.601 --> 00:49:25.500
but it seems to be a,
at least a person could.

835
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.220
It's like we all agree like you,
you live in a small town.

836
00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:32.460
So I think in a small town you get a better sense of community and we'd kind of

837
00:49:32.461 --> 00:49:36.870
all agree that,
you know,
like if you go to a place in their selling sandwiches,

838
00:49:36.871 --> 00:49:40.830
like how much is the sandwich is five bucks.
That sounds right.
That sounds right.

839
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.310
It's makes sense if,

840
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.110
but if we didn't have money and we had used some sort of a barter system,

841
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.800
which still figure out what's worth what,
you know,
that's what we would do.

842
00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:52.680
How many sandwiches are available.
Yeah.
And,
but we're,

843
00:49:52.681 --> 00:49:57.360
we're trapped in this idea that money is the only way to do it.
Dollars,

844
00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:01.560
corridors,
fives,
20.
This is the only way to do it.
It's not the only way to do it.

845
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:05.520
If enough fucking people agree to go this bitcoin route,

846
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:10.170
it's already established like this is a real possibility and everybody's poo poo

847
00:50:10.171 --> 00:50:10.471
in it.

848
00:50:10.471 --> 00:50:15.390
Like it's a joke and it is kind of a joke in some ways because I mean a map.

849
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.590
Yeah,
you're right.
A magic.
The gathering was the fucking,

850
00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.720
the big server that went down like we didn't even wait a minute.

851
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.820
You had a magic the gathering exchange and it became my,

852
00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:28.130
the biggest bitcoins sites in the like what

853
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:32.000
<v 0>the fuck,
like magic and didn't have the right security.</v>

854
00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:33.470
The whole thing is set up wrong.

855
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:38.160
Winds up losing 350 million plus dollars in bitcoins,

856
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:40.820
like the direct equivalent of like the guy,

857
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.980
the guy gets robbed and everybody has their money in.

858
00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:47.750
This exchange just gets fucking robbed but it's still going.
It's still going.

859
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.940
See how it can shut us down.

860
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.710
We want to throw in some fucking smart as far as age just gets all smart on us

861
00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:58.020
and we have to sit tomorrow and I want you to get goofy but,

862
00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.350
but this is a fascinating thing.

863
00:51:00.351 --> 00:51:03.410
In our time we're seeing an alternative to dollars,
the fright,

864
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.900
but then I have alternative.
Everyone goes to what?

865
00:51:05.901 --> 00:51:10.220
Internet currency and then someone could easily rob your or banks or everything.

866
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.610
What are you doing with regular money though?
Or you can just lose your iPhone.

867
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.003
Yeah.

868
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.010
<v 6>Alternative to [inaudible] the guest list.</v>

869
00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:19.290
<v 0>Do you write the number down?
All you have to do is write the number down.</v>

870
00:51:19.291 --> 00:51:23.160
It's not that hard.
Um,
oh great.
Another currency.
I'm broken.

871
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.181
<v 6>Hey,
good smart.</v>

872
00:51:27.181 --> 00:51:32.181
As Barb served one of us up on my strategy to introduce you and your

873
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:38.480
<v 0>ability to retain knowledge,
rub it in our face.</v>

874
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:43.190
Routine knowledge.
I retained affirmation.
Yeah.
So the,
the,
the knowledge of it.

875
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.110
The reason why I keep talking about it over and over again.

876
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.700
So knowledge is not sinking in,
so I don't really get it.
So I,

877
00:51:48.701 --> 00:51:52.100
I talk about it over and over again.
Your reaction to it and you're like,
whoa,

878
00:51:52.101 --> 00:51:56.130
that's fucking crazy.
And then slowly but surely it becomes knowledge.

879
00:51:56.270 --> 00:52:00.410
People talk to me in analogies that then I can get it.

880
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.440
And I try to do that with when I'm trying to do a bit that other people might,

881
00:52:05.441 --> 00:52:09.980
I'll,
I'll go.
It's like this.
Okay.
If you can make it stupid for me,
like a kid.

882
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.380
Okay,
honey,
imagine if you had two apples.

883
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.480
Jimmy's stole one of your apples.
I do that all the time.

884
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:21.350
I think that's a great way of communicating fucked up ideas.
But even then,

885
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.710
but it's both.
It's important to say it.

886
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:29.780
Use the big words and then go.
I mean it's like this like this,
so okay.
You get,

887
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:34.220
now you understand the big word.
I just learned with the stupidity.

888
00:52:34.221 --> 00:52:35.750
I needed to learn it.

889
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:39.800
Especially if you're on stage and you're telling me the joke because if you do

890
00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:40.170
that,

891
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:43.370
you can actually make someone laugh at something they ordinarily would argue

892
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:48.090
with you about.
Right.
You could just sneak it in.
Yeah.
Yeah.

893
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:50.840
Okay.
We were both on the same page.
I love you.

894
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.550
<v 6>Don't we have some ad copy to read?
I'm just here to do the advertisements.</v>

895
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:59.160
<v 0>The ad copies over forever.
Come on one more ad.
Do you see that?</v>

896
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:03.360
Did you have a drone?
I dare you make me uncomfortable.
The in Japan.

897
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:07.530
A drone yet that Jerome went into the radiation in Japan and just flying around

898
00:53:07.531 --> 00:53:11.760
like the deserted cities and it's so creepy cause that's his houses.

899
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:16.860
No,
but just it hasn't been touched since it happened.
It's really a great,
great.

900
00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.480
What do you try to scare the fuck out of me?

901
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:24.480
The only thing that scares the fuck out of me more than radiation is sharks.
Oh,

902
00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:25.980
I like the radiation

903
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.040
<v 3>is going to kill you in the ocean one.
The sharks would kill you first.</v>

904
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:32.520
How about that?
Do you not swear that up?
Fuck that dude.

905
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.590
I go in the water up to my waist in Hawaii and I panic every time because last

906
00:53:37.591 --> 00:53:41.670
time I was there,
a woman got killed by a shark.
That's real.

907
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:44.880
Like if I was there and a woman got murdered by the Werewolf.

908
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:48.300
What'd you go in the woods?
You'd be like,
I'm not going in the fucking woods.

909
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:53.040
But they're like,
hey,
I'll go in the water,
but no,
we're going to Hawaii tomorrow.

910
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:57.630
The next day I won't go in the water.
Fucking tiger sharks,
man.
They're too scary.

911
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:00.720
Tiger sharks and bull sharks.
Those are the scariest ones.
So you know,

912
00:54:00.721 --> 00:54:01.554
in that fucking,

913
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:06.190
the whole movie jaws was based on something that happened in freshwater.
Oh,

914
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:10.180
the New Jersey thing.
That's fresh water.
It was,

915
00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.650
<v 2>oh wait,
no,
that's not the New Jersey thing.</v>

916
00:54:12.651 --> 00:54:16.520
There was a rash of New Jersey Shark attacks in the early 19 hundreds.
Yeah,

917
00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:20.480
that's it.
It was in a river.
Fresh water was all right.

918
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:21.590
That's what's fucked.

919
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.980
Does a thing called a bull shark that swims in a fresh water.

920
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:29.720
They swim so far in fresh water that they saw them in Illinois.

921
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.710
They have them up the Mississippi River in fucking Illinois.
A shark.

922
00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:36.130
Well that's Jesse from your,
uh,

923
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.620
that's more reason we need stronger immigration policy.

924
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:44.060
That's why you can't take my guns from me,
Doug.
Staying hope.

925
00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.410
I literally saw a wall build a fence.
That's what I say.

926
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:52.320
<v 3>I literally saw song the other day that was talking about prying a gun from my</v>

927
00:54:52.321 --> 00:54:55.920
cold dead hands.
It was,
that was the song is like,

928
00:54:55.921 --> 00:54:58.170
you can come get my gun from my cold dead hands.

929
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.460
Like this guy thought about that,
wrote it down,
said fuck.

930
00:55:02.461 --> 00:55:04.500
And I'm putting this shit on wax.

931
00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:09.110
<v 2>But you heard it.
Oh,
I heard the whole song.
I listened to the whole song.</v>

932
00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:12.810
So someone's putting it out.
Someone's on his side.
There's some,
uh,

933
00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:14.180
what's the guy's name?

934
00:55:14.181 --> 00:55:18.650
The stapler guy from office space that played even route.

935
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.870
If you can't get the fucking reference right away,
drop the joke,
Stan.

936
00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:29.420
Yeah.
Stephen root man of constant stuff.
It's right.

937
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.770
There's a long way to get to this pointless reference he played.

938
00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:37.100
He played the record guy that said the guys,
the thing with the thing,

939
00:55:37.101 --> 00:55:40.010
the man of constant sorrow and George Clooney and the,
yeah,

940
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:44.870
see he put it on wax to it wasn't [inaudible] Greenwood,

941
00:55:44.871 --> 00:55:48.050
was it?
Yes.
Let's just say yes.

942
00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.790
That's what I'm saying.
Almost that guy,
Lee Greenwood,

943
00:55:52.791 --> 00:55:55.010
nothing was happening in his career.
He had that one song.

944
00:55:55.011 --> 00:55:59.420
I'm proud to be an American fucking nothing's going on in his career and

945
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:05.960
his career was on fire.
I always tell Henry Phillips to write a Christmas Song.

946
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:10.370
They're so desperate to have another Christmas song that they will play any

947
00:56:10.371 --> 00:56:13.400
fucking thing about Christmas.
They're so desperate to have a Christmas song.

948
00:56:13.401 --> 00:56:15.470
They went with the Hanukkah song.
You remember that?
Yeah.

949
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.620
They will pick a song every year.

950
00:56:18.621 --> 00:56:22.340
Grandma's still got run over by a reindeer fucking 30 years later.

951
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:24.190
They can't to have one more.

952
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.860
Henry Phillips get off your ass and get a fucking Christmas.

953
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.800
How about they don't even come up with new Christmas cartoons?

954
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:33.160
The same fucking cartoons.
The Grinch stole Christmas.

955
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:38.050
It would be CGI now and the Grinch should be like crushing villages a be evil

956
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:42.070
again.
He'd be very demonic.
Wouldn't be so sweet and cuddly.

957
00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:45.340
But what they did with Batman probably too that with the Grinch.

958
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.080
Did you watch the latest Batman?
I've never watched it.

959
00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.080
Where the tragedy occurred,

960
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:55.140
where those people get shot in Colorado for whatever reason ever with a

961
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.090
Christian Bale and uh,
what's his name?
We die.
I've heard it's awesome.

962
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:01.900
That's the greatest family I'm done with.
The dye was the greatest Batman ever.

963
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:03.640
The dark night.
That's it.

964
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.940
I didn't say it best Batman ever because of what happened in Colorado.

965
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.750
It's too bad that it happened.
No,
no,
no,
no.

966
00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.810
The reason I don't watch it is because of that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

967
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:19.960
One of the comics from the comedy works guys.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Serious business.
Oh,

968
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:24.760
that guy.
That guy because whatever,
for whatever reason,

969
00:57:24.761 --> 00:57:27.320
that movie's connected in my head.
Yeah,
that's fucked up.

970
00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.920
I can't just watch that movie for watch that movie.

971
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:34.360
I'll kind of like get weirded out.
But these parties,
one shooting weird you out.

972
00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:39.550
[inaudible] I saw it in the theater after that happened like a few weeks later.

973
00:57:39.641 --> 00:57:40.950
And then you're in the theater thing and you're,

974
00:57:40.951 --> 00:57:44.920
you're looking at the fucking exit doors.
I'm not saying it's logical,
I'm just,

975
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.320
Oh,
I don't go to actual movies.
I saw it at home,

976
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:51.910
but I had to see with Bingo and I can see why the man was traumatized.

977
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.540
I'm not traumatized.

978
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:58.570
I just chose not to see it because I thought about seeing it a few times and I

979
00:57:58.571 --> 00:58:01.330
just kept getting that thing in my head that they're a bunch of people fucking

980
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:04.330
died while this movie was being made.
That's all it is.
I mean,

981
00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:06.550
it doesn't make any sense.
I know.
It doesn't make any sense.

982
00:58:06.551 --> 00:58:10.370
I'm not like arguing the logical,
you know,
uh,
that,

983
00:58:10.371 --> 00:58:13.150
that it makes sense that I had this weird thing.
I love that.

984
00:58:13.151 --> 00:58:16.390
While you're saying this,
you're slamming ice India glass.

985
00:58:16.391 --> 00:58:19.600
I know this doesn't make sense,
but I just need a drink.

986
00:58:19.601 --> 00:58:22.560
I need a little something to take the edge off.
I'm not,
there's no edge talks.

987
00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:25.630
10 I'll put up there here.
I know.
It doesn't make any sense.
I'm not.

988
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:27.640
Why would they ever make another superhero movie?

989
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:31.900
We've seen they made another superman.
I love the captain America.
They're fun.

990
00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:35.830
They're stupid as fuck.
You know he's going to be the captain America Comic Book.

991
00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:37.150
When I was a kid,

992
00:58:37.151 --> 00:58:42.040
one of the few that I looked at and it was the lamest dude.
The Subaru.
Yeah.

993
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.730
He couldn't fly and to fly on the thing,
and then he had the shield.

994
00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:48.130
He was like the biggest pussy superhero ever.

995
00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:52.720
And then in the late seventies there was a black character called the Falcon.

996
00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:53.850
All right.
How about

997
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:59.800
Captain America would be getting his ass whooped in his black friend.

998
00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:01.660
That Falcon would come and save him.
Yeah.

999
00:59:01.661 --> 00:59:05.840
Well that's how it usually happens in real life.
You Negro,

1000
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:10.690
you call your friend,
but it was cute how they,
he's a fucking mask.
You're good.

1001
00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:15.360
But a black character couldn't get his own comic book.
He had,

1002
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.610
he likes introduced.
He had like Captain Marvel.

1003
00:59:18.611 --> 00:59:22.160
Marvel was a little bit more bold.
Marvel had blade,
blade

1004
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.670
<v 0>was a superhero.
He was a Buckeye.
Nightcrawler.
I'm sure they came out much.</v>

1005
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.520
He wasn't really black.
Well I guess he was more like,

1006
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.380
<v 2>that's demonic.
I had Roger from what's happening</v>

1007
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.900
Geeky,
but he was the smart one

1008
00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:42.270
<v 0>group
that was the Roger of my social circle.</v>

1009
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:45.180
A captain.
America was still fun.
I know.
It was stupid.

1010
00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:48.550
I know the premise is stupid,
but it's still fun moving.
Just nonsense.

1011
00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:51.750
He watching nonsense for a couple hours laughing,
you know,
having a good time,

1012
00:59:51.751 --> 00:59:56.220
watching space.
Ships get shot up.
I've missiles and whatever.
It's stupid,

1013
00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:57.323
but it's fun.

1014
00:59:57.450 --> 01:00:00.090
<v 2>Nobody got shot.
You can enjoy though.
Why of people got shot.</v>

1015
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:04.920
A lot of people died and Captain America movie in the promoted.

1016
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.070
You forget where your heart was it the beginning of this conversation.

1017
01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:10.080
I forgot my true loyalty.

1018
01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.580
<v 0>I,
uh,</v>

1019
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.480
I know it doesn't make sense that I don't watch the Batman movie and I've come

1020
01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:19.550
close to wash it a few times,
but I always think,
think,

1021
01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:22.280
I don't want to fucking shit.
That's what it is.
Because of that,

1022
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.710
that guy did joker.
He was amazing.
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
I mean,
uh,

1023
01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.840
that heath ledger character was fucking incredible.
He was amazing.

1024
01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:33.500
<v 2>Wait.
Yeah,
no I can't.</v>

1025
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:38.450
That's the one that heath ledger was that he was the chosen around when that was

1026
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:43.140
the note pain pain and Christian Bale was the,
was the,

1027
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.090
was the Guy Heath Ledger's years ago,
she became my grandpa.

1028
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:50.660
My grandpa doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about,
but yells about it.

1029
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:54.540
Fucking John Wayne,
John Wayne movie.

1030
01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:58.190
I know every time I say ledger on stage,

1031
01:00:58.191 --> 01:01:02.270
I know how dated it is during the new Batman.
No,
right.
No,

1032
01:01:02.271 --> 01:01:03.650
I didn't say he was in the new Batman.

1033
01:01:03.651 --> 01:01:06.710
He was in the one that the premiere shooting.
No,
he wasn't.

1034
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.170
No one was the bane lock up.

1035
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.520
The Bain one was the one where the guy came and then a year ago or two years
ago,

1036
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:18.590
2012 the 12th.
Yeah,
so may I believe it was may.

1037
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.110
I like to think I remember my shootings,
John Wayne,

1038
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.860
the number one problem with Captain America.

1039
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:28.520
My audience comes to me when there's a big shooting waiting for my response

1040
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.560
as Malaysian planes went down every six or eight weeks,

1041
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.410
I would be the prime minister of the shooting.
That has to come up with a joke.

1042
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.610
<v 0>That's an odd fan base is all I'm saying.
I'm aware of that.</v>

1043
01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.640
I agree.
It's very odd.
It's what you get.
You putting out an odd vibe,

1044
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:57.830
you know,
you live in the middle of nowhere.
What is death squad squad to me?

1045
01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.390
No one ever figured it out.
Well,
it's funny,
I was in London.

1046
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.980
I don't use the word anymore,
just carry the theater.
They go.

1047
01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.970
Some people showed up and they,
they said they were with the death squad.

1048
01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.800
<v 2>I was playing the Solo theater.
It's just like really prestige and or in London.</v>

1049
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.150
And I got to play this,
the,
the,
uh,
this,
this theater man and then fucking,

1050
01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:20.040
they're really proper therapy.
This,
the origin of,
and they were

1051
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.420
<v 0>like death squad from the Ob.
Anthony Show was a Eddie Bravo bread band,</v>

1052
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:29.240
Tate me and uh,
it,
I shut up in the Eddie,
uh,
and uh,
Eddie Bravo was,

1053
01:02:29.241 --> 01:02:33.600
you know,
black belt,
Jujitsu champion and Tate's this big gorilla.

1054
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.490
And uh,
Jeff Tate to no,
no,
no.
After,

1055
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:40.270
quickly after crusher,

1056
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:43.860
and I did our picks for the ultimate tour,

1057
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:48.210
we got down and sat down with his children and wife for dinner and he mentioned

1058
01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:51.990
Jeff Tate.
I'm like,
Fuck Jeff Day,
why didn't I pick Jeff?
Yeah,

1059
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:54.870
he's a great comic out of Cincinnati.
Yeah.
Anyway.
Oh,

1060
01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:59.160
so you thought it was talking about that guy Tait Fletcher is a big giant guy

1061
01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.360
and oop from opie and Anthony Goes,
look,
Joe Rogan showed up at the desk squad.

1062
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.440
That's it.
And then it was a joke.
We were laughing.
Ha ha ha.

1063
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.580
And then somehow or another people kept using it and then,
you know,

1064
01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:16.080
many years later,
Brian started the uh,
these videos.
Remember those videos?

1065
01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.880
They Rachel desks going podcast.
Yeah.

1066
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:20.970
We used to do these videos like at shows and uh,

1067
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.880
then he started the desk squad podcast network.

1068
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.880
The videos were all just us hanging around at shows like you would do these

1069
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:30.010
little clips of stupid shit that was happening.
It was actually,

1070
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.300
we did the Joe show and there's all this extra footage that was just bullshit

1071
01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:35.670
stuff inside.
Just made like quick one minute videos.

1072
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:39.900
Every time I see a death squad tee shirt in my audience,
which is often,

1073
01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:42.990
I always say,
hey,
death squad is point a to point them out on stage.

1074
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.660
It's a weird name and I'm going to stop doing that by my tee shirts.

1075
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:49.300
You've got your tee shirts anyway.
It's a weird name too.

1076
01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.460
That's why I stopped using it,

1077
01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:53.130
but I just stopped using it because it just sounds too crazy to use.

1078
01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:56.700
But feel free to keep using it.
I know.
I never knew the origins.
I just,

1079
01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.060
I assumed that was your network.
No,
it's Brian.
Well,

1080
01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:03.360
Brian started his podcast and he used that name.

1081
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:07.150
The new sort of represented all of us.
No,
I just have this.
Yeah.

1082
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.870
What is a network?
You know,
what does that mean?

1083
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:12.390
Hell have a network of guys that I'm friends with his comedy officially.

1084
01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:17.570
Hey I a bill burr and a,

1085
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:19.470
yeah,
sure I'll do that.

1086
01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.650
All that means is that you are joining up with a bunch of other people.

1087
01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:26.040
So in that sense,
yes.
But it's completely unofficial.

1088
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.160
So like my podcast is joined with Ari's podcasts is joined with Joey Diaz.

1089
01:04:32.271 --> 01:04:36.360
His podcasts is joined with Dunkin's podcast is joined with all the desk squad

1090
01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:39.230
podcasts at red band produces is joined with Dr Burge.

1091
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:42.290
Crisis podcasts is joined with Tom Seger and Christie.

1092
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:46.350
But it's all completely,
because we're friends,
there's no agreement,

1093
01:04:46.351 --> 01:04:49.680
but we all support each other.
We all constantly like all things.

1094
01:04:49.681 --> 01:04:54.030
Comedy is like that as well.
I'm with tracks.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Yeah,
yeah.

1095
01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:57.210
And they just want to,
you know,
comedians to,
you know,
get some beautiful,

1096
01:04:57.211 --> 01:05:00.720
do their own thing.
Yeah.
But we're not like,
there's no like official connection.

1097
01:05:00.721 --> 01:05:04.890
We just saw.
What it does for me is make me more disciplined in that.

1098
01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:05.791
Okay.

1099
01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:10.791
Now I guess I told Bill Byrd tacitly that I will do this on a weekly basis

1100
01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:16.520
rather than go fuck it.
No one cares.
Yeah.
So yeah,
I'll,
I'll,

1101
01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:20.620
I'll be better about putting it out.
Like I feel like I have an obligation,

1102
01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:24.280
but you should hire a guy that just turned the mic on.
It's so fucking I do.

1103
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:27.820
It's so easy just to hire a guy,
but I mean all the time,

1104
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:31.790
whoever he is all the time.
You should have a guy that just turns to my con.

1105
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.600
It's so easy for you.
It'll be fun for you.
I do.

1106
01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.060
You should do him every fucking day.

1107
01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.090
You should have a guy that turns a microphone on you every day just to let you

1108
01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:43.030
go.
Just just turn the microphone on and lets you go.

1109
01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:47.890
And then a bill burst style.
Have you ever done one by yourself?

1110
01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:50.260
I did a bunch of them in the beginning by Marcel.
That's amazing.

1111
01:05:50.261 --> 01:05:53.860
And he got scared to try it even though I know I don't have to put it out.

1112
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:55.023
I have,

1113
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:59.320
I've done it in between two where a guy like you like maybe need to take a leak

1114
01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:02.850
and you get up and I'll just keep going and even for 10 minutes but it becomes

1115
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:06.410
easy after a while you fall into a pattern.
I'm sure it would be at,

1116
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:11.460
but initially even when if I'm doing a set where I really,
uh,

1117
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.490
all new shit too much new shit do about to do a,
a,

1118
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.040
a DVD,
whatever,

1119
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:22.990
I will get Brian my manager and make him like I just have to say this out loud.

1120
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:26.410
You have to stand there but I can't say it out loud to myself.
Okay.

1121
01:06:26.411 --> 01:06:28.510
This segues into this and then I'm going to do this.

1122
01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.960
Say it out loud in front of someone other than the audience.
Important?
No.

1123
01:06:31.961 --> 01:06:34.250
Before a show.
Like if I,
if I,

1124
01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:39.251
if I like when I worked at UK and I have to abandoned two thirds of my set cause

1125
01:06:40.421 --> 01:06:43.990
it doesn't translate and I've been writing a bunch of new shit that I don't

1126
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:47.590
really know and I have to say it out loud before I go on stage.
Okay.

1127
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:49.840
This is the segue.
This gets me into this.

1128
01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:54.670
I'll make Brian listen to me say not the whole set but the bullet points and

1129
01:06:54.671 --> 01:06:58.870
what the segway is,
cause I couldn't say it to myself,
which I really am,

1130
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:02.920
but I need someone standing there,
right to say it out loud.

1131
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:08.070
And that's what a podcast by myself would feel like.
Nah.
Yeah,

1132
01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.100
I see where he was.
But it's,

1133
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:14.650
it's more of a freestyle thing if you choose to just go over what's going on in

1134
01:07:14.651 --> 01:07:17.960
the news every day.
There's always something in the news.
It's fascinating.
The,

1135
01:07:17.961 --> 01:07:19.570
the,
the beautiful thing about the time we're in,

1136
01:07:19.571 --> 01:07:22.720
if you wanted to do a solo podcast is all you have to do is go to your Twitter

1137
01:07:22.721 --> 01:07:26.110
feed.
You know,
I have,
um,
a guy works for me,
Matt stags,

1138
01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:30.880
he's my publicist for the podcast and every day he sends me,
um,
uh,
uh,

1139
01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:33.910
news and afternoon news and evening news in the morning news.

1140
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:36.760
It's all just the most fucked up shit that's going on in the world.

1141
01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:39.610
Fascinating things.
And Nd Day,

1142
01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:43.870
I've got 20 of them any day there's 20 subjects,
but he would just start.
Right.

1143
01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:45.620
But I think what you're talking about like just the,
the,

1144
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.260
when you look at someone,
when you speak,

1145
01:07:47.261 --> 01:07:51.580
just things totally know what you're saying into the air and not looking at it.

1146
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.560
And if I'm,
if I'm talking too much,

1147
01:07:53.561 --> 01:07:57.970
one of you will roll your eyes at me and I'll shut up and let the other guy
talk.

1148
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.350
I don't have that.
But you don't have to do that.
It,

1149
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:04.090
it's a totally different dynamic.
If you're doing a solo podcast,

1150
01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:05.740
like nobody wants you to shut up.

1151
01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:09.920
It's more about just not thinking about what you're saying.
Finding like a,

1152
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:14.940
a like a channel in the river of ideas and just riding it and then just like

1153
01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.280
free balling.

1154
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.620
<v 3>You get like this comfortable free ball thing going on.</v>

1155
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:22.110
And as long as you're not too conscious or aware of what you're doing,
you,

1156
01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:25.670
you kind of catch this wave of creativity.
It's really fun.
You know,

1157
01:08:25.671 --> 01:08:26.750
I've only done it a few times,

1158
01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:29.660
but I've done it on stage a bunch of times and there's this thing that Brian

1159
01:08:29.661 --> 01:08:34.500
does,
um,
with um,
uh,
Jeremiah Watson have Thunderpussy.

1160
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:38.600
Yeah,
that's the name though,
right?
Yeah.
Jeremiah Watkins,
Watkins,
sorry,

1161
01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:42.350
I said Watson.
Jeremiah.
I used to do it after shows,

1162
01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:45.260
but the better way to do it,
it's to do the whole show this way.

1163
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:49.550
We just yell out like the audience,
he yells out subjects,
you just,
you don't,

1164
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.980
you don't have any preparation whatsoever.
The audience,

1165
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:55.280
he yells out subjects and then yelling out subjects.
You just add a,

1166
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.830
like maybe a subject you never even thought about.

1167
01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:02.060
You'll just start talking about that subject and try to create comedy and under

1168
01:09:02.061 --> 01:09:05.990
the gun with a bunch of people watching,
a lot of times shit just comes up

1169
01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.590
<v 2>and it sounds like is fun like that and then give you the ideas,</v>

1170
01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:10.390
but it's different.
Yeah.

1171
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:13.470
<v 3>That it's not,
not a bunch of comics to come up with these wacky things.</v>

1172
01:09:13.471 --> 01:09:16.400
Orangutang pineapples.
What?
Orangutan fire?

1173
01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:19.790
<v 2>No,
it's fucking the audience.</v>

1174
01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:23.540
It's the audience which comes up with the dumbest ideas that are the easiest to

1175
01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:25.310
play off of sometimes.
Yeah,

1176
01:09:25.311 --> 01:09:28.580
like whenever you see like whenever there'd be an inch,
a improv group.

1177
01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:35.750
Oh,
you know what?
Who Says Sucking Dick?
It's not always,
that's three nights ago.

1178
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.630
They just heard second dick from the audience.
Now remember,

1179
01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:41.240
always improv troupes.
They go,
okay,
give us a word.
And it was always,

1180
01:09:41.241 --> 01:09:44.420
the first word was always someone in the audience dildo.
It was always like,
no,

1181
01:09:44.421 --> 01:09:47.900
I found the level of the crime.
Know what genre of film?

1182
01:09:47.901 --> 01:09:51.800
Everybody always says porn.
He says silent movies.

1183
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:55.250
They all say porn you got,
and if they do say silent movies,

1184
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.620
you know every fucking 45th show,

1185
01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.390
you abandoned the porn reference and go silent movies.
Okay,
we'll see.

1186
01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:04.970
We can come up with.
Then she got that shit memorized.
There's a silent born,

1187
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.270
you know those guys that used to work the crowd.
That was a big thing.

1188
01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:10.800
Like guys who worked the crowd,
they would ask the crowd things and people go,

1189
01:10:10.801 --> 01:10:12.830
wow,
this guy just coming up with this on the fly.

1190
01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.540
And then you watch him three nights in a row,

1191
01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:17.300
like he's coming up with the same shit on the fly over and over again.

1192
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:20.650
He's seeing people that had touched themselves.
They don't touch themselves.

1193
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:24.680
Like he's just,
yeah,
he's not really,
oh,
when I say this guy did this,

1194
01:10:24.681 --> 01:10:29.380
no he didn't.
No,
he did.
I have a living.
You fuckhead yeah,

1195
01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:34.370
it's like the worst dirty trick of all time.
My first tour for David Trimble,

1196
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:39.530
I first like road tour doing these triple gigs.
I worked with uh,
uh,
Matt.

1197
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.940
Fuck,
I can't remember his Goddamn name now.
He was at Denver comic,

1198
01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:48.540
but he did crowd rap and it was kind of,
he knew what was coming,
but he'd go,
uh,

1199
01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:53.390
what do you do?
The last Gig in price Utah.
He's like,
what do you do?

1200
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:57.740
Like the whole tour use getting,
I'm a pipe fitter,

1201
01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.950
I'm a meat wrapper.
And I'm like,
how are you getting this?

1202
01:11:00.951 --> 01:11:03.860
He was getting so fucking lucky with the easiest.

1203
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:08.780
So we play price Utah,
which is a mining town.
What do you do?

1204
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:13.830
I work in the mine and he had would've had whatever,
four or five people.

1205
01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:14.820
He said what do you do?

1206
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:19.340
I work in the mine who work in the mind and I like finally you've got,

1207
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.120
now you're on the fucking spot.

1208
01:11:21.121 --> 01:11:24.150
You're going to have to come up with some shit cause everyone is like does

1209
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:27.840
anyone here not work in the mine?
And a girl raised her hand.
He said,

1210
01:11:27.841 --> 01:11:30.750
what do you do?
I work at the common go.

1211
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:35.890
Oh Ah you fucking get lucky all in.

1212
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.320
And you caught that on the right

1213
01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:43.050
<v 0>river.
Come and go.
Whoever came up with that,</v>

1214
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.870
I thought that was a junk.

1215
01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:47.470
The first time I ever saw that shit was in Colorado Springs.

1216
01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:50.890
I stopped my car cause I didn't believe it was real.
I stopped my car,

1217
01:11:50.891 --> 01:11:53.350
I went wait,
that's the gas station is called common.

1218
01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:58.290
Go with a k like some sort of a wacky fucking whore house.
Cook,

1219
01:11:58.450 --> 01:12:03.450
Clean Comedy Knight with a k on Tuesday at the fucking the Clam House with a k.

1220
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:10.510
The common come and go is the number one fucking bid on the menu at the clam

1221
01:12:11.621 --> 01:12:14.860
house.
That's when you just suck your Dick.
They don't,
no one says a word.

1222
01:12:14.861 --> 01:12:18.100
They push you in.
She just sucks your Dick and you go,

1223
01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:22.900
that's the come and go at the Clam House with the k Tuesday Nights Colony Knight

1224
01:12:22.901 --> 01:12:25.540
with a k cocktail cocktail time.

1225
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:30.190
Do you remember those places that we'd have comedy Knight with a k?
Hang on,

1226
01:12:30.191 --> 01:12:34.360
I'm drinking cam check a vodka with a k.
Is that good little plug?

1227
01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.200
What is it?
Shitty vocat who's a,

1228
01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:41.710
is that ours or yours or did you bring that?
I brought that.
What is it?

1229
01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.900
I don't fucking come bearing gifts.

1230
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:49.800
<v 2>What is Cam Chat?
Kovach you know what?</v>

1231
01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.000
I'd step all over my clothes or if I've told you.

1232
01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.570
<v 0>Gotcha.
You um,
you know the,
uh,</v>

1233
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.220
they did this thing where they took vodka and they put it through one of those

1234
01:12:59.221 --> 01:13:00.480
Brita water filters.

1235
01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:05.120
<v 2>Tried it,
heard the trick,
tried it.
We did,
you know,</v>

1236
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.880
straight vodka taste tests.
It didn't work for,

1237
01:13:08.881 --> 01:13:12.120
she said four or five times through a,

1238
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:15.960
didn't work the same shifts.
It's all the same shit.
Years ago in San Francisco.

1239
01:13:15.961 --> 01:13:17.130
You remember the punchline,

1240
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:21.510
they would put you at the Commodore Hotel Room downstairs?
I would always,

1241
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:27.200
I was in the easy like Sunday morning sweet is that I had like a member of the

1242
01:13:27.271 --> 01:13:29.310
staff used to party.
Man.
I had a bunch,

1243
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:33.390
I had like eight people back in my hotel room and everyone drank until the wee

1244
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:35.440
hours banging the whole staff.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1245
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:39.870
But I remember waking up and there was like Tom was completely hung over and I

1246
01:13:39.871 --> 01:13:43.950
wanted to make some coffee.
And uh,
there was,
I was,

1247
01:13:43.951 --> 01:13:47.150
I thought it was a cup full of water and I put it in the coffee machine and then

1248
01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.290
it was vodka and coffee and I thought,
hey,

1249
01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:51.720
this might be the new reeses peanut butter cup.

1250
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:55.320
Remember the commercial guys walking with the chocolate and he bumps into the

1251
01:13:55.321 --> 01:13:57.870
guy with the,
so I like to get a couple of steps of it.

1252
01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.530
It is definitely not the new reason they fucked up with that commercial.

1253
01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:04.200
They fucked up with that research.
Cumbersome

1254
01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:06.730
<v 0>because if you take some chocolate and you dip it into peanut butter,</v>

1255
01:14:06.731 --> 01:14:08.710
it tastes way fucking better than races.

1256
01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:12.160
That's where they fucked up cause he chocolate and peanut butter is really

1257
01:14:12.161 --> 01:14:16.490
delicious.
Booney receives,
shouldn't have fucking hate that.
Yeah.

1258
01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:19.370
It's pretty bland.
And a Brian brought me some,
uh,

1259
01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:24.370
it's all sugar dark chocolate bars one and we had them in the fridge and I don't

1260
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:25.151
eat chocolate,

1261
01:14:25.151 --> 01:14:28.690
but there was nothing to eat and I had bought some pineapple off the street.

1262
01:14:28.691 --> 01:14:33.580
Fresh pineapple with a square of frozen dark chocolate.
Oh God.
It was good.

1263
01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:36.560
Dark chocolate is actually good for you.
It has a very high orac value.

1264
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:40.930
How I feel so healthy right now.
Yeah,
it's high in antioxidants.

1265
01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:43.090
I really good for you.
I don't,
I don't like chocolate,

1266
01:14:43.091 --> 01:14:46.660
but I've had chocolate in Europe.
There was just orgasmic from the first bite.

1267
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:51.220
You're like God damn good.
Every Deli Square.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Those are delicious.

1268
01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:54.880
Ghirardelli's like they used to have a real chocolate factory right there on San

1269
01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.860
Francisco and it was right down the street from the old cobb's,

1270
01:14:56.861 --> 01:14:59.560
the 150 seat cobb's.
Do you ever work that cops?
No,

1271
01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:01.500
I did all the time when I lived there.
I love that.
Right?

1272
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:03.250
The greatest all time comedy clubs ever.

1273
01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.090
Fucking tragedy when they moved out of that place is the big place.

1274
01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:09.250
Tom Sawyer fucking great,
great club.

1275
01:15:09.251 --> 01:15:13.200
I mean it was 150 seats and tight.
Today's Tom.
Sorry.

1276
01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:15.100
All small fucking room.

1277
01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:21.040
He's a serious comedy fan.
That dude,
Tom Sawyer loves comedy.

1278
01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:25.540
I was playing the purple onion,
I guess 60 seat or when you were playing cops,

1279
01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:30.340
the new big room.
We came down to see you.
They just

1280
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:33.790
<v 1>for Millennians now,
like an Italian restaurant are there was,</v>

1281
01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.380
it was always upstairs,
but I came down to see Rogan.
I'm playing a 60 cedar.

1282
01:15:38.381 --> 01:15:41.650
He's playing a 18,000 security cobb's comedy club,

1283
01:15:41.651 --> 01:15:44.180
whatever it think it's a fucking airplane hangar.

1284
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:48.610
Then we hung out with you afterwards.
It's like two 30 in the morning.
It's,

1285
01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.470
they threw everyone out.
It's a staff party and someone had below.
Then I'm going,

1286
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:58.170
I am,
I'm supposed to go do a live remote for a car show like it.

1287
01:15:58.171 --> 01:16:02.900
Good morning.
San Francisco TV live from a car show on Saturday morning.

1288
01:16:02.901 --> 01:16:06.520
And I go,
I'm not going to fucking make it.
I'm just,
I just did lines.

1289
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:11.110
It's two 30 so I got one of the local comics,
uh,
Jason,

1290
01:16:11.111 --> 01:16:15.760
fuck,
don't let me forget your name.
I go,
listen,

1291
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:20.200
will you go to the show as me?
Because the maids,

1292
01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:24.230
the man show is about to come out.
Red Band has footage of this.
Oh that's right.

1293
01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.500
Go down to the car show is me.

1294
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.800
I'm delineating my small amount of authority to a local guy that I know will do

1295
01:16:33.551 --> 01:16:38.020
it.
He's like 10 years younger than me,
eight inches taller than me,

1296
01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:43.080
but I still had him come by my room and get my overcoat and my fucking knit wool

1297
01:16:44.171 --> 01:16:48.190
cap.
That's funny.
As my outfit and I have footage,

1298
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.390
I have my own footage,
red books,
television.
It made a television.
Yeah,

1299
01:16:52.391 --> 01:16:57.391
he went down and the whole graphic on the Kyron on the bottom man show hosts

1300
01:16:57.401 --> 01:17:01.390
Doug Stan hope and he's just doing this straight interview as me.

1301
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:03.400
<v 0>You got it.
That's beautiful.</v>

1302
01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:14.700
<v 8>That San Francisco standing by to give us some insights on.</v>

1303
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.920
It's an interface between dare fucking homework.

1304
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:22.160
I'm very fascinated with,

1305
01:17:22.161 --> 01:17:24.890
is that my space.com we're going to be talking all about it.

1306
01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:33.730
<v 2>That hurts my feelings.
It hurts me.
How dumb that gutter</v>

1307
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:36.820
that wasn't good at Photoshop.

1308
01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:40.870
<v 8>Oh,
this weekend we're at the cow palace.
Where the</v>

1309
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.730
or is it rotten cup?
I can never remember.

1310
01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:48.480
And a motorcycle show was taking place through tomorrow.

1311
01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.160
Another event that's taking place this weekend to actually for next week or week

1312
01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.600
and a half to sketch fest in San Francisco.
Watch them a lot.

1313
01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.760
I gave him my clothes worse.
Stan hope being one of those comedians.

1314
01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.370
And by the way,
I will just,
I'm taking my career in my hands here,

1315
01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.340
but it's all good fun.
This is fun.
And uh,
this,
uh,

1316
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:14.040
Nasser won't take advantage of.

1317
01:18:14.041 --> 01:18:16.810
That's right hand and he understands that my job in my marriage,

1318
01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:23.750
the marriage,
so,
oh my God,

1319
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:25.170
it doesn't

1320
01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:30.120
<v 2>go anywhere for the listener.
It doesn't need to.
The Guy,</v>

1321
01:18:30.121 --> 01:18:33.570
his comedy,
the guy on the Tan jacket,
he's comedy.
Well,

1322
01:18:33.571 --> 01:18:37.500
I'm a walking shot that's pretty ambitious for a morning show.
Well,

1323
01:18:37.501 --> 01:18:40.620
you know what,
I like to mix it up.
Tom.
They'd like to get artistic.

1324
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:44.220
You get a morning show in San Francisco years ago and I was hungover as fuck.

1325
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:48.630
And they go,
would you mind?
Uh,
we have to say was mourning.
We,
oh,

1326
01:18:48.631 --> 01:18:50.930
you were hung over it.
We have to do this,
uh,

1327
01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:55.260
cover this fencing exhibit or some event or something.

1328
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.680
So I had to go down to this fencing place and they filmed it and like,
you know,

1329
01:18:58.681 --> 01:19:02.220
would you mind doing and comedian Tom Rhodes and like I've got the fencing

1330
01:19:02.221 --> 01:19:05.050
outfit on and the mask,
it's like I didn't need to be there.

1331
01:19:05.051 --> 01:19:08.340
It could have been anybody.
Anyone else that is standard and I'm fucking,

1332
01:19:08.341 --> 01:19:09.870
I'm still drunk and I'm not.

1333
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:14.190
I have to offend somebody so I can get like an extra three people in the fucking

1334
01:19:14.191 --> 01:19:17.580
show.
Brendan Walsh did that for me.
What I was,

1335
01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.600
Andy threw a party at the bar that they filmed a animal house,

1336
01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:27.810
the oldest day in the night scene.
Mind if we dance with your dates,

1337
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:28.850
the lever that,

1338
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:33.850
so that bar still exists and there's a campsite out in the way back of Oregon

1339
01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:38.310
near there.
So we had this party at this campsite and we,

1340
01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:42.270
and I can't get cell phone reception and I'm playing Seattle.

1341
01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:46.860
So I had Brendan Walsh,
I couldn't do a phoner to promote my show.

1342
01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:50.520
So we went into town to that bar.
I called Walsh.
I go,
Hey,

1343
01:19:50.521 --> 01:19:54.090
will you do this a phone or in Seattle as me?

1344
01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.890
And it's a show I've been on before,
so yeah,
sure,
I'll do it.

1345
01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:03.090
So he did it and they're like,
wow,
you know,
Kinda,
you don't sound like yourself.

1346
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:06.720
But they went through and Brendan Walsh did a whole interview as he was sick or

1347
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.830
I have no idea what he said,
but he is bullshit was strong.

1348
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:15.480
That's fucking funny.
Tom Rhodes don't pitch this thing if not the bathroom.
Yeah,

1349
01:20:15.490 --> 01:20:19.450
that's not the bathroom.
He's in there.
I've done that a lot.
Have you?

1350
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:23.640
Bingo is caught me so many times trying to go into the closet.

1351
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:28.530
No hotel room to take a piss that you go well that's the amount of times you've

1352
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:29.940
woken up and found me.

1353
01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:34.290
How many times did I pissed all over my own shit and never knew about it.

1354
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.560
I do it all the time.
The humidity,
I guess,

1355
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:39.030
I'm trying to remember who told me this story,

1356
01:20:39.031 --> 01:20:42.870
but somebody opened up their drawer and they pissed on their sock drawer.

1357
01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:43.890
They opened up,

1358
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:46.740
they went to their dresser and they pulled their sock drawer open and they just

1359
01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:50.070
pissed in there and I'm like,
how the fuck did you think your sock drawer was?

1360
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:51.580
The toilet.
I've peed on this.

1361
01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:55.080
I'm sure you've done this dog peed in the corner of a lot hotel rope and that's

1362
01:20:55.081 --> 01:20:55.861
why we're talking about,

1363
01:20:55.861 --> 01:20:59.100
we saw you go through the wrong door thinking going to win.

1364
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.080
You peed in the corner of a lot of hotel rooms.

1365
01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:05.100
A few of them just being plastered and like,
you know,

1366
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:07.470
I was signed it and he thought I was there.

1367
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:12.090
How many times bingos caught me doing that versus how many times she didn't wake

1368
01:21:12.091 --> 01:21:16.500
up that I did that and didn't know I did that.
That's those extra two shots.
Well,

1369
01:21:16.501 --> 01:21:19.980
your brain says it's over.
Doug Stanhope you say the fuck it is.

1370
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:23.100
I was plastered in Ireland years ago and I went out the room door.

1371
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:25.530
I thought it was going into it.
I was just drunk and half awake.

1372
01:21:25.531 --> 01:21:29.100
I just needed to pee and I'm in the fucking hallway naked and I was banging on

1373
01:21:29.101 --> 01:21:32.690
the door.
I'm like,
Hank girlfriend,
get come.
What the fuck are you doing?

1374
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:37.680
Motherfucking door.
We already have this on a podcast.

1375
01:21:37.681 --> 01:21:39.810
Hennigan did that right there.

1376
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:44.340
My manager and Henry Phillips both have stories walking out thinking they're

1377
01:21:44.341 --> 01:21:45.690
going into the bathroom,

1378
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:50.520
walking out naked and the door shuts behind them and they're both naked in the

1379
01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:54.480
fucking hallway.
Go and then you instantly become John Ritter.
I haven't been,

1380
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:59.490
there's no way.
That's not comedy.
You know what are you going already sober?
I,

1381
01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.670
many people know I don't have identification.

1382
01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:06.360
You do like a 20 year bid in a hotel.
You're working in a hotel for 20 years.

1383
01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.140
I'm a dude's coming down naked.

1384
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.840
How many dudes come down Nagin during your entire career holding their cock and

1385
01:22:12.841 --> 01:22:17.630
balls is going [inaudible] Brian,

1386
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:21.990
when he went into it like a locker,
a housekeeping door that was open,

1387
01:22:21.991 --> 01:22:25.080
grabbed a sheet or whatever,
put it over his dick.

1388
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:28.260
I walked down to the hotel and they just gave him the key.
He didn't,

1389
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:31.080
they didn't say ID or anything.
Oh,

1390
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:35.940
one good thing about being old is people don't question your intentions.
Well,

1391
01:22:35.941 --> 01:22:38.770
I also get the get,
I really think it's going to make it old,

1392
01:22:38.771 --> 01:22:41.730
old guy out of the lobbyists quicker.
It's more common than we want to admit,

1393
01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:44.580
especially if people were drinking booze.
If people are drinking booze,

1394
01:22:44.581 --> 01:22:47.040
I think they're pissing in the hallway.
They're walking outside,

1395
01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:49.950
they're getting people get so dry.
I mean,
how many people we've been around,

1396
01:22:49.951 --> 01:22:52.680
they'd gotten so drunk they don't know what the fuck they're doing.
I mean,

1397
01:22:52.681 --> 01:22:57.630
how many people?
Lot stitches.
We're not,
we're not unique.
We're not unique.

1398
01:22:57.631 --> 01:23:00.120
You know,
you,
you add us can connect assaults.

1399
01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:02.250
All the fucking people are out there in the world that are drinking.

1400
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:05.440
There's a lot of people walking down that hall with a Dick in their hand going

1401
01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.690
sheds here.
That could chunk.

1402
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.370
That's the day you gotta Walk to the front desk with confidence.
You know,

1403
01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:13.990
we just got to have one hand on the Dick and the other hand,

1404
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:18.640
like just casually explain your story.
You know,
some man like,

1405
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:21.430
you know,
give it a towel,
take your shirt off.

1406
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:26.320
My only problem at that drunk would be overexplaining it.
I'd be going,
listen,

1407
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:27.850
I went to this bar,

1408
01:23:27.851 --> 01:23:32.380
it was seven o'clock I hadn't eaten or letting him suck your Dick just to make

1409
01:23:32.381 --> 01:23:36.520
the story way over the top.
I've never get the front desk to suck my Dick,

1410
01:23:36.521 --> 01:23:37.660
but I'm not Joe Rogan.

1411
01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.990
But could you imagine if you went to the front desk and the man was like,
look,

1412
01:23:40.991 --> 01:23:42.610
I'll give you the key,
but I want to suck your Dick.

1413
01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:46.840
You might let them at least put his dick in your mouth so you could tell people

1414
01:23:46.841 --> 01:23:50.140
about it.
You would think about it.
This is the most ridiculous thing.

1415
01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:54.920
You Tom Rhodes,
I'm saying ducks.
No.
Was He dug Stan hope letting a man,

1416
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:58.750
you let it go.
You get the front desk.
Hello?
I'm just do it.

1417
01:23:58.751 --> 01:24:03.751
Just say stop saying you suck my Dick as a pre check cause I was going to call a

1418
01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:07.870
hooker,
but if I can't get it up,
if I do this,

1419
01:24:07.871 --> 01:24:12.871
when you give me gnostics on my penis before it weighs $350 on Arrow's guide.

1420
01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.130
Are you plugged in Sir?
Do you have the updated software?

1421
01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.990
Oh yeah,

1422
01:24:25.991 --> 01:24:30.080
you would do it just for the story of my life.
Yeah.

1423
01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.490
You train you and Tom Rhodes,
Tom Roach.
You wouldn't go in there.
Play in the UK.

1424
01:24:33.491 --> 01:24:35.260
I none of my material world,

1425
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:40.520
but getting blown in a hotel hallway by a front desk man.
That's universal to it.

1426
01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:44.380
Well that's the other thing like the UK,
they demand a new shell every year,

1427
01:24:44.381 --> 01:24:48.940
right?
They want you to have like a show like this.
This is the,
you know,

1428
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:51.070
the end of the world show in the UK.

1429
01:24:51.071 --> 01:24:55.540
They all do their shows kind of like plays where they title it has a beginning

1430
01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:58.180
and an end and a through line.
And what's that about?
Well,

1431
01:24:58.181 --> 01:25:00.340
I'm doing the Edinburgh festival this year.
I've never done it.

1432
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.181
And Are you feeling,

1433
01:25:01.181 --> 01:25:05.560
are you going to succumb to that peer pressure where she's always wanted to do

1434
01:25:05.561 --> 01:25:10.480
it and I,
but I mean are you going to just do an hour or maybe do what I do know.

1435
01:25:10.481 --> 01:25:13.440
I'm not going to talk about Mike.
Going to make it all make sense.

1436
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:18.880
Do you like guys,
you have a beginning,
a middle and an end,
right?

1437
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:24.670
You know over there.
I never did.
But those guys do.
They have a themed show.

1438
01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:28.570
Jim Jeffries had,
can't remember the name,
but yeah,
it was about,

1439
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:31.300
he takes this subject and it can vary.

1440
01:25:31.301 --> 01:25:34.660
There's this through line and an arch and then they're supposed to be a tidy

1441
01:25:34.661 --> 01:25:39.300
ending.
Eh,
it's about,
I've done a bunch of shows.

1442
01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:43.120
That's a fucking play.
Yeah.
I'm not into that.

1443
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:47.710
I'm not going out and pounding people with jokes and I'm not an end in the same

1444
01:25:47.711 --> 01:25:49.710
way every night.
I'm not be getting the same way every night.

1445
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:51.850
This is not going to be the same middle.
That's ridiculous.

1446
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:55.540
You don't have to do with that.
Oh no you don't,
but they,
again,

1447
01:25:55.810 --> 01:26:00.250
the same way we have three comics.
Any comedy club you go into,

1448
01:26:00.251 --> 01:26:05.240
there's a an opener of feature which ends,
I'm plugging this everywhere.

1449
01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.980
Stop saying feature fuses the audience.
You're say your next act,

1450
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:13.880
then your headline.
Middle it.
Yeah.
Just say the next act,
but if you say,

1451
01:26:13.881 --> 01:26:16.880
I'm middling for Stan Hope,
that's what you're really doing.
You're middling.

1452
01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:20.270
You did when you went out to eat to an audience of feature they think is a

1453
01:26:20.271 --> 01:26:21.890
headliner.
They don't know the difference.

1454
01:26:21.891 --> 01:26:23.840
Not only that it's gross because you know what you're doing.

1455
01:26:23.841 --> 01:26:26.210
It's the same exact spot doing the same exact thing.

1456
01:26:26.211 --> 01:26:28.670
You're trying to pretend it's more prestigious by calling it a feature.

1457
01:26:28.671 --> 01:26:32.060
That's stupid,
but a feature would sound like a headline or two.

1458
01:26:32.061 --> 01:26:37.061
A pedestrian audience who ends up England wasn't a thing of mega anybody ever

1459
01:26:37.311 --> 01:26:38.420
used in the east coast.

1460
01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:41.630
That was the thing that you would only use in the road for whatever reason.

1461
01:26:41.631 --> 01:26:45.770
Guys would use.
No point was in the UK.

1462
01:26:45.771 --> 01:26:49.310
They tend to do that.
They have a theme to show.
They have a,
you know,

1463
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.470
this is what it's called.
They have opening acts.
Dot at Edinburg.

1464
01:26:54.471 --> 01:26:57.230
No,
no.
You,
you go out,
you perform your show.

1465
01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.270
I at some point I go,
I don't,
I don't know.
These rules don't apply to me.
Yeah.

1466
01:27:02.271 --> 01:27:06.230
I'm going to bring fucking Henry Phillips silver,
but in,
in clubs,
in England,

1467
01:27:06.231 --> 01:27:08.150
not usually.
A lot of times the best comedians,

1468
01:27:08.151 --> 01:27:11.150
the host opens a 20 the whole show is his thing.

1469
01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:13.310
In America,

1470
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:16.850
we put on like open makers who have no experience and they don't know how to run

1471
01:27:16.851 --> 01:27:18.350
a show.
It's great when in England,

1472
01:27:18.351 --> 01:27:21.070
like a show's great from the start because you got,

1473
01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.700
and usually he's getting middle of most,

1474
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.790
everyone else does 20 minutes sets and this guy,

1475
01:27:25.791 --> 01:27:29.900
it's like he's presented David Letterman.
We used to do that in Boston,

1476
01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.090
but that was the thing in Boston,

1477
01:27:32.091 --> 01:27:36.200
it would be like tonight is a dawn Gavin show and friends.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1478
01:27:36.201 --> 01:27:39.590
Steve Sweeney and friends,
Kevin Knox and friends,
they would,
Kevin,

1479
01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:40.880
Kenny Rogers in in France.

1480
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:45.860
They did that all the time putting the fucking open miker hey no,

1481
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:50.150
look he was,
every people know the first guy is going to suck.
Change.

1482
01:27:50.151 --> 01:27:52.960
Why you saying we can change if anybody can fucking do whatever the fuck did

1483
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:56.830
they want?
It's you two.
You could both do whatever the fuck you want.
Yeah,

1484
01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.100
I'm talking about the United States,
about the club format.

1485
01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:05.150
Zig zags in Springfield,
Missouri.
Right,
right,
right.
But do you do it?

1486
01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:09.440
I don't do it.
I don't go out first and host the show.

1487
01:28:09.441 --> 01:28:13.190
Was I thinking about people who are still in comedy clubs where there people are

1488
01:28:13.191 --> 01:28:15.740
going to see comedy and not the comics.

1489
01:28:16.230 --> 01:28:19.670
So I still think they have to put three up.
I taught,
I've fucking

1490
01:28:21.290 --> 01:28:22.740
plow through.
I say,

1491
01:28:22.741 --> 01:28:26.980
I said this on fucking Bert Kreischer oh,

1492
01:28:26.981 --> 01:28:29.360
I see what she like one conversation.
But yes,

1493
01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.680
if you don't have a great herd of comics,

1494
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:37.700
don't just put up a guy that's shitty because you think you need three.
Right?

1495
01:28:37.701 --> 01:28:42.620
But don't you think that the only way we ever get really better at comedy,

1496
01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:45.770
all of us is everybody needs to be thrown to the wolves.

1497
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:47.420
There's gotta be a trial by fire.

1498
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.870
I think if you see a guy who's got any town as well,

1499
01:28:49.871 --> 01:28:52.760
but Mike nights are for that.
Sometimes it's like the fucking owner.

1500
01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:57.170
I'll go up and do 10 because you don't have a third comic,
you don't need three,

1501
01:28:57.230 --> 01:29:01.050
you're totally right.
But when I used to take guys in the road with me too,

1502
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.060
for the Diaz

1503
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:06.300
<v 3>security spot,
those guys like Dunkin and Ari,</v>

1504
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.610
both those guys,
when I started taking him on the road with me,

1505
01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:12.270
we're essentially open makers and they really didn't work professionally very

1506
01:29:12.271 --> 01:29:15.240
much.
We weren't making money off of it,
but I knew that they had potential.

1507
01:29:15.241 --> 01:29:19.410
So I figured if they can go on stage and break the crowd in like you,

1508
01:29:19.411 --> 01:29:21.960
you go out to a cold crowd every night,

1509
01:29:21.961 --> 01:29:25.800
a packed crowd that paid money and your use.
Oh that's,
Hey Mike Nights,

1510
01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:30.810
it's fucking great.
It's great for them.
And they both worked for worked for me.

1511
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:31.470
<v 4>Right?</v>

1512
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:34.650
But those guys have personalities that people love from hearing him on your
show.

1513
01:29:34.651 --> 01:29:36.780
That's just regular.
No,
no,

1514
01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.740
<v 3>no.
This way before that.
Okay.</v>

1515
01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:43.800
This was like in the 2002 2003 I was taking those guys the road with me and when

1516
01:29:44.441 --> 01:29:47.050
they were first starting out,
there was no podcast back then.

1517
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:49.510
I didn't have any internet presence at all.
There was nothing.

1518
01:29:49.511 --> 01:29:51.370
Every show was just you do radio,

1519
01:29:51.371 --> 01:29:54.010
you go to town to local radio though I had nothing.

1520
01:29:54.011 --> 01:29:58.990
I had a message board that was like a pretty popular but you know,

1521
01:29:58.991 --> 01:30:02.290
I mean what does that mean?
Like had like 10,000 members or something like that.

1522
01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:06.700
The whole country,
you can't like fill a crowd at a comedy club,

1523
01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:07.511
something like that.

1524
01:30:07.511 --> 01:30:11.050
So it was all people that knew me most likely from TV and Dunkin would go up

1525
01:30:11.051 --> 01:30:15.490
first.
And by doing that it's like strength training.

1526
01:30:15.491 --> 01:30:16.990
It's like running up hills,
you know,

1527
01:30:16.991 --> 01:30:20.200
you just develop the ability to get out of the gate strong.

1528
01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:23.740
And I've watched them all like sort of like morph in that sense.
So I,

1529
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:27.370
I see what you're saying like it is the best way to do it.

1530
01:30:27.371 --> 01:30:31.210
To have a guy like the Tom Rhodes and friends show and you go out.

1531
01:30:31.211 --> 01:30:34.660
So from the moment they go with the very least Tom roads coming up.

1532
01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:38.500
<v 4>No,
I like going on at the end with the big fat,
our piece of cake.</v>

1533
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:41.330
You can do that to move the middle guy to the front,

1534
01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:43.080
put the shitty high in the metal.

1535
01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:47.600
You're not going to have an opener at the fringe festival,
Aria.
Oh No,
no,
no.

1536
01:30:47.601 --> 01:30:50.720
Just me for an hour.
The problem is the Middle Guy.

1537
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:54.950
<v 3>If the middle guys is shitty guy,
he's just going to get buried.</v>

1538
01:30:55.190 --> 01:30:58.610
There's a big difference between getting buried by like if you have Diaz and

1539
01:30:58.611 --> 01:31:00.830
then after d as You have a guy who's just starting out.

1540
01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:05.390
He did that with an a heart.
We did it with.
Yeah,
that was,
that was not planned.

1541
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:09.350
I mean,
yeah.
Well I mean we did it for fun.
We just still like in,

1542
01:31:09.351 --> 01:31:12.830
but Joey also knows you.
He loves you,
he throws you on stage,

1543
01:31:12.831 --> 01:31:16.070
gives you a great introduction and everybody knows that Joey's coming back.

1544
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:17.240
But there is,

1545
01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:23.170
that's also part of being a great host is not front loading the whole shit where

1546
01:31:24.261 --> 01:31:27.700
you're,
yeah,
you don't open what you're closer and then bring out the fucking,

1547
01:31:27.710 --> 01:31:28.790
we need guy.

1548
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:32.510
You have to ramp it up and then you're going to come back and they make it a

1549
01:31:32.511 --> 01:31:36.050
little stronger and you know how to do the show.
That's the technician.

1550
01:31:36.051 --> 01:31:39.350
That's the guy,
that's your manager of the fucking show.

1551
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:42.830
But there's some guys that are really good,
they're really funny,

1552
01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:45.020
but they still need to be baby fucked.

1553
01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.980
There's some guys that you just can't have someone to strong gone before them.

1554
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:52.920
There's just some guys,
they have a great style.
They have a great [inaudible].

1555
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.620
The famous Mitch Hedberg incidents that happened all across the country were all

1556
01:31:57.650 --> 01:32:00.160
the wrong setup.
Like guy would go up,

1557
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.140
<v 0>it was the wrong middle act.
He would go up,</v>

1558
01:32:02.141 --> 01:32:04.540
he would crush and then Hedberg couldn't follow them.

1559
01:32:04.930 --> 01:32:07.720
And then no one could ever say that Hedberg wasn't brilliant.
Headworks

1560
01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.080
<v 1>but MC,</v>

1561
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:15.340
he was emceeing the first time I met him I was the Middle Act and he'd go up

1562
01:32:15.341 --> 01:32:18.800
with his jokes.
He has,
he had no,
yeah.
Hey,
how's everyone doing?

1563
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:23.690
What are you drinking there?
And it would have a birthday,
like had no skill.

1564
01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.350
Junior stop,
go who I use now.
Like I'll fucking,
I,
I'd make Brian Hennigan,

1565
01:32:29.351 --> 01:32:34.351
my manager or Chaley go up and just say anything if there was no opening act,

1566
01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:39.370
just so junior didn't have to go up cold cause he's got nothing other than his

1567
01:32:39.371 --> 01:32:40.750
jokes.
He has no,

1568
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:44.530
he doesn't have interpersonal skills as a friend.

1569
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:48.850
I don't know if you necessarily need those.
If your jokes are strong,

1570
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:51.970
you don't necessarily need those.
It's,
it's awkward at first.
But you know,

1571
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:55.630
after a few seconds while we played a lot of fucked up venues where you kind of

1572
01:32:55.631 --> 01:33:00.070
have to address awkward situations and yeah,
you need that guy.

1573
01:33:00.071 --> 01:33:04.690
So even just my tour manager going up,
going,
hey,
everyone doing great.

1574
01:33:04.691 --> 01:33:07.120
Okay,
turn off your cell phone,

1575
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:11.770
just announcements and then bring him up.
That makes just get people focused.

1576
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.680
That's a good move.
That's a very good,
but yeah,

1577
01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:17.170
there's some people that are not going to be good MCS

1578
01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.530
<v 0>guys that never respond to anything that happens in the audience.</v>

1579
01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:21.580
They do not deviate.

1580
01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:26.320
<v 1>Hey,
rap guys.
Mc has an actual fucking meaning in our world.
I'll go ahead.</v>

1581
01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:27.380
Wow.
What are you trying to say?

1582
01:33:27.381 --> 01:33:32.090
You start in ration would be the Donald Sterling to don't start a rapport on my

1583
01:33:32.091 --> 01:33:34.190
show.
If you want to go on your fucking all things

1584
01:33:34.230 --> 01:33:38.010
<v 0>comedy and started a rapport,
some east coast,
west coast type shit,</v>

1585
01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:41.640
you go right ahead.
I'm not,
I'm not about that.
Doug.
Stan hope

1586
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:46.530
<v 1>death squad versus eight t.
See what does it.
Thanks comedy.</v>

1587
01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:50.520
Jesus.
Getting an acronym.
Just wanting to make sure it was right.

1588
01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:57.120
<v 0>Comedy.</v>

1589
01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:01.940
You remember when you were starting out and you never had a fucking inkling of

1590
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.490
the idea of having a career,
having a career or common?
It's just like a,

1591
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.940
<v 1>when you get those emails,
they're the saddest emails.
Well,
listen,</v>

1592
01:34:09.941 --> 01:34:12.190
I've been thinking about doing comedy,

1593
01:34:12.191 --> 01:34:16.990
but like w like how do I get paid?

1594
01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:20.350
Well,
if that's how you're getting into comedy,
you're fucked.

1595
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:25.570
When like,
uh,
opening acts ask you,
you know,
are open mic guys.
The same thing.

1596
01:34:25.571 --> 01:34:27.370
You know,
when can I expect to be paid from this?

1597
01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.100
That's a pretty early [inaudible] guys,

1598
01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:32.530
before they've ever stepped on a stage going like,

1599
01:34:32.531 --> 01:34:34.720
how am I going to get an agent out of this?

1600
01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:38.230
What you're supposed to want to get pussy out of this.

1601
01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.110
That's why you get to open Mike.

1602
01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:46.360
You want to impress the next funniest guy who's not funny.

1603
01:34:46.570 --> 01:34:49.010
That's your first goal.
The first time you make

1604
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:51.770
<v 0>the back of the room laugh,
it's the first time you feel like,
Holy Shit,</v>

1605
01:34:51.771 --> 01:34:53.240
I might be a command in I,

1606
01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:57.680
I heard some comics laugh even more the first time when you went open miker you

1607
01:34:57.681 --> 01:34:58.220
heard of pro

1608
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:01.310
<v 3>laugh at something.
You said,
hey,
you're like,
Holy Shit.</v>

1609
01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.940
I made a real comedian laugh.
I didn't just make the audience laugh.

1610
01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:08.450
I think when,
when we were starting out though,
you know,

1611
01:35:08.451 --> 01:35:12.620
you started out in what [inaudible] 90 yeah.
[inaudible] 88 okay.
84 babies.

1612
01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:13.390
You know,

1613
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:18.390
it was just a dream of being able to get paid to do comedy,

1614
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:21.860
but the idea of a career or,
or,
or

1615
01:35:22.410 --> 01:35:23.640
<v 1>the first time I got paid,</v>

1616
01:35:23.641 --> 01:35:27.960
it was either 10 or $15 and then I called my brother.
I go,

1617
01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:32.370
I'm technically a professional now cause I had just got paid.
And he goes,

1618
01:35:32.371 --> 01:35:37.320
does that mean you get to take off the protective head gear?
Well,

1619
01:35:37.321 --> 01:35:38.370
I've always said,
you know,

1620
01:35:38.371 --> 01:35:41.100
the toughest thing about being a comedian is keeping a straight face when they

1621
01:35:41.101 --> 01:35:45.770
pay you.
Right.
Wow,
you just gave me money for this.
Yeah,
no,

1622
01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:50.820
I've come to grips with the fact that I have a scam for a living and I had no

1623
01:35:51.451 --> 01:35:54.690
tough life and there's no way I should get paid for this.

1624
01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:59.670
But like when I did fraud telemarketing before this,
you go,
hey,

1625
01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:02.060
if you don't fuck them over someone else.
Well,

1626
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:04.910
<v 3>first time I ever got paid.</v>

1627
01:36:04.911 --> 01:36:09.350
I worked for a guy named Warren Mcdonald and Warm Mcdonald had a brother that

1628
01:36:09.351 --> 01:36:13.160
was a,
he would do the Ronald.
No,

1629
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.230
he would run the a open mic night.
Good guy.
I forgot his fucking name.

1630
01:36:18.231 --> 01:36:21.070
I want to say bill.
Anyway,
he was a,

1631
01:36:21.071 --> 01:36:25.610
the the guy who ran the open mic night and um,
I worked for him.

1632
01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:29.450
We used to do these norm LOFO gigs in the middle of fucking nowhere.

1633
01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:32.390
Did you ever do another Mambo Gig?
Did you ever do,
I don't know.

1634
01:36:32.391 --> 01:36:36.590
I never worked back east.
You never worked back in Vegas,
but you,

1635
01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:40.160
but you lived in Worcester,
like you went back and did gigs there,
right?

1636
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:43.270
<v 1>I went back lunch.
Was it stitches?
Yeah,</v>

1637
01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.830
once open mic era.

1638
01:36:45.831 --> 01:36:50.560
So the first six months or year I ate shit.
[inaudible] 91

1639
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:54.860
<v 3>that was probably 1991.
Yeah,
I was still there.
I still,</v>

1640
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:57.750
I think it was still there until 91 or 92

1641
01:36:58.630 --> 01:37:03.310
<v 1>back visiting.
I thought,
Oh,
I was it Mike.
What street it was on?</v>

1642
01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:06.370
Was it a bigger stitches or was it the really tiny place that was next to the

1643
01:37:06.371 --> 01:37:10.000
paradigm?
Commonwealth.
Oh yeah,
that's right.

1644
01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:15.090
That is Commonwealth focused saturated old fossilized brain cell that just came

1645
01:37:16.271 --> 01:37:19.570
out and told you his street.
Yeah,
no,
that's it.
The Commonwealth App.

1646
01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:24.240
I wonder what the Paradise,
the Paradise Boston.
I was on bill burrs.
Uh,

1647
01:37:24.370 --> 01:37:28.480
what your Massachusetts?
Yeah,
I,
I'd mentioned czar rex.

1648
01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:31.990
Do you remember Zarek?
This is rx.

1649
01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.590
It was a syrup that you'd pour in the water as a kid like Tang,

1650
01:37:35.591 --> 01:37:39.700
but it was a syrup with a zebra on the front.
He's like,
yeah,
yeah.
He said,
wait,

1651
01:37:39.701 --> 01:37:41.170
wait.
Hey Cyrex.

1652
01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:46.260
We see a zebra and then just like that fucking Commonwealth brain cell.

1653
01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:51.790
He sang the theme song from Zurich's,

1654
01:37:51.970 --> 01:37:56.070
like he was speaking in tongues.
He didn't know what I at first and he goes,

1655
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:00.180
<v 2>wait a zebra,
and then he burst into song and had the theme song,</v>

1656
01:38:00.181 --> 01:38:03.990
which I didn't even know you was.
You went to the real stitches.

1657
01:38:03.991 --> 01:38:06.440
If you went to Commonwealth,
have you went to the original stitches,

1658
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:10.530
which was a next to the paradise.
The Paradise was a rock club.

1659
01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:12.740
Like you're really small rock club.
You're,

1660
01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:16.410
you're trying to end grand dies a rape scene for me.

1661
01:38:16.411 --> 01:38:18.000
I died so miserably.

1662
01:38:18.150 --> 01:38:22.370
But you got raped in a really historical place.
Did No,

1663
01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:26.850
I tied it was the most miserable fucking experience of my early comedy career.

1664
01:38:26.851 --> 01:38:30.720
Took it right in your dick hole at a really important place.
Fucking hated me.

1665
01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:34.410
That's zero rats back in production now.
And they started making,

1666
01:38:34.411 --> 01:38:38.760
what is this again?
What is rx?
Like I said,
it's stuff you put in like drink.

1667
01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:42.210
It's kind of like that stuff where you put it in one little drop into water and

1668
01:38:42.211 --> 01:38:44.850
it turns it into fruit punch.
I they looked,

1669
01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:50.190
they looked at sort of a Tang rip off that.
Uh,
that spot was amazing.

1670
01:38:50.191 --> 01:38:53.760
That little stitches,
that little stitches was a,
the little dark room.

1671
01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:54.630
That was amazing.

1672
01:38:54.631 --> 01:38:58.380
Unless you are a young mullet haired kid and your brother came to see it for the

1673
01:38:58.381 --> 01:39:02.800
first time and you ate shit in front of everyone.
I did my first head over there.

1674
01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:06.290
How'd you do have set?
I wasn't that good.
Okay.

1675
01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:10.380
Your first site wasn't good.
Pretty fucking terrible.
Talking about this.

1676
01:39:10.381 --> 01:39:15.030
I don't know if is Bert Kreischer,
but that would be a great setlist show.

1677
01:39:15.090 --> 01:39:19.830
Kind of themed show.
His breakout your first notebooks.
Oh Wow.

1678
01:39:19.831 --> 01:39:22.830
That'd be great.
I wish I still had them.
I would love to do that.

1679
01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:25.850
It was embarrassing.
I have him.
I got mine too.
Really?

1680
01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:30.390
My first one I wrote out my name I wrote out,
hi,

1681
01:39:30.391 --> 01:39:34.710
my name is Doug Stanton.
I like,
I wrote every fucking word out.

1682
01:39:34.770 --> 01:39:36.330
I have it.

1683
01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:40.020
Did you ever practice on a tape recorder before you actually did comedy?

1684
01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:43.740
I don't remember doing that.
My Dad had one of those things.

1685
01:39:43.741 --> 01:39:46.350
I would try and do like record funny things,
you know,

1686
01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:49.540
we had to push down fingers.
Yeah,
yeah.
Like the cassette thing.

1687
01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:54.590
Office guys did dictation or whatever to those things.
Yep.

1688
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:58.320
I had the exact same thing.
I tried to make silly a little radio shows.

1689
01:39:58.650 --> 01:40:01.200
I didn't try to do that,
but I tried to do standing up in it.

1690
01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:04.620
I would try to do my own version of stand up as if I was talking to a crowd and

1691
01:40:04.621 --> 01:40:06.930
then I would like play it to a couple of my friends.
Do you think this is funny?

1692
01:40:07.170 --> 01:40:12.120
None of them.
They all had the same look like,
oh my God,

1693
01:40:12.121 --> 01:40:15.120
what are you doing?
Like if you're a white guy wants to try boxing,
they're like,

1694
01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:18.990
oh yeah,
I'm gonna fucking kick everybody's ass bro.

1695
01:40:19.630 --> 01:40:22.980
Like there was this,
there was this,
uh,
it's a sense of like,

1696
01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:26.130
like sadness and they listened to your comedy.
Like you're fucking,

1697
01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:29.310
you're never going to make it.
Like this is terrible.
But the open Mike,

1698
01:40:29.311 --> 01:40:30.001
when you're first starting,

1699
01:40:30.001 --> 01:40:32.380
you're like throwing anything against the wall that would work.
You know,

1700
01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:34.590
I was breaking down into two.

1701
01:40:34.591 --> 01:40:38.260
There's two very distinct stages and the beginning of your comedy and the first

1702
01:40:38.261 --> 01:40:42.270
stage.
Did you do anything to try to get a laugh?
Shit.
You don't think it's funny.

1703
01:40:42.450 --> 01:40:46.350
It's just tools that just hammers and screwdrivers and just hoping to get

1704
01:40:46.351 --> 01:40:50.910
something that works.
See monkeys was a phrase.
I thought it was funny.

1705
01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:52.950
That's a funny thing.

1706
01:40:52.951 --> 01:40:57.220
And build anything around it where I turned it into a sexually transmitted

1707
01:40:57.221 --> 01:40:58.330
disease eventually,

1708
01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:01.690
but I just wanted to say sea monkeys cause I thought that was funny.

1709
01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:05.590
It's a funny word.
Yeah.
There was a bunch of those.
I used to say spatula.
I had a,

1710
01:41:05.591 --> 01:41:07.320
I use a prop I used,

1711
01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:11.730
I used a prop on my first open mic and I didn't realize it was racist.

1712
01:41:12.250 --> 01:41:17.250
I was race and why was it a blind drawn a cross burning I made,

1713
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:22.090
it was a monkey with a fucking jockey outfit on in a basketball uniform.

1714
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:26.580
His hat on backwards.
That's with a boombox in his shoulder.

1715
01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:32.220
I had no idea he was attacking him.
Punching none.

1716
01:41:32.221 --> 01:41:36.060
Picking cotton in blackface,
chained to a plantation stare.

1717
01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.280
It was open Mike night.
Sorry.
It's robbing a white man.

1718
01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:47.380
Hey Boo man book,

1719
01:41:50.670 --> 01:41:52.710
Fat Albert's friend with the hat over his face.

1720
01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:59.130
I had no idea it was racist by the way.
I'm wired.

1721
01:42:02.290 --> 01:42:03.970
I'm super respectful.
Black people.

1722
01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:14.250
No one.
I'm sorry.

1723
01:42:14.251 --> 01:42:18.150
What were you saying
something wasn't racist.

1724
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:21.570
I made it an art class.
I started when I was 17.

1725
01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.630
I made a one of those high school,
uh,

1726
01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:27.830
one of those black trace Mr Bill tick.

1727
01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.880
All the white women were climbing on it.
Why was eating a piece of chicken?

1728
01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.570
There's no reason it should have taken this long to,
it gets to this
fucking cry.

1729
01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:51.650
Welfare checks.

1730
01:42:51.650 --> 01:42:55.200
You have his back pocket and have no idea why anybody would take this shit was

1731
01:42:55.201 --> 01:42:56.034
racist.

1732
01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:01.230
It bell bottoms on an Afro.

1733
01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:06.630
That's fucking watermelon is delicious.
I don't know what the problem is.

1734
01:43:08.010 --> 01:43:11.910
Sunday night.
Why is everybody so uppity?
They had big lips.

1735
01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.030
His Urethra.
Yup.
Sorry.

1736
01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:23.950
Right.
Sorry.
I had to make it one Megan.

1737
01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:28.800
I'm funny saying,
sorry.
Nothing.
Black Guy Joe.

1738
01:43:28.801 --> 01:43:32.370
Just try a cigarette.
One cigarette while the store.
I did it with you.

1739
01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.800
<v 9>Come on.
I really don't want to hear this story.
Fuck it.
I ain't even tell him.</v>

1740
01:43:37.730 --> 01:43:40.980
I never would have fucking told anybody.
You guys clown.

1741
01:43:40.981 --> 01:43:44.350
Don't tell anybody on

1742
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:47.620
<v 2>the Internet.
Yeah,
please.
That's ridiculous.</v>

1743
01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:52.280
You guys go off watermelon and your phone.
What was your racist thing?

1744
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:56.240
I'll tell you my first race.
I was a kid.
I didn't,
you know,
whatever.

1745
01:43:56.241 --> 01:43:57.530
I didn't know any better.
I was checking,
you know,

1746
01:43:57.531 --> 01:44:01.850
you're trying to be funny and uh,
I don't know.
I,
you know,
I wasn't,

1747
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:04.420
I made an art class,
uh,

1748
01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.510
one of those street signs that the school's cross cause cross crossing and like

1749
01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:12.830
I made it art class like you know,
like a black markers and I made it and like,

1750
01:44:12.831 --> 01:44:16.400
and I,
and I like yellow poster board.
I cut it,
the s the size,

1751
01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:20.750
the shape of the fucking school crossings.
And I said,
come on.

1752
01:44:20.751 --> 01:44:23.900
When was the last time you saw two ball headed black kids walking to school

1753
01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:29.270
carrying books?
I don't get it.
It was 10.
I was 17.

1754
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:34.040
I was in it.
I mean why is it so it was just,
when did you,

1755
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:37.700
when would you ever see two bedroom flat in the sign had no,

1756
01:44:37.701 --> 01:44:41.060
it's the regular street sign.
Yeah.
What did you know?
A school crossing.

1757
01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.680
So I recreated that exact thing.
So the,
it's black kids.

1758
01:44:45.710 --> 01:44:49.760
It was stupid.
I was 17 you know,
it's way more racist is,
I'm so glad I opened up.

1759
01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:54.650
I didn't get it.
The signs you get when you're in fucking San Diego.
Oh,
those,

1760
01:44:54.651 --> 01:44:56.720
yeah.
The family running across the highway.

1761
01:44:56.721 --> 01:45:00.410
It's the dad and the mom and the little girl got married.
By the way,

1762
01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:03.670
this is not even the dad,
it's the mom.
Right,

1763
01:45:03.710 --> 01:45:07.160
but it's funny that the little kid isn't even running.
The kid is like flying.

1764
01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:11.660
They're running and the mom's holding the kid's hand and the kid is like flying

1765
01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:12.890
cars.
They're running so fast,

1766
01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:17.300
you're supposed to slow down because he's watch out more people seeking a better

1767
01:45:17.301 --> 01:45:19.070
life.
Be careful.

1768
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:23.420
They're dangerous people seeking a better life and that's up fucking weird thing

1769
01:45:23.421 --> 01:45:25.760
in it.
I mean,
you're right next to it.

1770
01:45:25.761 --> 01:45:29.600
You're about as close as humanly possible because the only place I've ever seen

1771
01:45:29.601 --> 01:45:34.160
in the world watch out for people running across the highway a couple miles away

1772
01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:37.370
from bingo.
What's the name of the signed?

1773
01:45:37.371 --> 01:45:39.680
Everyone has like every third house,

1774
01:45:39.681 --> 01:45:42.060
like a political sign where I live on the border.

1775
01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:47.500
A humanitarian aid is never a crime because people that are fucking decent at

1776
01:45:48.441 --> 01:45:52.820
the border where I live and they'll leave water out for people that have tracked

1777
01:45:52.821 --> 01:45:57.800
across the desert and leave jugs water.
No,
that's very cool.
And Yeah,

1778
01:45:57.801 --> 01:45:59.720
you can get arrested for that,

1779
01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.110
but somehow you can get a rest of the water.

1780
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:06.450
I don't know how it works,
but yes.

1781
01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:11.330
Or aiding them without turning them in or however it works so fast.

1782
01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:15.380
The Crystal meth houses to kick in the house has a door of the house that gave a

1783
01:46:15.381 --> 01:46:18.320
water to somebody.
They don't,
they don't do that.
Where I live,

1784
01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:20.930
I think if you made a dent in northern Mexico,

1785
01:46:20.931 --> 01:46:24.350
desert is so fucking just desolate and massive.

1786
01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.100
If you made it that far to the border,

1787
01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:30.500
you should get like a private car waiting for it is ridiculous.

1788
01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:33.470
The idea that we're going to keep these people from coming over where there's

1789
01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:36.270
jobs just because they were fucking shit out of luck.

1790
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:41.350
[inaudible] here's how you attack the militia man guy saying,

1791
01:46:42.110 --> 01:46:45.980
cause they're all family people and Jesus and go,
Hey,

1792
01:46:45.981 --> 01:46:49.980
if your kids were fucking Shitty,
would you not try to

1793
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.630
<v 1>make their life better by doing that?
Like as a,
as a father,</v>

1794
01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:58.710
anytime you go after their kids and put it on their kids,
they had,

1795
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:04.770
would you not try to make your child's life better by getting to a better place?

1796
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.390
If you,

1797
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:08.530
<v 3>we've really,
if we really believe in humans,
just this,</v>

1798
01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:11.800
the concept of human beings,
I really believe that humans are just a,

1799
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:13.940
just a porn bundle of potential.

1800
01:47:13.941 --> 01:47:18.941
If you're not a total complete racist where you think that your race is superior

1801
01:47:18.981 --> 01:47:23.180
or your superior because of whatever shape you are or color you are.

1802
01:47:23.181 --> 01:47:24.014
If you're not that,

1803
01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:29.260
then the idea of borders and keeping people that are poor out of places where

1804
01:47:30.171 --> 01:47:33.260
they don't have to be poor anymore because there's jobs,
it's ridiculous.

1805
01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:35.390
<v 1>Well,
it's funny because people talk about like all of these,
these,</v>

1806
01:47:35.391 --> 01:47:37.940
these immigrants flooding over the border.

1807
01:47:37.941 --> 01:47:40.010
I've been down to visit you a couple of times.

1808
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:44.570
It's was driving to El Paso from your place once and there's that one small road

1809
01:47:44.571 --> 01:47:48.590
that goes from the Bisbee straight to El Paso and it's right along the border

1810
01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:53.430
and there's like army troops out there with camouflage and then there's no

1811
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:58.070
towns.
And then you got,
they got ATV vehicles,
ATC vehicles,
and then they,
the,
uh,

1812
01:47:58.071 --> 01:48:00.230
the border patrol guys.
This guy pulled me over,

1813
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:02.310
I'm a white guy driving a car and he goes,
uh,

1814
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:06.330
I saw you were driving away from California.
What?
The five,

1815
01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.560
I've come to visit you with Florida plates.
What the fuck?
A guy.

1816
01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:13.850
It's completely ridiculous.
First of all,
I mean,
they got drug related,

1817
01:48:14.090 --> 01:48:16.100
which has nothing to do with immigration,

1818
01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:21.400
but you're what you were throwing out still,

1819
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:26.390
almost every argument boils down to overpopulation.
Okay,

1820
01:48:26.391 --> 01:48:31.220
well these people will,
everyone will continue to fuck until they have some,

1821
01:48:32.010 --> 01:48:32.843
like,
you know,

1822
01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:33.990
<v 3>that's a way to look at it.</v>

1823
01:48:33.991 --> 01:48:37.950
But the real issue isn't right now that we don't have enough resources to deal

1824
01:48:37.951 --> 01:48:38.910
with the people that are in hand.

1825
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:42.000
The real issue is there's people that have no access to resources.

1826
01:48:42.210 --> 01:48:46.470
There's people that they have the resources monopolized by gigantic corporations

1827
01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:50.610
and the military industrial complex and there's people that live in poverty

1828
01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:53.520
where the places where they live or some of the richest places in the fucking

1829
01:48:53.521 --> 01:48:54.060
world,

1830
01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:58.200
it's more of a greed issue and the money issue and domination issue than it even

1831
01:48:58.201 --> 01:48:59.310
is a resource issue.

1832
01:48:59.490 --> 01:49:03.060
If you just took the amount of oil that's coming out of places where the people

1833
01:49:03.061 --> 01:49:06.030
are incredibly poor and you just looked at that on the graph and said,

1834
01:49:06.031 --> 01:49:07.260
how the fuck is this possible?

1835
01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:11.100
How is it possible that the place where these people are just born is just

1836
01:49:11.101 --> 01:49:14.580
incredibly rich in natural resources but a company that it doesn't have anything

1837
01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:18.150
to do with this area as somehow or another acquired the rights to suck it out of

1838
01:49:18.151 --> 01:49:21.390
the ground and the people that work in the factories are incredibly poor.

1839
01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:22.680
How is that possible?

1840
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.090
That's nothing but cruelty has nothing but people with a shit ton of money

1841
01:49:27.091 --> 01:49:29.250
dominating people who don't have that opportunity.

1842
01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:32.940
It's nothing but a lack of humanity.
It's not about how many babies you have.

1843
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:35.220
It's not about resources.
It's about cons.

1844
01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:35.691
<v 1>Yes,</v>

1845
01:49:35.691 --> 01:49:39.830
it is about resources because there's more people all the time and that's why we

1846
01:49:39.831 --> 01:49:41.540
need more resources.
It is,
but it's,

1847
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:45.740
<v 3>did they do with that money,
if they'd used that money to enrich these people?</v>

1848
01:49:45.741 --> 01:49:49.180
It's been proven that when get people into an industrialized setting,

1849
01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:52.540
you get people into a nice city.
They have plumbing there,

1850
01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:54.850
their amount of children,
they have drops.

1851
01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:58.060
Like that's one of the number one concerns about all the people that like

1852
01:49:58.061 --> 01:49:59.500
believe in overpopulation.

1853
01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:02.920
There's another school of thought amongst like real scholars.

1854
01:50:03.490 --> 01:50:07.600
I'd say that the overpopulation exists in rural areas,
third world countries,

1855
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:09.850
a lot of different places.
India,
China,
what have you.

1856
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:14.980
But when places become stabilized and people started having careers and lives,

1857
01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:17.110
the number of children they have actually drops.

1858
01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:21.220
It drops to like every couple will have like one and a half kids or something

1859
01:50:21.221 --> 01:50:25.390
like that,
you know,
per,
per statistic.
So it's not that these people are,

1860
01:50:25.391 --> 01:50:29.320
everyone's fucking too much.
People keep going up,

1861
01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:32.770
so that's not good.
But you know what?
Right now it's totally sustainable.

1862
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:37.600
There's your proven statistics and that there's actual math of how many people

1863
01:50:37.601 --> 01:50:41.350
keep appearing.
It is,
but it's not because look,
humans,

1864
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:45.590
the with you,
I'm with you and scoring people.
I agree with you to a certain,

1865
01:50:45.591 --> 01:50:48.880
if we want to go outside and count them to win a bet.
No,

1866
01:50:48.881 --> 01:50:51.730
there's plenty of people.
There's more people than ever,
but they're always more,

1867
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:54.400
there is always more.
But right now it's totally sustainable.

1868
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:58.120
And what I'm saying is that industrial situations,
the numbers actually drop.

1869
01:50:58.270 --> 01:51:02.710
So just because there's a lot of people today and there's 7 billion people and

1870
01:51:02.711 --> 01:51:05.650
next year they might be seven point poverty is thriving.

1871
01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.020
It is currently,

1872
01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:12.390
but it doesn't mean that it has to stay that way once industrialization to set,

1873
01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:15.400
this is just science when it comes to population control,

1874
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:19.930
when you industrialize an area that people have less children because when the

1875
01:51:19.931 --> 01:51:22.330
people start getting careers,
they have less children.

1876
01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:25.600
So even though you might have an area that has a lot of people right now,

1877
01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:30.310
if that area improves and the quality of their,
their infrastructure,
their,
their,

1878
01:51:30.311 --> 01:51:32.740
their,
their economy,
all these different variables.

1879
01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:36.220
Obviously I don't have a dog in this fight,
but once they start doing that,

1880
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:40.000
the number of babies that have actually drops.
So it's a matter of,

1881
01:51:40.610 --> 01:51:41.560
in my opinion,

1882
01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:47.010
I definitely moved into West Hollywood in 1995 in a rent controlled place.

1883
01:51:47.590 --> 01:51:52.300
Brian still lives there.
Parking is way fucking harder.

1884
01:51:52.330 --> 01:51:55.540
This is not an impoverished place in West Hollywood.

1885
01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.540
There's more fucking people.
So there's more people here,

1886
01:51:58.541 --> 01:52:01.360
but there's less people in Cleveland,
there's less people in Detroit.

1887
01:52:01.570 --> 01:52:05.290
Detroit is fucking half empty now.
Detroit,
you can buy a house for 500 bucks.

1888
01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:08.950
I mean,
California is a great spot.
It never rains.
It's fucking 80 years,

1889
01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:10.180
80 degrees in February.

1890
01:52:10.181 --> 01:52:12.580
Everybody moves here because they want to be famous like Kim Kardashians.

1891
01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:16.870
You got me there just cause I'm drinking.
Look,
it makes sense.

1892
01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:20.590
There's definitely more people like statistically there's way more people and it

1893
01:52:20.591 --> 01:52:22.930
is a problem,
but it's not the number one problem.

1894
01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:27.130
The number one problem is the country,
the world,
all the economies,

1895
01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:30.160
all of the fucking natural resources are controlled by cons,

1896
01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:34.300
by evil cons that have shit,
tons of money and weapons.

1897
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:38.560
That's the number one problem.
This idea that our problem is overpopulation.

1898
01:52:38.561 --> 01:52:41.410
If we have less people were going to have a fucking smooth sailing.

1899
01:52:41.590 --> 01:52:44.920
That's not real because the people that I know are all people.

1900
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:46.430
The people that I love are all people.

1901
01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:50.360
They started out being fucking babies and then they came.
Awesome.
I mean that's,

1902
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:53.750
that's all the people that I know had to start out somewhere as people.

1903
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:56.540
If we want to believe that the human race can carry on and more.

1904
01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:00.350
Tom Rhodes and Doug Stan homes and more interesting people can exist that way,

1905
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:02.150
someone's got to make a fucking person.

1906
01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:05.030
It doesn't mean that we should all and it doesn't mean there's anything wrong

1907
01:53:05.031 --> 01:53:07.760
with not doing.
It.
Ain't anything wrong with doing it,

1908
01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.040
but that's not our number one fucking problem.

1909
01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:15.220
Our number one problem is comments that a gigantic chunk of the population is

1910
01:53:16.191 --> 01:53:20.790
controlled by cunts and where to cuts come from consequence from the babies.

1911
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:23.680
So to Comedians,
no strippers,

1912
01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:29.060
you know all your favorite movie stars,
they all came from a vagina.

1913
01:53:29.550 --> 01:53:32.730
<v 4>But you know,
you're talking about lifting up societies like,
yeah,
Nigeria,</v>

1914
01:53:32.770 --> 01:53:33.601
look out for these people.

1915
01:53:33.601 --> 01:53:38.250
Or you think these shell executive oil people would get tired of getting

1916
01:53:38.251 --> 01:53:40.800
kidnapped and their refineries getting taken hostage.

1917
01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:43.540
<v 3>You have enough security to prevent most of it.
You know there's,</v>

1918
01:53:43.541 --> 01:53:46.110
if you've got enough money,
they don't have the society they have.

1919
01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:48.730
You got enough money,
you plan ahead.
You can keep people at bay.

1920
01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.630
It's fucking to game of Thrones type shit.
It's,
it's pretty simple.

1921
01:53:52.690 --> 01:53:53.560
It's just more sophist.

1922
01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:58.350
<v 4>Oh,
here he goes,
thrown his intellect.
You can keep up with game of Thrones.</v>

1923
01:53:58.530 --> 01:54:01.480
I got through half of the premiere episode.
I go,
ah,

1924
01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:06.330
this is too fucking convoluted for me.
But yeah,

1925
01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:11.890
<v 3>look,
I,
I,
I see both points.</v>

1926
01:54:11.950 --> 01:54:16.270
I see your point.
I see,
I see.
Look,
life is,
no matter what,
it's pointless.
I mean,

1927
01:54:16.271 --> 01:54:20.140
you live and you die for you,
for any individual.
It's a temporary ride.

1928
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:24.280
But I think that to concentrate entirely on the futility of it all

1929
01:54:24.930 --> 01:54:29.550
<v 4>the saw me now,
have you seen,
uh,
but there's nothing,</v>

1930
01:54:29.590 --> 01:54:32.840
but we've seen pervert's guide to ideology.
No,
that guy,

1931
01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:37.600
he's like the Slovenia is premiere philosopher.
He's,

1932
01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:41.260
he's big in England and he's got this great movie.
It's documentary,

1933
01:54:41.261 --> 01:54:43.000
it's called the pervert's guide,
dial geology.

1934
01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:45.250
And he breaks down with movies and how we're like,

1935
01:54:45.251 --> 01:54:49.720
just mass fed these different ideologies.
And he starts with that movie.

1936
01:54:49.721 --> 01:54:53.190
They live Oh yeah.
From 88 where the guy finds the sunglasses and you should,

1937
01:54:53.250 --> 01:54:56.680
right.
Yeah.
And He sees the aliens.
He was on the podcast last night.

1938
01:54:56.681 --> 01:55:00.490
I did with him.
He's great.
Yeah.
Rodney came around.
Yeah,
he's around.

1939
01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:03.850
He does like comedy shows with Steve [inaudible].
Yeah.
He came up on stage.

1940
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:06.580
We were doing a podcast and this guy just starts walking towards us and it

1941
01:55:06.581 --> 01:55:09.970
starts walking on stage.
And I was like,
three seconds.
I was about to go,
hey sir,

1942
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.990
you can't just,
but then right when I did it,
Tony Hinchcliffe goes,
Rowdy Roddy,

1943
01:55:13.991 --> 01:55:17.650
piper,
everyone.
I'm like,
ah Ha.

1944
01:55:18.670 --> 01:55:22.030
We had no idea.
He just walked on stage in the middle of outside cats kill Tony.

1945
01:55:22.210 --> 01:55:23.043
That's hilarious.

1946
01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:27.010
Have you ever seen the video he did with Ari when he came on stage with him and

1947
01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:32.190
slammed him?
Was there,
that was weird.
All reach a fear.

1948
01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:37.150
Got Body slammed by Rowdy Roddy Piper.
Yeah,
that was awesome.
That was awesome.

1949
01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:40.620
That was a naughty show,
right?
Wasn't it?
Yeah.
Sam Tripoli.

1950
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:44.370
Did I miss the end of the physic?
I tried to have my prostate

1951
01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:49.370
<v 1>time to a Tom road so I can start pissing when he talks about Isaac and get it</v>

1952
01:55:50.050 --> 01:55:51.410
right.
He's done beat.

1953
01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:55.220
<v 0>You set it all up.
He,
uh,
physics a little creek.</v>

1954
01:55:56.270 --> 01:56:00.170
It's tough to say.
Here's our,
that standard DRM on announcing it and here's it.

1955
01:56:00.171 --> 01:56:00.400
Right?

1956
01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:05.070
<v 6>Piper,
he Armand her from the</v>

1957
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:09.480
<v 1>space daze and it was Dana DRM and photography.</v>

1958
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:14.750
So I thought the thumbnail was some dude named Dana that put hot chicks up.

1959
01:56:15.991 --> 01:56:17.220
So you'd follow him.

1960
01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:22.640
And it wasn't till recently where I've found out and I saw she follows you when

1961
01:56:23.191 --> 01:56:25.260
they're like,
oh,
that's really a hot chick.

1962
01:56:25.261 --> 01:56:29.280
I thought it was a dude using hot chick.
He took a picture of to try to get me to

1963
01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.300
<v 0>follow him.
She's a very nice person that happens to be a hardcore porn star,</v>

1964
01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:36.390
but she's a very nice person.
Yeah,
it's very cool.
We did a podcast.

1965
01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:38.550
What do you doing?
A couple podcasts,
whether at the Ice House,

1966
01:56:38.551 --> 01:56:40.140
but we did one with her at Brian's place.

1967
01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:44.570
<v 1>Tabitha.
Steven seems really cool on Twitter.</v>

1968
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:49.010
She's cool to the point where I'm like,
I don't want you to do this.

1969
01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:51.950
<v 0>I follow you.
You don't have to send me a dirty picture every day.</v>

1970
01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.880
I think she enjoys it though.
Generally.
No,
but she enjoys it,

1971
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:59.750
but you don't have to do that to me.
You want to say I understand.
I understand,

1972
01:56:59.751 --> 01:57:04.130
but you've got to let a whole be a Ho.
It's like from a Willie Geto boys.

1973
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:07.560
I think that when they deep coated the hieroglyphics on the pyramid,

1974
01:57:07.570 --> 01:57:11.340
that's what it says,
that it's in a cryptic.

1975
01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:14.760
You got to use the Rosetta stone to get it correctly.
Yeah.

1976
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:21.020
<v 6>That's Rowdy Roddy Piper Banner and Ari Shapiro.</v>

1977
01:57:21.021 --> 01:57:25.040
His head off the piano.
Some the ass.
I'm sorta sex thing going on.

1978
01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.090
You know he's passed at the comedy store.
Rodney Rodney.
Yes.

1979
01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:32.220
That's where the comic stories today.
Oh my God.
He beat him with,
Oh yeah.

1980
01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:35.390
That's when our,
he's like,
okay,
I gotta get Outta here.
Wow.
He really beat him,

1981
01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:36.473
but hey,
they used to

1982
01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.480
<v 0>for real,
beat the fuck out of each other.
In those old days of wrestling,</v>

1983
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:44.510
those guys used to cut each other in the Ari Shaffir Rowdy Roddy Piper wars.

1984
01:57:45.450 --> 01:57:48.480
No.
The real rowdy Roddy piper wrestling matches Doug.

1985
01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:50.560
That's what we're talking about.
That they used to beat the fuck out of.

1986
01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:52.730
You didn't even pay attention.

1987
01:57:53.010 --> 01:57:57.030
We're just showing the video of Rowdy Roddy Piper beaten Ari Shaffir with a belt

1988
01:57:57.050 --> 01:57:59.730
and my,
the guy off the mark right now,
you're a little off the mark.

1989
01:57:59.970 --> 01:58:03.360
Rowdy Roddy Piper was just beaten Ari with a belt in this video and we were

1990
01:58:03.361 --> 01:58:06.210
saying that they,
that's for him.
That's what the fuck they did.

1991
01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:08.790
They used to hit each other with chairs and shit.
They really hit each other.

1992
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:09.301
She's like,

1993
01:58:09.301 --> 01:58:12.180
you can get hit with a chair and you can be all right if that's what your job

1994
01:58:12.181 --> 01:58:15.390
entails.
Like I know you don't want to clean toilets,
but somebody's got to do it.

1995
01:58:15.391 --> 01:58:19.500
That's their job.
I always assumed the wrestler was kind of authentic.
The movie.

1996
01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:22.770
Yeah.
It's fairly authentic.
Yeah.
It's fairly,
I'm going to do this to you.

1997
01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:26.040
Are you cool with that?
Right.
There was a great,
uh,

1998
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:28.300
Louis Thorough documentary where they,
uh,

1999
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:31.440
he went around to all these low level pro rate time.

2000
01:58:31.650 --> 01:58:36.420
<v 1>He's on our level,
Tom.
We go,
hey,
we can talk wrestling.
That's dumb.
He goes,
well,</v>

2001
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:38.130
Louie thorough once said,

2002
01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.100
<v 0>yeah,
he's fucking sidestepped on golden</v>

2003
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.130
<v 1>pond.
Then we,
now we're now we're on throw Louis throw.</v>

2004
01:58:46.630 --> 01:58:49.150
He goes to these local North Carolina

2005
01:58:49.150 --> 01:58:51.850
<v 3>wrestling matches with these amateur guys and not making any money in there.</v>

2006
01:58:51.851 --> 01:58:55.000
Cutting themselves with razor blades and making themselves bleed mid fucking

2007
01:58:55.001 --> 01:58:58.430
crazy.
One guy puts Barb wire all over himself and they charge a,

2008
01:58:58.431 --> 01:59:01.960
knew each other with barbwire,
beat each other with barbwire sticks and shit.

2009
01:59:02.290 --> 01:59:04.660
Like for real,
they're cut.
They're like,
they're all bleeding after

2010
01:59:05.110 --> 01:59:07.170
<v 1>original jackass.
Well,</v>

2011
01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:11.390
they really used the theater with jackass guy.

2012
01:59:11.970 --> 01:59:14.820
There was a big coke scene and they used to hang around a lot of comedians in

2013
01:59:14.821 --> 01:59:17.190
the 80s I remember hanging out with Jake the snake,

2014
01:59:17.730 --> 01:59:21.030
and he had the largest bag of cocaine I've ever seen in my life.
Well,

2015
01:59:21.031 --> 01:59:24.060
those guys are all medicated.
You saw Oh,
constantly hurt.

2016
01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:28.280
You saw that documentary beyond the mat?
No.
What does that fucking,
it's,

2017
01:59:28.290 --> 01:59:32.630
it's about,
uh,
wrestlers.
It was fantastic.
Pro Wrestlers.
Yeah.

2018
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:36.030
They would like five different guys.
They had to,

2019
01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:41.060
the new guys starting out and then intermediaries and then Jake,

2020
01:59:41.491 --> 01:59:46.140
the snake Roberts,
who's now playing an armory in Carney,
Nebraska.

2021
01:59:46.890 --> 01:59:48.180
Still fucking,
yeah,
he,

2022
01:59:48.210 --> 01:59:51.420
and they're going to meet him up with his daughter that he does.

2023
01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:55.590
He never met that he abandoned,
but he used to slam Brian.
That's,

2024
01:59:55.591 --> 01:59:59.550
it couldn't break away from the march tables.
So I never met her.
No.

2025
01:59:59.551 --> 02:00:03.360
You Start Smoking crack and they get them like on a camera shot through his

2026
02:00:03.361 --> 02:00:07.900
motel blinds.
Oh,
I don't want smoking crack.
I'm want to get sad right here.

2027
02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:13.200
Oh,
just to please stop playing this fucking nonsense.
Get Sad.

2028
02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:14.311
Look,

2029
02:00:14.311 --> 02:00:17.940
I get sad when I watch people that are wrestlers and then that was fun that that

2030
02:00:17.941 --> 02:00:22.170
was the guy that died and watched the documentary,
but fuck,
it was wicked good.

2031
02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.100
I want it.

2032
02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:28.080
It made me want to do a documentary about all the eighties comedians who thought

2033
02:00:28.081 --> 02:00:32.910
they had it made because all of a sudden it's like the oil boom now in North

2034
02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:37.910
Dakota where everyone's making $5,000 a week with book jokes to Jews walking to

2035
02:00:38.641 --> 02:00:39.690
a bar.
Thank you.

2036
02:00:39.691 --> 02:00:44.030
$5,000 Kansas City and where they became fixed,

2037
02:00:44.031 --> 02:00:48.010
Dunlop fucking lost a leg and then he's dead like,

2038
02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:52.260
but for a minute he was fucking huge.
Not even huge.

2039
02:00:52.261 --> 02:00:53.910
He was just rich.
He died

2040
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:57.480
<v 3>to do was get an evening at the Improv.</v>

2041
02:00:57.570 --> 02:01:00.600
If you had a Caroline's comedy hour and an evening with the Improv,

2042
02:01:00.601 --> 02:01:01.434
you were good.

2043
02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:06.420
And if you had an MTV half hour comedy hour and a Caroline's comedy hour an

2044
02:01:06.421 --> 02:01:11.070
evening at the Improv.
Holy Shit.
You were,
you were in one of those USA.

2045
02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:13.500
You remember those USA comedy guides?

2046
02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:17.720
<v 1>Yeah,
we,
before the Internet,
they didn't have this induced that</v>

2047
02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.720
put that out.
Kippy had a two page spread.

2048
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:28.860
Skippy from the facts of loss from the show was the fucking show.

2049
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:33.640
Yeah.
Mark Price.
What was the show?
Facts?
Some family ties,
family ties.

2050
02:01:34.230 --> 02:01:39.230
The like Justine Bateman once emailed me and I was starstruck.
She goes,

2051
02:01:39.231 --> 02:01:40.760
I think you're brilliant.
I go,
oh,

2052
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:45.850
are you the Justine Bateman that I know from TV and this is not a long time ago.

2053
02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:51.170
Did you jerk off while you were s?
No,
I was.
It was like six years ago.

2054
02:01:51.230 --> 02:01:55.030
I probably told this story on the Internet.
I love Mallory.
She was,

2055
02:01:55.150 --> 02:01:56.840
she was incredible.
That's pretty interesting.

2056
02:01:56.841 --> 02:02:00.740
So she decided that she's going to reach out to you?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
it was.

2057
02:02:01.650 --> 02:02:04.820
Did you tell all your friends,
this story takes about three minutes.

2058
02:02:04.821 --> 02:02:08.090
Do you have the time for it?
She came to a show,

2059
02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.710
Garrett Morris opened a comedy club,
the downtown Comedy Club,

2060
02:02:12.711 --> 02:02:15.500
or Garrett Morris from senator.
Yeah,

2061
02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:19.280
and it was like in a Sushi place in a hotel.

2062
02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:24.640
So he played it and Justine Bateman showed up after that email and I'm all

2063
02:02:25.731 --> 02:02:30.290
excited.
I'm doing two shows.
Well anyway,

2064
02:02:30.291 --> 02:02:34.790
whatever it is,
we get done the show.
She's been there.
Lynn,

2065
02:02:34.791 --> 02:02:38.870
shock Croft,
you know,
hedbergs wife and Bingo.

2066
02:02:39.110 --> 02:02:40.730
They've been drinking a lot.

2067
02:02:41.090 --> 02:02:46.090
So I go to the downstairs bar after the show to meet them and some producer,

2068
02:02:46.341 --> 02:02:49.130
friend Hollywood types,
and I'm all like,
hey,

2069
02:02:49.131 --> 02:02:54.131
I'm nervous because I'm fucking star struck by Justine Bateman at way too late

2070
02:02:54.261 --> 02:02:59.210
of an age to be star struck by Justine Bateman.
Good time to take a piss.

2071
02:02:59.211 --> 02:03:03.050
Tom Rose Darya,
Tom Rhodes,
you selfish son of a bitch.
So they're fucked.

2072
02:03:03.051 --> 02:03:05.480
A bingo and shock.
Crofters so fucked up.

2073
02:03:05.481 --> 02:03:10.481
And they're like spilling the tables and everyone's trying to be polite and

2074
02:03:10.791 --> 02:03:12.710
ignore the fucking elephants in the room.

2075
02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:17.150
They have a pizza on one of those trays that's being heated from the bottom and

2076
02:03:17.151 --> 02:03:20.240
shock.
Krav knocks.
The pizza shop Croft,

2077
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:24.980
her excuse is that she's on a,
uh,
what do you,

2078
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:28.340
what's the Diet where you can't have carbs?
Oh,
fucking sack.

2079
02:03:28.410 --> 02:03:32.300
And she's doing the Atkins,
so she's drinking vodka instead of drinking beer,

2080
02:03:32.301 --> 02:03:35.900
but she's drinking vodka at the same rate you would drink beer.

2081
02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:41.140
So she's so fucked up so quickly and she's knocking shit over and you don't know

2082
02:03:42.141 --> 02:03:45.640
what love is.
You know,
and I'm like,
uh,

2083
02:03:45.641 --> 02:03:48.920
and I'm distancing myself from my own girlfriend and my friend.

2084
02:03:49.710 --> 02:03:51.290
I don't know God.

2085
02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:56.040
At one point she knocks their pizza on the ground and gets down on all fours.

2086
02:03:56.060 --> 02:04:00.910
Scott,
I don't care.
I'll eat it.
And she's eating pizza off Justine Bateman,

2087
02:04:00.911 --> 02:04:05.911
his feet and I'm just trying to make a smiley face and Justine was fucking great

2088
02:04:06.441 --> 02:04:08.690
and she knew how to bust balls that she's,

2089
02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:11.840
she's making fun with it and being kind of cruel.

2090
02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:15.530
Like a comic would skip to the next morning.

2091
02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:20.630
Shot Croft wakes up from her blackout going,
Oh my God,

2092
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:25.610
did I make an asshole out of myself in front of that?
Justine Bateman and I go,

2093
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:31.030
you are fucking crawling on all fours like a pig eating pizza off her feet and

2094
02:04:32.181 --> 02:04:36.950
without any irony or sarcasm.
Shock Croft goes,

2095
02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:38.213
oh my God,

2096
02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:41.390
<v 0>I ate pizza.
I'm not supposed to have</v>

2097
02:04:45.330 --> 02:04:49.260
dude,
why are you not telling them on stage?
Because it's not my story.

2098
02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:52.650
It's abandoned.
I probably told it a million times out.

2099
02:04:52.690 --> 02:04:57.510
A bunch of podcasts deleted off the Internet and please tell on stage.

2100
02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:02.040
That's a great guy.
Damn story.
She is so funny.
Oh my God,

2101
02:05:02.041 --> 02:05:06.360
I so see carbs.
So she's gluten free,
is that what it is?

2102
02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:09.900
Yeah.
Again,
this is like six years ago.
I don't know.

2103
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:15.210
That's fucking hilarious.
Well good on Justin Bateman.
Good for her.

2104
02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:19.230
What show was she on?
Family ties.
Emily Michael J.

2105
02:05:19.230 --> 02:05:22.170
Fox tech space in Ohio.
He's back benches.

2106
02:05:22.290 --> 02:05:25.440
I don't know if you know what Tom Segura has got a fucking 20 minute bit about

2107
02:05:25.441 --> 02:05:29.190
the family ties new,
the new Michael J.
Fox show,

2108
02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:33.120
brutal,
brutal bit so mean.

2109
02:05:33.630 --> 02:05:37.590
So fucking mean fucking rag and the guy with Parkinson's,

2110
02:05:38.650 --> 02:05:43.650
I've done four podcasts and 24 hours basically or 36.

2111
02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:48.450
So I feel like you got to repeat myself.

2112
02:05:48.451 --> 02:05:52.980
But Bert Kreischer I was talking about is Tom Segura is has been on my list of

2113
02:05:52.981 --> 02:05:56.730
shit to do to watch cause I've heard about him so much from you,

2114
02:05:56.950 --> 02:06:01.650
your podcast and tweets and stuff that and Kreischer said fuck yeah.

2115
02:06:01.651 --> 02:06:06.140
You get to see him.
I still have not like pulled up youtube or anything.
Okay.

2116
02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:09.660
That's really good man.
Yeah,
he's really good.
We uh,
I,
I met him when I went,

2117
02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:12.360
I did the um,
maximum tour with Charlie Murphy,

2118
02:06:12.361 --> 02:06:16.560
me and half Ron and Charlie Murphy,
you know Segura Oh,
he's hilarious.
I love it.

2119
02:06:16.561 --> 02:06:20.190
Really good.
Every place we went,
they had a new guy opened for us,
you know,

2120
02:06:20.191 --> 02:06:20.501
like a,

2121
02:06:20.501 --> 02:06:25.200
a local guy or a guy that won like a little contest and he went up in Phoenix.

2122
02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:26.840
We did the Hollywood theater,

2123
02:06:26.850 --> 02:06:29.840
the same theater with Louie did his last special and it's,

2124
02:06:29.841 --> 02:06:32.760
the girl went up and I was like,
Holy Shit,
this guy's good.
He's real.

2125
02:06:32.761 --> 02:06:36.990
It was like at all the guy.
We had 22 shows,
so 22 different guys open for us,

2126
02:06:37.170 --> 02:06:40.490
but he was the only one that really stood out.
I was like,
he's based,
he's legit.

2127
02:06:40.620 --> 02:06:43.950
Podcast is fun too.
Yeah.
It's just a fun guy.
He's just a good guy.

2128
02:06:44.010 --> 02:06:45.730
He's like crusher,
you know,

2129
02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:50.220
his wife was fucking hilarious to you ever seen Christina Palicki no

2130
02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:56.040
show.
Whenever she went up,
Sam triply had this naughty show and uh,

2131
02:06:56.130 --> 02:07:01.000
he had all these people on the show and I mean it's all chaos.
It's like,
here's,

2132
02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:01.680
there's Tom,

2133
02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:06.660
it's like Tom member naked people and people getting beaten by belts and all

2134
02:07:06.661 --> 02:07:11.160
this chaos.
And uh,
this woman was beaten,
this guy with a belt and I was thinking,

2135
02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:13.590
oh my God,
I can't believe she's got to file this.
Like,

2136
02:07:13.591 --> 02:07:16.680
how's she going to fuck on fall?
This is the first time I met her.

2137
02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:20.770
She's like real friendly.
And I was like,
Pour Tom's wife,
poor toms wife.

2138
02:07:20.771 --> 02:07:23.220
I'm going to go up in front of follow a guy getting beaten by a belt.

2139
02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:27.240
She goes up and sleighs and I was like,
Holy Shit.
She's really good.

2140
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:28.343
She's really funny.

2141
02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:33.180
It's like finally a husband and wife team where they're both really funny,

2142
02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.980
which usually like the wives really.
But the husbands

2143
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:39.160
<v 3>some bitch to just follows her around and tells her how awesome she is.
Yeah.</v>

2144
02:07:39.250 --> 02:07:43.480
Or the jokes,
but you can't do it.
And one of the other,
one of the other,

2145
02:07:43.481 --> 02:07:46.480
it's either the husband's awesome or the wife's awesome or something.

2146
02:07:46.481 --> 02:07:47.314
What are you doing?

2147
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:51.180
<v 1>That's why their podcasts for the fucking crocodile is her.</v>

2148
02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:53.490
When she was on road rules,
she was on road rules,

2149
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:59.120
<v 3>but she's a really good comic.
Bottom line.
She really good comic.
Funny.</v>

2150
02:07:59.330 --> 02:08:01.520
Just a legit legit comedian.

2151
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:06.790
Has nothing to do with the gender or the fact that she's married to a legit

2152
02:08:07.011 --> 02:08:10.600
comedian.
It's a rare instance were to legit comedians are hooked up.

2153
02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:15.480
Can't come up with another one.
I can't get him.
Well,
I'd love it though cause I,

2154
02:08:15.481 --> 02:08:19.970
I'd love that.
The never say it doesn't work.
You know,
people always say,
oh,

2155
02:08:19.971 --> 02:08:23.660
don't ever date a comic.
That fucking never works.
You can't say that.
It doesn't,

2156
02:08:24.110 --> 02:08:27.320
most of the time it doesn't work,
but doesn't mean it can't work.

2157
02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:30.140
It can totally work.
Like Tom and Christina had actually works.

2158
02:08:30.141 --> 02:08:33.230
They're both really funny,
but then it's a perfect example of,

2159
02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:34.440
<v 1>come on in history.</v>

2160
02:08:34.441 --> 02:08:39.000
There had to be at least an instance of where to funny people that were already

2161
02:08:39.001 --> 02:08:42.870
legitimately George Burns and Gracie Allen where they married captain into Neil.

2162
02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:44.250
No,

2163
02:08:44.250 --> 02:08:49.250
Jim Carrey married Jenny Mccarthy who is hot enough for you to think was funny.

2164
02:08:50.630 --> 02:08:51.650
<v 3>Bone,
Luke Duke.</v>

2165
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:59.000
There's none this fucking Tom and Christina.
That's it.
Never existed.

2166
02:08:59.001 --> 02:09:01.580
That's why we need gay marriage.
That's what I'm talking about.

2167
02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:05.240
If to really funny guys way you can find too funny women in a room.

2168
02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:08.630
But what about if Richard Pryor and George Carlin marry each other at the

2169
02:09:08.631 --> 02:09:12.530
greatest gay couple,
the greatest married couple of all time.
Yeah.

2170
02:09:13.730 --> 02:09:16.760
Gay Marriage.
They're both gay and he went into comedy.

2171
02:09:18.370 --> 02:09:19.720
<v 1>I bagged gay marriage,</v>

2172
02:09:19.721 --> 02:09:23.440
but you're talking interracial and I'm out.

2173
02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:26.630
<v 3>My favorite,
my favorite thing you've ever done outside of your comedy.</v>

2174
02:09:26.631 --> 02:09:30.610
He said fucking Bisbee town hall thing that you did where you went up there and

2175
02:09:30.730 --> 02:09:34.330
<v 1>oh,
you didn't see the one where I ate shit the next time.
It was another one.</v>

2176
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:37.810
How did you shit I went up.
This is,

2177
02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.610
it was the most brutal.

2178
02:09:39.790 --> 02:09:44.790
Every comic has had the dream where you go on stage and you can't talk and you

2179
02:09:45.281 --> 02:09:49.900
don't know what you're saying in the audiences that happened to me in real life

2180
02:09:49.930 --> 02:09:51.790
after I did the one,
I just,

2181
02:09:51.791 --> 02:09:56.470
I spouted off at one city hall about,
uh,
you know,

2182
02:09:56.590 --> 02:10:00.040
why are you having prayer at a city council?

2183
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:01.690
And that was quick.

2184
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:06.910
And the next time I went when they were actually voting on the referendum for

2185
02:10:06.911 --> 02:10:07.960
civil unions,

2186
02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:13.320
and I sat in the back listening to all these Christian speak and I just like,

2187
02:10:13.921 --> 02:10:16.570
you watch the opening acts and he,
I can riff off of this.

2188
02:10:16.571 --> 02:10:20.110
And I developed this bit in my head that was not ready.

2189
02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:21.940
And I went up to speak.

2190
02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:25.540
And instead of hearing the ladies and gentlemen,

2191
02:10:25.541 --> 02:10:29.260
are you ready for your headliner and applause?
I realized it was dead silence.

2192
02:10:29.261 --> 02:10:29.800
And I'm,

2193
02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:34.800
I'm walking through water and I went up to speak and I lost my breath.

2194
02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:40.460
I started to talk and I see the mayor looking at me like,
why are you up here?

2195
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:43.640
What are you doing?
The mayor of Brisbane?
Yeah.
How many people are in Brisbane?

2196
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:48.740
5,000 5,500 make me move there.
I'll make,
I'll become the man.
I just,

2197
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:53.810
everything that should have everything that I thought about listening to a bunch

2198
02:10:53.811 --> 02:10:58.250
of speakers.
Is it live?
Is that the video?

2199
02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:00.520
Is this the exact change?
Is this it?

2200
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:05.620
<v 10>Obviously we have enough people in the room to fight on my behalf.</v>

2201
02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:07.360
I don't have to be here.

2202
02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:12.580
There was rumors of buses of churches that we're going to show up and filibuster

2203
02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:14.070
this.
So we felt we could,

2204
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:17.790
<v 1>no,
no,
this is not the breakdown.
There was the next,</v>

2205
02:11:18.090 --> 02:11:22.290
the next city council meeting.
I saw this one.
I fell apart where I,

2206
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:25.860
I,
I'm
like,

2207
02:11:25.861 --> 02:11:30.120
I'm talking to a cop with a dead hooker in my trunk and I,

2208
02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:35.520
and then and then all the eyes are getting worse and then I start flop sweating

2209
02:11:35.521 --> 02:11:38.910
and I'd go,
Hey,
this is why I'm going to default lines.

2210
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:44.000
This is why normally drink when I am Rosa parks in the,

2211
02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:49.380
and I had to leave in shame knowing that the fucking mayor and one of the

2212
02:11:49.381 --> 02:11:53.850
councilmen and the rest of my friends have seen this and they're coming to my

2213
02:11:53.851 --> 02:11:57.790
house and I'm like,
the only I have to leave.
BSB coming to your house.
They,

2214
02:11:57.850 --> 02:12:00.950
we would party over there and party with your hair.
Yeah,
man.
Yeah.

2215
02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:02.640
The mirror is cool.
I met her about a year old.

2216
02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:07.260
How would you panic then if you just went into a fucking pen like I had all this

2217
02:12:07.261 --> 02:12:12.261
stuff that I know in my head is a comedy bit that I could do but going wasn't

2218
02:12:14.041 --> 02:12:15.210
done yet.
No.

2219
02:12:15.211 --> 02:12:19.060
Going up to a bunch of people that are angry and don't want to see me and don't

2220
02:12:19.061 --> 02:12:22.410
know.
You got to always bring a least a little bit of your own audience,

2221
02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:27.450
but I did.
I had my friends there,
which made it worse.
I have no idea.
It was,

2222
02:12:27.451 --> 02:12:32.220
he's a dream that you have where you don't know what the fuck you're doing on

2223
02:12:32.221 --> 02:12:36.180
stage and you wake up going,
oh,
fucking thank God.
That was just a dream,

2224
02:12:36.420 --> 02:12:40.650
but it was real and it was really to this day,

2225
02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:45.150
I see people that were at that city council meeting and I,
I go,

2226
02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:49.300
I should kill myself.
You hang your head.
And Shay was,
fuck,
how long ago?

2227
02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:54.780
Last year,
dude,
we need to change this and you got to move to a new town.

2228
02:12:54.850 --> 02:12:57.630
We didn't move this.
No,
we need to find clean out the town.

2229
02:12:58.130 --> 02:13:00.610
Everybody I've seen that we need to kill him.
It's all of those.

2230
02:13:00.630 --> 02:13:03.990
That's what I thought.
Yeah.
That's actually said that on stage.
No.

2231
02:13:04.050 --> 02:13:08.390
Last week I went up and city council doing yourself.

2232
02:13:08.490 --> 02:13:12.570
Not In redeem us.
I didn't kill,
but I went up and said,
hey listen,

2233
02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:15.750
we're having a party.
You know I want to talk about noise complaints.

2234
02:13:15.751 --> 02:13:19.380
A city council meeting.
You went up and said,
hey,
listen,
we're having a party.
No.

2235
02:13:19.500 --> 02:13:22.860
I said,
hey,
listen,
I want to talk about noise complaints.
You know what?

2236
02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:26.190
There's neighbors that make noise complaints and you're going to make a lot on

2237
02:13:26.191 --> 02:13:30.660
May 25th wherever the party out of respect for a whiskey girl in a nowhere man

2238
02:13:30.661 --> 02:13:35.661
who died between a six and 10:00 PM you know what?

2239
02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.540
Don't call the cops to show up.
Bring some food.

2240
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:45.090
Did you run in a town?
Why don't you run for mayor?
I,
well,
first of all,

2241
02:13:45.091 --> 02:13:49.140
when I could,
when I could help you,

2242
02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:50.660
but it's uh,

2243
02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:55.730
you'd have to show up and it pays $386 a month and an annual and money and all

2244
02:13:56.431 --> 02:14:01.200
the people that don't know you.
I hope you will hate you safely.
No,
no.

2245
02:14:01.201 --> 02:14:03.840
We'll get rid of them.
Don't move.
No.

2246
02:14:04.110 --> 02:14:07.290
How much do you think their houses are worth?
Here's,
here's the reality.

2247
02:14:07.291 --> 02:14:10.020
Here's the reality.
If they really have their shit together,

2248
02:14:10.021 --> 02:14:14.800
would they be living in Bisbee?
Most likely no,
but that's their world.

2249
02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:15.420
Just,

2250
02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:20.160
you don't show me people in their move people to town,

2251
02:14:20.161 --> 02:14:20.471
Doug,

2252
02:14:20.471 --> 02:14:25.471
Stan hope they'd start buying up all these houses of these malcontents who are

2253
02:14:25.561 --> 02:14:28.200
upset that you're the new mayor.
When you're on the road,

2254
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:29.910
Jones do your show style.

2255
02:14:30.210 --> 02:14:34.620
Let's say there's 500 people at the show at the end of the night,

2256
02:14:34.890 --> 02:14:39.210
the staff or your only friends,
you don't fuck with the staff.

2257
02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:41.640
I live with the staff.
I live with a small,

2258
02:14:41.641 --> 02:14:46.110
tiny amount of people and you're going to see them at Safeway every day and if

2259
02:14:46.111 --> 02:14:50.730
you fuck up what they think is important,
meaning city politics in Bisbee,

2260
02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:52.740
I don't want to see those.

2261
02:14:53.010 --> 02:14:57.990
It's the same reason you wouldn't work a cruise ship because if you suck,

2262
02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:02.640
you're going to have to see those same people at the buffet and the Lido deck

2263
02:15:02.730 --> 02:15:05.640
and shuffleboard for another week.
I see your point.

2264
02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:08.640
I wouldn't work cruise ship because I don't want to be in a boat in the middle

2265
02:15:08.641 --> 02:15:11.070
of the fucking ocean trapped with a bunch of people,

2266
02:15:11.190 --> 02:15:14.280
but I see your point like if you bomb,
don't be mayors.

2267
02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:19.380
It would be fuck Hunter Thompson running for sheriff of a Woody Creek.

2268
02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:20.730
If you fucking,

2269
02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:24.810
if you ran for mayor of Bisbee and actually one,

2270
02:15:25.230 --> 02:15:28.830
it might be the greatest victory that our generation has ever had.

2271
02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:32.910
We have a great mayor.
Listen Dude,
let live the great mayors.
Great.

2272
02:15:32.911 --> 02:15:35.880
He'll work for you.
This is my thoughts.
You can,

2273
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:39.480
you could take over Bisbee and then from you taking over Bisbee.

2274
02:15:39.630 --> 02:15:43.950
We just start moving people in.
Just start.
People will fuck this place.

2275
02:15:43.951 --> 02:15:48.720
It's going to shit.
Standups don't cook.
They sell the house.
Cool people buy it.

2276
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:50.580
I want to be near stand up.
Next thing you know,

2277
02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:54.760
you got to fucking town filled with Doug's Stan hope fans.
I tell you I,

2278
02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:58.800
whenever I visit you,
do you know why I give out my address on your podcast?

2279
02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:00.560
Just trying to do the van Dyke Street,

2280
02:16:01.410 --> 02:16:06.120
Arizona eight five six Oh three let me repeat to 12 van Dyke Street.

2281
02:16:06.150 --> 02:16:07.470
Bisbee Arizona.

2282
02:16:07.530 --> 02:16:11.460
Eight five six oh three mail packages to us.

2283
02:16:11.850 --> 02:16:14.430
I can give that out because I can't get my own friends,

2284
02:16:14.670 --> 02:16:18.330
namely Joe Rogan to even visit me much less.

2285
02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:22.900
How that would be happy.
I'd be happy to visit you.
I'd be happy to have is.

2286
02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:26.020
You would be.
I haven't done it,
but I would be happy to visit you.

2287
02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:30.040
You're going to buy the cave house.
I would like to buy that house,
but then you

2288
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:30.610
<v 2>fucked up.</v>

2289
02:16:30.610 --> 02:16:33.970
Now everybody knows the fucking cave house where I'm going to be known about the

2290
02:16:33.971 --> 02:16:37.220
cave house.
It's been five is I the cave house?

2291
02:16:37.221 --> 02:16:42.221
That's a different thing because you just said bother airbnb fucked me up.

2292
02:16:42.970 --> 02:16:47.500
You fucked up my cave house dreams right there by disclosure by in voluntary

2293
02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:51.960
disclosure.
You fucked up my cave house.
Dream House has been in so many magazine.

2294
02:16:51.961 --> 02:16:55.570
We just need guns and fences and shit.
We have guns.
Hire Mexicans.

2295
02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:58.570
My think that you could run that town,
Dude,

2296
02:16:58.630 --> 02:17:01.690
I think you're already running that town.
You already own any real estate.

2297
02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:06.280
Have you seen windy city heat?
Great show.

2298
02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:08.290
That's what we're looking at.

2299
02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:12.700
Fine is to not run for mayor but runs someone for mayor.

2300
02:17:12.730 --> 02:17:13.810
That's okay.

2301
02:17:13.930 --> 02:17:18.190
Now I like how you said now I like how you thinking now.

2302
02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:21.970
Now I like what you're thinking.
We need to do is just,

2303
02:17:21.971 --> 02:17:26.050
there's a lot of people that just really are not totally buying the whole future

2304
02:17:26.051 --> 02:17:29.380
Bisbee experience.
We need to get them to start selling,
you know,

2305
02:17:29.381 --> 02:17:32.920
it's like a reverse blockbusting let them know,
look gentrify.

2306
02:17:33.020 --> 02:17:36.040
Bisbee I already have a guy that's made the logo.

2307
02:17:36.370 --> 02:17:41.370
It's the communist fist with a Rolex hill central five Bisbee that's your

2308
02:17:41.501 --> 02:17:46.300
version of the Gonzo fucking two thumbed,
uh,
holding the payoti button.

2309
02:17:47.250 --> 02:17:47.920
Gentrify.

2310
02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:52.420
Bisbee we're in communist lettering to you make it very attractive.

2311
02:17:52.510 --> 02:17:57.280
Make moving to the middle of nowhere next to them.
Cool town.
I couldn't do it.

2312
02:17:57.281 --> 02:18:01.900
No,
you have to have the fucking you.
You need shit around you.

2313
02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:05.200
What do I need to write?
Good.
I'm good.
Like just laying in the Hammock,

2314
02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:06.970
but I'm going to actually have a hammock.

2315
02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.860
I lived in the mountains of Colorado for a while,

2316
02:18:08.890 --> 02:18:12.490
for about two months and fucking fled back here.
No,
it was three months,

2317
02:18:12.491 --> 02:18:15.970
but the only my wife got pregnant.
You can't live up there if you're pregnant.

2318
02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:19.510
The point is,
but you can't.
You are like a tail.

2319
02:18:19.511 --> 02:18:23.470
You have to do a show before the giant show.

2320
02:18:23.471 --> 02:18:28.000
You have to have a big show before the giant show.
I understand it.

2321
02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:31.060
I'm not down downing you.
What does that mean,
the big show for the giant show?

2322
02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:35.110
Well you go to do UFC and then you do a big theater show before you do the

2323
02:18:35.111 --> 02:18:38.890
monstrous bucking UFC show and yeah,

2324
02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:43.330
you thrive on that kind of attention.
I,
I'm terrified by it.

2325
02:18:43.331 --> 02:18:46.450
When you brought me to UFC,
I've never been more scared.

2326
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:50.770
Even with you,
just stay with me.

2327
02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:55.390
Get a picture of nick.
Fuck.
Fuck you.
Hollywood.

2328
02:18:59.290 --> 02:19:02.510
That's my UFC experience in a nutshell.
Fuck you,
Hollywood.

2329
02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:03.610
Me Walking through a crowd.

2330
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:04.281
<v 4>Joe,</v>

2331
02:19:04.281 --> 02:19:07.970
you got me tickets to the staple center a couple of years ago and I had never

2332
02:19:07.971 --> 02:19:11.630
been to UFC and I absolutely loved it.
Uh,
just,

2333
02:19:11.690 --> 02:19:15.860
just transformed cause I was a real boxing fan purist and I absolutely fell in

2334
02:19:15.861 --> 02:19:16.161
love with it.

2335
02:19:16.161 --> 02:19:20.780
But the seats were like way up in the top of the arena and some guy that was

2336
02:19:20.781 --> 02:19:24.110
sitting in my seat and I mentioned a guy was in my seat.

2337
02:19:24.111 --> 02:19:26.630
I showed him the ticket and I started talking to the guy,

2338
02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:28.070
he was like the next seat over

2339
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:31.520
<v 2>and I was so high up and I had mentioned that Joe Rogan had gotten me the</v>

2340
02:19:31.521 --> 02:19:33.110
tickets and the guy turns to me.
He goes,

2341
02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:36.980
I thought you were better friends because they were so high up.
They were like,

2342
02:19:36.981 --> 02:19:38.840
how high up were they were pretty high.

2343
02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:42.220
Did you get the tickets really last minute or something?
Uh,

2344
02:19:42.310 --> 02:19:44.880
you must be probably a couple of days before.
That's the problem.

2345
02:19:44.881 --> 02:19:47.650
It was probably sold out.
That's all I could get.
You fucking lazy.

2346
02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:52.070
Have Brian,
how many times you've been on the floor?
Uh,

2347
02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:55.730
almost every time was on the floor or get in touch with me.

2348
02:19:56.380 --> 02:19:58.880
Stand ups on the floor.
Right.
Had you on the floor.

2349
02:19:58.881 --> 02:20:03.881
You can't Holler at me two days before roads is probably based on that racist

2350
02:20:03.921 --> 02:20:07.520
bit.
You do that fucking watermelon.

2351
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:12.610
I should have kept that a secret soldier.
That was a black fighter headlining.

2352
02:20:14.620 --> 02:20:18.880
<v 3>Oh.
Oh God.
Dude,
if you ever want to go,
just ask me.</v>

2353
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:21.670
Don't think you'd have to drop hints on a podcast.
Jesus Christ.

2354
02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:26.140
I get you better seats,
Bill Cosby.
Fuck yeah,
we're going to go.

2355
02:20:26.470 --> 02:20:31.090
We're going to go see bill Cosby if you want to go.
Me,
I'm telling you,

2356
02:20:31.091 --> 02:20:34.420
I keep hearing these really fucking funny.
I keep hearing from a bunch of people,

2357
02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:38.350
but he tells these long really funny storytelling bits.

2358
02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:40.420
I heard it from bill burr.

2359
02:20:40.570 --> 02:20:44.740
I heard it from a Ian Edwards hurted bill Cosby.
I heard it from Chris Rock.

2360
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:47.820
I heard it from a bunch of fucking people that Cosby's fucking hilarious.
Yeah,

2361
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:50.170
I heard the same thing.
I keep hearing it,
man.

2362
02:20:50.350 --> 02:20:53.350
I heard it from a due to random dude,
it doesn't even do comedy in Austin.

2363
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:56.050
He goes,
you know what really fucking surprised me.
He goes,

2364
02:20:56.051 --> 02:20:58.150
my friends took me out to see bill Cosby and I was like,

2365
02:20:58.151 --> 02:21:00.670
I don't want to go see bill Cosby man.
And he's like 80 years old.

2366
02:21:00.671 --> 02:21:02.770
What the fuck am I going to get out of this?
He goes,
dude,

2367
02:21:02.771 --> 02:21:06.460
I was fucking crying laughing.
He goes,
for the first five minutes you go,

2368
02:21:06.461 --> 02:21:08.470
what am I getting into?
Cause he doesn't have an opening act.

2369
02:21:08.770 --> 02:21:11.470
He just goes out there and he starts talking over the first five minutes.

2370
02:21:11.471 --> 02:21:14.130
It takes a while to build up and he goes like,
I'm like,
what am I doing?

2371
02:21:14.140 --> 02:21:16.780
Like what?
Oh my God,
what am I fucking sitting through?

2372
02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:19.570
How long is this going to be?
He goes,
then you start,
fuck it.

2373
02:21:19.571 --> 02:21:21.060
He starts tying things together.

2374
02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:24.190
You start fucking laughing and then it goes deeper and deeper.

2375
02:21:24.370 --> 02:21:28.240
Apparently he's been touring like you go look at his schedule,

2376
02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:31.780
he's fucking touring a lot and you look at his schedule.

2377
02:21:31.781 --> 02:21:34.720
I saw him working out a lot of that shit at the comedy cellar.

2378
02:21:36.310 --> 02:21:38.680
He joking.
Yeah.
Jay doesn't work it out at all.

2379
02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:42.400
He does it on stage but he's working at [inaudible].
Bill Cosby,

2380
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:46.760
like bumping someone at the comedy cellar at midnight and work out some new
shit.

2381
02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:49.510
Still doing to theater shows a night in some places.

2382
02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:53.680
I mean he's doing a lot of shows and I think always get all those illegitimate

2383
02:21:53.681 --> 02:21:57.670
kids to take care of.
He has also had a few lawsuits.
Yeah,

2384
02:21:57.980 --> 02:22:01.530
rape sounds awesome.
Yeah.
Beats whatever between the law,

2385
02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:05.590
like the same language and pop between the lengthy phone calls to black comics

2386
02:22:05.591 --> 02:22:09.280
about how they're ruining the fucking yes.
Right.
Listen,

2387
02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:13.030
he's 100%.
He's flawed.
He's definitely flawed.

2388
02:22:13.330 --> 02:22:18.330
But my idea of it is not to connect him to what the art form that I appreciate.

2389
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:22.810
Like I appreciate guys like you guys like you Diaz.
I understand.

2390
02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:26.130
I don't like what he,
I don't like clean comedy.
Donald Sterling

2391
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:29.400
<v 1>needs this same fucking decency.
Hey,</v>

2392
02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:34.230
that's a old feeble fucking dude that America's up in arms about rather than the

2393
02:22:34.231 --> 02:22:38.940
justice system,
which is really abusively racist.
Oh yeah.

2394
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:43.680
Yo Bill Cosby.
Donald Sterling tour together.

2395
02:22:44.420 --> 02:22:49.250
<v 3>MMM.
Okay.
I see your point.
Um,
um,</v>

2396
02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:53.430
<v 1>I'm not,
I switch headphones with Tom Rhodes,
so it looks like he said that.
Yeah.</v>

2397
02:22:54.540 --> 02:22:58.950
<v 3>I'm not in support of anything that,
uh,
the Donald Sterling or bill Cosby said,</v>

2398
02:22:58.951 --> 02:23:03.951
but I think that it's tough to ignore Cosby as a craftsman and sterling's not

2399
02:23:04.051 --> 02:23:04.884
that funny.

2400
02:23:05.010 --> 02:23:07.980
And I think sterling is pretty funny when he's trying to bang a 20 year old and

2401
02:23:07.981 --> 02:23:11.370
he's fucking 81.
I think it's funny that he pulls it off,
you know,

2402
02:23:11.371 --> 02:23:13.470
and he's got a buy.
Everybody's like,
oh my God,

2403
02:23:13.471 --> 02:23:15.300
he bought her a Bentley and a Ferrari.

2404
02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:18.840
You have to buy him a Bentley and a Ferrari.
If you have $1 billion,

2405
02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:20.030
a Bentley and a Ferrari.

2406
02:23:20.031 --> 02:23:23.520
It's like buying a chicken necklace you buy or something pretty and she sucks

2407
02:23:23.521 --> 02:23:26.010
your Dick.
And then if you're lucky,
she'll do it again in six months,

2408
02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:27.440
<v 1>but he shouldn't have missed a payment.</v>

2409
02:23:28.330 --> 02:23:33.190
If you're a millionaire guy and you're banging some psycho side policy,
uh,

2410
02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:34.760
you know,
make sure they got the payment.

2411
02:23:34.780 --> 02:23:38.290
<v 3>You know what happens is these guys get fucking greedy and they don't realize</v>

2412
02:23:38.291 --> 02:23:40.090
how much $1 billion really is.

2413
02:23:40.350 --> 02:23:42.850
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't know.
I've been that guy.</v>

2414
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:47.530
You can give a chick like I've been that guy where you're so desperate for a

2415
02:23:47.531 --> 02:23:49.900
chick not to leave you.
That's out of your league.

2416
02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:53.960
<v 3>Yeah.
You start talking racial shit to make her feel uncomfortable.</v>

2417
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:58.190
That's why this is so much worse.
Shit.
That's what he did.

2418
02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:01.070
He said some racial shit to make her feel uncomfortable,
man.

2419
02:24:04.470 --> 02:24:07.290
You know?
I mean,
I think that's what happened and that's what he said happened.

2420
02:24:07.470 --> 02:24:09.620
I think he's just an asshole.
Just an old ass.

2421
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:11.580
And he didn't know that he was being recorded.

2422
02:24:11.610 --> 02:24:15.130
<v 1>Cherry,
she came on CNN like two days late because I'm his silly rabbit.</v>

2423
02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:18.530
Did you see that?
No,
she,
she went like two days later she was,
gee,
I miss,

2424
02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:24.550
I'm his silly rabbit is a view of race that might be inappropriate to someone.

2425
02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:29.760
A racist doesn't hire black general managers and coaches like that.

2426
02:24:31.210 --> 02:24:35.800
Yeah.
He's a fucking clansmen is real racism in the world.

2427
02:24:35.950 --> 02:24:39.800
Sports people are not your fucking,
yeah.

2428
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:43.420
Well the one thing,
it wasn't talked about those of morality.

2429
02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.130
Did he say it in his own house?
I mean,

2430
02:24:45.131 --> 02:24:47.530
you should be able to say whatever you want and your own house.
Right?

2431
02:24:47.531 --> 02:24:49.420
Apparently that's what's kind of Orwellian about it.

2432
02:24:49.421 --> 02:24:52.420
But they never said where it was recorded.
Well,
why would,
do you know,

2433
02:24:52.421 --> 02:24:55.960
why would he bring the site pussy niggers over?
You know what?

2434
02:24:55.961 --> 02:25:00.440
My team's going to be all white.
Well,
apparently here please.

2435
02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:05.680
He said,
fuck,
go ahead and fuck black guys.

2436
02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:10.840
Michael.
Not Michael Jordan,
Magic Johnson,
Magic Johnson is that,

2437
02:25:11.050 --> 02:25:13.960
you know what?
Feed them.
Fuck them.
I don't care.

2438
02:25:13.961 --> 02:25:18.961
Just please don't put pictures on Instagram if that's racist.

2439
02:25:19.930 --> 02:25:24.100
Well,
the idea is that it's racist because this is great position of power.

2440
02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:29.050
People keep contacting me.
God,
you're fucking a black guy.
It's the culture.

2441
02:25:29.610 --> 02:25:33.140
<v 2>They calm.
Did you,
Donald,
did you really buy that broad?</v>

2442
02:25:33.141 --> 02:25:36.230
You bought her a Ferrari and look at it and dig into big,

2443
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:40.250
you know that the magic magic

2444
02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:47.980
magic is just constantly fucking is broad and you're buying a Rolls Royce car.

2445
02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:54.620
She's taking pictures.
You know what?
Magic butter,
butter Dick Sandwich.

2446
02:25:55.610 --> 02:25:56.443
That's what he bought.

2447
02:25:56.970 --> 02:26:00.750
<v 1>I have a black girlfriend and I said,
it's okay if you flunk.</v>

2448
02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:04.110
Fuck another black guy.
Just don't put pictures on the Internet.

2449
02:26:04.111 --> 02:26:08.250
So people fuck with me.
That's a racist.
Now that is a racist.

2450
02:26:08.251 --> 02:26:12.000
The guy with a black girlfriend that he's cheating on his wife with saying,

2451
02:26:12.001 --> 02:26:16.650
you can fuck other black guys.
Just don't put it on the Internet.
That's racism.

2452
02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:21.370
<v 2>Um,
listen,
he doesn't know any better.
These are quotes.</v>

2453
02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:23.950
He doesn't know any better.
Doug Stanhope.

2454
02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:27.980
<v 1>He doesn't know any better than to not fuck a black girl.
If you're a racist,</v>

2455
02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:30.620
you're a racist,
Donald.
You get it wrong.

2456
02:26:30.770 --> 02:26:35.180
You don't fuck black girls and you don't say it's okay to fuck other black guys

2457
02:26:35.181 --> 02:26:36.620
as long as you don't put it on the,

2458
02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:40.140
<v 2>did you see that shit?
We talked last time we talked about it.</v>

2459
02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:43.010
We brought up the fact that maybe he had Alzheimer's or something like that.

2460
02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:45.480
That's what they're trying to say now that he has the early stage.

2461
02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:50.480
Isn't he forgot that he's dating a black girl?

2462
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:54.560
No.
Well that's the whole reason why the whole recording was being done the first

2463
02:26:54.561 --> 02:26:57.590
place.
He can't remember the things he said.
So part of her job,

2464
02:26:57.591 --> 02:26:58.580
she actually works for him.

2465
02:26:58.790 --> 02:27:02.930
Part of her job is that she's supposed to record these conversations so that he

2466
02:27:02.931 --> 02:27:06.230
can talk about things and she could bring it up what he's already talked about.

2467
02:27:06.231 --> 02:27:10.160
So he knows what he said.
Apparently he's like going meant right.

2468
02:27:10.161 --> 02:27:13.650
And then so she releases the tapes.
What sterling thinks.

2469
02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:16.460
That's what she said.
He said the opposite.

2470
02:27:16.461 --> 02:27:20.330
Evidently I read the transcript because I don't have cable at my Airbnb,

2471
02:27:20.331 --> 02:27:22.790
but my girlfriend pissed your bed so we're even,

2472
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:26.330
it didn't hit the mattress.

2473
02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:30.230
I think it's a sad state.

2474
02:27:30.260 --> 02:27:35.260
It's a sad state when you want to fucking shit on an old man who is alone in his

2475
02:27:35.781 --> 02:27:39.320
home and everybody's going off on him.
Everybody you just took up for him.

2476
02:27:39.321 --> 02:27:40.154
He's got all this money.

2477
02:27:40.430 --> 02:27:45.430
He's an old man that wants to get his head when he says stupid shit being led

2478
02:27:45.621 --> 02:27:50.360
off fucking death row only because of the innocence project clearing their name

2479
02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:51.650
because they were black.

2480
02:27:51.651 --> 02:27:55.550
They were convicted of Shit and spending 20 years in prison,

2481
02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:56.960
the justice system,

2482
02:27:56.961 --> 02:28:01.961
fucking cops shooting black kids because they thought they had a gun and that's

2483
02:28:02.211 --> 02:28:03.650
not blown up in the news.

2484
02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:07.640
That's not trending on Twitter of fucking old feeble man.

2485
02:28:07.860 --> 02:28:12.570
Gone Fuck Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson.
No,

2486
02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:15.680
I couldn't agree more.
I mean obviously in in perspective,

2487
02:28:15.681 --> 02:28:17.530
but the idea is of course we're paying attention.

2488
02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:22.070
This guy because he's a billionaire and because he owns a gigantic sports and he

2489
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:27.080
<v 3>also made a shit fuck ton of money off of black people and apparently he's not</v>

2490
02:28:27.081 --> 02:28:29.960
happy about black people banging his side piece.
You know,

2491
02:28:29.970 --> 02:28:34.810
the whole thing is hilarious that it's so mild.
The things that he said,
hold on,

2492
02:28:34.850 --> 02:28:35.331
hold on a second.

2493
02:28:35.331 --> 02:28:39.290
Whether it's racist or not so mild in the context that he said it in the comfort

2494
02:28:39.291 --> 02:28:43.340
of his own home,
there was no racial slurs,
there was nothing defamatory.

2495
02:28:43.341 --> 02:28:46.550
There's no,
the less than us,
they're not white.
They're not us.

2496
02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:51.050
<v 2>I heard that.
I think Elan,
Jerry West the money to buy the Lakers,</v>

2497
02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:54.830
so that guy singlehandedly is responsible for basketball in Los Angeles.
Well,

2498
02:28:54.831 --> 02:28:55.780
he's a fucking

2499
02:28:55.860 --> 02:29:00.240
<v 3>rich dude.
He's super successful,
but he's a cunt.
He's been a cut forever.</v>

2500
02:29:00.330 --> 02:29:03.690
He's been racially discriminating against people that lived in his properties,

2501
02:29:03.691 --> 02:29:05.820
but so have a million other people.

2502
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:09.840
<v 2>He's,
he was 60 when the internet came out.
I'm not sticking up for the guy.</v>

2503
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:13.260
He ain't a great guy.
I'm not.
I'm not.
He ain't a great guy.

2504
02:29:13.261 --> 02:29:16.140
He's not a perfect example of what an 80 year old person has learned from the

2505
02:29:16.141 --> 02:29:19.590
lifetime.
Stakes can be.
He's not.
He's an old billionaire.

2506
02:29:19.591 --> 02:29:21.620
He wanted to get his dick sucked by some crazy bitch.

2507
02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:26.520
We talked a lot of shit and we found out about it because it got out.

2508
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:27.780
It was a private thing.

2509
02:29:27.810 --> 02:29:32.810
How many people out there have that grandfather slash uncle slash guy that you

2510
02:29:33.871 --> 02:29:36.450
listened to him at Thanksgiving dinner?

2511
02:29:36.810 --> 02:29:41.810
Say Way worse shit with like you know the epithets saying nigger and spic and

2512
02:29:44.041 --> 02:29:46.590
everything and y'all just go.
Do you want some more?

2513
02:29:46.591 --> 02:29:50.190
A butternut squash uncle Harry especially,

2514
02:29:50.191 --> 02:29:52.470
but the thing is everything's going to be recorded.

2515
02:29:52.830 --> 02:29:55.120
There's just recording devices everywhere you can.

2516
02:29:55.130 --> 02:29:58.170
What's an example of what we're learning?
We're learning or Wellington.

2517
02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:01.670
We're going to have to just be constantly aware of what we're saying.
Stop.

2518
02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:04.870
Please get out of my fucking head.
All right,
closer.

2519
02:30:04.890 --> 02:30:09.030
Drop the headphones and leave.
Well your volunteer

2520
02:30:09.060 --> 02:30:11.610
<v 3>terribly doing that by doing something like this right now,</v>

2521
02:30:11.611 --> 02:30:14.790
you're free for three hours.
You've given up your thoughts.
You know,

2522
02:30:14.791 --> 02:30:17.640
I think there's not going to be any secrets.
I think the idea,

2523
02:30:17.641 --> 02:30:19.050
I think I'm going to give you one further.

2524
02:30:19.051 --> 02:30:22.800
There's not going to be any money because money is information and money right

2525
02:30:22.801 --> 02:30:27.120
now is just ones and Zeros on a fucking website somewhere.
I mean,

2526
02:30:27.121 --> 02:30:28.680
that's what bitcoin is going to be.

2527
02:30:28.681 --> 02:30:32.250
That's what the money essentially that we have now.
It's not backed by gold.

2528
02:30:32.251 --> 02:30:33.084
That's what it is.

2529
02:30:33.250 --> 02:30:36.630
<v 2>The thing of secrecy will.
Yeah,
it's a bit of,</v>

2530
02:30:36.631 --> 02:30:39.850
I've never done enough hallucinogens to work out,

2531
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:42.940
but the fact that it's calling,
yeah.

2532
02:30:42.970 --> 02:30:45.950
The fact that you will never have a private thought.
Yeah.

2533
02:30:46.030 --> 02:30:49.190
There's not going to be any private inner voice,
but you know what that means.

2534
02:30:49.290 --> 02:30:49.900
<v 3>We,
we,</v>

2535
02:30:49.900 --> 02:30:53.950
we want to think of it as like everything that we experience in our lifetime is

2536
02:30:53.951 --> 02:30:57.070
like a static thing then has to stay like this,
but it never does.

2537
02:30:57.340 --> 02:31:02.320
It never has from the moment that some fucking weird little sneaky little

2538
02:31:02.321 --> 02:31:05.560
multi-celled thing crawled out of the ocean.
It's never been the same.

2539
02:31:05.561 --> 02:31:07.690
Everything keeps changing.
It's going to keep changing.

2540
02:31:07.900 --> 02:31:09.190
And what we're doing right now,

2541
02:31:09.191 --> 02:31:12.940
which we're figuring out new ways to not be able to hide shit,

2542
02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:16.210
not be able to,
to hide ideas,

2543
02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:19.230
not be able to hide the very thoughts and your own fucking mind,

2544
02:31:19.231 --> 02:31:22.650
not just what you say when you're trying to bang your side piece and she's

2545
02:31:22.651 --> 02:31:24.720
recording you besides your piece.
Your mind is,

2546
02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:29.460
that's the new coin term because of Donald Sterling.
It's not the no,

2547
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:32.700
that's been around for ever.
It's caught side bitch and it's no,

2548
02:31:32.701 --> 02:31:37.350
that's only in your shortfalls are so rude.
He's up massage.

2549
02:31:37.620 --> 02:31:39.060
I know.
Um,

2550
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:43.560
he got some porn star Pussy at some point in all of a sudden this is just

2551
02:31:43.561 --> 02:31:46.770
indicative of some greater trend that's going on and that greater trend is the

2552
02:31:46.771 --> 02:31:49.890
access to information.
That's what it is.
It's the information,

2553
02:31:50.010 --> 02:31:54.480
whether it's information like the idea that what you say in a room,

2554
02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:58.830
it's just like there's an echo and it dies off so I got to die off anymore.

2555
02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:02.300
There's not going to be an echo is going to be a recording and it's going to

2556
02:32:02.310 --> 02:32:02.671
change.

2557
02:32:02.671 --> 02:32:06.930
The very dimension that you exist in the very world that you interface with is a

2558
02:32:06.931 --> 02:32:10.410
completely different world now and it's because the very things that come out of

2559
02:32:10.411 --> 02:32:14.060
your mouth and no longer temporary then now resourceful there,
none of than than,

2560
02:32:14.061 --> 02:32:17.700
than every searchable.
You can go back and find them.
You put them in a bank,

2561
02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:20.640
you hold on to them,
you have amount of phone,
you have them in a,

2562
02:32:20.850 --> 02:32:24.600
in a database and Utah because the NSA has collected all your emails.

2563
02:32:25.060 --> 02:32:29.160
As long as there's celebrity,
as long as there's a Donald Sterling,

2564
02:32:29.161 --> 02:32:33.330
that doesn't matter.
Versus the cop who was caught on tape,

2565
02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:37.890
you know,
hitting a fucking guy with this baton.

2566
02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:39.570
But they're getting in trouble too.

2567
02:32:39.571 --> 02:32:43.350
I mean the guy who just shot that 83 year old lady,
the 83 year old,

2568
02:32:43.351 --> 02:32:48.351
93 93 crazy lady had a gun screaming and young guy came in and just unloaded on

2569
02:32:49.231 --> 02:32:52.040
are just pumped a fucking ton of bullets into her and they're like,
well,

2570
02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:54.540
every week,
every week,
like,
what are you doing?
You didn't just shoot.

2571
02:32:54.541 --> 02:32:55.830
The old lady wants you shot her,

2572
02:32:56.310 --> 02:32:59.400
shot a fucking dozen bullets in her direction or something crazy like that.

2573
02:32:59.810 --> 02:33:00.643
I mean,
it's not,

2574
02:33:00.690 --> 02:33:05.010
it is every week and it doesn't make sense and it's not fair and that is to be

2575
02:33:05.011 --> 02:33:09.690
an exposed,
not as much as the,
the people like the Donald Sterling's,

2576
02:33:09.691 --> 02:33:12.060
but enough that you see a trend.

2577
02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:15.390
If you just looked at it completely objectively outside the ideas of social

2578
02:33:15.391 --> 02:33:17.490
justice,
they'll just look at it like,
yeah,

2579
02:33:17.491 --> 02:33:21.330
we'll look at it like a a like a scientific observation.

2580
02:33:21.630 --> 02:33:23.400
If you look at it like that,
you go,
well yeah,

2581
02:33:23.401 --> 02:33:27.210
Mel Gibson got fucked over by some crazy Khan,
Donald Sterling.
He's an old man,

2582
02:33:28.810 --> 02:33:33.810
raped by a pack a nigger and turn in your fucking sag card because they take it

2583
02:33:34.321 --> 02:33:36.150
into account that he's a fucking entertainer.

2584
02:33:36.151 --> 02:33:39.540
And they gave him a little bit slack.
But stepping outside of the,

2585
02:33:39.541 --> 02:33:43.650
the idea of justice give black people hundreds of millions of dollars.

2586
02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:47.850
You're right,
Donald Sterling who goes,
please don't quantify who's better.

2587
02:33:48.090 --> 02:33:51.440
I don't think you should quantify who's better.
I think what I look at it on it.

2588
02:33:51.490 --> 02:33:54.690
I tried to not think of myself being connected.

2589
02:33:54.691 --> 02:33:58.230
What would I do if I was an old crazy guy like Donald sterling or Mel Gibson?

2590
02:33:58.380 --> 02:34:02.100
I go,
what's going on?
What's going on is just not gonna be any secrets.

2591
02:34:02.430 --> 02:34:06.310
Like you better get used to it.
Cause it's,
it's,
it's slowly happens with a,

2592
02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:10.520
a TMZ tape that the fucking mistress of,
uh,

2593
02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:14.130
Donald Sterling releases or Mel Gibson's crazy rants,

2594
02:34:14.131 --> 02:34:18.070
his racist rant at a cop or you know,
whatever.
But when

2595
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:22.330
<v 1>you're sitting in a cubicle and you went on a date with another guy in the</v>

2596
02:34:22.331 --> 02:34:26.410
office and you're typing on Facebook going,
he's fucking,

2597
02:34:27.250 --> 02:34:28.630
he was kind of Nice,

2598
02:34:28.631 --> 02:34:33.010
but he's filthy and he's as bad breath and he chews with his mouth open.

2599
02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:37.690
All of a sudden,
yeah,
now you're,
you're reading that on Facebook about you.

2600
02:34:37.691 --> 02:34:41.140
It's no longer TMZ about some celebrity.

2601
02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:45.730
Now you're finding out the truth about how someone feels about you on the

2602
02:34:45.731 --> 02:34:50.640
Internet and you go,
Oh,
oh my God.
That's how people feel about me.
I'm,

2603
02:34:50.810 --> 02:34:53.180
I'm just a guy in another cubicle.
Yeah.

2604
02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:58.180
People find out shit about you without being famous.
You're not famous,

2605
02:34:58.181 --> 02:34:59.950
but you read,
Oh,
this is,

2606
02:34:59.951 --> 02:35:04.780
my cousin just said this about me and social networking and now I know.

2607
02:35:05.410 --> 02:35:07.610
Yeah.
No one has any secrets.
Yeah.
Well,

2608
02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:10.510
<v 0>pull effect.
I mean,
right now it's hidden in the celebrities first,</v>

2609
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:13.360
but it's going to,
it's going to go deeper and deeper into the culture.

2610
02:35:13.361 --> 02:35:14.920
This is no getting around it,
man.

2611
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:18.340
It's like what we're experiencing now is not going to be with the future is the

2612
02:35:18.341 --> 02:35:20.750
future is gonna be,
we're gonna be able to read each other's fucking minds.

2613
02:35:20.770 --> 02:35:21.850
They're really close to it.

2614
02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:24.520
They're coming up with technology on a day to day basis.

2615
02:35:24.670 --> 02:35:26.470
That is establishing the,

2616
02:35:26.471 --> 02:35:31.471
the very steps to take to not just be able to send each other pictures or emails

2617
02:35:31.871 --> 02:35:35.680
on a phone,
but be able to do it mind a mind that's there.

2618
02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:39.610
They're working on that.
That's not,
it's not like an impossibility.

2619
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:41.590
That's it's an inevitability.

2620
02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:44.440
It's just a matter of how long it's going to take for the technology becomes

2621
02:35:44.441 --> 02:35:46.960
viable.
They're working on it so they're not going to,

2622
02:35:46.961 --> 02:35:49.450
unless we get hit by an asteroid or invaded by aliens,

2623
02:35:49.451 --> 02:35:51.970
we blow each other up in a nuclear war.
It's common.

2624
02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:56.050
<v 1>Worst fear about reincarnation as I go,
I'll be</v>

2625
02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:01.140
<v 0>dead before that happens.
Oh wait,
I'll come back.
Jesus.
Well,
not only that,</v>

2626
02:36:01.141 --> 02:36:03.450
what if they come up with something that fucking regenerates you?

2627
02:36:03.630 --> 02:36:04.351
What did they come up with?

2628
02:36:04.351 --> 02:36:08.250
Something like this mouse thing where they are injecting young mice blood into

2629
02:36:08.251 --> 02:36:11.880
these mice and making the mice regenerate and they're actually regenerating

2630
02:36:11.881 --> 02:36:14.610
brain tissue and reversing the signs of aging.

2631
02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:18.630
This is like legitimate scientific experiments they're doing on mice where

2632
02:36:18.631 --> 02:36:19.560
they're showing that this is a,

2633
02:36:19.950 --> 02:36:24.750
a potential like thing that might work on all mammals mind not just only work on

2634
02:36:24.751 --> 02:36:26.340
mice and mice be something to do with anything.

2635
02:36:26.570 --> 02:36:30.230
<v 1>I saw this on Sullivan and son.
Hey,
speaking of,</v>

2636
02:36:31.530 --> 02:36:32.363
ah,

2637
02:36:32.830 --> 02:36:35.590
<v 0>that's you.
Would you just assume like,
I'd rather not,</v>

2638
02:36:35.591 --> 02:36:39.820
I'd rather fucking go out and blaze a camels was just keep it bucket.

2639
02:36:40.650 --> 02:36:43.870
He's a,
Peter gave you an opening,
you said before the show,

2640
02:36:43.871 --> 02:36:48.400
you need to miss a week to get ahold of them.
They're fucking president swell up.

2641
02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:51.790
They have the very small little bladder.
It's like a coin purse for a child.

2642
02:36:51.860 --> 02:36:55.940
<v 1>You know what?
I spent so much time dealing with my prostate,
one on one,</v>

2643
02:36:57.820 --> 02:37:00.130
<v 0>one on one with two fingers or one.
I mean,</v>

2644
02:37:00.470 --> 02:37:04.270
when he's in a glove or whatever dog you snip your nails,

2645
02:37:04.510 --> 02:37:08.200
do you file down the edges or you just fucking crazy?
It's going.

2646
02:37:08.201 --> 02:37:12.610
They're ragged with a coke nail.
One of those fucking big ones from Dracula.

2647
02:37:12.611 --> 02:37:16.040
That's a silver with a tip on the end.
I just tear

2648
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.580
<v 3>up the inside of your were assholes.</v>

2649
02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:22.730
Find my prostate and to a world of pain,

2650
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:24.260
hell raisers style,

2651
02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:30.050
ah,

2652
02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:34.550
<v 1>that lasts Soliloquy of mine.
Laughs evidently,</v>

2653
02:37:34.820 --> 02:37:37.850
evidently didn't make sense to you.
That was the eye roll.

2654
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:42.590
No reason I don't do podcasts by myself.
It makes sense.
That makes sense.

2655
02:37:42.591 --> 02:37:46.500
Eventually Joe Rogan has to frown on me and I go,
hey,
that's an hour.

2656
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:50.590
<v 3>Neither one of us,
neither one of us are.
I mean there's no,</v>

2657
02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:53.740
no right or wrong.
We're both making sense.
You know?

2658
02:37:53.741 --> 02:37:56.290
It's like there's a bunch of different points to this whole thing.

2659
02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:00.460
You're absolutely right that it's the one of the most minor forms of racism
ever,

2660
02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:02.830
where people having this massive amounts of outrage,

2661
02:38:03.130 --> 02:38:05.620
but people always have mass amounts of black girl,

2662
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:09.220
but people have massive amounts that were outraged at anything a billionaire

2663
02:38:09.221 --> 02:38:10.660
does,
especially if that building,

2664
02:38:10.730 --> 02:38:15.730
they have a bunch of mots of outrage at what CNN tells him to be outraged.

2665
02:38:16.361 --> 02:38:18.230
That's too,
that's true too,
but the,

2666
02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:22.690
this is one of those things where if you have a billionaire who owns a bunch of

2667
02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:27.640
black people's contracts,
he owns a bunch of thank God.
There was a parentheses.

2668
02:38:29.170 --> 02:38:33.880
<v 1>Yeah,
sweet.
I go,
I want to buy the La Clippers but have the money,</v>

2669
02:38:34.030 --> 02:38:36.220
but I think it would be racist to buy just one

2670
02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:42.760
he owns.
I mean he owns Doug Stanhope.
If you own a team,
do you own

2671
02:38:42.910 --> 02:38:45.880
<v 3>contracts?
I mean,
how do you own it?
I mean you own,
you're essentially,</v>

2672
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:49.960
you own the business.
It's employing x amount of black people.

2673
02:38:50.530 --> 02:38:54.040
<v 1>Interesting that that guy is this.
To see how the 1% lives,</v>

2674
02:38:54.041 --> 02:38:57.250
you know that this guy can like by his Chica Ferrari,

2675
02:38:57.310 --> 02:39:01.570
like he doesn't care that it's,
you know,
he loses 2.5 million.
What is,

2676
02:39:02.650 --> 02:39:07.460
he looks at people like plantation a Chris,
the Chris rock bit was a,

2677
02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:11.110
there's a difference between rich and wealthy.
Shaq is rich.

2678
02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:16.160
The guy that writes the signs,
shacks check is welcome.
That's a great,

2679
02:39:17.710 --> 02:39:19.400
that's a great bit.
I don't even,
you think

2680
02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:23.900
<v 3>we could wrap our heads around the idea of the 1% they're the real Rockefeller</v>

2681
02:39:23.901 --> 02:39:25.100
type money,
you know,

2682
02:39:25.101 --> 02:39:29.900
that's been in their circulation of their family for fucking generation after

2683
02:39:29.901 --> 02:39:34.100
generation.
I think it's so insane.
It's so decadent.

2684
02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:39.520
I mean the reason why we have these ideas about like skull and crossbones,

2685
02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:44.770
the nepotism that these family fucking groups that get handed down.

2686
02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:47.990
My son will be in his colon crossbones as well.

2687
02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:51.020
They all get together and they put on diapers and paddle each other and suck

2688
02:39:51.021 --> 02:39:52.820
each other's dicks and take Polaroids of it,

2689
02:39:52.970 --> 02:39:56.690
put it in a vault in the middle of fucking Yale,
somewhere deep in the dungeon.

2690
02:39:56.900 --> 02:39:57.111
I mean,

2691
02:39:57.111 --> 02:40:00.500
that's because these guys have been in control of some ridiculous thing that

2692
02:40:00.501 --> 02:40:04.370
they should have never had the power to wrap their fucking greedy little fingers

2693
02:40:04.371 --> 02:40:09.020
around billions and billions and billions of dollars with no work at all.

2694
02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:11.840
They were born into it and they're born into this and they're like,

2695
02:40:11.841 --> 02:40:14.220
this is our legacy.
We have to,
it happens on every

2696
02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:17.310
<v 2>level of society.
Yup.
It does.
It does.</v>

2697
02:40:17.430 --> 02:40:19.650
Whenever someone has like a real solid,

2698
02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:23.790
you're a cab batcher and you're going to give your friend that drinks with you,

2699
02:40:23.791 --> 02:40:28.791
the better fucking fair before everyone fucking does that.

2700
02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:32.280
Yeah,
but that's like a friendship thing.
There's a difference between that.

2701
02:40:32.281 --> 02:40:34.980
That is a theory.
Naysayers,

2702
02:40:35.380 --> 02:40:39.150
conspiracy theories happen on in this fucking room.

2703
02:40:39.390 --> 02:40:43.380
People conspire against each other on some level,
but on this guy's level,

2704
02:40:43.381 --> 02:40:46.620
why is it such a surprise to people that he looks at it like a plantation

2705
02:40:46.621 --> 02:40:48.930
workers?
That these are,
you know,
his property.

2706
02:40:48.931 --> 02:40:53.931
I think way a lot of billionaires have that attitude that bees on the ranch,

2707
02:40:54.050 --> 02:40:57.780
the same way you bring openers in case Joey Diaz doesn't show up.
Hey,

2708
02:40:57.781 --> 02:41:02.490
you know what?
You're lower than Joey Diaz,
but you're year for a reason.

2709
02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:07.950
That's the same kind of theory as,
hey,
you work for me.

2710
02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:12.270
Why?
Wait a minute.
Hang on someone else.

2711
02:41:12.271 --> 02:41:15.240
Make that make sense.
Cause that does,
hold on a second.

2712
02:41:16.650 --> 02:41:19.260
You're saying to a guy that you're less than Jody is.

2713
02:41:19.261 --> 02:41:23.490
That's the same as the Donald's.
You're fucking openers.

2714
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:26.300
You're a plantation owner.
You own your own

2715
02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:31.770
to the extent that Donald Sterling does.

2716
02:41:33.870 --> 02:41:37.560
Oh,
I see.
I'm feel,
I feel terrible now.
Oh No,
no.

2717
02:41:37.561 --> 02:41:41.850
I'm saying he shouldn't feel terrible and he's paying them mother fuckers old

2718
02:41:41.851 --> 02:41:45.180
cons.
He's like,
he's born in the era of the fights.

2719
02:41:45.220 --> 02:41:47.490
When Duncan Trussell you behind your back.

2720
02:41:47.550 --> 02:41:50.520
It was a great show and I should have been Joey Diaz the whole time.

2721
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:54.490
Oh,
that's funny.

2722
02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:01.380
John D Rockefeller is worth 340 billion.

2723
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:05.620
Not million billion dollars.
That's the number one richest American.
The mom,

2724
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:10.620
that's guy's dead.
That's not helping this family.
But John D Rockefeller,

2725
02:42:10.621 --> 02:42:11.520
when did he die?

2726
02:42:12.030 --> 02:42:16.890
He died in 1937 that's the point.
No one cares.

2727
02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:19.070
It's such a,
Barb can say that.

2728
02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:22.980
Go see with you said Tom Rhodes was talking to somebody a couple weeks ago and

2729
02:42:22.981 --> 02:42:25.470
every time I mentioned someone's name,
the entertainer,
the guy who was,

2730
02:42:25.471 --> 02:42:29.190
he was on the Internet and I think it's like net worth.com you can punch in

2731
02:42:29.191 --> 02:42:31.350
anybody's name and it says what their net worth is

2732
02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:35.730
to see if it's accurate.
Wait a minute,

2733
02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.730
who the fuck do you talk to that does that.
If they do that,

2734
02:42:38.731 --> 02:42:43.470
stop talking to her and talks about it all the time like,
well,
why?

2735
02:42:43.780 --> 02:42:46.080
First of all,
have you checked it?
Well,
no.

2736
02:42:46.081 --> 02:42:50.640
Why would I keep right now and see if it's close?
I know how off by a million.

2737
02:42:51.570 --> 02:42:53.670
I have my cousins,
I'm not even going to,

2738
02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:56.370
my cousin's a cop in Florida and I got to drive,

2739
02:42:57.810 --> 02:43:01.950
but to see if it's accurate.
Why did the substantiated,
Oh,
who cares?

2740
02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:05.310
The point is not whether or not it's accurate.
My point is who the fuck?

2741
02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:06.271
You tell a guy,

2742
02:43:06.271 --> 02:43:09.870
a guys who you're talking about and the guy immediately goes and checks his

2743
02:43:09.871 --> 02:43:12.040
worth,
tell you,
who cares,
the moron.
Do you want

2744
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.910
<v 0>me to show or maybe Steve Viano cares and her name's Vanessa.</v>

2745
02:43:15.911 --> 02:43:19.810
Stop Saying v by the way,
it's not even her name.
Okay.
It's a fake name.

2746
02:43:19.811 --> 02:43:21.740
She got a bunch of aliases the way,

2747
02:43:22.570 --> 02:43:26.080
but she branded herself as v Steve Yano.
Fuck you.

2748
02:43:26.081 --> 02:43:30.080
You're a gold digging cunt.
But we'll go with Vanessa.
Hey,

2749
02:43:30.220 --> 02:43:34.990
she's a nice girl who has something to offer.
Look,
she's not carrying logs.

2750
02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:38.920
She's not being a fucking woodcutter for the the mill.

2751
02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:42.390
Those guys don't want to be there either.
She's sucking old rich Guy Dick.

2752
02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:47.130
She might start [inaudible] a scam,
but when you get busted at it,
just say,
yeah,

2753
02:43:47.350 --> 02:43:50.630
listen to my opinion is a noble profession that's been around longer than any

2754
02:43:50.650 --> 02:43:51.201
other profession.

2755
02:43:51.201 --> 02:43:56.201
She is going to inspire a lot of other young girls to get them all the time when

2756
02:43:56.861 --> 02:44:00.820
it looked like it's all about what they're worth.
Look,
if he was George Clooney,

2757
02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.120
that check would be fucking them all the time,
but he's not.

2758
02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:07.180
He's an 81 year old bag of meat.

2759
02:44:07.450 --> 02:44:12.450
He's an old wrinkly coins sack filled with flesh and some shitty hollow chicken

2760
02:44:14.111 --> 02:44:19.111
bones that barely carry his old wounded hips around his fucking million dollar

2761
02:44:19.181 --> 02:44:21.460
mansion.
He's an old fuck.
Okay.

2762
02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:25.300
And she fucks him when she has to fuck him and no more,
no less.

2763
02:44:25.301 --> 02:44:29.050
And that's what the market dictates.
Okay.
If it was George Clooney,

2764
02:44:29.170 --> 02:44:32.770
if it was chocolate Dell,
chuck the Dellwood fucker anytime he wanted to,

2765
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:36.280
cause he's an animal and he's alive and he's still a man.

2766
02:44:36.490 --> 02:44:41.490
This is a guy who's barely clinging onto the very cellular existence that he

2767
02:44:41.861 --> 02:44:45.430
maintains in this dimension.
His body's ready to tap the fuck out.

2768
02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:48.970
So when she fucks him is when she fucks him.
And that's the deal.

2769
02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:53.320
You buy the Bentley,
you pay the Ferrari,
you take your fucking ride.

2770
02:44:53.350 --> 02:44:54.910
And that's how the market set.

2771
02:44:56.910 --> 02:44:58.450
<v 12>Uh hmm.</v>

2772
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:03.970
<v 0>There's nothing wrong when she's doing,</v>

2773
02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:07.670
there's nothing wrong with he's doing either.
Both of them are doing fine work,

2774
02:45:07.671 --> 02:45:08.504
work.

2775
02:45:09.170 --> 02:45:12.560
<v 2>And then when you fucking tape record that guy for no reason,</v>

2776
02:45:12.561 --> 02:45:15.740
just to fuck him over,
I don't think she tape recorded him to fuck him over.

2777
02:45:15.741 --> 02:45:16.820
What I understand about this.

2778
02:45:16.821 --> 02:45:20.310
The story is she let the tape recording out to fuck him over,

2779
02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:24.920
but part of her job was to tape record and because
come on,

2780
02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:26.151
let it out.

2781
02:45:26.151 --> 02:45:29.240
And then when she went on CNN like two days later and she was on there or no,
no,

2782
02:45:29.241 --> 02:45:32.720
no,
no,
I'm sorry.
She did a fucking Barbara Walters interview.

2783
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:36.190
She's going to inspire young girls all over America to be fucking old guys.

2784
02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:41.420
He comes out on on Barbara Walters and she says,

2785
02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:45.860
I'm Mister Sterling's right arm,
right hand man.

2786
02:45:45.890 --> 02:45:46.671
Is that you whore?

2787
02:45:46.671 --> 02:45:50.590
You have one line we've taught you to say to cover the woodshed.

2788
02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:53.390
You on this one head,
one fucking line.

2789
02:45:53.391 --> 02:45:58.391
She was supposed to say for the news fucking sound bite and she fucked it up.

2790
02:45:59.150 --> 02:46:04.150
Are you saying you did not look at that chick for a fraction of a second and

2791
02:46:05.841 --> 02:46:10.841
summer up completely knowing what a horrible La Gold digger,

2792
02:46:10.941 --> 02:46:15.410
whatever label you,
it's fishing him the whole time.
Well,
no doubt.

2793
02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:19.760
My old bit about Anna Nicole Smith and her fucking husband,
j Howard Marshall,

2794
02:46:19.761 --> 02:46:22.550
that billionaire guy,
we all,
everybody was like,
no,

2795
02:46:22.551 --> 02:46:26.090
but it's the idea is that of course that's the deal.

2796
02:46:26.210 --> 02:46:29.930
You're in 90 fucking years old.
That girls young.
That's the deal.

2797
02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:32.270
She took it a step beyond the deal.

2798
02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:37.160
I can put Andy Andrews to in the mix.
She's to the point where you go,

2799
02:46:37.161 --> 02:46:41.150
okay,
you stepped over the fucking man boundary of what the line is.

2800
02:46:41.300 --> 02:46:45.020
You don't tape me and then put that out there for no reason just to make me look

2801
02:46:45.021 --> 02:46:47.840
like an asshole after the fact.
Yes,
I agree with you.

2802
02:46:47.841 --> 02:46:52.430
I think that she is a bad person,
no doubt about it and no and no doubt about it,

2803
02:46:52.431 --> 02:46:57.431
but also he's a bad person and who knows what fucking chaos she grew up with and

2804
02:46:58.221 --> 02:47:01.730
who knows what fucking shit he said that she didn't record.

2805
02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:04.010
Who knows what the fuck they're relationship is.

2806
02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:07.670
But what I know is that like vultures circling,

2807
02:47:07.710 --> 02:47:10.720
carrying this is all over the news.
I mean this is,

2808
02:47:10.721 --> 02:47:15.500
we're in the middle of two fucking wars.
You know,
Russia is invading the Ukraine.

2809
02:47:15.501 --> 02:47:20.330
We got all kinds of chaos over the world and everybody's focusing on nonsense

2810
02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:22.390
and the alluding us.
Yeah,

2811
02:47:22.430 --> 02:47:25.580
it's the three [inaudible] about the Ukraine.

2812
02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:30.080
Clean had talking about legitimate social commentators.

2813
02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:34.370
In this day and age,
we count as legitimate social commentators.

2814
02:47:34.580 --> 02:47:37.760
We're doing our job to point out the,
the fruitlessness of this pursuit.

2815
02:47:37.970 --> 02:47:40.940
Go out tomorrow and do something nice for someone you don't know.

2816
02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:45.110
That's my point in fucking people have a barbecue.
Yeah.
Don't care.

2817
02:47:45.140 --> 02:47:48.710
Don't even talk about Donald Sterling by that cave house in Bisbee so I don't

2818
02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:52.220
move in.
Move in and take five acres.

2819
02:47:52.250 --> 02:47:56.360
If we could get 52 buyers one week a year,
that's what I'm talking about.

2820
02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:57.131
A fucking time.

2821
02:47:57.131 --> 02:48:00.920
Share in a cave and been in for a week and call it the mushroom palace when just

2822
02:48:00.921 --> 02:48:04.910
go to eat mushrooms and then just rent it out.
We can make a legit deal.

2823
02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:09.150
The police department badge.
Come on,
we can make it.

2824
02:48:09.350 --> 02:48:13.010
I have to.
But you smoke cigarettes for three hours.
What are you talking about?

2825
02:48:13.190 --> 02:48:16.880
I don't look,
we can make a legitimate deal or the show that's production.

2826
02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:21.290
If we can make a legitimate deal with the local government,
you know,

2827
02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:24.880
somebody we know becomes mayor and work something out.
Uh,

2828
02:48:25.070 --> 02:48:27.740
some sort of an audit shamonic retreat down in Bisbee,

2829
02:48:27.741 --> 02:48:29.480
Arizona may or you're a target.

2830
02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:32.590
We have a nice little underground tunnel somewhere near a tail.

2831
02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:35.900
Somebody who has a case.
I told you off the air stories,

2832
02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:40.040
I told you three of them about how great Bisbee is.

2833
02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:42.950
And I'll tell you the fourth wouldn't have to worry off.
This is what we do.

2834
02:48:42.951 --> 02:48:46.250
We get someone on your death pool to be the mayor.

2835
02:48:46.370 --> 02:48:48.860
And we were placing him with the most likely candidate every year.

2836
02:48:48.861 --> 02:48:52.580
So we constantly celebrities and dying off.
Not now.

2837
02:48:52.581 --> 02:48:55.570
But you had fucking Jake Lamata and your living room.
Dude.
I saw the picture.

2838
02:48:55.571 --> 02:48:59.590
Not dead yet.
That's what I'm talking about.
Jake Lamata as mayor of the busy bee.

2839
02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:04.250
You follow what I'm saying?
It's perfect.
And then who's his vice president?

2840
02:49:04.910 --> 02:49:09.450
Wayne Newton.
Shit.
Somebody else's ready to fucking go.
We've talked about it.

2841
02:49:09.460 --> 02:49:14.010
You need to,
it's not the mayor Johnny,
Johnny Depp.

2842
02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:17.580
Is that a real Johnny Depp?
Who's that guy we are?
Whatever,
whatever.

2843
02:49:17.581 --> 02:49:22.250
I'll tell you another time.
Oh Shit.
It's a real tough shit.
Okay,

2844
02:49:22.530 --> 02:49:26.070
so forget about Johnny Depp Party in your house.
What's a,
you know,

2845
02:49:26.910 --> 02:49:29.620
there's people that we could have that could be a,
you know,

2846
02:49:29.621 --> 02:49:34.170
a mayoral candidates work something.
Now we've got a little utopia going on here,

2847
02:49:34.171 --> 02:49:35.490
but it's a little bit of a shell game.

2848
02:49:35.730 --> 02:49:39.540
It's a bit of a shell game right now to keep it moving.
It's utopia for me.

2849
02:49:39.541 --> 02:49:42.750
Maybe you move in all the fucking vultures.
Follow you.
I like,

2850
02:49:42.790 --> 02:49:46.080
I was so nice to move to and,
and ruined the neighborhood,

2851
02:49:46.110 --> 02:49:50.770
but he started crossfit and
sandbags.

2852
02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:54.960
They'll turn their blood mix ionize water and fucking getting vampire blood.

2853
02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.180
Yeah.
Kettle Bell Boulevard.

2854
02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:09.360
I liked the idea was just glorious.
I burn the other night.

2855
02:50:09.420 --> 02:50:11.900
It's a great guy.
I heard that.
Oh,

2856
02:50:12.500 --> 02:50:15.290
Tom Rose Byrne.

2857
02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:20.430
I'm at a place now where I met so many comics over the years and I've been kind

2858
02:50:20.431 --> 02:50:25.431
of away from them for 10 years that I met Steve Byrne and I assumed I knew him

2859
02:50:26.190 --> 02:50:29.010
and he was like,
oh so nice to meet you.
And I'm like,
I don't,

2860
02:50:29.011 --> 02:50:31.320
we already know each other because you're so familiar.

2861
02:50:31.530 --> 02:50:34.920
And I was in a drunken state.
Tom Saw me there.

2862
02:50:35.010 --> 02:50:39.630
This fucking story just got shady,
right?
I'm not buying this at all.

2863
02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:41.190
Well it's like Amy Schumer.

2864
02:50:41.191 --> 02:50:45.840
I don't know if I assume I've met her cause she looks familiar and now she's

2865
02:50:45.841 --> 02:50:46.351
famous.

2866
02:50:46.351 --> 02:50:51.351
So I just assume we probably met at a festival somewhere cause she got famous on

2867
02:50:52.501 --> 02:50:56.940
the sneak tip early after me,
after my career.

2868
02:50:57.060 --> 02:51:01.860
She was so I go,
we probably met at Montreal.
So Steve Byrne,
he's like,
no,

2869
02:51:01.861 --> 02:51:06.480
I've never met you.
And I'm like,
ah,
maybe I'm just drunk.
I thought I did.

2870
02:51:06.660 --> 02:51:09.240
So I shit,
I saw you there.
Yeah,
I ran into,

2871
02:51:09.241 --> 02:51:12.360
I saw you at the Improv and Steve Burton was there also.
This is what,

2872
02:51:12.361 --> 02:51:16.230
Saturday night?
Yeah.
And he's screaming drinks for all my friends or whatever.

2873
02:51:16.470 --> 02:51:17.041
Steve Byrne,

2874
02:51:17.041 --> 02:51:21.480
I have a lot of friends who have television shows like good friends of mine and

2875
02:51:21.481 --> 02:51:24.660
I've never been on them.
Steve is a guy I know he's a friend,

2876
02:51:24.661 --> 02:51:26.160
but not like a really good friend.

2877
02:51:26.370 --> 02:51:29.610
That Saturday night you were plastered and then you left and then I was talking

2878
02:51:29.611 --> 02:51:33.000
to him and he's,
when he leave in town,
I'm like,
Wednesday.
He goes,
oh,

2879
02:51:33.001 --> 02:51:33.451
that's great.

2880
02:51:33.451 --> 02:51:37.320
We tape on Tuesdays and there's a role that will be perfect for you.
He goes,

2881
02:51:37.321 --> 02:51:41.190
you got a second.
Pulls out his phone,
calls it as executive producer,

2882
02:51:41.370 --> 02:51:42.203
gets off the phone.
He goes,

2883
02:51:42.210 --> 02:51:47.210
we rehearsed Monday and a film Tuesday and the role I went by there first that

2884
02:51:48.601 --> 02:51:51.450
night.
Well,

2885
02:51:51.451 --> 02:51:53.700
the role was a part of a road comic that sucks his cock.

2886
02:51:53.701 --> 02:51:57.960
It's a very complicated piece.
Back to the front desk guy blowing.

2887
02:51:57.961 --> 02:52:02.520
You're from Missouri.
Jesus Christ,
I could've had my teeth removed,

2888
02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:10.000
does and seen.
This is the end,
this fun.

2889
02:52:10.130 --> 02:52:14.910
We ran out and buy three hours.
We did it.
We did a 500 podcast.

2890
02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:19.360
This is wow.
500 gentlemen.
It was a part of the 500th.
You ever done it?
500 times.

2891
02:52:19.361 --> 02:52:21.350
Three hours.
Cause it's to see what that is.

2892
02:52:21.370 --> 02:52:23.740
I don't think it really is three hours.
I think a lot of them are too,

2893
02:52:23.741 --> 02:52:25.030
but there's most of them are three.

2894
02:52:25.270 --> 02:52:28.870
The majority of them probably like 80% since the end.
This is the end.

2895
02:52:29.340 --> 02:52:31.810
Oh lightly frank.
Where are you going to bitch?
Asia.

2896
02:52:31.930 --> 02:52:36.700
How dare you when Asia for a month.
How dare your Tom Rhodes.
I'm going to Hawaii.

2897
02:52:36.701 --> 02:52:39.580
Maybe it will be on the same flight.
That makes sense.

2898
02:52:39.660 --> 02:52:43.860
The same direction now over in Honolulu,
we're going to Hawaii.

2899
02:52:43.861 --> 02:52:47.670
You doing gigs now?
Mileage grab.
I needed to,

2900
02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:49.480
I met a front desk.

2901
02:52:52.030 --> 02:52:56.860
I go through Hawaii and uh,
I go,
I just tweeted,
hey,
I'm going to Hawaii.

2902
02:52:57.220 --> 02:52:59.080
Set me up with a Gig.
Anyone.

2903
02:52:59.470 --> 02:53:04.150
And within like I think 12 hours it was done.
Wow.
Wow.
Well,

2904
02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:07.300
so I tried it again with the,
I didn't actually tweet it this time.

2905
02:53:07.301 --> 02:53:11.850
I went back to the same guy.
Well Eddie if does there that night we got,

2906
02:53:12.470 --> 02:53:17.020
they saw your council meeting.
So No,

2917
02:53:53.951 --> 02:53:56.900

I had a hard time finding it.
I don't want anyone to follow me.

2918
02:53:56.901 --> 02:54:00.880
You can't find underscore.
I said that about both of you recently on a podcast.

2919
02:54:00.881 --> 02:54:05.410
Like why don't you have your fucking audience go after whoever has Tom Rhodes.

2920
02:54:05.470 --> 02:54:05.971

All I had to do was give him free tickets for life whenever I played in Dallas.

2927
02:54:27.150 --> 02:54:29.530
