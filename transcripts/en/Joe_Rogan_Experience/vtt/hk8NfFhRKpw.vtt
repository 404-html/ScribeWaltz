00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:09.300
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>

150
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.133
<v Speaker 1>You're listening.</v>

151
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be easy online.</v>

152
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

153
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>

155
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

156
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

157
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it's very unfortunate.</v>

158
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Divorce is very unfortunate,</v>

159
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>but what's more unfortunate is that marriage exists.</v>

160
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

161
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.210
<v Speaker 1>it's more than fortunate with the more in French.</v>

162
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I for sure.</v>

163
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:25.594
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

164
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely,</v>

165
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>women should be compensated when they have children and I understand the idea of</v>

166
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:31.271
<v Speaker 1>alimony,</v>

167
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I get what's going on.</v>

168
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>No one should suffer and yeah,</v>

169
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>I get that totally 100% but at what time do we just stop and go,</v>

170
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:40.151
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

171
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not the best idea to just get your finances all fucking tangled up</v>

172
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>together where you want to break up and you can't break up because all your</v>

173
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>fucking credit cards and bank accounts are together and your own the house</v>

174
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>together or some crazy shit and you absorb her student loans and now your</v>

175
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>credit's fucked.</v>

176
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>And she has to deal with the facts.</v>

177
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Your credit shit too because your car got repossessed and together you're just a</v>

178
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking nightmare.</v>

179
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Then you have some,</v>

180
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>some sort of lawyers that take the extra third that they,</v>

181
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.510
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

183
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>we don't even end up with everything with a lot less than you expected in the</v>

184
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.001
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

185
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:13.834
<v Speaker 1>Just paying other parties.</v>

186
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

187
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it happen.</v>

188
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:15.981
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

189
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm happily married parents.</v>

190
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.363
<v Speaker 1>I got lucky.</v>

191
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.293
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

192
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh it happens with everybody.</v>

193
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

194
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

195
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>People are fucking crazy.</v>

196
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Me included.</v>

197
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>We're all fucking crazy.</v>

198
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that we can get locked into some nutty contract that says,</v>

199
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:29.471
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

200
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:30.131
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going anywhere.</v>

201
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>You go anywhere.</v>

202
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>No sign here.</v>

203
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it works.</v>

204
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>But that one third thing is the thing that Phil Hartman,</v>

205
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:36.620
<v Speaker 1>you still say,</v>

206
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah and this is a guy whose wife wound up killing him.</v>

207
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>This is what he used to always say is it's not half,</v>

208
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

209
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>it's two thirds because the lawyer gets a fucking third.</v>

210
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Like he was,</v>

211
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>he was sweating it hard.</v>

212
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Did she,</v>

213
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.953
<v Speaker 1>did she do that?</v>

214
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Just killed him in his sleep.</v>

215
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

216
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying with the divorced or,</v>

217
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>or would they still know they were still married but you know,</v>

218
00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of rumors as to why she was upset,</v>

219
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>but she was obviously,</v>

220
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>she was fucked up on some,</v>

221
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>she was on Zoloft and cocaine apparently.</v>

222
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.354
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>

223
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It's quite that mix.</v>

224
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Even I think they got a payment from Zoloft for that.</v>

225
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the family got money for it.</v>

226
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole thing is so fucking sad.</v>

227
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>My point is it's not like that would have changed it.</v>

228
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

229
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy person and drugs and all sorts of other things.</v>

230
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

231
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.290
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that I just wish it didn't have to be that people got crushed</v>

232
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:27.081
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

233
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I've watched dudes go down and take a divorce hit that is like,</v>

234
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>it just eats a year of your life and they were miserable for a year.</v>

235
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

236
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

237
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

238
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like any,</v>

239
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>any like vicious separation like that.</v>

240
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It's hard enough just emotionally.</v>

241
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>But then the tag into it,</v>

242
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>the fucking battle that people go through where they,</v>

243
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:51.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:51.951
<v Speaker 1>this fucking bitch,</v>

245
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:52.731
<v Speaker 1>she wants the house.</v>

246
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna fucking give it to you.</v>

247
00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:54.711
<v Speaker 1>Ain't even like that house.</v>

248
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

249
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

250
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 1>you see people get crazy.</v>

251
00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

252
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.120
<v Speaker 1>What did he could've just go his wife to zoom.</v>

253
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Kobe's wife took all three houses.</v>

254
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.091
<v Speaker 1>Did she?</v>

255
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I thought they got back together in Newport coast.</v>

256
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what really,</v>

257
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

258
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:05.520
<v Speaker 1>it's just stuff that I've heard.</v>

259
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to talk about Colby.</v>

260
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

261
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.103

262
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.811
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

263

<v Speaker 1>Do I know asshole.</v>

264
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Let me just get bullshit.</v>

265
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:12.704
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not him.</v>

266
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Coby got divorced on legal zoom.com.</v>

267
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Copy the shit.</v>

268
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Figured it out himself.</v>

269
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.201
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

270
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:19.034
<v Speaker 1>just take,</v>

271
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.553
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

272
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 1>legal zoom.com,</v>

273
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

274
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>can do a lot of shit though.</v>

275
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a suite.</v>

276
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a suite.</v>

277
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.700
<v Speaker 1>A alternative to going to a lawyer and spending a lot of money just isn't,</v>

278
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not really necessary.</v>

279
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in over your head,</v>

280
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 1>they'll also provide you a contact with an independent attorney.</v>

281
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in the middle of it and you're like,</v>

282
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:40.581
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

283
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm plugging panicking.</v>

284
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I think this is illegal.</v>

285
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.214
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop.</v>

286
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm with Ya.</v>

287
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm stupid too.</v>

288
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

289
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 1>If I had to go and do my own taxes,</v>

290
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.480
<v Speaker 1>who knows what the fuck I would have done?</v>

291
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh goodness.</v>

292
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 1>It would be terrible.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's fucking delicious.</v>

331
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Mccoffee man bulletproof.</v>

332
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

333
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.203
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

334
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

335
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I read something saying that that could be bad for you,</v>

336
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 1>that I could possibly give you a heart attacks and shit.</v>

337
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Like people are like,</v>

338
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.271
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

339
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 1>All the butter in the,</v>

340
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.131
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

341
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

342
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>in the coffee and they're like,</v>

343
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.231
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

344
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>this is probably not so good.</v>

345
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>But I think they're probably discounting the difference.</v>

346
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder if they are between,</v>

347
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

348
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>the body's absorption of grass fed butter versus regular butter.</v>

349
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.051
<v Speaker 1>If you never,</v>

350
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the fuck we're talking about.</v>

351
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Dave Asprey,</v>

352
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:27.351
<v Speaker 1>this like super eclectic genius dude who collects all sorts of information about</v>

353
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 1>human optimization.</v>

354
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 1>He's a freak for this stuff.</v>

355
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

356
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 1>he runs the bulletproof exec.com and he came up with this idea for bulletproof</v>

357
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:36.400
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

358
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking genius.</v>

359
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's grass fed butter,</v>

360
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 1>MCT oil,</v>

361
00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>which is medium triglyceride oral.</v>

362
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 1>And is that what it's called?</v>

363
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.363
<v Speaker 1>Is that what is called,</v>

364
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was on a blank?</v>

365
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Mct Oil medium something,</v>

366
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

367
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.963
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it call,</v>

368
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

369
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Speaker 1>it's good for you.</v>

370
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is?</v>

371
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Mct Oil is coconut oil,</v>

372
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but what they do is they spin it in a centrifuge and by spinning it in a</v>

373
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:03.871
<v Speaker 1>centrifuge,</v>

374
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 1>they can take out the,</v>

375
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>the most nutritious aspects of it.</v>

376
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Medium chain triglycerides is what they're called.</v>

377
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.323
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

378
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 1>all that together mixed with the coffee.</v>

379
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>

380
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 1>it has like a slow release effect because you have all the calories with it</v>

381
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 1>because you have the calories of the butter and you cowers of that like really</v>

382
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.840
<v Speaker 1>rich MCT oil and it's a slower release sort of coffee thing so that you don't</v>

383
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:31.411
<v Speaker 1>have like,</v>

384
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 1>like that massive crash.</v>

385
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 1>If you drink like black coffee and you have an empty stumper,</v>

386
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 1>do you just go for it?</v>

387
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Four shots before every training session.</v>

388
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you force shots?</v>

389
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Man.</v>

390
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried doing it with bulletproof coffee?</v>

391
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:42.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

392
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

393
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.191
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally,</v>

394
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>it was before,</v>

395
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 1>like when I was sitting in Brazil,</v>

396
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I was on the Internet trying to buy it off of your,</v>

397
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:49.231
<v Speaker 1>off of,</v>

398
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:50.970
<v Speaker 1>on it that you would,</v>

399
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I think you would enjoy it man.</v>

400
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 1>This is what we have some of it right here.</v>

401
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Do we have any shit that,</v>

402
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I drink it all the time.</v>

403
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 1>If you want to try it,</v>

404
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.741
<v Speaker 1>I'll try.</v>

405
00:10:59.741 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I say try up here.</v>

406
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't have cooties.</v>

407
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Try some of them just don't stick your tongue.</v>

408
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 1>We sell.</v>

409
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.950
<v Speaker 1>We sell a lot of shit like that though at on it.</v>

410
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>We do sell bulletproof coffee,</v>

411
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>but we tried to sell the most nutritious and interesting things that we can find</v>

412
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>like killer bee honey that is delicious.</v>

413
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.461
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

414
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Stevia to no sugar.</v>

415
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

416
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Himalayan salt,</v>

417
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.190
<v Speaker 1>which is an incredibly rich in minerals.</v>

418
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:22.980
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know about the benefits of natural salt.</v>

419
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>If you thinking about any of these things,</v>

420
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the new tropics,</v>

421
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I always urge people to Google it.</v>

422
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

423
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting and fascinating subject and the subject of supplements</v>

424
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:32.484
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

425
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of data,</v>

426
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.960
<v Speaker 1>from a lot of people that seem to suggest that people,</v>

428
00:11:36.961 --> 00:11:39.150
<v Speaker 1>it's more important to have diet and that,</v>

429
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:39.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

430
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 1>your diet is really where you get all your nutrients from,</v>

431
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.670
<v Speaker 1>which I agree that the body absorbs nutrients most certainly better from a rich</v>

432
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 1>diet and a healthy diet,</v>

433
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's also really good to supplement.</v>

434
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.750
<v Speaker 1>That's don't be crazy.</v>

435
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.643
<v Speaker 1>They're both good.</v>

436
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Healthy vitamins are good,</v>

437
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.470
<v Speaker 1>healthy nutrients are good and healthy amounts of,</v>

438
00:11:59.500 --> 00:11:59.801
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

439
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:00.181
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

440
00:12:00.181 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

441
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.361
<v Speaker 1>of vegetables,</v>

442
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:02.470
<v Speaker 1>green leafy vegetables.</v>

443
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.640
<v Speaker 1>That's shit so important.</v>

444
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Can't stress that enough.</v>

445
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't even sell vegetables,</v>

446
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.851
<v Speaker 1>but I always tell people,</v>

447
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 1>you want to make your life better.</v>

448
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Eat more vegetables,</v>

449
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

450
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 1>You're eating fucking cheeseburgers and empty food.</v>

451
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 1>She eats perfect.</v>

452
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

453
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 1>but no supplements.</v>

454
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying to get the responses by APS.</v>

455
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:16.451
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

456
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:17.620
<v Speaker 1>as long as you eat perfect,</v>

457
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>you don't need supplements.</v>

458
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:19.361
<v Speaker 1>Quite honestly,</v>

459
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I think there's certain supplements that I would take regardless of my diet,</v>

460
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 1>like shroom tech for uh,</v>

461
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 1>for training or just things give you extra energy or Melatonin.</v>

462
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:28.834
<v Speaker 1>If I wanted to sleep,</v>

463
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 1>I would still take those things.</v>

464
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 1>But I think that if you could eat like just nothing but organic vegetables and</v>

465
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you're like all day and you,</v>

466
00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:37.570
<v Speaker 1>you really ate healthy quantities of it,</v>

467
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably get enough nutrients.</v>

468
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.160
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably do if you really do.</v>

469
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you know the quantity,</v>

470
00:12:44.171 --> 00:12:44.351
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

471
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to eat massive quantities.</v>

472
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

473
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Twice a day with me.</v>

474
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

475
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.121
<v Speaker 1>She's young though.</v>

476
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Look at her.</v>

477
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.640
<v Speaker 1>You're young and if I'm young,</v>

478
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:52.451
<v Speaker 1>people are vibrant,</v>

479
00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 1>they heal quicker.</v>

480
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.150
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

481
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 1>my daughter is three,</v>

482
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>she's like Wolverine.</v>

483
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 1>She gets a scratch.</v>

484
00:12:57.431 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 1>It's gone by the end of the day.</v>

485
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.820
<v Speaker 1>They just suck up inside their body.</v>

486
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

487
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>they're just growing that she could eat cheeseburgers all day.</v>

488
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.700
<v Speaker 1>That's how young people get away with shitty diets.</v>

489
00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:07.900
<v Speaker 1>It's still amazing athletes.</v>

490
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

491
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 1>you give a hyper body and my daughter's almost two and she literally,</v>

492
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I feel like she fall down a flight of stairs and then five seconds later she's</v>

493
00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 1>doing jumping jacks and I'm like,</v>

494
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:17.770

499
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

500
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be able to rebound just like a little kid.</v>

501
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.440
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking for sure.</v>

502
00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Common.</v>

505
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.070

514
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.330
<v Speaker 1>How sexy was he on a one to 10 for,</v>

515
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.390
<v Speaker 1>for a six year old man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

517
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 1>he was just about a 9.5 I saw a dude on the beach that had to be 75 years old</v>

518
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and he was yoked.</v>

519
00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.351
<v Speaker 1>And I should talk.</v>

521
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm 45 I'm 46 now.</v>

522
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm on TRT,</v>

523
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm on human growth hormone.</v>

524
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:04.311
<v Speaker 1>Let's take both of them.</v>

525
00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So I take one like a little bit less than one unit of growth a day.</v>

526
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.831
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

527
00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I take a shot once a week of testosterone.</v>

528
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I used to do a cream,</v>

529
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.480
<v Speaker 1>but the creams,</v>

530
00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 1>like you gotta do it every day and do a shot.</v>

531
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like once a week and it's just a little,</v>

532
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:19.480
<v Speaker 1>it's just like too on a syringe,</v>

533
00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck that is.</v>

534
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's not much for a week.</v>

535
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>But if I don't,</v>

536
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel as good.</v>

537
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I try and get my dad on to it because I know it'll,</v>

538
00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:26.570
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

539
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.960
<v Speaker 1>he's always fucking complaining about,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And like come on.</v>

542
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.511
<v Speaker 1>That's figured out.</v>

543
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:31.991
<v Speaker 1>He won't do it.</v>

544
00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's an old surfer hippie,</v>

545
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 1>but well it's becoming much more popular and you see it all over the news,</v>

555
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.600
<v Speaker 1>like getting old.</v>

<v Speaker 2>loyal followers.</v>

00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

601
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.200
<v Speaker 2>What does that stand for?</v>

602
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.600
<v Speaker 2>The undergrad creepy top team</v>

603
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

604
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.960
<v Speaker 2>and these,</v>

605
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:05.511
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

606
00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I've been there forever.</v>

607
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I've been on the underground since 2002 or 2001 I think.</v>

608
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.900
<v Speaker 2>But they made this themselves,</v>

609
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 2>they called themselves the UGC.</v>

610
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 2>T t didn't make fun of other,</v>

611
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 2>all the other top teams in the world that that's why all the shirts have it on</v>

612
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

613
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.300
<v Speaker 2>That's why we don't make money off the shirts like that.</v>

614
00:16:21.301 --> 00:16:21.950
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

615
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.450
<v Speaker 2>we just make it make enough to pay for it and then we'd give away tons of</v>

616
00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:26.721
<v Speaker 2>shirts.</v>

617
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:27.554
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

618
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.141
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

619
00:16:28.141 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 2>that undergrounds kind of mine if it's own,</v>

620
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

621
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.290
<v Speaker 2>they could sway the opinion of,</v>

622
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:33.561
<v Speaker 2>of yeah,</v>

623
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:34.910
<v Speaker 2>the sport I think itself.</v>

624
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

625
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:35.641
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

626
00:16:35.641 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how these things sort of just sort of,</v>

627
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 2>they just come out of nowhere on a forum and then it becomes like a meme and</v>

628
00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 2>then it takes off like a,</v>

629
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 2>like on the underground it was always beep,</v>

630
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
<v Speaker 2>the homeowner detector like Ted's and always have beef.</v>

631
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Like someone with some,</v>

632
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.810
<v Speaker 2>someone even this,</v>

633
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 2>you could clearly see that some guys with troll for beef but still like it's</v>

634
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:01.130
<v Speaker 2>very common if something happens,</v>

635
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 2>some guy has his shirt off beep.</v>

636
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.033
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

637
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I had a long thread on the underground for a while.</v>

638
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever saw that.</v>

639
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.460
<v Speaker 2>What was it that the threat,</v>

640
00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:11.160
<v Speaker 2>the threat of the,</v>

641
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.130
<v Speaker 2>the women that ever sleeping with no,</v>

642
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:15.320
<v Speaker 2>you had a thread with all the women you were sleeping with.</v>

643
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go for it too.</v>

644
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

645
00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 2>That would seem like that could get you in trouble.</v>

646
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:20.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know new today.</v>

647
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.771
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

648
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:22.281
<v Speaker 2>not yet.</v>

649
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:22.641
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

650
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:22.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

651
00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:23.211
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

652
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:27.330
<v Speaker 2>there was honestly it was a couple off by a couple of hundred on there and it,</v>

653
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 2>it was like a year long and it just got ugly.</v>

654
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

655
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

656
00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:35.180
<v Speaker 2>some people can be obviously complained and threatened me and not make it on</v>

657
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:35.301
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

658
00:17:35.301 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just there's stars over your parts.</v>

659
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.440
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

660
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.680
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

661
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I am not that it probably feel like it was a better idea at the time.</v>

662
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:45.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

663
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was,</v>

664
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

665
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 2>this was before I was in the UFC.</v>

666
00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 2>This is before I was,</v>

667
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.210
<v Speaker 1>it was a while ago.</v>

668
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:51.601
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

669
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I just thought I was cool.</v>

670
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's really all,</v>

671
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm only good at the physical things and everything else.</v>

672
00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I suck cat fighting and,</v>

673
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>

674
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm all right at,</v>

675
00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

676
00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:03.510
<v Speaker 1>the underground has produced some of the most epic threads I've ever seen on</v>

677
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>message boards.</v>

678
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever read the one with the,</v>

679

680
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's the undefeated prison fighter?</v>

681
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

682
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Christian.</v>

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.440

684
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.371
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.540
<v Speaker 1>he wound up having a,</v>

693
00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:27.300
<v Speaker 1>a fight with this,</v>

694

702
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.040
<v Speaker 1>the kid who fought them because the kid who fought them had some skills and just</v>

703
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:39.930
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of this guy.</v>

704

<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

705
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.800
<v Speaker 1>it was weird watching it.</v>

706
00:18:41.801 --> 00:18:42.121
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

707
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Speaker 1>cause this guy even trained and he might've not even have ever trained.</v>

708
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.110

709
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.020
<v Speaker 1>And he talked himself into a being the toughest man on the pizza,</v>

710
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 1>having an MMA fight when he really had no fucking business.</v>

00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's how I found out about this thread was from the underground.</v>

732
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.210
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

733
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.150
<v Speaker 1>did you ever read the grow?</v>

734
00:19:22.151 --> 00:19:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Look tried to lick my pooper.</v>

735
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

736
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.690
<v Speaker 1>The thread is like a billion fucking pages long.</v>

737
00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:29.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like crazy.</v>

738
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 1>There's some threads that I have like subscribed that I'll check in on every</v>

739
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 1>couple of months.</v>

740
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:34.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

741
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:37.140
<v Speaker 1>like they have a podcast thread and uh,</v>

742
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:37.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:38.200
<v Speaker 1>every now and then I'll,</v>

744
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll jump in and they have a thread about the podcasts.</v>

745
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:41.124
<v Speaker 1>I'll jump in and said,</v>

746
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.963
<v Speaker 1>just hire.</v>

747
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Those are your people.</v>

748
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.770
<v Speaker 1>They're nice people that look this,</v>

749
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

750
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.110
<v Speaker 1>the amount of cuts in the world is,</v>

751
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:50.130
<v Speaker 1>is pretty high.</v>

752
00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I love that word.</v>

753
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:54.360
<v Speaker 1>And when people are free to be whoever they are anonymously,</v>

754
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a lot of cons because that's the root of all animosity is</v>

755
00:19:59.011 --> 00:19:59.850
<v Speaker 1>cunty behavior.</v>

756
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I got trolled in Brazil and I would just lost it on some guy cause he was just,</v>

757
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.470
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

758
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.720
<v Speaker 1>there's only one word he said,</v>

759
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:07.650
<v Speaker 1>but it just pissed me off.</v>

760
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.203
<v Speaker 1>It's constant,</v>

761
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.601
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

762
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is that they're just trying to have fun a lot of times by just</v>

763
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 1>getting a rise out of you.</v>

764
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.390
<v Speaker 1>You've got to realize that and,</v>

765
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's also just,</v>

766
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not a natural way to communicate,</v>

767
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.400
<v Speaker 1>to not be in front of someone.</v>

768
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of things that you'd say,</v>

769
00:20:22.231 --> 00:20:23.700
<v Speaker 1>an email he would never say in front.</v>

770
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

771
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.803
<v Speaker 1>that's my PSA.</v>

772
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.621
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk to you.</v>

773
00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to write your letters,</v>

774
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.510
<v Speaker 1>show you how to feel like bitch,</v>

775
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:27.931
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

776
00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:28.101
<v Speaker 1>It will,</v>

777
00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:28.921
<v Speaker 1>we'll just fucking letter.</v>

778
00:20:28.921 --> 00:20:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't make me read.</v>

779
00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a sissy.</v>

780
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Look at me and tell me what's going on.</v>

781
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Like you tell me what's the problem and let's talk this out.</v>

782
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the best way to communicate as looking at each other,</v>

783
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 1>looking at each other and actually saying what's on your mind.</v>

784
00:20:41.161 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 1>You can't let things build up.</v>

785
00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:43.314
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

786
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:43.831
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

787
00:20:43.831 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you're going to explode and end up,</v>

788
00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

789
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:46.680
<v Speaker 1>doing something stupid.</v>

790
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

791
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:50.140
<v Speaker 1>And things can swing like left or right,</v>

792
00:20:50.141 --> 00:20:51.190
<v Speaker 1>like good or bad,</v>

793
00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:55.000
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you react to a moment while you're in front of someone.</v>

794
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times you would apologize,</v>

795
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:57.431
<v Speaker 1>you'd go,</v>

796
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:57.641
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

797
00:20:57.641 --> 00:20:58.391
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have said that.</v>

798
00:20:58.391 --> 00:20:58.511
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

799
00:20:58.511 --> 00:20:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean it that way.</v>

800
00:20:59.561 --> 00:20:59.981
<v Speaker 1>Or look,</v>

801
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:00.221
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

802
00:21:00.221 --> 00:21:00.551
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

803
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:01.690
<v Speaker 1>this is where I'm coming from.</v>

804
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:02.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

805
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

806
00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:03.611
<v Speaker 1>when you see that,</v>

807
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:04.510
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at each other,</v>

808
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

809
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.580
<v Speaker 1>But you write it down in an email,</v>

810
00:21:06.581 --> 00:21:11.581
<v Speaker 1>you can just be completely self indulgent and just filled with nonsense.</v>

811
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:15.810
<v Speaker 1>And you think just because someone wrote it down like it makes it real.</v>

812
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

813
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.160
<v Speaker 1>respect feelings and this and that,</v>

814
00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:19.270
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah.</v>

815
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:19.841
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

816
00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:20.674
<v Speaker 1>You fucking,</v>

817
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.611
<v Speaker 1>you've ever posted.</v>

818
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Just don't have the balls to say clickety clickety clack.</v>

819
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Clickety could stop talk stupid text messages.</v>

820
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.670
<v Speaker 1>He broke up with me over text messages.</v>

821
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Well that's horrible,</v>

822
00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:34.060
<v Speaker 1>but if you are in a nightmare relationship,</v>

823
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:35.320
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a good move.</v>

824
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.710
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

825
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Like why be around them anymore than you'd have to just go watch and just pull</v>

826
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:40.960

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

848
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.880
<v Speaker 1>He was like one of the first guys around La to get really fucking good.</v>

857
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what I took from him.</v>

858
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 1>That was most of my game.</v>

859
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

860
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.240

861
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

862

<v Speaker 1>Really Good Jujitsu.</v>

863
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people slept on his Jujitsu and then he went over to Japan,</v>

864
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:43.960
<v Speaker 1>but it was almost like on the tail end of his competing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

866

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

868
00:22:46.271 --> 00:22:50.350

869
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.020
<v Speaker 1>You have a bunch of epic fights with Pat Miletich.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Trying to pull out of it,</v>

1000
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:33.290
<v Speaker 2>falling back into it.</v>

1001
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:35.420
<v Speaker 2>And now I have a kid and now I have a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>for once in my life I have a positive female influence as far as dating goes.</v>

1003
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.150

1008
00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:49.064
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

1009
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 2>but I've done just about everything,</v>

1012
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.030

1020
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it and I've just,</v>

1021
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:02.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1022
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.990
<v Speaker 2>now I've got a kid in a career and I'm just trying to settle down and be a good</v>

1023
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:06.440
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>

1024
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.520
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1026
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.520
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a wild past for a dude who's like a top level professional athlete.</v>

1027
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.710
<v Speaker 2>If people listening to this on the podcast,</v>

1028
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1029
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.960
<v Speaker 2>without getting to know you better,</v>

1030
00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:18.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1031
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this guy?</v>

1032
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.290
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the best flyweights on the planet.</v>

1033
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm the best</v>

1034
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.770
<v Speaker 2>look dudes may on any given night in,</v>

1035
00:26:28.771 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 2>in the world of high level of mixed martial arts,</v>

1036
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.000
<v Speaker 2>anybody can beat anybody.</v>

1037
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.840
<v Speaker 2>And I thought you'd be Dj in the first fight and then you guys,</v>

1038
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.970
<v Speaker 2>well this is I think,</v>

1039
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:40.160
<v Speaker 2>and correct me if you disagree.</v>

1040
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that there has to be,</v>

1041
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1042
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>an</v>

1043
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.460
<v Speaker 1>element of the fight where when one person is like doing something like really</v>

1044
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:50.610
<v Speaker 1>dominant to the other person that's got to count for more.</v>

1045
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Like when a guy's got a guy's back,</v>

1047
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:54.360
<v Speaker 1>like he had his backend pounded on them,</v>

1048
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.950
<v Speaker 1>that's got to count for more than just winning around all,</v>

1049
00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.033
<v Speaker 1>barely.</v>

1051
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Like if a guy wins around with like strikes and 10 more strikes be more strikes</v>

1052
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:08.130
<v Speaker 1>or the next guy gets into a really good position,</v>

1053
00:27:08.131 --> 00:27:09.450
<v Speaker 1>it does significant damage.</v>

1054
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.050
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

1055
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.310
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same point.</v>

1056
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a different,</v>

1057
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.760
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense to me the way things are now.</v>

1058
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:15.601
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1059
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:16.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1060
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.600
<v Speaker 1>you do know doc Hamilton's I'd go,</v>

1061
00:27:17.601 --> 00:27:18.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1062
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:18.883
<v Speaker 1>Do you like that idea?</v>

1063
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:19.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a half point idea.</v>

1064
00:27:19.991 --> 00:27:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

1066
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.301
<v Speaker 2>Did actually,</v>

1067
00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:21.730
<v Speaker 2>it makes,</v>

1068
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just,</v>

1069
00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:22.811
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1070
00:27:22.811 --> 00:27:23.644
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1071
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.630
<v Speaker 2>it sounds nice,</v>

1072
00:27:24.631 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 2>but we have people that have no business judging,</v>

1073
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:29.160
<v Speaker 2>judging flies and then like literally let's,</v>

1074
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.740
<v Speaker 2>let's say if I would have won that fight,</v>

1075
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.161
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1076
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:37.161
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have gone into some just horrible spiral out of control for the,</v>

1077
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:38.880
<v Speaker 2>the next year of my UFC career,</v>

1078
00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:40.590
<v Speaker 2>right after written my very first fight,</v>

1079
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1080
00:27:41.131 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 2>back to just being stupid and doing horrible things to myself.</v>

1081
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you would have done that?</v>

1082
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:46.080
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1083
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.140
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1084
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:46.973
<v Speaker 2>That's what I did.</v>

1085
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.700
<v Speaker 2>How you did after that.</v>

1086
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why I DJ kicked my ass a second time.</v>

1087
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:51.991
<v Speaker 2>That's why Joe,</v>

1088
00:27:51.991 --> 00:27:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do anything to Joe when I could've,</v>

1089
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean I should have done a lot better.</v>

1090
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Both guys said I could have finished them and then I just,</v>

1091
00:27:57.811 --> 00:27:58.590
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1092
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.170
<v Speaker 2>I had to just a mental bad marriage.</v>

1093
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:01.411
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

1094
00:28:01.411 --> 00:28:01.651
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1095
00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get into it right now just in a bad place.</v>

1096
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 2>It was a really bad place and it wasn't performing and we are all top level</v>

1097
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:09.384
<v Speaker 2>athletes,</v>

1098
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.460
<v Speaker 2>but I know I'm better than these guys.</v>

1099
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just they were better that night.</v>

1100
00:28:13.231 --> 00:28:14.970
<v Speaker 2>They're better performers at at this point in time.</v>

1101
00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Mentally it's what it comes down to is the mental aspect and you know,</v>

1102
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.330
<v Speaker 2>I'll get back now I'm happy and then I'm finally in a good place.</v>

1103
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:22.500
<v Speaker 2>I think against Joe,</v>

1104
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:23.340
<v Speaker 2>I was getting there,</v>

1105
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.610
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't quite there yet.</v>

1106
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean physically I'll always be there,</v>

1107
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.250
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1108
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's just for me mentally,</v>

1109
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 2>even this last fight I did great,</v>

1110
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:33.871
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1111
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:37.410
<v Speaker 2>But I think I still have steps to get back to where I know I can't be,</v>

1112
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:38.610
<v Speaker 2>like when it became world champion,</v>

1113
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.560
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

1114
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.393
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1115
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.443
<v Speaker 2>it was just better.</v>

1116
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1117
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I was just training harder and longer and faster and everything.</v>

1118
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1119
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 2>now I'm technically better I think,</v>

1120
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:50.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's just getting my head betters is still,</v>

1121
00:28:50.431 --> 00:28:51.211
<v Speaker 2>it's still a process,</v>

1122
00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

1123
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1124
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost there,</v>

1125
00:28:53.221 --> 00:28:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1126
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:54.231
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

1127
00:28:54.231 --> 00:28:56.190
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you're a work in progress?</v>

1128
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1129
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Always.</v>

1130
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Always.</v>

1131
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like all this shit that's happened to you?</v>

1133
00:29:01.311 --> 00:29:02.600
<v Speaker 1>All this craziness in your life,</v>

1134
00:29:02.601 --> 00:29:03.650
<v Speaker 1>the mistakes that you've made,</v>

1135
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:07.700
<v Speaker 1>like in some ways surviving as many mistakes as you have,</v>

1136
00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.940
<v Speaker 1>like really creates a very fascinating person because the type of person has as</v>

1137
00:29:13.011 --> 00:29:14.510
<v Speaker 1>many experiences as you.</v>

1138
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

1139
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:15.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1140
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:15.771
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1141
00:29:15.771 --> 00:29:19.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a magnetic thing to be around cause most people haven't had as many crazy</v>

1142
00:29:19.101 --> 00:29:21.740
<v Speaker 1>fucked up life experiences and have been,</v>

1143
00:29:21.741 --> 00:29:21.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
00:29:21.921 --> 00:29:23.720
<v Speaker 1>professional cage fighters at the same time.</v>

1145
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:24.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1146
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.410
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm trying to do now becoming a better person for once.</v>

1147
00:29:27.411 --> 00:29:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be that better person.</v>

1148
00:29:28.671 --> 00:29:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to just show people like,</v>

1149
00:29:31.641 --> 00:29:32.301
<v Speaker 2>this is what,</v>

1150
00:29:32.301 --> 00:29:33.081
<v Speaker 2>this is what I've done.</v>

1151
00:29:33.081 --> 00:29:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm a walking example of what not to do because most likely you're not going to</v>

1152
00:29:37.251 --> 00:29:38.840
<v Speaker 2>get back to where I am.</v>

1153
00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:39.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1154
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:39.951
<v Speaker 2>almost like a,</v>

1155
00:29:39.951 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 2>you're either going to become just a human being</v>

1156
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.600
<v Speaker 1>or you're going to die,</v>

1157
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1158
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:46.180
<v Speaker 1>like calm down.</v>

1159
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Or you're going to die.</v>

1161
00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And then you figure it out on your own or you're on a bad path.</v>

1163
00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.780
<v Speaker 1>And I think that for some reason I'm,</v>

1164
00:29:52.781 --> 00:29:53.614
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to,</v>

1165
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1166
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I've been able to do to do that and make,</v>

1167
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Speaker 1>get back to greatness and try and do something that no one really ever gets to</v>

1168
00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:01.121
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1169
00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's fight in the octagon.</v>

1170
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:02.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1171
00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:04.360
<v Speaker 1>they're very few percentage of people in the world that actually kept,</v>

1172
00:30:04.361 --> 00:30:05.171
<v Speaker 1>will ever be able to do this.</v>

1173
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1174
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So especially at your weight class man.</v>

1175
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1177
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.170
<v Speaker 1>that's really fucking technical way class.</v>

1178
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 1>That Dj,</v>

1179
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.480
<v Speaker 1>he keeps getting better to everywhere.</v>

1180
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Every time he fights.</v>

1181
00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1182
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:18.700
<v Speaker 1>His uh,</v>

1183
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 1>last fight with Morocco was incredible.</v>

1184
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1185
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.760
<v Speaker 1>He's so good at like changing where the fight takes place,</v>

1186
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.800
<v Speaker 1>whether it's taking you down,</v>

1187
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.450
<v Speaker 1>kicking you and you think he's going to punch you,</v>

1188
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 1>punch you,</v>

1189
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:29.800
<v Speaker 1>is going to kick you.</v>

1190
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.023
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

1191
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 1>he is ever evolving.</v>

1192
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I make fun of him a lot.</v>

1193
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I do because he can't help because yeah,</v>

1194
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:35.471
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1195
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:35.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1196
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:36.101
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1197
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I got a,</v>

1198
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I got a chip on my shoulder because I thought I beat him and then he beat me up</v>

1199
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 1>and plus I think he's a nerd.</v>

1200
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.351
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1201
00:30:41.351 --> 00:30:41.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1202
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:42.850
<v Speaker 1>but he's just such a nice guy.</v>

1203
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:44.010
<v Speaker 1>But something wrong with being a nerd.</v>

1204
00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:44.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1205
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:44.501
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

1206
00:30:44.501 --> 00:30:45.130
<v Speaker 1>aren't being retired.</v>

1207
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I just can't make fun of him because he beat me up on time.</v>

1208
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1209
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Just let me do that.</v>

1210
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.030
<v Speaker 1>But now he,</v>

1211
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.110
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy is,</v>

1212
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 1>he's at first people gave him so much guff because he just wasn't performing.</v>

1213
00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:58.000
<v Speaker 1>But now he's getting better.</v>

1214
00:30:58.001 --> 00:30:58.890
<v Speaker 1>He's getting to the point where he,</v>

1215
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.130
<v Speaker 1>the strides he's making are making it actually exciting and they,</v>

1216
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Speaker 1>the adoring public is actually,</v>

1217
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:03.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1218
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.670
<v Speaker 1>not being such a Douche bags that are learning the sport and realizing that</v>

1219
00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:06.860
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1220
00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.900
<v Speaker 1>that's art right there.</v>

1221
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:08.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1222
00:31:08.441 --> 00:31:08.681
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1223
00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:10.180
<v Speaker 1>he's painting a fucking masterpiece,</v>

1224
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1225
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:11.920
<v Speaker 1>especially compared to these big guys.</v>

1226
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Not to say that anything against big guys,</v>

1227
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:16.810
<v Speaker 1>but we're doing a lot more than they are.</v>

1228
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:17.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:18.010
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1230
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1231
00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a different game.</v>

1232
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:20.330
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1233
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.760
<v Speaker 1>the pace is faster.</v>

1234
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 1>It's more technical.</v>

1235
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.790
<v Speaker 1>There's very little room for error.</v>

1236
00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1237
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1238
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.380
<v Speaker 1>like he called Moraga and that gear team,</v>

1239
00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:28.540
<v Speaker 1>there was no room.</v>

1240
00:31:28.541 --> 00:31:29.374
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

1241
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:30.400
<v Speaker 1>just snatched it up.</v>

1242
00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:31.301
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1243
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:31.631
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1244
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:31.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1245
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:36.450
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of an interesting difference between watching the,</v>

1246
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 1>the smallest way class and watching the largest way cross the room for error.</v>

1247
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

1248
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.400
<v Speaker 1>The guy becomes a lot bigger.</v>

1249
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.263
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1250
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we've never seen a heavyweight that moves like,</v>

1251
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.160
<v Speaker 1>like a flyweight says it.</v>

1252
00:31:48.161 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 1>He says it doesn't exist.</v>

1253
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:50.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1254
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a completely different experience watching the,</v>

1255
00:31:52.841 --> 00:31:53.920
<v Speaker 1>the lighter weight classes.</v>

1256
00:31:53.921 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like you guys are like hummingbirds,</v>

1257
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Speaker 1>you're like a moving at such a faster pace.</v>

1258
00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:58.983
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1259
00:31:59.360 --> 00:31:59.820
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1260
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.200
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

1261
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean even just to fight at that pace.</v>

1262
00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean you gotta be on point because if you're one step behind,</v>

1263
00:32:07.601 --> 00:32:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just a constant pop,</v>

1264
00:32:09.371 --> 00:32:09.551
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

1265
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:09.701
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

1266
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:09.881
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

1267
00:32:09.881 --> 00:32:10.061
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

1268
00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:10.350
<v Speaker 1>pop.</v>

1269
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Just like each kid got caught by my Raga big time that fourth round.</v>

1270
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfect example of that.</v>

1271
00:32:15.671 --> 00:32:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean Dj was not getting hit by anything.</v>

1272
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 1>He was just moving like a ghost.</v>

1273
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:20.830
<v Speaker 1>He was in and out.</v>

1274
00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 1>And when you thought he was coming in,</v>

1275
00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:23.051
<v Speaker 1>he was coming out.</v>

1276
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:23.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1277
00:32:23.221 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it was a beautiful performance.</v>

1278
00:32:24.311 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>

1279
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.111
<v Speaker 1>he hits hard.</v>

1280
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:26.681
<v Speaker 1>He hits hard,</v>

1281
00:32:26.681 --> 00:32:27.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1282
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:27.641
<v Speaker 1>he gets hard.</v>

1283
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:32.140
<v Speaker 1>But even the point is like [inaudible] anytime it can come anytime a big one</v>

1284
00:32:32.141 --> 00:32:32.830
<v Speaker 1>point clip you,</v>

1285
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1286
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the craziest thing about the sport,</v>

1287
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:35.200
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1288
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1289
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.150
<v Speaker 1>This is really nothing like that.</v>

1290
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare and boxing for things to around out of nowhere with one shot.</v>

1291
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen that often.</v>

1292
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Like later,</v>

1293
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:44.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1294
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 1>in a fight when you see it in,</v>

1295
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:47.061
<v Speaker 1>in MMA,</v>

1296
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>that it can happen at any moment with those little gloves.</v>

1297
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:49.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1298
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:50.721
<v Speaker 1>It just slips right through.</v>

1299
00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:50.790
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1300
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I of people really don't get is that defense.</v>

1301
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Even having your defense has to be perfect because those little gloves fit</v>

1302
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:01.340
<v Speaker 1>through the smallest holes and they make,</v>

1303
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:01.880
<v Speaker 1>they make,</v>

1304
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 1>they make those holes bigger.</v>

1305
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:05.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not just like a boxing glove where it's a blunt object that's just going to</v>

1306
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 1>expand and on impact,</v>

1307
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:08.450
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1308
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:11.330
<v Speaker 1>There's much less give the slide through things,</v>

1310
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:12.980
<v Speaker 1>especially in they get all greased up,</v>

1311
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.670
<v Speaker 1>sweaty up like the Todd Duffy,</v>

1312
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Mike Russell fight is a fight that I always point to.</v>

1313
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 1>If you never saw that fight,</v>

1314
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:24.210
<v Speaker 1>if you've never seen that fight is one of like it's a historical MMA fight.</v>

1315
00:33:24.211 --> 00:33:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.150
<v Speaker 1>They played that for young fighters.</v>

1317
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:26.691
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1318
00:33:26.691 --> 00:33:27.710
<v Speaker 1>this is what can happen.</v>

1319
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 1>This guy motherfucker looks like superman,</v>

1320
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:31.064
<v Speaker 1>three rounds,</v>

1321
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.740
<v Speaker 1>three rounds of horrific beating.</v>

1322
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:34.574
<v Speaker 1>Broke his arm.</v>

1323
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1324
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Russell had a broken arm and then at an with no hint whatsoever that that it was</v>

1325
00:33:41.351 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 1>going to take place before this.</v>

1326
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.020
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like he had tagged them a couple of times.</v>

1327
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.910
<v Speaker 1>It looked like he had them stagger it a few times.</v>

1328
00:33:46.911 --> 00:33:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Like he's coming back,</v>

1329
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:53.730
<v Speaker 1>he's getting just destroyed and plus it's Duffy is a physical specimen.</v>

1330
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.190
<v Speaker 1>That guy's huge and and Mike not so much.</v>

1331
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1332
00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Mike is,</v>

1333
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.640
<v Speaker 1>looks like what he has is a Chicago cop.</v>

1334
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Excises a tough fucking guy.</v>

1335
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:03.521
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

1336
00:34:03.521 --> 00:34:04.221
<v Speaker 1>It's super tough.</v>

1337
00:34:04.221 --> 00:34:05.054
<v Speaker 1>Fucking guy.</v>

1338
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.570
<v Speaker 1>But that punch was like one of the quickest turn.</v>

1339
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 1>It was out of nowhere.</v>

1340
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1341
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.730
<v Speaker 1>It turned the whole fight or out bang.</v>

1342
00:34:10.731 --> 00:34:11.450
<v Speaker 1>He had him hurting.</v>

1343
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.781
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

1344
00:34:11.781 --> 00:34:13.940
<v Speaker 1>He was out like what the hell?</v>

1345
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Like how is that even possible?</v>

1346
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:18.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1347
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.580
<v Speaker 1>especially at that weight,</v>

1348
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 1>you know when you have,</v>

1349
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:25.420
<v Speaker 1>when you have two guys that are 250 pounds hitting each other that hard.</v>

1350
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

1351
00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:28.520
<v Speaker 1>that is frightening.</v>

1352
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And I see where the heavy weight,</v>

1353
00:34:31.041 --> 00:34:31.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1354
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:31.881
<v Speaker 1>my roommate,</v>

1355
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:36.881
<v Speaker 1>she ended up Rosario to see him move and he's fast and it hasn't been able to,</v>

1356
00:34:37.191 --> 00:34:37.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1357
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.590
<v Speaker 1>to really show how good he really is.</v>

1358
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.281
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

1359
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:41.300
<v Speaker 1>that guy can move and it's,</v>

1360
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:41.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is,</v>

1361
00:34:41.811 --> 00:34:42.790
<v Speaker 1>it scares the crap out of him.</v>

1362
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:44.000
<v Speaker 1>He can hold pads for me.</v>

1363
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.070
<v Speaker 1>That's how fast he is.</v>

1364
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1365
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:47.653
<v Speaker 1>And I mean I,</v>

1366
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:52.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll go for 30 minutes straight by la La la La la.</v>

1367
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1368
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.680
<v Speaker 1>He moves really well and he's set that weight of heavyweight where there's like</v>

1369
00:34:57.681 --> 00:34:59.180
<v Speaker 1>a point of diminishing returns.</v>

1370
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:01.220
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people believe there's an argument about it.</v>

1371
00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:01.700
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1372
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.100
<v Speaker 1>and that argument is about like two 40 that are like anything bigger than are</v>

1373
00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:06.110
<v Speaker 1>like Cain Velasquez.</v>

1374
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.090
<v Speaker 1>You get tired too easy.</v>

1375
00:35:07.091 --> 00:35:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1376
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:07.950
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1377
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:08.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1378
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.080
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1379
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:09.261
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1380
00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:10.340
<v Speaker 1>but then for a while there,</v>

1381
00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:10.821
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1382
00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 1>people thought it was like when Brock Lesnar like first burst on the scene,</v>

1383
00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:14.571
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

1384
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:15.231
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

1385
00:35:15.231 --> 00:35:16.610
<v Speaker 1>you got to get way bigger mat.</v>

1386
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what frank wait,</v>

1387
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Geiger,</v>

1388
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Shane Carwyn got way bigger.</v>

1389
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Those dudes got way bigger.</v>

1390
00:35:22.011 --> 00:35:22.310
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1391
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:24.340
<v Speaker 1>fuck that dude is,</v>

1392
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.280
<v Speaker 1>that's your game.</v>

1393
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.210
<v Speaker 1>If you're game is,</v>

1394
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1395
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Tuck your face in between your shoulders and plow forward.</v>

1396
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.460
<v Speaker 1>If that's your game and you better be built,</v>

1397
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:32.640
<v Speaker 1>like that guy shines.</v>

1398
00:35:32.641 --> 00:35:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Just hulk smash people.</v>

1399
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1400
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.181
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1401
00:35:35.181 --> 00:35:35.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1402
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.680
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work out so well.</v>

1403
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1404
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 1>It's when you watch a fight like Carwyn versus less than,</v>

1405
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:42.120
<v Speaker 1>which is at an all time classic fight.</v>

1406
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 1>But you see how quick Carlin gasses out,</v>

1407
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 1>like to the point where he's dead.</v>

1408
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like one round within run.</v>

1409
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:48.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>

1410
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:48.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1411
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:49.250
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1412
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I think he said it was also that he was so fired up so much adrenaline.</v>

1413
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:53.310
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't believe.</v>

1414
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.350
<v Speaker 1>He thought he was winning and thought the fight was over.</v>

1415
00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was gonna win the fight right there.</v>

1416
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 1>And he was beating on him for a long time.</v>

1417
00:35:58.501 --> 00:35:58.891
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1418
00:35:58.891 --> 00:35:59.131
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1419
00:35:59.131 --> 00:35:59.360
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1420
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.180
<v Speaker 1>that's going to take,</v>

1421
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 1>not just 10 seconds.</v>

1422
00:36:01.051 --> 00:36:01.751
<v Speaker 1>If I thought I wanted,</v>

1423
00:36:01.751 --> 00:36:02.584
<v Speaker 1>it was</v>

1424
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.321
<v Speaker 1>a couple of minutes of,</v>

1425
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I thought I won.</v>

1426
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.910
<v Speaker 1>And he was sprinting.</v>

1427
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.570
<v Speaker 1>You mean it was two minutes of sprinting and literally after it was over,</v>

1428
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Brock survived that.</v>

1429
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:11.370
<v Speaker 1>He was done.</v>

1430
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Like he couldn't even get up out of his stool.</v>

1431
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like his whole body like completely shut down.</v>

1432
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy to watch.</v>

1433
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1434
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.960
<v Speaker 1>but you will watch a body like that.</v>

1435
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 1>That's when you go,</v>

1436
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.210
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1437
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.110
<v Speaker 1>How big is too big?</v>

1438
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1439
00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Cause that might be too big.</v>

1440
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to,</v>

1441
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.500
<v Speaker 1>someone's got to figure this out.</v>

1442
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Like scientifically.</v>

1443
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1444
00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:27.811
<v Speaker 1>We got to figure it out.</v>

1445
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:28.644
<v Speaker 1>What it's,</v>

1446
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about crossfit,</v>

1447
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.523
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>

1448
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 1>my roommate and he runs RV sport for Ruca and he went to go sponsors guys and</v>

1449
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:36.690
<v Speaker 1>talked to some people and watch it.</v>

1450
00:36:36.691 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 1>And I always thought,</v>

1451
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:38.341
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

1452
00:36:38.341 --> 00:36:39.120
<v Speaker 1>you guys are douchebags.</v>

1453
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1454
00:36:40.141 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I just always hear him yelling and screaming.</v>

1455
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I hate her.</v>

1456
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:42.631
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1457
00:36:42.631 --> 00:36:42.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1458
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:43.040
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

1459
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.771
<v Speaker 1>they're really positive.</v>

1460
00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:44.604
<v Speaker 1>They're cool guys.</v>

1461
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.241
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1462
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:45.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1463
00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1464
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.190
<v Speaker 1>apparently like the perfect way for them.</v>

1465
00:36:47.191 --> 00:36:48.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like one 85,</v>

1466
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:50.070
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds for what they do.</v>

1467
00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:50.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1468
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.533
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1469
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't even really know what they should do a bit way it was Christ.</v>

1470
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just stupid way.</v>

1471
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1472
00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't see stupid like dumb.</v>

1473
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

1474
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:59.190
<v Speaker 1>like Holy Shit.</v>

1475
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:00.181
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this,</v>

1476
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:04.080
<v Speaker 1>a little guy who was like 165 pounds and he was doing cleans with a,</v>

1477
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it was cleans with 120 pound kettle bell.</v>

1478
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 1>He was still,</v>

1479
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 1>he was not a big guy and he's doing this clean press over and over again with</v>

1480
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:13.840
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1481
00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 1>It was more than a hundred pound kettle bell.</v>

1482
00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.141
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

1483
00:37:16.141 --> 00:37:16.951
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck it was.</v>

1484
00:37:16.951 --> 00:37:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1485
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.540
<v Speaker 1>And he was doing it for Reps.</v>

1486
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.991
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1487
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:20.070
<v Speaker 1>this is incredible.</v>

1488
00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:20.943
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

1489
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.013
<v Speaker 1>we've got a 200,</v>

1490
00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.490
<v Speaker 1>we have multiple stones.</v>

1491
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:25.920
<v Speaker 1>We got 125 pounds stone at uh,</v>

1492
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.210
<v Speaker 1>at my strength conditioning place.</v>

1493
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:27.960
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

1494
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.120
<v Speaker 1>roll it up on my legs and I can pop pop.</v>

1496
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:30.931
<v Speaker 1>But it's just a stone.</v>

1497
00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:31.291
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1498
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:31.680
<v Speaker 1>that's something,</v>

1499
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.940
<v Speaker 1>that's where I get my suplexes from.</v>

1500
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:35.310
<v Speaker 1>But I would think it probably would help you a lot,</v>

1501
00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:35.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1502
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:36.271
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I can,</v>

1503
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I can get out the two.</v>

1504
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's two 52 40 I can get that up and do it maybe five times.</v>

1505
00:37:41.191 --> 00:37:41.701
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it's,</v>

1506
00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1507
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.570
<v Speaker 1>it's getting it out onto your lap is the hardest part.</v>

1508
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I can explode probably 400 pounds off my hips.</v>

1509
00:37:47.641 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a professional athlete.</v>

1510
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it fascinating to see like how much things have changed as far as like the</v>

1511
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:54.630
<v Speaker 1>way they train athletes,</v>

1512
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.430
<v Speaker 1>some of the ideas behind it.</v>

1513
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:57.601
<v Speaker 1>If you go back,</v>

1514
00:37:57.601 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a student of the game and you go back just like 2030 years like</v>

1515
00:38:01.891 --> 00:38:04.620
<v Speaker 1>these like Angela Dundee's until fighters and not lift weights.</v>

1516
00:38:04.621 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1517
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.020
<v Speaker 1>They said tell him that a lot.</v>

1518
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.070
<v Speaker 1>A lot of weights and it was going to slow you down.</v>

1519
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1520
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:08.740
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1521
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:08.911
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1522
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:09.330
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't,</v>

1523
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:09.840
<v Speaker 1>they just didn't,</v>

1524
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.470
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

1525
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.980
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know.</v>

1526
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.471
<v Speaker 1>They didn't understand.</v>

1527
00:38:11.471 --> 00:38:11.940
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know.</v>

1528
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Well it does slow you down in that if you lift weights and you're sore the next</v>

1529
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.553
<v Speaker 1>day you're going to be slower.</v>

1530
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.590
<v Speaker 1>And then the coach was like,</v>

1531
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.540
<v Speaker 1>God slowing you down.</v>

1532
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.190
<v Speaker 1>But then Mackey shields stone comes along and trains Evander Holyfield to go up</v>

1533
00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:23.701
<v Speaker 1>to heavyweight.</v>

1534
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1535
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.140
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden heavy.</v>

1536
00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 1>He's like a real heavyweight.</v>

1537
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.340
<v Speaker 1>He was like two oh five or something like that.</v>

1538
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Like not too big,</v>

1539
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.280
<v Speaker 1>but he was big enough and he was,</v>

1540
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.680
<v Speaker 1>he got fucking</v>

1541
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1542
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:38.531
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

1543
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Was He Jack 40 holy film.</v>

1544
00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>How old was he when he went up to heavyweight?</v>

1545
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.280
<v Speaker 2>He started out as a cruiserweight.</v>

1546
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:46.541
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1547
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Cause he fought Dwight Kawai.</v>

1548
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.390
<v Speaker 2>That was like a one 95 right.</v>

1549
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:50.224
<v Speaker 2>That's cruiserweight.</v>

1550
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 2>And then when he went up to heavyweight,</v>

1551
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.940
<v Speaker 2>was it Mackey shields don't work with him?</v>

1552
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:55.271
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>

1553
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1554
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Cause he worked with,</v>

1555
00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 2>he worked with Spinks,</v>

1556
00:38:58.570 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1557
00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1558
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.010
<v Speaker 2>He worked with Michael Spinks when he was bulking Spinks up to be a heavyweight</v>

1559
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:04.690
<v Speaker 2>to fight Tyson and Larry Holmes.</v>

1560
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 2>That was when he burst into the scene.</v>

1561
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 2>He was like one of those first guys that was [inaudible].</v>

1562
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.120
<v Speaker 2>They were realizing back in the day,</v>

1563
00:39:10.121 --> 00:39:12.880
<v Speaker 2>like we got to do things a little different here we can just do curls,</v>

1564
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 2>which yes,</v>

1565
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:15.840
<v Speaker 2>that guys in San Clemente and I,</v>

1566
00:39:15.841 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 2>and I've never had a run in with him,</v>

1567
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.210
<v Speaker 2>but all my friends have and all my coaches,</v>

1568
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

1569
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:19.870
<v Speaker 2>he ate.</v>

1570
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he's just very set in his ways I guess we'll say.</v>

1571
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 2>But I'm in that he was an originator of,</v>

1572
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 2>of so much crazy stuff.</v>

1573
00:39:26.651 --> 00:39:27.484
<v Speaker 2>And we look at the sun.</v>

1574
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean that didn't turn out like it should have.</v>

1575
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Well I was under a tremendous of,</v>

1576
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:33.160
<v Speaker 2>for people who don't know the whole store,</v>

1577
00:39:33.161 --> 00:39:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know his son's name cause I'm not a football fan.</v>

1578
00:39:35.351 --> 00:39:36.184
<v Speaker 2>What does this on the name?</v>

1579
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Todd Todd.</v>

1580
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Todd Todd and uh,</v>

1581
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:44.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a good documentary on it and Marinovich is like a cow racy strength and</v>

1582
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:44.801
<v Speaker 2>fitness guy.</v>

1583
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:47.550
<v Speaker 2>And he's the guy who got Bj Penn in the best shape of his life ever.</v>

1584
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.050
<v Speaker 2>When Bj fan fought Diego Sanchez and when he fought Sean Penn,</v>

1585
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:53.290
<v Speaker 2>I think those are the two times Sean Penn,</v>

1586
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Sean to Shirk Jesus Christ.</v>

1587
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Right after I said it.</v>

1588
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:56.831

<v Speaker 2>He made Joe Stevens and cry.</v>

1598
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.250
<v Speaker 2>He beat a man up so bad that he was crying in the fucking corner.</v>

1599
00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.310

<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1608
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:32.960
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1609
00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.793
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1610
00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:34.630
<v Speaker 2>that makes me feel,</v>

1611
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:35.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1612
00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:35.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1613
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:35.591
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1614
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:36.040

1615
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

1616
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:37.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the path you're on.</v>

1617
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:40.630
<v Speaker 2>You're on the path to excellence and the people fear the scariest,</v>

1618
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.880
<v Speaker 2>most excellent fighters.</v>

1619
00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1620
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no really disguising what's the sports about exactly that.</v>

1621
00:40:45.731 --> 00:40:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Sports about victory.</v>

1622
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.950
<v Speaker 2>It's about beating the other man.</v>

1623
00:40:47.951 --> 00:40:51.700
<v Speaker 2>It's about imposing your martial arts skills and you really can't get great at</v>

1624
00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:53.020
<v Speaker 2>that and not be scary as fuck.</v>

1625
00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:53.950
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the program.</v>

1626
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:57.630
<v Speaker 2>What brings out the most primal urges in us that,</v>

1627
00:40:57.631 --> 00:40:58.464
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

1628
00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

00:40:59.021 --> 00:41:01.870
<v Speaker 2>I want to kill something and eat it with my bare hands.</v>

1630
00:41:01.871 --> 00:41:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to like,</v>

1631
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:02.920

1633
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:05.650

<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1639
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to do that.</v>

1640
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you have that extra bad from growing up small?</v>

1641
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1642
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Cause I always wanted to prove myself.</v>

1643
00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:16.780
<v Speaker 2>My parents,</v>

1644
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.441
<v Speaker 2>especially my mom.</v>

1645
00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:18.400
<v Speaker 2>I think my dad really cared,</v>

1646
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.533
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1647

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1649
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1650
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I could do it.</v>

1651
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:25.510
<v Speaker 2>My mom wanted to show everybody else that I do every single sport and you're</v>

1652
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:26.080
<v Speaker 2>good at it.</v>

1653
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1654
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Cause I was,</v>

1655
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.181
<v Speaker 2>I was good at everything.</v>

1656
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:28.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1657
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 2>how much did you weigh when you were in high school?</v>

1658
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I wrestled one oh three one oh three one 12 one 19.</v>

1659
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 2>But I got into high school at a hundred pounds.</v>

1660
00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1661
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:37.581
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>

1662
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing Kung Fu San Suu my whole life by the black belt in that which</v>

1667
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

1668
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I was his protege and he's like,</v>

1669
00:41:48.591 --> 00:41:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to teach you things that I don't teach other kids.</v>

1670
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:51.981
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1671
00:41:51.981 --> 00:41:53.840
<v Speaker 2>You have this red zone around you.</v>

1672
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.411
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1673
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:55.610
<v Speaker 2>If they would get in within arm's length,</v>

1674
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:56.900

1676
00:41:59.310 --> 00:41:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

1677
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:00.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1678
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 2>in a threatening manner and I got,</v>

1679
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:02.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1680
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.010
<v Speaker 2>I would punch kids in the throat,</v>

1681
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 2>elbows,</v>

1682
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:05.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1683
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I would love that.</v>

1684
00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I learned arm,</v>

1685
00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:06.460
<v Speaker 2>arm,</v>

1686
00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.880
<v Speaker 2>armbar kind of stuff back then,</v>

1687
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.520
<v Speaker 2>kick jump kits in the face or the groin.</v>

1688
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Like I got kicked out of all of the best private schools.</v>

1689
00:42:12.591 --> 00:42:16.370
<v Speaker 2>So it was always people fucking with you and you defending yourself against</v>

1690
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.740
<v Speaker 2>assholes or it was you being an asshole sometimes.</v>

1691
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.330
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the time it started out as me wanting to beat up the bullies.</v>

1692
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.190
<v Speaker 2>That's how it turned into me being like,</v>

1693
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:25.461
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1694
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Fuck those guys.</v>

1695
00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I want to beat up every bully I see.</v>

1696
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.301
<v Speaker 2>And I did it,</v>

1697
00:42:29.301 --> 00:42:29.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1698
00:42:29.481 --> 00:42:32.900
<v Speaker 2>like I got kicked out of what my high school one year for beating up some Cholo</v>

1699
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.640
<v Speaker 2>for picking on my friends,</v>

1700
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:35.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1701
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.143
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1702
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.040
<v Speaker 2>mentally handicapped cousin with down syndrome and I might beat the shit out of</v>

1703
00:42:40.041 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1704
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.610
<v Speaker 2>What kind of a world is it where you get in trouble for that and well,</v>

1705
00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 2>what happened was I beat him up and then I felt someone grab me.</v>

1706
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.760
<v Speaker 2>So of course I thought it wasn't one of his friends and I turned around and like</v>

1707
00:42:49.761 --> 00:42:51.980
<v Speaker 2>swept the person on the ground and it was one of the proctors,</v>

1708
00:42:51.981 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 2>one of the female proctors and then,</v>

1709
00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.830
<v Speaker 2>oh and I ran away.</v>

1710
00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.780
<v Speaker 2>He swept her and it's just,</v>

1711
00:42:56.781 --> 00:42:56.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1712
00:42:56.961 --> 00:42:58.610
<v Speaker 2>just kind of to kids style,</v>

1713
00:42:58.611 --> 00:42:59.430
<v Speaker 2>sweep the leg.</v>

1714
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1715
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 2>It just turned around and like,</v>

1716
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.090
<v Speaker 2>cause I,</v>

1717
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:02.871
<v Speaker 2>she grabbed me from,</v>

1718
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:03.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1719
00:43:03.021 --> 00:43:03.910
<v Speaker 2>one side and I put my,</v>

1720
00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Speaker 2>my arm out on the chest and just swept the leg and just so dangerous to grab</v>

1721
00:43:07.341 --> 00:43:08.300
<v Speaker 2>someone in the middle of a fight.</v>

1722
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And she probably wouldn't even think that because it's probably not a violent</v>

1723
00:43:10.581 --> 00:43:11.120
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1724
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1725
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:12.050
<v Speaker 2>she was super nice.</v>

1726
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.181
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1727
00:43:12.181 --> 00:43:12.770
<v Speaker 2>she just,</v>

1728
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.270
<v Speaker 2>I had to be pulled out of school.</v>

1729
00:43:14.271 --> 00:43:16.820
<v Speaker 2>My coach pulled me out of school three out of the four years from freshman,</v>

1730
00:43:16.821 --> 00:43:17.301
<v Speaker 2>sophomore,</v>

1731
00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:21.370
<v Speaker 2>junior year because after wrestling season I would just la.</v>

1732
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.440
<v Speaker 2>So you needed the discipline of wrestling to keep you in check?</v>

1733
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1734
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.531
<v Speaker 2>That's the only that,</v>

1735
00:43:25.531 --> 00:43:25.731
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1736
00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:30.350
<v Speaker 2>that I owe my life to have to have a small group of people and Reza,</v>

1737
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:30.591
<v Speaker 2>Betty,</v>

1738
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:31.970
<v Speaker 2>my old wrestling coach was one of them that,</v>

1739
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean that guy saved me.</v>

1740
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:33.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1741
00:43:33.831 --> 00:43:34.610
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1742
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing thing.</v>

1743
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:41.051
<v Speaker 2>How many people have been saved by the diversity there comes from something like</v>

1744
00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:41.500
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1745
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.870
<v Speaker 2>whether it's boxing or MMA or wrestling or</v>

1746
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:45.660
<v Speaker 1>she gets,</v>

1747
00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.830
<v Speaker 1>for me it was taekwondo.</v>

1748
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.600
<v Speaker 1>You just knew I needed something.</v>

1749
00:43:48.601 --> 00:43:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I needed some,</v>

1750
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.730
<v Speaker 1>some form of discipline,</v>

1751
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:51.990
<v Speaker 1>something that can,</v>

1752
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I can like enjoy and I can attack it and I can get really good at it and it</v>

1753
00:43:57.121 --> 00:44:00.480
<v Speaker 1>gives me a calmness because most boys,</v>

1754
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.600
<v Speaker 1>like people who are not boys don't remember it.</v>

1755
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess when they get older or they forget because they have problems with their</v>

1756
00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:07.891
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>

1757
00:44:07.891 --> 00:44:08.724
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to deal with it.</v>

1758
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.660
<v Speaker 1>When you're like 15,</v>

1759
00:44:09.661 --> 00:44:10.411
<v Speaker 1>16 years old,</v>

1760
00:44:10.411 --> 00:44:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking crazy.</v>

1761
00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.370
<v Speaker 1>You're body's bouncing around,</v>

1762
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.260
<v Speaker 1>hormones are flying through your system,</v>

1763
00:44:16.261 --> 00:44:17.260
<v Speaker 1>you're walking around,</v>

1764
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:23.310
<v Speaker 1>your dick is hard all the time and you're crazy and you're basically almost a</v>

1765
00:44:23.311 --> 00:44:23.800
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1766
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:23.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1767
00:44:23.971 --> 00:44:24.810
<v Speaker 1>And you're like thinking,</v>

1768
00:44:24.811 --> 00:44:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of fucking almost a mat.</v>

1769
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And that was how beating up guys that were in college.</v>

1770
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:29.431
<v Speaker 1>So I was,</v>

1771
00:44:29.431 --> 00:44:29.791
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1772
00:44:29.791 --> 00:44:30.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1773
00:44:30.061 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was fucking super cool.</v>

1774
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I was out stealing my dad's super as which we built in a built supra or quarter.</v>

1775
00:44:36.101 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 2>There were cars and they would steal those and he knows or whatever.</v>

1776
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1777
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1778
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I was living,</v>

1779
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:42.390
<v Speaker 2>living in South Orange County and just,</v>

1781
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.520
<v Speaker 2>just getting away with whatever I wanted.</v>

1782
00:44:44.521 --> 00:44:44.941
<v Speaker 2>My parents,</v>

1783
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 2>I was too fast for them,</v>

1784
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:46.201
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1785
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:46.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1786
00:44:46.441 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1787
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:48.030
<v Speaker 2>and they were going through their own stuff,</v>

1788
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:48.600
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1789
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.381
<v Speaker 2>So of course,</v>

1790
00:44:49.381 --> 00:44:49.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1791
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 2>like I just was off on my own,</v>

1792
00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:52.470
<v Speaker 2>just being crazy.</v>

1793
00:44:52.471 --> 00:44:52.591
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1794
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:52.771
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1795
00:44:52.771 --> 00:44:55.020
<v Speaker 2>I started smoking weed when I was eight years old.</v>

1796
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:56.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a good to know.</v>

1797
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Start.</v>

1798
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:57.091
<v Speaker 2>So he was,</v>

1799
00:44:57.091 --> 00:44:57.271
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1800
00:44:57.271 --> 00:44:58.280
<v Speaker 2>it's not sex.</v>

1801
00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.493
<v Speaker 2>That's an eight.</v>

1802
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.353
<v Speaker 2>Sounded good.</v>

1803
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.780
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't like it was a bad influence,</v>

1804
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:02.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1805
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.571
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

1806
00:45:02.571 --> 00:45:03.160
<v Speaker 2>it just happened.</v>

1807
00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.670
<v Speaker 2>And I mean crazy.</v>

1808
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1809
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:07.890
<v Speaker 2>you're smoking weed.</v>

1810
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:08.851
<v Speaker 2>God Damn,</v>

1811
00:45:08.851 --> 00:45:09.620
<v Speaker 2>that's so crazy.</v>

1812
00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:10.411
<v Speaker 2>They go to school and kids,</v>

1813
00:45:10.411 --> 00:45:10.681
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

1814
00:45:10.681 --> 00:45:11.131
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1815
00:45:11.131 --> 00:45:12.330
<v Speaker 2>my dad let me have a sip of beer.</v>

1816
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:12.900
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1817
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I drink a 40 and took four foot bong rips all weekend.</v>

1818
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:16.320
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1819
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.153
<v Speaker 2>how old were you?</v>

1820
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1821
00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:17.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1822
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.560
<v Speaker 2>going through like middle school or whatever,</v>

1823
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:21.480
<v Speaker 2>and kids just didn't understand.</v>

1824
00:45:21.481 --> 00:45:21.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1825
00:45:21.611 --> 00:45:22.880
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a private school and I wouldn't,</v>

1826
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:23.783
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

1827
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:24.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1828
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I was always,</v>

1829
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:25.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1830
00:45:25.051 --> 00:45:25.251
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

1831
00:45:25.251 --> 00:45:25.830
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

1832
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 2>you don't talk about stuff like that,</v>

1833
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:28.040
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

1834
00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:28.873
<v Speaker 2>you don't wanna get in trouble.</v>

1835
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1836
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:30.390
<v Speaker 2>So of course I always kept my mouth shut,</v>

1837
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1838
00:45:31.681 --> 00:45:32.400
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1839
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I was a degenerate at a young age,</v>

1840
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:34.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1841
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:34.711
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

1842
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:36.150
<v Speaker 2>it was just in me to just,</v>

1843
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be the bad guy.</v>

1844
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to have that fun.</v>

1845
00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.131
<v Speaker 1>And where,</v>

1846
00:45:39.131 --> 00:45:41.470
<v Speaker 1>where do you think that came from then when you think about it now,</v>

1847
00:45:41.471 --> 00:45:44.450
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to be a calm guy and you have a kid and your,</v>

1848
00:45:44.451 --> 00:45:46.750
<v Speaker 1>your triggers on track and you're like,</v>

1849
00:45:46.751 --> 00:45:48.940
<v Speaker 1>you reflect back to like your wildest shit.</v>

1850
00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Like what makes you think had,</v>

1851
00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:50.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1852
00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I had a great upbringing.</v>

1853
00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:52.693
<v Speaker 1>Literally,</v>

1854
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I did this all to myself,</v>

1855
00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:55.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1856
00:45:55.421 --> 00:45:57.010
<v Speaker 1>My parents are awesome people.</v>

1857
00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.150
<v Speaker 1>The sure they went through a divorce,</v>

1858
00:45:58.151 --> 00:45:58.570
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

1859
00:45:58.570 --> 00:45:59.410
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't turn.</v>

1860
00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Let me stop you right there because I think it's really difficult to understand</v>

1861
00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.700
<v Speaker 1>or underestimate the negative impact of being bullied can have on a person.</v>

1862
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1863
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.410
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1864
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:11.530
<v Speaker 1>it's huge.</v>

1865
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:12.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1866
00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:13.680
<v Speaker 1>and people say like that it's,</v>

1867
00:46:13.681 --> 00:46:17.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not like being molested or abused.</v>

1868
00:46:17.231 --> 00:46:18.340
<v Speaker 1>And I say bullshit.</v>

1869
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I say it's probably pretty close to a lot of guys.</v>

1870
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1871
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.550
<v Speaker 1>For,</v>

1872
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:21.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1873
00:46:21.851 --> 00:46:22.331
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1874
00:46:22.331 --> 00:46:25.840
<v Speaker 1>it's might not be the physical humiliation of someone's forcing you to have sex,</v>

1875
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:26.671
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1876
00:46:26.671 --> 00:46:30.430
<v Speaker 1>the physical intimidation aspect of it is terrifying.</v>

1877
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>

1878
00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.970
<v Speaker 1>it changes your perception of reality when you're around that person.</v>

1879
00:46:33.971 --> 00:46:34.151
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1880
00:46:34.151 --> 00:46:35.320
<v Speaker 1>there's constant danger.</v>

1881
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.460
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get swatted,</v>

1882
00:46:36.461 --> 00:46:37.390
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get pushed,</v>

1883
00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get compromised.</v>

1884
00:46:38.771 --> 00:46:39.521
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible,</v>

1885
00:46:39.521 --> 00:46:40.354
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing.</v>

1886
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And it can fuck with people and it can turn people into depressed people who</v>

1887
00:46:44.831 --> 00:46:46.570
<v Speaker 1>want to kill themselves because of that,</v>

1888
00:46:46.571 --> 00:46:49.060
<v Speaker 1>because they can't take the pain anymore and it,</v>

1889
00:46:49.061 --> 00:46:50.620
<v Speaker 1>and people don't realize it when they're doing it.</v>

1890
00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

1891
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:51.821
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1892
00:46:51.821 --> 00:46:52.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1893
00:46:52.061 --> 00:46:53.910
<v Speaker 1>they're probably bullied at home or you know,</v>

1894
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.660
<v Speaker 1>someone bullied them and you know,</v>

1895
00:46:55.661 --> 00:46:57.790
<v Speaker 1>they're insecure or they're beaten or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1896
00:46:57.791 --> 00:47:00.490
<v Speaker 1>So they go to school and they just conked out on some little kid.</v>

1897
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1898
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:01.391
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

1899
00:47:01.391 --> 00:47:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1900
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it have devastating impacts.</v>

1901
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1902
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:04.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1903
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:05.321
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1904
00:47:05.321 --> 00:47:05.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1905
00:47:05.511 --> 00:47:07.250
<v Speaker 2>you just see it in high school and then what I would,</v>

1906
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I always did it in high school was I would pick on the bullies or pick on the</v>

1907
00:47:09.851 --> 00:47:10.684
<v Speaker 2>cool kids because,</v>

1908
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.501
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1909
00:47:11.501 --> 00:47:11.611
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1910
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:12.970
<v Speaker 2>the class president types,</v>

1911
00:47:12.971 --> 00:47:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1912
00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:13.900
<v Speaker 2>I would just like,</v>

1913
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I just like talking shit to,</v>

1914
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:15.461
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

1915
00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:16.294
<v Speaker 2>it was fun.</v>

1916
00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:16.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1917
00:47:16.691 --> 00:47:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I had always had a big mouth.</v>

1918
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:21.520
<v Speaker 2>I got pretty lucky with not getting the fuck beat.</v>

1919
00:47:21.521 --> 00:47:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1920
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:22.543
<v Speaker 2>I mean high school.</v>

1921
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1922
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.440
<v Speaker 2>we'll see.</v>

1923
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 2>The only time I ever got really beat up I think in street fights was cause I was</v>

1924
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.651
<v Speaker 2>at picking my battles.</v>

1925
00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1926
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1927
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I know I can beat that guy up.</v>

1928
00:47:31.691 --> 00:47:32.261
<v Speaker 1>I'm just small,</v>

1929
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:32.501
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1930
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:32.900
<v Speaker 1>But like I,</v>

1931
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I would always try and test it,</v>

1932
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:34.841
<v Speaker 1>but I got,</v>

1933
00:47:34.841 --> 00:47:34.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1934
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:35.860
<v Speaker 1>we used to go as groups,</v>

1935
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:36.521
<v Speaker 1>me and my friends,</v>

1936
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:38.800
<v Speaker 1>we would go beat up a bunch of skinheads in the next neighboring town.</v>

1937
00:47:38.801 --> 00:47:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Like all the time I got booted and you know,</v>

1938
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:41.481
<v Speaker 1>booty boy,</v>

1939
00:47:41.481 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 1>those guys twice at del Taco and once at a house party.</v>

1940
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:45.671
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1941
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1942
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:46.691
<v Speaker 1>you get beat up.</v>

1943
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I get beat up on national TV now and it's not that bad.</v>

1944
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 1>But I mean when you're getting beat up,</v>

1945
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:52.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1946
00:47:52.241 --> 00:47:54.620
<v Speaker 1>especially as a kid getting beat up by,</v>

1947
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:55.771
<v Speaker 1>by a bully,</v>

1948
00:47:55.771 --> 00:47:57.540
<v Speaker 1>by someone in front of other people and that,</v>

1949
00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:58.560
<v Speaker 1>that like Chamilian.</v>

1950
00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.561
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

1951
00:47:59.561 --> 00:48:02.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I would always try and stick up for the kids getting,</v>

1952
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:03.723
<v Speaker 1>getting bullied.</v>

1953
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's also at a time in your life when you're the most vulnerable.</v>

1954
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.850
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard for you to really understand what's going on in life.</v>

1955
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1956
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:13.900
<v Speaker 1>people make a lot of terrible mistakes at those young ages.</v>

1957
00:48:13.901 --> 00:48:16.270
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of them is actually being a bully.</v>

1958
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1959
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1960
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1961
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.161
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1962
00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:18.750
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1963
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:21.580
<v Speaker 1>that kind of Karma like pushing out in that direction.</v>

1964
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:22.830
<v Speaker 1>You're a 10 year old asshole.</v>

1965
00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1966
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I want to punch you in the face.</v>

1967
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1968
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I started getting into martial arts just because I was scared.</v>

1969
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted people to be scared of me.</v>

1970
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

1971
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do anything.</v>

1972
00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't,</v>

1973
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:32.970
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to start fights.</v>

1974
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted everybody to be scared of me.</v>

1975
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I want it.</v>

1976
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be Wolverine.</v>

1977
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:36.874
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1978
00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.553
<v Speaker 1>you've got the look.</v>

1979
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:40.023
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1980
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.661
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1981
00:48:40.661 --> 00:48:41.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1982
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:41.801
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing,</v>

1983
00:48:41.801 --> 00:48:42.401
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1984
00:48:42.401 --> 00:48:47.401
<v Speaker 1>the interesting aspect of it is that I'm a huge MMA fan and I don't think you</v>

1985
00:48:48.281 --> 00:48:50.020
<v Speaker 1>have MMA if you don't have bullies.</v>

1986
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.950
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

1987
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:52.090
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of fucked up.</v>

1988
00:48:52.091 --> 00:48:53.140
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things,</v>

1989
00:48:53.141 --> 00:48:53.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1990
00:48:53.291 --> 00:48:54.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not everybody,</v>

1991
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.540
<v Speaker 1>but God damn,</v>

1992
00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:57.040
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them have been bullied.</v>

1993
00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:57.221
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1994
00:48:57.221 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Jon Jones had been bullied,</v>

1995
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that Jon Jones has a bigger brother and they used to go at it in</v>

1996
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:03.040
<v Speaker 1>the house all the time.</v>

1997
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:03.981
<v Speaker 1>So like that's,</v>

1998
00:49:03.981 --> 00:49:06.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not bullied because it's not dangerous.</v>

1999
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like your brother,</v>

2000
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:09.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's still like you got to fight all the time.</v>

2001
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh my brother used to beat the crap out of me.</v>

2002
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:12.910
<v Speaker 1>My oldest brother Tom,</v>

2003
00:49:12.911 --> 00:49:13.840
<v Speaker 1>he was kind of a Dick.</v>

2004
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:14.081
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

2005
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:14.291
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2006
00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:15.124
<v Speaker 1>he was a bully.</v>

2007
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.521
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>

2008
00:49:15.521 --> 00:49:15.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2009
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:16.810
<v Speaker 1>he's like 15 years older than me.</v>

2010
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:17.801
<v Speaker 1>My brother Brad,</v>

2011
00:49:17.801 --> 00:49:20.260
<v Speaker 1>who fought professionally before there was anything,</v>

2012
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:20.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2013
00:49:20.381 --> 00:49:20.831
<v Speaker 1>like I told you,</v>

2014
00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:24.580
<v Speaker 1>you funny fan and stuff and he was five [inaudible] five and one or six in one.</v>

2015
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:29.040
<v Speaker 1>You said we trained a 10th planet chain with Eddie at 10th and you attend a,</v>

2016
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:32.110
<v Speaker 1>but we know we were at next generation and our,</v>

2017
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.520
<v Speaker 1>when we would get mad at each other,</v>

2018
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean we can be at the gym and I'm sure he,</v>

2019
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:36.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2020
00:49:36.311 --> 00:49:38.380
<v Speaker 1>he never probably really let me have it,</v>

2021
00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:40.570
<v Speaker 1>but he used to beat the crap out of me and that was,</v>

2022
00:49:40.571 --> 00:49:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I was 15 getting beat up by grown men by the CRISPR and the Adam Lindsay and my</v>

2023
00:49:45.341 --> 00:49:46.600
<v Speaker 1>brother Jeremy.</v>

2024
00:49:46.601 --> 00:49:47.880
<v Speaker 1>It's sucked,</v>

2025
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:48.221
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2026
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:49.540
<v Speaker 1>But that fucking sucks.</v>

2027
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:49.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2028
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:50.171
<v Speaker 1>it was horrible.</v>

2029
00:49:50.171 --> 00:49:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

2030
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2031
00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 1>but it made me the fighter I am now.</v>

2032
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:52.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2033
00:49:52.991 --> 00:49:53.770
<v Speaker 1>But that's almost,</v>

2034
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2035
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean not encouraging bullies in any stretch of the imagination,</v>

2036
00:49:56.561 --> 00:50:00.310
<v Speaker 1>but George St Pierre was bullied the greatest fighter of all time because one of</v>

2037
00:50:00.311 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the all time greats.</v>

2038
00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:01.451
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2039
00:50:01.451 --> 00:50:01.810
<v Speaker 1>by far,</v>

2040
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about Anderson Silva,</v>

2041
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.810
<v Speaker 1>but I would like to know,</v>

2042
00:50:04.811 --> 00:50:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to wonder whether the voice like that,</v>

2043
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2044
00:50:08.001 --> 00:50:10.750
<v Speaker 1>he for sure was in a dangerous area growing up.</v>

2045
00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2046
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.700

2047
00:50:12.701 --> 00:50:13.534
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2048
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:14.051
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

2049
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:16.540
<v Speaker 1>just like watching those old fights and those guys,</v>

2050
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.901

2051
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:18.760
<v Speaker 1>the box guys would all come in like a gang.</v>

2052
00:50:18.761 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2053
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.790
<v Speaker 1>they were the mother fuckers.</v>

2054
00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean fighting in like backyards.</v>

2055

2059
00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.340

2060
00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:32.400
<v Speaker 1>like you look at the,</v>

2061
00:50:32.401 --> 00:50:37.401
<v Speaker 1>the early days of pride and you see like Vandelay and Shogun and Ninja like God</v>

2062
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:39.141
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

2063
00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:40.970

2068
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 1>They were pretty open about it back then.</v>

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:52.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>

2070

2085
00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:21.380
<v Speaker 1>as it was because they put together shit that no one would ever sanction.</v>

2086
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Like a Toro versus Bob Sapp.</v>

00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:39.790

2138
00:52:39.791 --> 00:52:42.320
<v Speaker 1>He became like a real power puncher after awhile,</v>

2139
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:43.280
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

00:52:43.611 --> 00:52:43.791
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2143
00:52:43.791 --> 00:52:46.430
<v Speaker 1>rampage can still knock out anyone in the world.</v>

2144
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.800
<v Speaker 1>If he catches anyone in the world,</v>

2145
00:52:48.801 --> 00:52:49.341
<v Speaker 1>they're fucks.</v>

2146
00:52:49.341 --> 00:52:50.000
<v Speaker 1>We're going asleep.</v>

2147
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.390
<v Speaker 1>He has answered hammers.</v>

2148
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 1>That right hook that he had chocolate dealt with.</v>

2149
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that day hunch.</v>

2150
00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:56.660
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

2151
00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:00.710
<v Speaker 1>he ducked chuck through a laughed and he came over the top of the right,</v>

2152
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.300
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it was,</v>

2153
00:53:02.301 --> 00:53:04.310
<v Speaker 1>I think Chuck was pawn with his jab.</v>

2154
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:05.930
<v Speaker 1>May Be he's trying to set up the right,</v>

2155
00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:06.950
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

2156
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Rampage hit him with either,</v>

2157
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a counter right hook.</v>

2158
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 1>They the end of they were circling,</v>

2159
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I can see the camera.</v>

2160
00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You're now bear barely remember Chuck's one of my best friends.</v>

2161
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:19.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's the [inaudible] membrane,</v>

2162
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:20.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2163
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:23.340
<v Speaker 1>but see I think there are circling left and then of course you know [inaudible]</v>

2164
00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:24.270
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2165
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 1>He threw that right and just boom.</v>

2166
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.210
<v Speaker 1>That was rampage had that ridiculous one punch power that Vandelay fights.</v>

2167
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Another example.</v>

2168
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:35.130
<v Speaker 1>God Damn he uncorked that left took on the button.</v>

2169
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:35.993
<v Speaker 1>You're going nine night.</v>

2170
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had ever done,</v>

2171
00:53:37.171 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean cro,</v>

2172
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:41.980
<v Speaker 1>cop t he hit him a gang at times for 40 flatline dumb.</v>

2173
00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:46.590
<v Speaker 1>He was a lighting Vandelay up in that fight because the first time they fought</v>

2174
00:53:46.591 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 1>it was an incredible fight.</v>

2175
00:53:47.671 --> 00:53:50.580
<v Speaker 1>But Cro cop just really wasn't good on the ground yet.</v>

2176
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.810
<v Speaker 1>He has takedown defense.</v>

2177
00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Was He there?</v>

2178
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>

2179
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:53.903
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>

2180
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.130
<v Speaker 1>And they had a strange rules fight.</v>

2181
00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like you can only see on the ground for a little bit of time.</v>

2182
00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:00.300
<v Speaker 1>There's like a minute or something.</v>

2183
00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Just like short periods,</v>

2184
00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:01.951
<v Speaker 1>some short period.</v>

2185
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:04.620
<v Speaker 1>So Cro cop would just lock them up in a guard.</v>

2186
00:54:04.621 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2187
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And try to hang on.</v>

2188
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what rules they had.</v>

2189
00:54:07.421 --> 00:54:08.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird rule thing.</v>

2190
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:09.443
<v Speaker 1>It was private.</v>

2191
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:14.470
<v Speaker 1>But then in the second fight cro cop had had a few MMA fights and he got his</v>

2192
00:54:14.581 --> 00:54:17.160
<v Speaker 1>timing down and that was when cro cop was cro cop man.</v>

2193
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.233
<v Speaker 1>He was Scott.</v>

2194
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 1>That was a scary man.</v>

2195
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean he is again,</v>

2196
00:54:20.431 --> 00:54:25.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the scariest tools to ever exist ever an MMA that he knocked out multiple</v>

2197
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:26.160
<v Speaker 1>people with.</v>

2198
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And you did.</v>

2199
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:30.570
<v Speaker 1>The thing about cro cop is I feel like UFC fans,</v>

2200
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:34.140
<v Speaker 1>again don't appreciate the majesty of that was cro.</v>

2201
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Cop now has prime,</v>

2202
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:38.070
<v Speaker 1>we got 'em after a long career,</v>

2203
00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:42.690
<v Speaker 1>a hard career against fatal or and against Josh Barnett.</v>

2204
00:54:42.691 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean he fought some battles.</v>

2205
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.460
<v Speaker 1>So when by the time we got them in the UFC,</v>

2206
00:54:47.461 --> 00:54:49.380
<v Speaker 1>he had been in quite a few like real,</v>

2207
00:54:49.381 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 1>real world.</v>

2208
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And think of all of the heavyweight kickboxing fights it yet.</v>

2209
00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2210
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:53.251
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2211
00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:53.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2212
00:54:53.371 --> 00:54:55.560
<v Speaker 1>He fought a lot of k one fights against the top guys.</v>

2213
00:54:55.561 --> 00:54:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2214
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.761
<v Speaker 1>high level,</v>

2215
00:54:56.761 --> 00:55:01.560
<v Speaker 1>high level guys that Mark Hunt fight so I can elastic one man classic.</v>

2216
00:55:01.561 --> 00:55:03.090
<v Speaker 1>They had some wars in in,</v>

2217
00:55:03.091 --> 00:55:04.080
<v Speaker 1>in k one man.</v>

2218
00:55:04.081 --> 00:55:04.890
<v Speaker 1>People had,</v>

2219
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a in the mix with some of the best fighters in the world over</v>

2220
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:08.130
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2243
00:55:32.641 --> 00:55:33.121
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy,</v>

2244
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:36.630
<v Speaker 1>but I mean double the size and almost the same amount of flights.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He had some great fucking k one fights too,</v>

2256
00:55:56.371 --> 00:55:56.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really Fun King.</v>

2258
00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:58.261
<v Speaker 1>He see,</v>

2259
00:55:58.261 --> 00:56:01.950
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the best guys to come over even though he wasn't one of the best k</v>

2260
00:56:01.951 --> 00:56:02.551
<v Speaker 1>one guys.</v>

2261
00:56:02.551 --> 00:56:04.050
<v Speaker 1>He was like just below the,</v>

2262
00:56:04.051 --> 00:56:05.010
<v Speaker 1>the elite of the elite.</v>

2263
00:56:05.011 --> 00:56:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't just below like the Grand Prix winners.</v>

2264
00:56:07.531 --> 00:56:07.951
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2265
00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Before he did win a ground pre recently.</v>

2266
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2267
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:10.860
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2268
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.641
<v Speaker 1>There was in a,</v>

2269
00:56:11.641 --> 00:56:13.230
<v Speaker 1>it was the big European men or something,</v>

2270
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:14.371
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2271
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:14.581
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

2272
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

2273
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out and give him the credit he deserves.</v>

2274
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:17.430
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2275
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:18.061
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

2276
00:56:18.061 --> 00:56:18.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2277
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.890
<v Speaker 1>when he came over he was,</v>

2278
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 1>he had the one thing that a lot of people didn't have ridiculous speed and</v>

2279
00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:26.080
<v Speaker 1>explosion and he had like,</v>

2280
00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I think he had a karate background,</v>

2281
00:56:27.521 --> 00:56:28.354
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2282
00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2283
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:31.130
<v Speaker 1>When we first started it,</v>

2284
00:56:31.131 --> 00:56:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you started like,</v>

2285
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.153
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that was a long,</v>

2286
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:33.790
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>

2287
00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:36.610
<v Speaker 1>John Claude van Damme movies or something like that and learn how to kick that</v>

2288
00:56:36.611 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 1>way and then got something crazy like that,</v>

2289
00:56:38.801 --> 00:56:39.634
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

2290
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that's like how it got started.</v>

2291
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I think he liked,</v>

2292
00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 1>it was a John Claude van Damme fan and I know karate from that,</v>

2293
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 1>but his fucking kicks are so unusual.</v>

2294
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Like angle.</v>

2295
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh speed.</v>

2296
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:55.960
<v Speaker 1>The speed is ridiculous and he's got horse legs.</v>

2297
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Like those things are huge.</v>

2298
00:56:56.951 --> 00:56:58.030
<v Speaker 1>So of course those,</v>

2299
00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:58.601
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

2300
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:00.970
<v Speaker 1>those kicking you in the face is going to not feel good.</v>

2301
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 1>And he again,</v>

2302
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like he had that weight.</v>

2303
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.571
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2304
00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:04.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2305
00:57:04.901 --> 00:57:05.830
<v Speaker 1>to 30th,</v>

2306
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:10.920
<v Speaker 1>two 28 he said yeah to 28 is what he like the average that he weighed when he</v>

2307
00:57:11.051 --> 00:57:16.051
<v Speaker 1>was in his prime and it was just scary fast when knocked out Bob Sapp Zap was</v>

2308
00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:19.990
<v Speaker 1>three fucking 70 and Mirko Cro cop.</v>

2309
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 1>No he right handed or left handed.</v>

2310
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm a straight left to the eye socket.</v>

2311
00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.211
<v Speaker 1>Remember on broke.</v>

2312
00:57:24.211 --> 00:57:24.671
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>

2313
00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:25.850
<v Speaker 1>And then yeah,</v>

2314
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:27.190
<v Speaker 1>he broke his eye socket bone.</v>

2315
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I think he kicked him before that.</v>

2316
00:57:29.391 --> 00:57:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2317
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean I remember I kick to the body,</v>

2318
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 1>see if you can find that,</v>

2319
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:35.680
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find a cro cop versus Bob Sapp.</v>

2320
00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause that was one of cro cop's best fights.</v>

2321
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.141
<v Speaker 1>And he was a,</v>

2322
00:57:38.141 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 1>it was a kickboxing fight too.</v>

2323
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:40.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2324
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:44.540
<v Speaker 1>that was back when this was a guy Bob Sapp who had beaten Ernesto,</v>

2325
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.820
<v Speaker 1>who's too most people think was the greatest ever or one of the top 10 guys</v>

2326
00:57:48.821 --> 00:57:49.091
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2327
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:49.500
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

2328
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2329
00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say the greatest ever,</v>

2330
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:52.150
<v Speaker 1>like even Dutch guy say,</v>

2331
00:57:52.151 --> 00:57:57.151
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of between him when he's in his prime or like a rob came in or uh,</v>

2332
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:02.980
<v Speaker 1>or of course Ramon Dekkers deckers gets the most credit because he fought the</v>

2333
00:58:02.981 --> 00:58:03.221
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>

2334
00:58:03.221 --> 00:58:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>

2335
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I read that [inaudible] look at this shit dude.</v>

2336
00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.980
<v Speaker 1>This is Bob Sapp versus Mirko Cro.</v>

2337
00:58:08.981 --> 00:58:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Cop Mirko is literally almost 200 pounds lighter than them.</v>

2338
00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:18.650
<v Speaker 1>He's actually a hundred.</v>

2339
00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a probably no bullshit.</v>

2340
00:58:20.571 --> 00:58:22.790
<v Speaker 1>150 pounds lighter than him,</v>

2341
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:24.200
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible.</v>

2342
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:25.243
<v Speaker 1>And I mean he's,</v>

2343
00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.870
<v Speaker 1>he just sucks man.</v>

2344
00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:31.100
<v Speaker 1>And he's chasing cro cop around and he gets a hold of him and he like China to</v>

2345
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:33.110
<v Speaker 1>rabbit punches just trying to dirty box some.</v>

2346
00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:34.160
<v Speaker 1>He just wants to me to death.</v>

2347
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.961
<v Speaker 1>He sees that big.</v>

2348
00:58:34.961 --> 00:58:38.720
<v Speaker 1>It just has to lay one on you and your and your dumb Mirko was strong enough and</v>

2349
00:58:38.721 --> 00:58:40.250
<v Speaker 1>fast enough to keep him off.</v>

2350
00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Which is the difference between his style and Ernesto.</v>

2351
00:58:42.741 --> 00:58:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Who's throwing Ernesto?</v>

2352
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.861
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

2353
00:58:43.861 --> 00:58:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Who's the better kickboxer look technically then Mirko.</v>

2354
00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2355
00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:52.090
<v Speaker 1>What makes Mirco so dangerous and MMA is that he's explosive and it'll dart in</v>

2356
00:58:52.191 --> 00:58:53.030
<v Speaker 1>and blast you.</v>

2357
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.220
<v Speaker 1>He'll take a chance and do something wild.</v>

2358
00:58:55.221 --> 00:58:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Where a guy like it was something hard,</v>

2359
00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:58.340
<v Speaker 1>something ridiculous shit.</v>

2360
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:59.061
<v Speaker 1>Not just a feeler.</v>

2361
00:58:59.061 --> 00:58:59.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2362
00:58:59.381 --> 00:58:59.601
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2363
00:58:59.601 --> 00:59:00.434
<v Speaker 1>he wants to,</v>

2364
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.433
<v Speaker 1>he will go after you.</v>

2365
00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:02.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh I forgot.</v>

2366
00:59:02.901 --> 00:59:03.261
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

2367
00:59:03.261 --> 00:59:04.094
<v Speaker 1>He got ball clipped.</v>

2368
00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.770
<v Speaker 1>You've got Paul clipped it looks like or something happen there.</v>

2369
00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely do you get pokes in pride too.</v>

2370
00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:11.700
<v Speaker 1>That was another interesting thing.</v>

2371
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.840
<v Speaker 1>This is actually kickbox fat fingers on fat fingers.</v>

2372
00:59:15.841 --> 00:59:18.000
<v Speaker 1>And apparently the way it's designed,</v>

2373
00:59:18.001 --> 00:59:20.790
<v Speaker 1>it makes you a curl your hand more,</v>

2374
00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:21.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2375
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 1>keep it curled.</v>

2376
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the UFC ones,</v>

2377
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 1>do you feel that the UFC ones make your hands straightened out?</v>

2378
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:27.351
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about it.</v>

2379
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to check that out next time.</v>

2380
00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:28.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2381
00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:30.610
<v Speaker 1>they say that the pride ones were like curved.</v>

2382
00:59:30.611 --> 00:59:32.030
<v Speaker 1>They had like a curve too actually.</v>

2383
00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:32.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2384
00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:34.490
<v Speaker 1>They were actually bent curve where the UFC ones are straight.</v>

2385
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:34.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2386
00:59:34.781 --> 00:59:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And as,</v>

2387
00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:35.913
<v Speaker 1>as you,</v>

2388
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.370
<v Speaker 1>especially as a fight goes on,</v>

2389
00:59:37.371 --> 00:59:37.971
<v Speaker 1>you've relaxed,</v>

2390
00:59:37.971 --> 00:59:39.410
<v Speaker 1>your hands may be a little bit like,</v>

2391
00:59:39.411 --> 00:59:42.080
<v Speaker 1>that would be a time where the pride one would be better because it would keep</v>

2392
00:59:42.081 --> 00:59:42.710
<v Speaker 1>them kind of curved.</v>

2393
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:43.140
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

2394
00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Did he hit him with a body shot there?</v>

2395
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.681
<v Speaker 1>Backed that up.</v>

2396
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking too much.</v>

2397
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.790
<v Speaker 1>People who are listening to this and watching this are getting two totally</v>

2398
00:59:49.791 --> 00:59:52.240
<v Speaker 1>different experiences because uh,</v>

2399
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know who has the a c there's a body shot,</v>

2400
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:56.010
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2401
00:59:56.010 --> 00:59:58.520
<v Speaker 1>left kick to the body and straight left to the face.</v>

2402
00:59:59.360 --> 00:59:59.901
<v Speaker 1>Mirko Cro.</v>

2403
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Cop was a fucking savage back then.</v>

2404
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:02.181
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2405
01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the most dangerous guys as far as like sniper strikers.</v>

2406
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And then came into MMA and fought in pride.</v>

2408
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:11.691
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2409
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>With us some great fights.</v>

2410
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>His knockouts and pride are some of the all time greatest highlight reel head</v>

2411
01:00:16.731 --> 01:00:17.564
<v Speaker 1>kick knockouts,</v>

2412
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>series of your ego of,</v>

2413
01:00:20.061 --> 01:00:20.894
<v Speaker 1>of change game.</v>

2414
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Uhmm Alexander million ankle boom.</v>

2415
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Just blast and dudes with that head kick,</v>

2416
01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>that Russian dude dose Carl's with the,</v>

2417
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.311
<v Speaker 1>he came in with the loop,</v>

2418
01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>delete Libris mask on head kicked Blount.</v>

2419
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>He was treating with Marco who asked for that fight.</v>

2420
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking like,</v>

2421
01:00:33.981 --> 01:00:34.161
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2422
01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:34.994
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got it.</v>

2423
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2424
01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:36.141
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2425
01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Martha was it on,</v>

2426
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.141
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

2427
01:00:37.141 --> 01:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>it was in our area and I had some friends that trained over there and uh,</v>

2428
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I remember just like I would stop in there every once in a while and I was just</v>

2429
01:00:44.301 --> 01:00:44.421
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2430
01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:44.691
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2431
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:45.201
<v Speaker 1>this guy's,</v>

2432
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>this guy's,</v>

2433
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>this guy might might actually die in this one.</v>

2434
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2435
01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.220
<v Speaker 1>He was amazing man.</v>

2436
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Mirko when at that level,</v>

2437
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>that's like when he was at its very best.</v>

2438
01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>It was either before it was challenging,</v>

2439
01:00:54.711 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 1>fade or ripe right after.</v>

2440
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>It was somewhere in that area.</v>

2442
01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Where was him chasing after fade or couldn't quite beat that guy,</v>

2443
01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2444
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.070
<v Speaker 1>that guy was the best at that time.</v>

2445
01:01:04.071 --> 01:01:04.904
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>

2446
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2447
01:01:05.391 --> 01:01:06.980
<v Speaker 1>still one of my all time favorites.</v>

2448
01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Especially now like now that you know you've,</v>

2449
01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>you've had a chance to like look at his career and a perspective cause you know,</v>

2450
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>he decided to step back.</v>

2451
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching some of his old fights,</v>

2452
01:01:16.731 --> 01:01:20.480
<v Speaker 1>like I've watched the best of pride and watch some of the crazy ones.</v>

2453
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2454
01:01:21.091 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

2455
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.230
<v Speaker 1>he was a risk taking motherfucker,</v>

2456
01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.810
<v Speaker 1>man as a heavyweight champ risk taken motherfucker.</v>

2457
01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to go in there and he wanted to to finish you.</v>

2458
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>No ma'am.</v>

2459
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>No matter what he wanted.</v>

2460
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>And he wanted to just violently take,</v>

2461
01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>just crush you.</v>

2462
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>And he would do,</v>

2463
01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

2464
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>it just seemed like he had that super killer instinct that,</v>

2465
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's rare.</v>

2466
01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Who was incredible.</v>

2467
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2468
01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.090
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2469
01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>he was so aggressive and explosive and the yet unassuming.</v>

2470
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2471
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:48.740
<v Speaker 1>It was the weirdest thing.</v>

2472
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.000
<v Speaker 1>230 pounds,</v>

2473
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.811
<v Speaker 1>20 pounds,</v>

2474
01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>if not,</v>

2475
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>not buff at all.</v>

2476
01:01:53.091 --> 01:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Almost like a Chubby kid.</v>

2477
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Not even a little buff.</v>

2478
01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:56.443
<v Speaker 1>And just like,</v>

2479
01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:57.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2480
01:01:57.411 --> 01:01:58.244
<v Speaker 1>he could move,</v>

2481
01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:59.750
<v Speaker 1>that guy was fast and he hit,</v>

2482
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>he hit like a,</v>

2483
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.090
<v Speaker 1>had a break on the end of his hand.</v>

2484
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>And it was crazy because he really started off as a grappler,</v>

2485
01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along the line he became one of the scariest strikers in MMA.</v>

2486
01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.370
<v Speaker 1>And one of the guys who was the most successful striking,</v>

2487
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.810
<v Speaker 1>like his fight with cro cop was basically a kickboxing fight.</v>

2488
01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>They stood the whole time.</v>

2489
01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:17.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a few exchanges on the ground where he was inside a crow cubs</v>

2491
01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>

2492
01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part it was a kickboxing belt that he won.</v>

2493
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2494
01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:25.831
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2495
01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:26.491
<v Speaker 1>You outset cro,</v>

2496
01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>cop and he just kept cro,</v>

2497
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:29.180
<v Speaker 1>cop backing up.</v>

2498
01:02:29.181 --> 01:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>He kept coming forward and he's always dangerous,</v>

2499
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:32.401
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2500
01:02:32.401 --> 01:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>And there was fights where he had to come back to like,</v>

2501
01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2502
01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>the fight against Fujita where he got clipped that fight,</v>

2503
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>did the ad and do the chicken dance.</v>

2504
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:41.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2505
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>He did the chicken dance and then,</v>

2506
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2507
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds later for GTAs out random and slammed him.</v>

2508
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.890
<v Speaker 1>And then that just swept him and woo.</v>

2509
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>That Kamora that reverse a arm bar,</v>

2510
01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:52.494
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

2511
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>That was beautiful and it was like the seconds after getting slammed on his head</v>

2512
01:02:57.781 --> 01:03:02.160
<v Speaker 1>and the one of the most ridiculous suplexes ever attempted in MMA and random and</v>

2513
01:03:02.161 --> 01:03:06.720
<v Speaker 1>if you never saw a random and fight random in was probably the biggest freak</v>

2514
01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:08.700
<v Speaker 1>athlete to ever get into MMA.</v>

2515
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.550
<v Speaker 1>And I know that's like a big statement though,</v>

2516
01:03:11.551 --> 01:03:12.031
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

2517
01:03:12.031 --> 01:03:13.200
<v Speaker 1>he's a ball of,</v>

2518
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:14.610
<v Speaker 1>of of Alpha.</v>

2519
01:03:14.611 --> 01:03:15.121
<v Speaker 1>Of Alpha.</v>

2520
01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:15.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2521
01:03:15.331 --> 01:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>he is just,</v>

2522
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean he could do things physically like a whole,</v>

2523
01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.301
<v Speaker 1>like the whole,</v>

2524
01:03:21.301 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 1>like the hulk to hulk was real.</v>

2525
01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2526
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:23.790
<v Speaker 1>that's him.</v>

2527
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 1>He would go into the octagon before fights and do this thing where he would jump</v>

2528
01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:31.350
<v Speaker 1>up in the air just to kind of freak you out and he would literally jump to the</v>

2529
01:03:31.351 --> 01:03:32.580
<v Speaker 1>top of the octagon.</v>

2530
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:34.620
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the weirdest thing you've ever seen in your life.</v>

2531
01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you couldn't believe a human could jump that high and he's not,</v>

2532
01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:39.300
<v Speaker 1>not not that tall,</v>

2533
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:41.190
<v Speaker 1>but wide and just long.</v>

2534
01:03:41.191 --> 01:03:41.611
<v Speaker 1>It's probably,</v>

2535
01:03:41.611 --> 01:03:43.440
<v Speaker 1>is he five 11 or six feet tall?</v>

2536
01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe five 11 I'd say.</v>

2537
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:47.990
<v Speaker 1>And unbelievably muscular in his prime.</v>

2538
01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2539
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:48.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2540
01:03:48.451 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 1>he was a superhero and a 26 inch waist and he looks like Wolverine.</v>

2541
01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Wolverine was a real person.</v>

2542
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 1>He had that build.</v>

2543
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2544
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And God damn that motherfucker could move.</v>

2545
01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Randleman would take guys down and take guys down with these power doubles,</v>

2546
01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:03.810
<v Speaker 1>like launched them through the air,</v>

2547
01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:07.230
<v Speaker 1>like it was launching hundreds of pounds he was.</v>

2548
01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:07.830
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2549
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:08.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2550
01:04:08.071 --> 01:04:10.200
<v Speaker 1>the big looping setup hooks that he would throw,</v>

2551
01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:11.160
<v Speaker 1>like you're knocked out cro,</v>

2552
01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:11.994
<v Speaker 1>cop picks.</v>

2553
01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:15.240
<v Speaker 1>He jumped from halfway across the rings.</v>

2554
01:04:15.241 --> 01:04:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous,</v>

2555
01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.920
<v Speaker 1>explosiveness,</v>

2556
01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 1>athleticism,</v>

2557
01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.391
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

2558
01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>speed off the charts.</v>

2559
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:23.580
<v Speaker 1>But seemed like there was only bursts where he really applied himself,</v>

2560
01:04:23.581 --> 01:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2561
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 1>You feel like it's one of the curses it seems like for like these ultra ultra</v>

2563
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:28.740
<v Speaker 1>talented guys.</v>

2564
01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:29.731
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost,</v>

2565
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:33.480
<v Speaker 1>it comes too easy and it's almost like guys that have to,</v>

2566
01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I've always said like if you want to learn technique,</v>

2567
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:35.430
<v Speaker 1>like I mean,</v>

2568
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:36.810
<v Speaker 1>and just like trying to learn Jujitsu,</v>

2569
01:04:36.811 --> 01:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>learn from a light guy.</v>

2570
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2571
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Learn from a guy who has struggle and really learn how to do it correctly.</v>

2572
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>You learn from some Kevin Randleman type cat like that guy can do shit.</v>

2573
01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:45.624
<v Speaker 1>You can't do math.</v>

2574
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Like still getting around that.</v>

2575
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.321
<v Speaker 1>He ain't going to do it.</v>

2576
01:04:49.321 --> 01:04:51.060
<v Speaker 1>He just get a can opener you all day.</v>

2577
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2578
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Just just forget that it's Lou got to figure out another way to approach this</v>

2579
01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>because you guys are different with dealing with two different kinds of</v>

2580
01:04:57.751 --> 01:04:58.584
<v Speaker 1>vehicles.</v>

2581
01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:01.770
<v Speaker 1>That guy's got a fucking Ferrari and he can do crazy shit.</v>

2582
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

2583
01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:05.280
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think for Das buyer aren't going to,</v>

2584
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.770
<v Speaker 1>it's weird that a lot of those guys that are like super ultra talented for</v>

2585
01:05:10.771 --> 01:05:11.461
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

2586
01:05:11.461 --> 01:05:16.461
<v Speaker 1>they don't achieve the same results that a lot of the guys that are like almost</v>

2587
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2588
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>It's an uphill battle,</v>

2589
01:05:18.701 --> 01:05:19.451
<v Speaker 1>the entire wag.</v>

2590
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>But along the way they develop these incredible skills and like perfect example</v>

2591
01:05:23.981 --> 01:05:27.370
<v Speaker 1>of a guy who had very few physical gifts and didn't even take care of his</v>

2592
01:05:27.371 --> 01:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

2593
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>It was Jeremy Horn.</v>

2594
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>You know and Jeremy Horn would eat shitty ass food.</v>

2596
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:34.820
<v Speaker 1>It was never yoked in lift a weight in his life.</v>

2597
01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:36.900
<v Speaker 1>205 damn.</v>

2598
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Horn had a lot of fights and he very rarely got hurt.</v>

2599
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2600
01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:41.141
<v Speaker 1>Very rare.</v>

2601
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:41.801
<v Speaker 1>He got chucked.</v>

2602
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:43.930
<v Speaker 1>The chuck fight was like the only fight where he got hurt.</v>

2603
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>That was sad.</v>

2604
01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:45.791
<v Speaker 1>It was a blood,</v>

2605
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>

2606
01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It was a different shock.</v>

2607
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>It was a different shock.</v>

2608
01:05:48.221 --> 01:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>And Jeremy didn't belong in that weight class.</v>

2609
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.470
<v Speaker 1>There was already a weight class below that.</v>

2610
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.020
<v Speaker 1>He should have been competing at 85.</v>

2611
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:53.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

2612
01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.490
<v Speaker 1>but I think of money thing.</v>

2613
01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>It was a hype thing,</v>

2614
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2615
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:56.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2616
01:05:56.741 --> 01:05:56.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2617
01:05:56.921 --> 01:05:58.360
<v Speaker 1>it was like Chuck's first loss.</v>

2618
01:05:58.361 --> 01:05:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2619
01:05:58.690 --> 01:05:59.770
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun fight.</v>

2620
01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 1>The first fight was interesting because,</v>

2621
01:06:02.261 --> 01:06:03.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2622
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Caught Chuck with an arm triangle from the bottom and put him to sleep,</v>

2623
01:06:07.001 --> 01:06:08.110
<v Speaker 1>which never happens.</v>

2624
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:09.161
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare.</v>

2625
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:12.670
<v Speaker 1>And if you know how fucking strong chocolate Dell is,</v>

2626
01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:14.950
<v Speaker 1>that's when that becomes really incredible.</v>

2627
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2628
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Because chuck is a fucking savage.</v>

2629
01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 1>He is a very big,</v>

2630
01:06:20.051 --> 01:06:20.830
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

2631
01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:21.581
<v Speaker 1>very strong man.</v>

2632
01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:22.600
<v Speaker 1>People don't know.</v>

2633
01:06:22.601 --> 01:06:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I was like in person.</v>

2634
01:06:24.161 --> 01:06:25.930
<v Speaker 1>I saw some of his greatest victories,</v>

2635
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:29.920
<v Speaker 1>like the Tito fights and Bob Ballou fights and um,</v>

2636
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:30.813
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2637
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:33.330
<v Speaker 1>just you could think of this so many of them back to,</v>

2638
01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.290
<v Speaker 1>but the random and fight another great fight.</v>

2639
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Chuck had a way of going after dudes like the,</v>

2640
01:06:39.491 --> 01:06:44.470
<v Speaker 1>the first Tito knock out that fucking series of hammers he threw.</v>

2641
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:46.270
<v Speaker 1>He was a terrifying guy,</v>

2642
01:06:46.271 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2643
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.673
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>

2644
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Especially for Tito that time.</v>

2645
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause Tito knew.</v>

2646
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:51.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2647
01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 1>it was common.</v>

2648
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2649
01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:52.451
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2650
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:53.320
<v Speaker 1>you don't know it was coming.</v>

2651
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:54.183
<v Speaker 1>He knew that</v>

2652
01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:58.180
<v Speaker 1>it was only going to get worse with no pads on,</v>

2653
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2654
01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.620
<v Speaker 1>and he though doesn't,</v>

2655
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't like in hit and he,</v>

2656
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:02.650
<v Speaker 1>he's just that kind of guy who,</v>

2657
01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:03.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2658
01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean he will break under that kind of pressure.</v>

2659
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:07.901
<v Speaker 1>I think most people will.</v>

2660
01:07:07.901 --> 01:07:08.561
<v Speaker 1>But I mean he just,</v>

2661
01:07:08.561 --> 01:07:09.700
<v Speaker 1>he wilted pretty bad.</v>

2662
01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Well it was just a terrible matchup for him at that time.</v>

2663
01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think Tito was already having some back problems.</v>

2664
01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Think Tito's back had been fucking with them for a while.</v>

2666
01:07:17.861 --> 01:07:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2667
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.400
<v Speaker 1>you got to think he had a real powerful style.</v>

2668
01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:21.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2669
01:07:21.731 --> 01:07:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Tito had this really aggressive attacking style and dealing one fucking feed.</v>

2670
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:26.051
<v Speaker 1>That bitch is,</v>

2671
01:07:26.051 --> 01:07:27.490
<v Speaker 1>you got to work it like that in the gym,</v>

2672
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:28.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2673
01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure if he fought the way he fought and if he,</v>

2674
01:07:32.111 --> 01:07:33.670
<v Speaker 1>if he trained for those kinds of fights,</v>

2675
01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I bet his training was every bit as fucking brutal and that's an incredible</v>

2676
01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:38.350
<v Speaker 1>amount of punishment for your body.</v>

2677
01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.770
<v Speaker 1>That's not my coach is the one who had him there and he just,</v>

2678
01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy trained his ass off from what my coach has that colony yama.</v>

2679
01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2680
01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:46.443
<v Speaker 1>He uh,</v>

2681
01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Colin says that Holland's been around forever.</v>

2682
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2683
01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:49.810
<v Speaker 1>He's super old school.</v>

2684
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Old School respect call.</v>

2685
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Get Out of my respect.</v>

2686
01:07:53.551 --> 01:07:54.580
<v Speaker 1>You've got an old school team,</v>

2687
01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:54.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2688
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that mean to go from like Tito's early days.</v>

2689
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:00.243
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2690
01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.540
<v Speaker 1>dude went hard man.</v>

2691
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.411
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you what,</v>

2692
01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:02.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2693
01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:02.891
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2694
01:08:02.891 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Tito Ortiz gets enough respect.</v>

2695
01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Most people realize that in,</v>

2696
01:08:06.461 --> 01:08:07.540
<v Speaker 1>during his era,</v>

2697
01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.070
<v Speaker 1>he was incredibly dominant.</v>

2698
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Even if he lost to chocolate dow or whoever he lost to during Tito's era when he</v>

2699
01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:14.960
<v Speaker 1>was on top.</v>

2700
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>When he beat Evan Tanner,</v>

2701
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>when it,</v>

2702
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.910
<v Speaker 1>when he slammed him and k owed him rest in peace.</v>

2703
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Evan Tanner.</v>

2704
01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2705
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>When you know,</v>

2706
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>when he beat Ken Shamrock,</v>

2707
01:08:23.691 --> 01:08:27.020
<v Speaker 1>and granted these are not the best fighters in the world at the time.</v>

2708
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Ken had already had a long career and had a lot of damage,</v>

2709
01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>a CLS,</v>

2710
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked up,</v>

2711
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2712
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:34.210
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't,</v>

2713
01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:35.044
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

2714
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Tito was fucking dominate back when he would get his hands on you.</v>

2715
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:39.130
<v Speaker 1>He was so strong,</v>

2716
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:39.973
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

2717
01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:40.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2718
01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>with clean wrestling and then hit me like maybe he didn't punch out hard on the</v>

2719
01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>

2720
01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but when he got on top of you,</v>

2721
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

2722
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

2723
01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:50.170
<v Speaker 1>He was putting all of his weight and the elbow is all of his weight into the</v>

2724
01:08:50.171 --> 01:08:52.850
<v Speaker 1>punches and him and he was just on point with that.</v>

2725
01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.661
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion.</v>

2726
01:08:53.661 --> 01:08:56.980
<v Speaker 1>He's like a pioneer of ground and pound inside the guard.</v>

2727
01:08:56.981 --> 01:08:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Definitely because he's one of the best at doing it inside the guard.</v>

2728
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody,</v>

2729
01:09:00.411 --> 01:09:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I say like if I see someone doing a grounded pound thing and the guard,</v>

2730
01:09:03.411 --> 01:09:04.041
<v Speaker 1>I always think,</v>

2731
01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:04.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2732
01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 1>this guy would do better if he would get out of this position.</v>

2733
01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:07.483
<v Speaker 1>Not Tito.</v>

2735
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Tito would fucking smash guys from inside their guard.</v>

2736
01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And I think we learned a lot about horsepower and those fights.</v>

2737
01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:16.580
<v Speaker 1>But if you've got that kind of horsepower,</v>

2738
01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.510
<v Speaker 1>there's certain,</v>

2739
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:20.960
<v Speaker 1>there's like most dudes have a 320 horsepower engine and then you know,</v>

2740
01:09:20.961 --> 01:09:22.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're in there with a dude like Tito,</v>

2741
01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Tito has got a 500 horsepower engine.</v>

2742
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:23.961
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2743
01:09:23.961 --> 01:09:25.580
<v Speaker 1>And you're not going to hold on one with your legs.</v>

2744
01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You're sweaty ass tired legs.</v>

2745
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:31.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not going to keep that animal fucking slam and elbows in your face.</v>

2746
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.713
<v Speaker 1>But it's just,</v>

2747
01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>that was his time.</v>

2748
01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's time is very limited in that sport.</v>

2749
01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.161
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

2750
01:09:38.161 --> 01:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2751
01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:39.860
<v Speaker 1>We all have a very limited shelf life.</v>

2752
01:09:39.861 --> 01:09:40.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>

2753
01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:40.291
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2754
01:09:40.291 --> 01:09:40.491
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2755
01:09:40.491 --> 01:09:41.324
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go back to,</v>

2756
01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.020
<v Speaker 1>even today,</v>

2757
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2758
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.960
<v Speaker 1>even chuck who was one of the most durable guys ever,</v>

2759
01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.700
<v Speaker 1>there's certain point in time he had to be like,</v>

2760
01:09:46.701 --> 01:09:47.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2761
01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2762
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.020
<v Speaker 1>we're gone,</v>

2763
01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:48.270
<v Speaker 1>we're done.</v>

2764
01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:48.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2765
01:09:48.621 --> 01:09:48.920
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2766
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.030
<v Speaker 1>that your body gives out,</v>

2767
01:09:50.031 --> 01:09:51.290
<v Speaker 1>that button gets pushed too much,</v>

2768
01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:52.124
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

2769
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>

2770
01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:53.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2771
01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:54.940
<v Speaker 1>one day it,</v>

2772
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:55.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2773
01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:55.390
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2774
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:57.320
<v Speaker 1>we and most of us want to go out and our shield,</v>

2775
01:09:57.321 --> 01:09:57.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2776
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:58.700
<v Speaker 1>so that's just how it ends.</v>

2777
01:09:59.000 --> 01:09:59.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that pretty,</v>

2778
01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:00.583
<v Speaker 1>it's not always pretty.</v>

2779
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2780
01:10:00.981 --> 01:10:02.360
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting the,</v>

2781
01:10:02.361 --> 01:10:06.800
<v Speaker 1>the volume of strikes that you guys deal with in the flyweight division,</v>

2782
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:11.720
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be higher than it by far than any other division,</v>

2783
01:10:11.721 --> 01:10:12.500
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2784
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:12.921
<v Speaker 1>If you ever,</v>

2785
01:10:12.921 --> 01:10:15.220
<v Speaker 1>has anybody ever compiled it and tried to see like what the,</v>

2786
01:10:15.221 --> 01:10:16.850
<v Speaker 1>what the volume of strikes is?</v>

2787
01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:17.361
<v Speaker 1>That's a good,</v>

2788
01:10:17.361 --> 01:10:18.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2789
01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.970
<v Speaker 1>someone to do that on the Ugi someone,</v>

2790
01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2791
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.860
<v Speaker 1>someone figured out that someone probably already has and crunching numbers like</v>

2792
01:10:24.861 --> 01:10:25.610
<v Speaker 1>on the data,</v>

2793
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:26.430
<v Speaker 1>this is probably dude's out there.</v>

2794
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:29.050
<v Speaker 1>The remember the rain man of stats.</v>

2795
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I only am jumping on on weekends,</v>

2796
01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:36.640
<v Speaker 1>but just the amount of like actual beats that actual go on,</v>

2797
01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.960
<v Speaker 1>whether it's movement steps,</v>

2798
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:39.561
<v Speaker 1>strikes,</v>

2799
01:10:39.561 --> 01:10:43.970
<v Speaker 1>landed and the accelerated aspect of that in comparison to maybe other weight</v>

2800
01:10:43.971 --> 01:10:45.350
<v Speaker 1>classes where they don't move as much.</v>

2801
01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that has an impact on,</v>

2802
01:10:48.051 --> 01:10:48.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2803
01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:49.880
<v Speaker 1>your body getting to a certain point.</v>

2804
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:50.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just saying all right,</v>

2805
01:10:50.961 --> 01:10:51.471
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

2806
01:10:51.471 --> 01:10:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2807
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I landed the fourth most late kicks in UFC history.</v>

2808
01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:55.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2809
01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:56.031
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell on,</v>

2810
01:10:56.031 --> 01:10:56.740
<v Speaker 1>he told me.</v>

2811
01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And your last fight.</v>

2812
01:10:57.390 --> 01:10:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2813
01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.280
<v Speaker 1>43.</v>

2814
01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2815
01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn.</v>

2816
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Which Dylan had to kick harder because if I land 43 kicks should not be walking.</v>

2817
01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking about 43 kicks and the body and the guy that was just the</v>

2818
01:11:09.921 --> 01:11:10.221
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>

2819
01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I got a couple of the body and a couple of the head.</v>

2820
01:11:11.571 --> 01:11:12.404
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of fun.</v>

2834
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.590

<v Speaker 2>I've had to crack her heart and just be like,</v>

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like you're in a John Wayne movie when that should happen?</v>

3049
01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.480
<v Speaker 2>We got a smack a bitch and go,</v>

3050
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.220

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:18.791
<v Speaker 2>hey listen.</v>

3052
01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I know you've been fucking up some dude's.</v>

3053
01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:21.600
<v Speaker 2>If he ain't fucking with me,</v>

3054
01:16:21.601 --> 01:16:22.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to fuck you up.</v>

3055
01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:23.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm just just,</v>

3056
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.250
<v Speaker 2>just [inaudible] we're trying to go over technique.</v>

3057
01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Carla don't hit me that hard pop and I hit her back and she goes,</v>

3058
01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:27.691
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3059
01:16:27.691 --> 01:16:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

3060
01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3061
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:28.870
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3062
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 2>well some people get really intense man.</v>

3063
01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:31.571
<v Speaker 2>They were really into it.</v>

3064
01:16:31.571 --> 01:16:31.901
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

3065
01:16:31.901 --> 01:16:32.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3066
01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:36.250
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's a style of training and some people disagree with it.</v>

3067
01:16:36.251 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Like they think that like to shoot box it up,</v>

3068
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:41.620
<v Speaker 2>you're going to punch your card too many times before you even get into yeah.</v>

3069
01:16:41.621 --> 01:16:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Into a ring or a cage or headgear.</v>

3070
01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3071
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:44.680
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do.</v>

3072
01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.860
<v Speaker 2>But does that really make an impact because they say that head gear,</v>

3073
01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.590
<v Speaker 2>even though you don't get cut as up as much,</v>

3074
01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:50.840
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3075
01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.371
<v Speaker 2>you're still,</v>

3076
01:16:51.371 --> 01:16:52.990
<v Speaker 2>it's the impact on the brain.</v>

3077
01:16:53.230 --> 01:16:54.940
<v Speaker 2>The actual impact doesn't change.</v>

3078
01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:56.500
<v Speaker 2>It gets cushioned a bit.</v>

3079
01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3080
01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:58.690
<v Speaker 2>But it almost rattles you more.</v>

3081
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:59.500
<v Speaker 2>That could be true.</v>

3082
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.221
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3083
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:00.611
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3084
01:17:00.611 --> 01:17:01.061
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3085
01:17:01.061 --> 01:17:01.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3086
01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:02.523
<v Speaker 2>I'm no scientist.</v>

3087
01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:04.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't take my,</v>

3088
01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

3089
01:17:05.561 --> 01:17:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3090
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:06.270
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3091
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.440
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3092
01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:06.720
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3093
01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.280
<v Speaker 2>it keeps,</v>

3094
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 2>it makes me think I'm protected.</v>

3095
01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3096
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:10.460
<v Speaker 2>So I'll wear it.</v>

3097
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3098
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:11.691
<v Speaker 2>it also,</v>

3099
01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:12.200
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

3100
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.140
<v Speaker 2>do you practice a training with guys that you could trust?</v>

3101
01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you like do you or do you treat with anybody and train with anybody?</v>

3102
01:17:17.891 --> 01:17:18.120
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3103
01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:18.270
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3104

<v Speaker 2>we've got a tight knit team.</v>

3108
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting thing,</v>

3109
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:22.281
<v Speaker 2>isn't it,</v>

3110
01:17:22.281 --> 01:17:27.281
<v Speaker 2>that MMA over like maybe the past decade or so has really developed a way to</v>

3111
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:29.160
<v Speaker 2>professionally approach things.</v>

3112

<v Speaker 2>and training methods and a lot of people did a lot of stupid shit.</v>

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that I was like naming something that people weren't aware of,</v>

3304
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:22.380
<v Speaker 1>but I was saying that someone should kick his legs cause he's had problems with</v>

3305
01:21:22.381 --> 01:21:23.580
<v Speaker 1>his knees and he was like,</v>

3306
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:24.600
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of fucked up.</v>

3307
01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:25.950
<v Speaker 1>And I see his point.</v>

3308
01:21:25.951 --> 01:21:27.060
<v Speaker 1>It is Kinda fucked up.</v>

3309
01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:29.700
<v Speaker 1>But it's also true with public knowledge.</v>

3310
01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:32.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you hide that and like you told me,</v>

3311
01:21:32.551 --> 01:21:33.181
<v Speaker 1>don't tell anybody,</v>

3312
01:21:33.181 --> 01:21:34.014
<v Speaker 1>but I fucked my knee up.</v>

3313
01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Coaches are already going to have that thought of,</v>

3314
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:36.511
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>

3315
01:21:36.511 --> 01:21:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I hate saying shit like that,</v>

3316
01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.110
<v Speaker 1>but it is what you should do.</v>

3317
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3318
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like if you,</v>

3319
01:21:42.091 --> 01:21:45.360
<v Speaker 1>if you were fighting in a movie like game of Thrones and there was like the</v>

3320
01:21:45.361 --> 01:21:48.600
<v Speaker 1>noble choice and if it's not knowable to kick a guy's legs,</v>

3321
01:21:48.601 --> 01:21:50.520
<v Speaker 1>if his knees are problematic,</v>

3322
01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but with a fucking Boa constrictor,</v>

3323
01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:53.851
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

3324
01:21:53.851 --> 01:21:54.211
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3325
01:21:54.211 --> 01:21:56.130
<v Speaker 1>you got to take every advantage you can get anyway,</v>

3326
01:21:56.131 --> 01:21:56.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3327
01:21:56.401 --> 01:21:56.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3328
01:21:56.551 --> 01:21:57.350
<v Speaker 1>You got to just,</v>

3329
01:21:57.350 --> 01:22:00.580
<v Speaker 1>just try and put a chink in that armor somewhere so it,</v>

3330
01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:00.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3331
01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:02.070
<v Speaker 1>the body doesn't move right.</v>

3332
01:22:02.071 --> 01:22:03.420
<v Speaker 1>If you can just start to hurt something.</v>

3333
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:03.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3334
01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:04.980
<v Speaker 1>So he got mad that I brought that up,</v>

3335
01:22:04.981 --> 01:22:06.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that I don't love you buddy.</v>

3336
01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3337
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.831
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

3338
01:22:07.831 --> 01:22:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Hobby.</v>

3339
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:09.301
<v Speaker 1>I do love that dude.</v>

3340
01:22:09.301 --> 01:22:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I was bummed out that he was mad at me,</v>

3341
01:22:10.531 --> 01:22:11.341
<v Speaker 1>but I get it.</v>

3342
01:22:11.341 --> 01:22:12.174
<v Speaker 1>I understand it.</v>

3343
01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those weird things where like people have been upset at me if I've</v>

3344
01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:20.940
<v Speaker 1>done commentary on them losing and like spectacular fashion that like I sort of</v>

3345
01:22:20.941 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 1>like emphasized it made it suckier than it even had to be kind of your job.</v>

3346
01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:26.431
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't,</v>

3347
01:22:26.431 --> 01:22:30.330
<v Speaker 1>but I don't mean to like everybody thinks it's you know,</v>

3348
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:32.360
<v Speaker 1>or they suspect that it's personal.</v>

3349
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:34.320
<v Speaker 1>It's no way you have,</v>

3350
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:37.900
<v Speaker 1>you get excited about doing your job that's apparent.</v>

3351
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3352
01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird job though.</v>

3353
01:22:39.811 --> 01:22:40.644
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3354
01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:41.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3355
01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:43.350
<v Speaker 1>it's an especially weird job if you haven't done it,</v>

3356
01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3357
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.550
<v Speaker 1>cause like that's true.</v>

3358
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing commentary and MMA.</v>

3359
01:22:45.991 --> 01:22:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I never had an MMA fight ever come close.</v>

3360
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even thinking about it.</v>

3361
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3362
01:22:49.891 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I almost fought Wesley snipes but I was pretty sure he didn't know what he was</v>

3363
01:22:52.531 --> 01:22:53.070
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

3364
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:54.580
<v Speaker 1>This thought I was just going to grab him,</v>

3365
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:56.203
<v Speaker 1>take him down and shut out.</v>

3366
01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:57.421
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

3367
01:22:57.421 --> 01:22:57.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3368
01:22:57.751 --> 01:22:59.310
<v Speaker 1>how's I going to keep me from grabbing him?</v>

3369
01:22:59.570 --> 01:23:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you going to do?</v>

3370
01:23:00.451 --> 01:23:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to be going to be really slick?</v>

3371
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3372
01:23:03.170 --> 01:23:04.070
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time.</v>

3373
01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:05.830
<v Speaker 1>We have a long time to dance.</v>

3374
01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.693
<v Speaker 1>I'll grab you.</v>

3375
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:07.833
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to grab you.</v>

3376
01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:08.771
<v Speaker 1>That's all I thought of.</v>

3377
01:23:08.771 --> 01:23:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think like I'm,</v>

3378
01:23:09.821 --> 01:23:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll start fighting MMA,</v>

3379
01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3380
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:14.620
<v Speaker 1>to do commentary on a guy like Anderson Silva.</v>

3381
01:23:14.621 --> 01:23:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Like who the fuck am I to say what he should do?</v>

3382
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I have zero credibility.</v>

3383
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a ridiculous position for me to begin.</v>

3384
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Damn you.</v>

3385
01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.300
<v Speaker 1>You're just like the refs man.</v>

3386
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:23.740
<v Speaker 1>He had no business being there.</v>

3387
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

3388
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I have no business being there.</v>

3389
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:26.840
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

3390
01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.790
<v Speaker 1>the rest I said the judges,</v>

3391
01:23:27.791 --> 01:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>the rest happened at the reps actually.</v>

3392
01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3393
01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:30.940
<v Speaker 1>for the most part.</v>

3394
01:23:30.941 --> 01:23:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some mistakes like Mazda God,</v>

3395
01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:34.180
<v Speaker 1>he takes a lot of heat I think.</v>

3396
01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fucking tough,</v>

3397
01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:37.463
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough job.</v>

3398
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough gig.</v>

3399
01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:41.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's excellent guys like in my opinion right now,</v>

3400
01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:42.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3401
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:44.560
<v Speaker 1>big John McCarthy is always top of the heat.</v>

3402
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

3403
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the gold standard.</v>

3404
01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:48.850
<v Speaker 1>And then there's herb dean who I think is right up there.</v>

3405
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I think Josh Rosenthal,</v>

3406
01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:53.410
<v Speaker 1>that was Josh Rosenthal is right up there,</v>

3407
01:23:53.411 --> 01:23:54.244
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3408
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3409
01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm really bummed out about his legal situation.</v>

3410
01:23:57.341 --> 01:23:58.174
<v Speaker 1>He got a,</v>

3411
01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to blow up his spot,</v>

3412
01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:00.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3413
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to talk about his legal problems,</v>

3414
01:24:01.751 --> 01:24:02.561
<v Speaker 1>but he's a great guy.</v>

3415
01:24:02.561 --> 01:24:03.400
<v Speaker 1>We start kind of luck.</v>

3416
01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a good dude.</v>

3417
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:09.050
<v Speaker 1>He just did something that's only illegal because the world's run by cunts.</v>

3418
01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3419
01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.061
<v Speaker 1>Lost my answer.</v>

3425
01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you can count on him like does a few guys like you find out they're going to be</v>

3426
01:24:20.651 --> 01:24:21.041
<v Speaker 1>the referee.</v>

3427
01:24:21.041 --> 01:24:21.874
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

3428

<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

3429
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:23.710
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be a good fight.</v>

3430
01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you have say over who referees your fights?</v>

3431
01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:26.801
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3432
01:24:26.801 --> 01:24:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm just waiting for the day that Kim winds up walks in and I can just raise my</v>

3433
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:29.921
<v Speaker 1>hand and go,</v>

3434
01:24:29.921 --> 01:24:30.370

<v Speaker 1>this is not happening.</v>

3436
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.450
<v Speaker 1>I think Kim does a pretty good job,</v>

3437
01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.313
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3438
01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3439
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I think she has a real hard time with big people though.</v>

3440
01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:39.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3441
01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:42.220
<v Speaker 1>like what was her last fight where this two fucking,</v>

3442
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.720
<v Speaker 1>oh it was gone.</v>

3443
01:24:43.721 --> 01:24:45.730

3450
01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:55.060

<v Speaker 1>took in a lab and Berge with a human.</v>

3453
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean when he like gets in front of the camera and goes,</v>

3454
01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:08.260

01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's saga looks like he's some crazy caveman.</v>

3457
01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:16.630
<v Speaker 1>What's he just bothers me cause she's made some bad choices and the fact that I</v>

3458
01:25:16.631 --> 01:25:19.090
<v Speaker 1>don't want to hear a woman's voice in the cage there.</v>

3459
01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:20.830
<v Speaker 1>You just pick again,</v>

3460

3461
01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:23.950

<v Speaker 1>prepare for the feminists to be coming at you full boar.</v>

3463
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Especially feminist MMA fans in the,</v>

3464
01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.133
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge,</v>

3465
01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:32.740
<v Speaker 1>huge part of the market.</v>

3466
01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:36.970
<v Speaker 1>He's going to have to apologize for you now and I'm probably probably both in</v>

3467
01:25:36.971 --> 01:25:37.804
<v Speaker 1>trouble right now.</v>

3468
01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Shut our phones off the Dana can't Texas my dad,</v>

3469
01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:43.570

3470
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Who called Vegas?</v>

3471
01:25:44.891 --> 01:25:45.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a string call.</v>

3472
01:25:45.681 --> 01:25:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Lorenzo.</v>

3473
01:25:46.190 --> 01:25:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Shut the internet down.</v>

3474
01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:50.020
<v Speaker 1>We're all going in.</v>

3475
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:50.291
<v Speaker 1>Ian,</v>

3476
01:25:50.291 --> 01:25:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get us in trouble.</v>

3477
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.831
<v Speaker 1>It's funny man.</v>

3478
01:25:53.831 --> 01:25:56.170
<v Speaker 1>But I see how you would want.</v>

3479
01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Definitely if you have that opinion about it,</v>

3480
01:25:58.151 --> 01:25:59.410
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a woman or a man,</v>

3481
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.630
<v Speaker 1>if you have an opinion about a referee that you don't think is good,</v>

3482
01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I would think that would be important to like make sure that that's one less</v>

3483
01:26:04.581 --> 01:26:05.570
<v Speaker 1>thing you have to think about.</v>

3484
01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Did they give you like a hard time about that?</v>

3485
01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Is that like pretty easy to do?</v>

3486
01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:09.801
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3487
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:10.371
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

3488
01:26:10.371 --> 01:26:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a complaint about it.</v>

3489
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:13.940
<v Speaker 1>So I know that's been in dispute in boxing matches.</v>

3490
01:26:13.941 --> 01:26:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Like there's certain reps that are slower to break things up and let guys fight</v>

3491
01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:18.710
<v Speaker 1>out of clinches,</v>

3492
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:19.250
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3493
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other bar wraps that don't,</v>

3494
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.240
<v Speaker 1>they don't tolerate Nyesha.</v>

3495
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:22.881
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

3496
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:23.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3497
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it happen and UFC,</v>

3498
01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:25.401
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know.</v>

3499
01:26:25.401 --> 01:26:26.061
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

3500
01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's going to happen or it has happened and that they've taken care of</v>

3501
01:26:28.521 --> 01:26:28.611
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

3502
01:26:28.611 --> 01:26:32.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure Bert has has made it quick work of it.</v>

3503
01:26:32.511 --> 01:26:32.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3504
01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:33.890
<v Speaker 1>that guy does his job well.</v>

3505
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:34.371
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

3506
01:26:34.371 --> 01:26:37.250
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting situation and a lot of people don't even aware of that.</v>

3507
01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:37.701
<v Speaker 1>Like people go,</v>

3508
01:26:37.701 --> 01:26:39.710
<v Speaker 1>what does UFC fixed your fucking judging?</v>

3509
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:40.940
<v Speaker 1>They can't do anything.</v>

3510
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3511
01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:41.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3512
01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:44.480
<v Speaker 1>it's the state athletic commissions that control all the judging.</v>

3513
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3514
01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.610
<v Speaker 1>It's getting better I think sometimes.</v>

3515
01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I think it's getting better.</v>

3516
01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then a flight comes along and you're like,</v>

3517
01:26:50.991 --> 01:26:51.351
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3518
01:26:51.351 --> 01:26:52.184
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3519
01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:52.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3520
01:26:52.881 --> 01:26:54.020
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

3521
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some shit you guys are not taking into consideration here.</v>

3522
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3523
01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:58.001
<v Speaker 1>You know there's,</v>

3524
01:26:58.001 --> 01:26:59.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a few fights where he just go,</v>

3525
01:26:59.391 --> 01:26:59.631
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3526
01:26:59.631 --> 01:26:59.841
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3527
01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm missing something here.</v>

3528
01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't get how that was.</v>

3529
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:04.600
<v Speaker 1>What did you see that I didn't see or not Sam,</v>

3530
01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:05.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

3531
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I really believe this and this sounds like stupid bullshit,</v>

3532
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think that they should consider having a one extra vote.</v>

3533
01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.540
<v Speaker 1>One extra judge and that one extra judge.</v>

3534
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:18.500
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be the Internet.</v>

3535
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:20.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

3536
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I think you should allow fans to register and vote and allow them to like you</v>

3537
01:27:26.811 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 1>could rate someone who judges the way you read a Yelp account.</v>

3538
01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Like all this food tastes like ass.</v>

3539
01:27:32.170 --> 01:27:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3540
01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Like all this guy judges like shit.</v>

3541
01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:38.210
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a few red flags if you made some questionable decisions and</v>

3542
01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:42.110
<v Speaker 1>then you get removed from the queue and you can't judge anymore or you can't</v>

3543
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:45.320
<v Speaker 1>judge a high level fights where you have to prove yourself or whatever the fuck</v>

3544
01:27:45.321 --> 01:27:46.010
<v Speaker 1>you got to do.</v>

3545
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:49.790
<v Speaker 1>But I think having that as a fourth judging that May 4th option,</v>

3546
01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe even coming to it if it's a a close disputed decision.</v>

3547
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:55.130
<v Speaker 1>If it's close,</v>

3548
01:27:55.130 --> 01:27:56.510
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the Internet judge,</v>

3549
01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.700
<v Speaker 1>let's see what that was and then you know,</v>

3550
01:27:58.850 --> 01:28:00.190
<v Speaker 1>take that into consideration or,</v>

3551
01:28:00.191 --> 01:28:00.830
<v Speaker 1>or what,</v>

3552
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:01.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3553
01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you would factor it in.</v>

3554
01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:04.160
<v Speaker 1>What would be most valuable,</v>

3555
01:28:04.161 --> 01:28:07.610
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the in person judges or the Internet judge because it's a different</v>

3556
01:28:07.611 --> 01:28:09.140
<v Speaker 1>experience not being there as well.</v>

3557
01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Maybe give him half a point.</v>

3558
01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3559
01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Like is that,</v>

3560
01:28:12.170 --> 01:28:13.070
<v Speaker 1>does that make sense?</v>

3561
01:28:13.071 --> 01:28:17.390
<v Speaker 1>That it's a different experience watching it cage side as it is watching it on</v>

3562
01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:21.050
<v Speaker 1>television and it almost wouldn't be fair if they only watch it on television.</v>

3563
01:28:21.650 --> 01:28:22.550
<v Speaker 1>It's completely different.</v>

3564
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:23.960
<v Speaker 1>There's so much,</v>

3565
01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.040
<v Speaker 1>there's so much you can't see.</v>

3566
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Your judges have screens in front of them,</v>

3567
01:28:26.841 --> 01:28:27.560
<v Speaker 1>don't they?</v>

3568
01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:27.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3569
01:28:27.771 --> 01:28:30.920
<v Speaker 1>And you can see they do have screens if they want to catch angles they do.</v>

3570
01:28:30.921 --> 01:28:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

3571
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:35.180
<v Speaker 1>It's something that we complained about for a long fucking time before they</v>

3572
01:28:35.181 --> 01:28:38.330
<v Speaker 1>finally gave in and started giving them screens because there's certain angles</v>

3573
01:28:38.331 --> 01:28:39.800
<v Speaker 1>where if someone,</v>

3574
01:28:39.801 --> 01:28:43.730
<v Speaker 1>if I'm on one side of the cage and there's a ground fight going on in the exact</v>

3575
01:28:43.731 --> 01:28:44.630
<v Speaker 1>opposite side of the cage,</v>

3576
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:45.980
<v Speaker 1>I can't see what's going on.</v>

3577
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:48.260
<v Speaker 1>And if a guy has his back to me and the other guy has,</v>

3578
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.153
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he's,</v>

3579
01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I have to see a monitor is,</v>

3580
01:28:50.331 --> 01:28:51.310
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way to see it.</v>

3581
01:28:51.311 --> 01:28:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3582
01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.640
<v Speaker 1>So finally judges get to see that because for the longest time some of the</v>

3583
01:28:55.641 --> 01:28:58.910
<v Speaker 1>questionable decisions could be boiled down to that.</v>

3584
01:28:58.911 --> 01:28:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

3585
01:28:59.190 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you didn't get a good angle to see exactly was happening the whole time.</v>

3586
01:29:02.071 --> 01:29:03.360
<v Speaker 1>So in a close,</v>

3587
01:29:03.361 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 1>like ten nine sort of a situation where it could go either way,</v>

3588
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:09.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fights where could kind of go either way.</v>

3589
01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3590
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Well after the round was over like fuck,</v>

3591
01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 1>they got to choose a winner here.</v>

3592
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3593
01:29:13.741 --> 01:29:14.530
<v Speaker 1>And then would are,</v>

3594
01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:15.950
<v Speaker 1>or how,</v>

3595
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3596
01:29:16.171 --> 01:29:20.130
<v Speaker 1>how much do you do refs or a judges go off punch that so they know them right</v>

3597
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:20.430
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

3598
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:21.500
<v Speaker 1>You think they know them at all?</v>

3599
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:23.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of thing that that needs to get figured out.</v>

3600
01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Like we have them.</v>

3601
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.961
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3602
01:29:24.961 --> 01:29:25.794
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying that,</v>

3603
01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:26.700
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

3604
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:29.280
<v Speaker 1>they should want that information to judge a fight.</v>

3605
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they get it.</v>

3606
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they don't get it.</v>

3607
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:32.783
<v Speaker 1>So like when we're,</v>

3608
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that could influence them,</v>

3609
01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.690
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's why they don't get it.</v>

3610
01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I need to find that out for sure.</v>

3611
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:39.263
<v Speaker 1>I should ask my dope,</v>

3612
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.870
<v Speaker 1>my Kohlberg,</v>

3613
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:40.501
<v Speaker 1>I'll text him.</v>

3614
01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:43.770
<v Speaker 1>That's how strong this is while this is going on and it might go over and we'll</v>

3615
01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:47.340
<v Speaker 1>be on ancient if they don't know the numbers and that's bullshit cause they need</v>

3616
01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:48.840
<v Speaker 1>to know they need to see those numbers.</v>

3617
01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3618
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3619
01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that would be something just like the,</v>

3620
01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:53.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3621
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:54.780
<v Speaker 1>just like the monitors,</v>

3622
01:29:54.781 --> 01:29:55.830
<v Speaker 1>that would be a no brainer,</v>

3623
01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:56.971
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard,</v>

3624
01:29:56.971 --> 01:29:57.271
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3625
01:29:57.271 --> 01:29:58.650
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get change.</v>

3626
01:29:58.651 --> 01:30:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Change is fucking hard,</v>

3627
01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:01.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3628
01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.310
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's run by the state.</v>

3629
01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3630
01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:04.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's what people need to understand.</v>

3631
01:30:04.531 --> 01:30:05.071
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3632
01:30:05.071 --> 01:30:08.250
<v Speaker 1>this is not as simple as like the UFC needs to implement the,</v>

3633
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.491
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3634
01:30:08.491 --> 01:30:10.260
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a whole bureaucracy.</v>

3635
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.840
<v Speaker 1>He dealing with people that don't want to lose their jobs.</v>

3636
01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:13.674
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with,</v>

3637
01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:16.620
<v Speaker 1>it's really tough to fire people because it's a government gig.</v>

3638
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:16.881
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3639
01:30:16.881 --> 01:30:17.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same,</v>

3640
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:18.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3641
01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:19.320
<v Speaker 1>and that's a part of it.</v>

3642
01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people that are judges that I like as human beings,</v>

3643
01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I always say hi to them.</v>

3644
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:24.930
<v Speaker 1>They're very nice people.</v>

3645
01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think they're qualified to do what they're doing.</v>

3646
01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:28.613
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

3647
01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be look at them and see that yeah.</v>

3648
01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:31.311
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>

3649
01:30:31.311 --> 01:30:32.760
<v Speaker 1>there should be some sort of,</v>

3650
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:33.623
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3651
01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:34.620
<v Speaker 1>some sort of</v>

3652
01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.480
<v Speaker 1>like absolute baseline knowledge that you have to have had.</v>

3653
01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:42.810
<v Speaker 1>You have to have some experience in some sort of combat sports.</v>

3654
01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that fighters are,</v>

3655
01:30:45.811 --> 01:30:48.750
<v Speaker 1>judges should have been fighters with so many fights.</v>

3656
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:49.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a good idea,</v>

3657
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3658
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:50.250
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

3659
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:51.650
<v Speaker 1>or at least hire a,</v>

3660
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.430
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

3661
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:53.610
<v Speaker 1>a standup judge,</v>

3662
01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:56.300
<v Speaker 1>a wrestling judge and the judge in a,</v>

3663
01:30:56.301 --> 01:30:56.830
<v Speaker 1>in a grand,</v>

3664
01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:57.840
<v Speaker 1>you get to judge or you know,</v>

3665
01:30:57.841 --> 01:30:58.381
<v Speaker 1>some sort of,</v>

3666
01:30:58.381 --> 01:30:59.490
<v Speaker 1>and then have a fourth MMA.</v>

3667
01:30:59.491 --> 01:31:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3668
01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:00.291
<v Speaker 1>Just they,</v>

3669
01:31:00.291 --> 01:31:00.680
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

3670
01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:01.351
<v Speaker 1>they need to figure it out.</v>

3671
01:31:01.351 --> 01:31:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Something because everyone has to have knowledge and I think the entire sport</v>

3672
01:31:05.911 --> 01:31:07.200
<v Speaker 1>instead of just one facet of it.</v>

3673
01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:07.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3674
01:31:07.561 --> 01:31:08.311
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right too.</v>

3675
01:31:08.311 --> 01:31:09.000
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

3676
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.590
<v Speaker 1>if you had just to Jitsu judges,</v>

3677
01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:11.680
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers would be,</v>

3678
01:31:11.850 --> 01:31:13.360
<v Speaker 1>every five was the Juju.</v>

3679
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:13.801
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

3680
01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:15.010
<v Speaker 1>when me and my friend,</v>

3681
01:31:16.670 --> 01:31:18.810
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know he can posses God,</v>

3682
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.770
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>

3683
01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:19.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3684
01:31:19.981 --> 01:31:21.000
<v Speaker 1>we disagree.</v>

3685
01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:22.283
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>

3686
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:25.710
<v Speaker 1>There was so many Brazilians were mad when Haji Gracie got cut.</v>

3687
01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3688
01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:26.460

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:27.750

<v Speaker 1>And it's one more five,</v>

3692
01:31:29.461 --> 01:31:29.591

<v Speaker 1>they all wanted him.</v>

3696
01:31:33.151 --> 01:31:33.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3697
01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:37.080
<v Speaker 1>they're so loyal and like a name like Gracie,</v>

3698

01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:15.220
<v Speaker 1>he's big dude.</v>

3726
01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:16.120
<v Speaker 1>When you're around him,</v>

3727
01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.950
<v Speaker 1>like how does that guy way one 85?</v>

3728
01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:19.120
<v Speaker 1>How's that even possible?</v>

3729
01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Because he,</v>

3730
01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:22.840
<v Speaker 1>I see a lot of guys like that and I mean at every weight that is just like,</v>

3731
01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:23.680
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

3732
01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3733
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:26.260
<v Speaker 1>No one better exemplifies it then.</v>

3734
01:32:26.261 --> 01:32:27.094
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

3735
01:32:27.710 --> 01:32:28.543
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3736
01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.460
<v Speaker 1>GSP is pretty bad.</v>

3737
01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:31.061
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Rumble.</v>

3738
01:32:31.061 --> 01:32:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Johnson.</v>

3739
01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:31.901
<v Speaker 1>Johnson.</v>

3740
01:32:31.901 --> 01:32:32.734
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3741
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:33.161
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3742
01:32:33.161 --> 01:32:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean he made one,</v>

3743
01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:35.470
<v Speaker 1>well we barely made one mistake.</v>

3744
01:32:35.471 --> 01:32:37.090
<v Speaker 1>One 70 but now he's fighting it in heavyweight.</v>

3745
01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3746
01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

3747
01:32:38.410 --> 01:32:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And he's beating guys like our Lawsky.</v>

3748
01:32:40.241 --> 01:32:40.690
<v Speaker 1>You missed,</v>

3749
01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:41.920
<v Speaker 1>you missed wait at 70.</v>

3750
01:32:41.921 --> 01:32:43.060
<v Speaker 1>So they kicked out a 70.</v>

3751
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:44.290
<v Speaker 1>They kick you out of a weight class,</v>

3752
01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.030
<v Speaker 1>which I don't knew that was possible.</v>

3753
01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Then you miss wait at the next higher for the 15 pounds higher weight class by</v>

3754
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:51.940
<v Speaker 1>12 pounds.</v>

3755
01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:54.760
<v Speaker 1>So you missed your original weight by 2027 pounds.</v>

3756
01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.220
<v Speaker 1>You're just being an asshole now.</v>

3757
01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I met him in between fights once his back when he was,</v>

3758
01:33:01.091 --> 01:33:01.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3759
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:03.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the scariest guys in the welterweight division.</v>

3760
01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:04.300
<v Speaker 1>He was just coming up.</v>

3761
01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:07.750
<v Speaker 1>He had knocked out Tommy Burns and remember that fight.</v>

3762
01:33:07.751 --> 01:33:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3763
01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:09.430
<v Speaker 1>but ruthless fight man,</v>

3764
01:33:09.431 --> 01:33:11.350
<v Speaker 1>he was absolutely brutal.</v>

3765
01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Tommy was coming off of the ultimate fighter and he was,</v>

3766
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:18.340
<v Speaker 1>there is moments in fighters' careers where they just appear like,</v>

3767
01:33:18.341 --> 01:33:19.390
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

3768
01:33:19.391 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 1>this is the motherfucker right here.</v>

3769
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.180
<v Speaker 1>And he was one of them.</v>

3770
01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:25.480
<v Speaker 1>And that moment when he bursts on the scene and knocked out that Tommy Burns,</v>

3771
01:33:25.481 --> 01:33:26.860
<v Speaker 1>who that was like his coming out party,</v>

3772
01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:27.371
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3773
01:33:27.371 --> 01:33:29.680
<v Speaker 1>this kid is fucking powerful.</v>

3774
01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:30.573
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

3775
01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.480
<v Speaker 1>He went after people and he just,</v>

3776
01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.060
<v Speaker 1>it just physically just crushed.</v>

3777
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And he was so big for one 70.</v>

3778
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even make sense.</v>

3779
01:33:39.011 --> 01:33:39.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3780
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I met him in between fights.</v>

3781
01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:41.081
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

3782
01:33:41.081 --> 01:33:41.771
<v Speaker 1>at one of the,</v>

3783
01:33:41.771 --> 01:33:42.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3784
01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:43.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Denver.</v>

3785
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Came down and he wasn't competing,</v>

3786
01:33:45.371 --> 01:33:47.140
<v Speaker 1>so he was giant.</v>

3787
01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:47.801
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3788
01:33:47.801 --> 01:33:49.000
<v Speaker 1>what do you way?</v>

3789
01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:49.631
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

3790
01:33:49.631 --> 01:33:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to 30 to 20 to 30.</v>

3791
01:33:51.581 --> 01:33:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Like how watch,</v>

3792
01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.640
<v Speaker 1>he was huge.</v>

3793
01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:56.140
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking gigantic.</v>

3794
01:33:56.170 --> 01:33:56.510
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3795
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3796
01:33:56.730 --> 01:33:57.130
<v Speaker 1>the foot,</v>

3797
01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:58.450
<v Speaker 1>that's a 60 pound weight cut.</v>

3798
01:33:58.570 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 1>And he's building a heavyweight too.</v>

3799
01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean he be like,</v>

3800
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:02.590
<v Speaker 1>looked like it didn't look like,</v>

3801
01:34:02.591 --> 01:34:02.771
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3802
01:34:02.771 --> 01:34:03.810
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be fighting heavyweight.</v>

3803
01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:04.181
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

3804
01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:04.421
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3805
01:34:04.421 --> 01:34:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you can be a heavyweight.</v>

3806
01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:07.360
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did you get one 70?</v>

3807
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:07.701
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's,</v>

3808
01:34:07.701 --> 01:34:08.471
<v Speaker 1>he's tall too.</v>

3809
01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:11.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he's a short super thick guy.</v>

3810
01:34:11.561 --> 01:34:12.790
<v Speaker 1>He's just a big man.</v>

3811
01:34:12.810 --> 01:34:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3812
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.660
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3813
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:16.660
<v Speaker 1>that's just gotta be unbelievably bad for your body.</v>

3814
01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:19.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just gotta be unbelievably bad for your body when you have that Nice nutty</v>

3815
01:34:19.871 --> 01:34:20.320
<v Speaker 1>seesaw.</v>

3816
01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.153
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3817
01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3818
01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.880
<v Speaker 1>I honestly probably think it takes a year or two off your life every time you do</v>

3819
01:34:24.881 --> 01:34:25.001
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3820
01:34:25.001 --> 01:34:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like I cut the most I've ever cut was 18.8 and last 20 hours.</v>

3821
01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing for you though too,</v>

3822
01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.990
<v Speaker 1>because of the percentage of your body weight as opposed to like a guy like</v>

3823
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Johnson who's 50 60 pounds heavier.</v>

3824
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:37.781
<v Speaker 1>But as I'm saying,</v>

3825
01:34:37.781 --> 01:34:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I was in Florida.</v>

3826
01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:39.821
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3827
01:34:39.821 --> 01:34:44.821
<v Speaker 1>When I thought deep Demetrius the second time I cut 18.8 pounds the last 80 or</v>

3828
01:34:45.191 --> 01:34:46.024
<v Speaker 1>last 20 hours.</v>

3829
01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what it was before that was,</v>

3830
01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3831
01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:50.213
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3832
01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.940
<v Speaker 1>that that one was really screwed me up.</v>

3833
01:34:51.941 --> 01:34:53.440
<v Speaker 1>But when you go to a place like Florida,</v>

3834
01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:57.230
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you spend adjusting to the moisture in the air and the change</v>

3835
01:34:57.231 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 1>in the environment?</v>

3836
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.581
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3837
01:34:58.581 --> 01:34:59.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3838
01:34:59.040 --> 01:34:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3839
01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't really,</v>

3840
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.520
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really bother me.</v>

3841
01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.590
<v Speaker 2>What about an altitude if you have to fight it?</v>

3842
01:35:03.591 --> 01:35:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Like Denver?</v>

3843
01:35:04.190 --> 01:35:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I never fought in the high altitude before.</v>

3844
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3845
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:09.280
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that'd be a wild place to wash some fucking fly whites.</v>

3846
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:09.861
<v Speaker 2>Cheese,</v>

3847
01:35:09.861 --> 01:35:10.131
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3848
01:35:10.131 --> 01:35:10.964
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>

3849
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 2>cause heavyweights in Denver are crazy.</v>

3850
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Like every time you have a heavyweight fight in Denver,</v>

3851
01:35:15.921 --> 01:35:16.820
<v Speaker 2>it's like these poor fucking,</v>

3852
01:35:16.821 --> 01:35:19.730
<v Speaker 2>God's got just got drugged and pushed into a cage.</v>

3853
01:35:19.731 --> 01:35:20.930
<v Speaker 2>You gotta fucking dark your neck,</v>

3854
01:35:20.931 --> 01:35:21.320
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3855
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.580
<v Speaker 2>People don't understand man.</v>

3856
01:35:22.581 --> 01:35:23.780
<v Speaker 2>If you've never been to Denver,</v>

3857
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 2>that shit is up there.</v>

3858
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:26.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a mile high city,</v>

3859
01:35:26.541 --> 01:35:27.051
<v Speaker 2>legit.</v>

3860
01:35:27.051 --> 01:35:29.300
<v Speaker 2>And the people that live there have more endurance than you.</v>

3861
01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.040
<v Speaker 2>If you get used to that too.</v>

3862
01:35:31.041 --> 01:35:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Like that's why those guys trained in Albuquerque or,</v>

3863
01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:34.160
<v Speaker 2>but he goes up to big bear.</v>

3864
01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.510
<v Speaker 2>When you get used to that shit,</v>

3865
01:35:35.511 --> 01:35:39.470
<v Speaker 2>it makes your body like super enriched with oxygen and red blood cells.</v>

3866
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:40.460
<v Speaker 2>You have all this endurance.</v>

3867
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.961
<v Speaker 2>Well that's it.</v>

3868
01:35:40.961 --> 01:35:41.870
<v Speaker 2>But my girlfriend outside,</v>

3869
01:35:41.871 --> 01:35:42.161
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

3870
01:35:42.161 --> 01:35:43.790
<v Speaker 2>she lives in Reno is always in tile.</v>

3871
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3872
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:45.530
<v Speaker 2>so you're always up there high.</v>

3873
01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:46.251
<v Speaker 2>And then she's,</v>

3874
01:35:46.251 --> 01:35:47.084
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's always,</v>

3875
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:48.470
<v Speaker 2>she comes out here more but,</v>

3876
01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:50.000
<v Speaker 2>but you have to go up there to train.</v>

3877
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3878
01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:51.400
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3879
01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:51.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3880
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start in more cause I,</v>

3881
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.100
<v Speaker 2>cause she's up there and I actually genuinely liked this one.</v>

3882
01:35:55.101 --> 01:35:57.410
<v Speaker 2>So I would think that for a guy like you,</v>

3883
01:35:57.411 --> 01:36:00.230
<v Speaker 2>like there'd be a real benefit and training at a place like big bear.</v>

3884
01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:00.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3885
01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:03.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't make enough money to pay for a camp,</v>

3886
01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:04.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3887
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:05.480
<v Speaker 2>and I do do see Vac,</v>

3888
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.951
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>

3889
01:36:05.951 --> 01:36:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever yeah,</v>

3890
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:07.130
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3891
01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:09.380
<v Speaker 2>What Seabeck explain that though for it is,</v>

3892
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:10.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3893
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:11.290
<v Speaker 2>let me try it and be split at 10.</v>

3894
01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Like Bj has.</v>

3895
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:12.711
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3896
01:36:12.711 --> 01:36:13.181
<v Speaker 2>it would have,</v>

3897
01:36:13.181 --> 01:36:14.900
<v Speaker 2>or the sleeping bag.</v>

3898
01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:15.733
<v Speaker 2>It's an egg.</v>

3899
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:18.380
<v Speaker 2>And that egg you sit in and you're getting,</v>

3900
01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:21.380
<v Speaker 2>like you're sitting in a recliner and basically it's,</v>

3901
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:23.180
<v Speaker 2>it does the elevation,</v>

3902
01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:23.861
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

3903
01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:25.490
<v Speaker 2>it's changes to temperature,</v>

3904
01:36:25.491 --> 01:36:27.230
<v Speaker 2>density of air elevation.</v>

3905
01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:28.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3906
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:29.390
<v Speaker 2>a few,</v>

3907
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:32.240
<v Speaker 2>a few different things where it makes your body at a cellular level,</v>

3908
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:36.950
<v Speaker 2>flex and expel all the bad stuff and you're just ready to suck and you feel</v>

3909
01:36:36.951 --> 01:36:37.311
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

3910
01:36:37.311 --> 01:36:38.121
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll shoot from,</v>

3911
01:36:38.121 --> 01:36:43.121
<v Speaker 2>from sea level up to 25,000 feet within 20 seconds and then shoot back down and</v>

3912
01:36:43.671 --> 01:36:43.941
<v Speaker 2>then up.</v>

3913
01:36:43.941 --> 01:36:45.350
<v Speaker 2>And they do this rhythmic stuff to it.</v>

3914
01:36:45.351 --> 01:36:48.230
<v Speaker 2>And you have why you do breathing exercises and it,</v>

3915
01:36:48.231 --> 01:36:49.064
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3946
01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:25.590
<v Speaker 2>I go to a cent in Newport beach and it,</v>

3947
01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

3948
01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I'll do 20 minutes sessions,</v>

3949
01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I'll do three of them and they just pound.</v>

3950
01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.351
<v Speaker 2>I pound out,</v>

3951
01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:30.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3952
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:31.490
<v Speaker 2>a lot of like this for the good,</v>

3953
01:37:31.491 --> 01:37:31.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3954
01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.370
<v Speaker 2>9.5 ph or whatever while I'm in there.</v>

3955
01:37:34.371 --> 01:37:35.030
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>

3956
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I feel amazing.</v>

3957
01:37:35.911 --> 01:37:37.760
<v Speaker 2>And then I do breathing exercises while I'm in there,</v>

3958
01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:39.380
<v Speaker 2>so I'll hold my breath.</v>

3959
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.040
<v Speaker 2>And what it does is when you shoot up an elevation,</v>

3960
01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:46.550
<v Speaker 2>you're already full of oxygen and it stretches your lungs.</v>

01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:47.383
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>

3962

3963
01:37:48.130 --> 01:37:50.600
<v Speaker 2>there's no other way to get this feeling that I've ever felt.</v>

3964
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:52.490
<v Speaker 2>It literally stretches your lungs out,</v>

3965
01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:53.324
<v Speaker 2>then you</v>

3966
01:37:54.670 --> 01:37:55.441
<v Speaker 2>and then breathe again.</v>

3967
01:37:55.441 --> 01:37:56.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>From my area.</v>

4155
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And there's a bunch of them now,</v>

4156
01:42:22.481 --> 01:42:22.721
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4157
01:42:22.721 --> 01:42:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4158
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:24.610
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying power balance that that coverage,</v>

4159
01:42:24.650 --> 01:42:26.830
<v Speaker 1>the one at least was done by when they get in jail.</v>

4160
01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Did they have to go to jail?</v>

4161
01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:29.173
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

4162
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:30.063
<v Speaker 1>Did they get away?</v>

4163
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know there was some like crazy losses,</v>

4164
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.400
<v Speaker 1>whether there was them or someone else,</v>

4165
01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:36.130
<v Speaker 1>you just had to get money or they had to stop doing something.</v>

4166
01:42:36.131 --> 01:42:36.641
<v Speaker 1>And I know,</v>

4167
01:42:36.641 --> 01:42:37.331
<v Speaker 1>I know went under,</v>

4168
01:42:37.331 --> 01:42:39.370
<v Speaker 1>but they made a boatload of money while they could.</v>

4169
01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:39.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4170
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:44.590
<v Speaker 1>if you sold something that gave you the kind of confidence that made you believe</v>

4171
01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:45.360
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4172
01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that a product?</v>

4173
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you got all those fucking positive,</v>

4174
01:42:49.570 --> 01:42:50.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4175
01:42:50.021 --> 01:42:52.180
<v Speaker 1>you look at like those stupid rubber band.</v>

4176
01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:52.621
<v Speaker 1>Thanks man.</v>

4177
01:42:52.621 --> 01:42:54.670
<v Speaker 1>It's so many people were telling me how great they are.</v>

4178
01:42:54.850 --> 01:42:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I want them just to wedges just to,</v>

4179
01:42:56.201 --> 01:42:57.250
<v Speaker 1>just to where it's all people.</v>

4180
01:42:57.370 --> 01:42:59.260
<v Speaker 1>So for one I can try to get the sponsorship out of it.</v>

4181
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4182
01:42:59.690 --> 01:42:59.991
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

4183
01:42:59.991 --> 01:43:00.610
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

4184
01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

4185
01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was bullshit,</v>

4186
01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.570
<v Speaker 1>but if it did actually help because everybody else had them on,</v>

4187
01:43:04.571 --> 01:43:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing.</v>

4188
01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the only reason why I was willing to believe outlook?</v>

4189
01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I've been willing to believe a lot of dumb shit in my life.</v>

4190
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Psychics and fucking Tarot card readers and I've been leading,</v>

4191
01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:15.250
<v Speaker 1>willing to believe a lot of stupid shit.</v>

4192
01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:20.370
<v Speaker 1>But the reason why I didn't believe in this one when it got down to it was that</v>

4193
01:43:20.741 --> 01:43:22.750
<v Speaker 1>the dude who was trying to demonstrate it on me,</v>

4194
01:43:22.751 --> 01:43:24.310
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to do carnival tricks.</v>

4195
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:25.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:28.600

4202
01:43:31.661 --> 01:43:32.920
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same position.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that you could put on that makes you feel better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Two hours.</v>

4307
01:45:51.850 --> 01:45:52.251
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

01:45:52.251 --> 01:45:53.600
<v Speaker 1>this is just ridiculous.</v>

4309

4312
01:45:58.611 --> 01:45:59.031
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even,</v>

4313
01:45:59.031 --> 01:46:02.970
<v Speaker 1>my dad drove from my family dealership in debt like downtown La next to staple</v>

4314
01:46:03.010 --> 01:46:03.240
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's my families.</v>

4317
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:09.440
<v Speaker 1>He would drive from there down to Laguna Niguel and then to San Clemente after</v>

4318
01:46:09.441 --> 01:46:14.441
<v Speaker 1>we moved to San Clemente on the beach for 30 years there for some really fucking</v>

4319
01:46:16.401 --> 01:46:16.940
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

4320
01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:17.980
<v Speaker 1>How old were you when you moved?</v>

4321
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:20.120
<v Speaker 1>You lived on the beach like right on the beach?</v>

4322
01:46:20.150 --> 01:46:20.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:23.870
<v Speaker 1>like I walk on my balcony and I could be,</v>

4325
01:46:23.871 --> 01:46:24.231
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

4326
01:46:24.231 --> 01:46:24.441
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

4327
01:46:24.441 --> 01:46:25.540
<v Speaker 1>it could be two in the morning.</v>

4328
01:46:25.570 --> 01:46:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I could grab a group of people and run and jump in the water naked and run back</v>

4329
01:46:28.581 --> 01:46:30.110
<v Speaker 1>in the house without getting caught.</v>

4330
01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4331
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:33.440
<v Speaker 1>How old were you then when you guys moved to the beach?</v>

4332
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:38.890
<v Speaker 1>We moved there when I was 16 or 17 and I believe and we do find in any way that</v>

4333
01:46:39.231 --> 01:46:41.060
<v Speaker 1>that had a change in your,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in your demeanor at all,</v>

01:46:42.981 --> 01:46:44.360
<v Speaker 1>like being by the water?</v>

4336
01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:44.781
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4337
01:46:44.781 --> 01:46:46.990
<v Speaker 1>cause I already had lived in Laguna Niguel like,</v>

4338
01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:48.710
<v Speaker 1>like a couple of miles from the beach.</v>

4339
01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:49.650
<v Speaker 1>I was at the beach.</v>

4340
01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

4341
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.730
<v Speaker 2>where our whole little fight crew came from was Salt Creek beached in Dana point</v>

4342
01:46:53.731 --> 01:46:54.780
<v Speaker 2>was that was our beach.</v>

4343
01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:55.351
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4344
01:46:55.351 --> 01:46:56.340
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing in our beach?</v>

4345
01:46:56.341 --> 01:46:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Like beat it,</v>

4346

4348
01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:00.240
<v Speaker 2>We had a bunch of pro surfer friends and bodyboard friends and,</v>

4349
01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:02.790
<v Speaker 2>and you would just bully people and kick them off the beach and throw water</v>

4350
01:47:02.791 --> 01:47:03.181
<v Speaker 2>balloons,</v>

4351
01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:03.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4352
01:47:03.391 --> 01:47:04.740
<v Speaker 2>and like it bad it now.</v>

4353
01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.300
<v Speaker 2>It always not really.</v>

4354
01:47:06.301 --> 01:47:07.134
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of fun.</v>

4355
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.990
<v Speaker 2>It was our beach though.</v>

4356
01:47:10.330 --> 01:47:10.931
<v Speaker 2>It was different,</v>

4357
01:47:10.931 --> 01:47:11.110
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4358
01:47:11.110 --> 01:47:12.060
<v Speaker 2>That's so douchey though.</v>

4359
01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I just want to use the ocean,</v>

4360
01:47:13.381 --> 01:47:14.214
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4361
01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.060
<v Speaker 2>We were such to be recessed Douche bag.</v>

4362
01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Is there a difference in uh,</v>

4363
01:47:19.410 --> 01:47:22.380
<v Speaker 2>being by the water all the time and living at the water?</v>

4364
01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4365
01:47:22.890 --> 01:47:23.790
<v Speaker 2>I've always wondered,</v>

4366
01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 2>like for me there is,</v>

4367
01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:29.520
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend was a beach house and it costs like 4 million bucks and it looks</v>

4368
01:47:29.521 --> 01:47:30.720
<v Speaker 2>like it should be like 50.</v>

4369
01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.220
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>

4370
01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:33.061
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

4371
01:47:33.061 --> 01:47:34.590
<v Speaker 2>this is not a $4 million house man.</v>

4372
01:47:34.591 --> 01:47:35.880
<v Speaker 2>And you're right next door to the neighbor.</v>

4373
01:47:35.881 --> 01:47:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the nuttiest thing ever.</v>

4374
01:47:37.171 --> 01:47:37.321
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4375
01:47:37.321 --> 01:47:39.780
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck did somebody get you to pay for $1 million for this?</v>

4376
01:47:39.810 --> 01:47:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4377
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:42.630
<v Speaker 2>You could have like a castle in Colorado.</v>

4378
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:43.421
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4379

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4380
01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:47.850
<v Speaker 2>You could have a hundred acres with elk wandering through your yard instead.</v>

4381
01:47:47.851 --> 01:47:49.380
<v Speaker 2>You're not jammed up on your neighbor.</v>

4382
01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.473
<v Speaker 2>But he was like,</v>

4383
01:47:50.610 --> 01:47:53.460
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter when you get up and you see the ocean,</v>

4384
01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:54.740
<v Speaker 2>you look out your window to see the ocean.</v>

4385
01:47:54.741 --> 01:47:55.170
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

01:48:52.651 --> 01:48:56.320
<v Speaker 2>but I would just like an evil character in a fucking teeny bopper movie.</v>

4440
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I was a horrible kid thinking about it.</v>

4441
01:48:59.050 --> 01:49:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Like there was like a 16 candles type movie.</v>

4442
01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I really feel like the ultimate bad character,</v>

4443
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:06.270
<v Speaker 2>but then you know what?</v>

4444
01:49:06.271 --> 01:49:09.300
<v Speaker 2>They'd probably be a girl in the movie and you fall in love with her and you</v>

4445
01:49:09.301 --> 01:49:10.170
<v Speaker 2>would change for her.</v>

4446
01:49:10.171 --> 01:49:11.160
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happening right now.</v>

4447
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4448
01:49:12.230 --> 01:49:13.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a bit of review.</v>

4449
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.863
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

4450
01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:19.020
<v Speaker 2>just thinking about your driving your dad's Porsche around living in the fucking</v>

4451
01:49:19.021 --> 01:49:20.010
<v Speaker 2>beach and shit.</v>

4452
01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:21.630
<v Speaker 2>And kicking guys asked is like,</v>

4453
01:49:21.631 --> 01:49:22.830
<v Speaker 2>what a constantly,</v>

4454
01:49:22.890 --> 01:49:23.723
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

4455
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:24.541
<v Speaker 2>my dad would bring,</v>

4456
01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:25.500
<v Speaker 2>he would go kill fish,</v>

4457
01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:25.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4458
01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:29.560
<v Speaker 2>big tuna or whatever had in Mexico and come back with a whole fish whole to,</v>

4459
01:49:29.590 --> 01:49:31.760
<v Speaker 2>and just literally we would eat it.</v>

4460
01:49:31.770 --> 01:49:32.760
<v Speaker 2>They don't get any fresher than that.</v>

4461
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4462
01:49:32.941 --> 01:49:33.560
<v Speaker 2>he's cutting up,</v>

4463
01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.870
<v Speaker 2>he's gutting it and then giving you a Sushi is amazing.</v>

4464
01:49:36.871 --> 01:49:38.400
<v Speaker 2>I've never done any tuna fishing,</v>

4465
01:49:38.401 --> 01:49:42.210
<v Speaker 2>but my friend Tommy did and he said they ate Tunis Sashimi on the boat.</v>

4466
01:49:42.211 --> 01:49:42.451
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

4467
01:49:42.451 --> 01:49:43.650
<v Speaker 2>it's the most ridiculous thing.</v>

4468
01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.150
<v Speaker 2>You can't even believe how good it tastes.</v>

4469
01:49:45.151 --> 01:49:45.381
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4470
01:49:45.381 --> 01:49:46.200
<v Speaker 2>it's a different,</v>

4471
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.033
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole different,</v>

4472
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:48.243
<v Speaker 2>and I mean</v>

4473
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:49.203
<v Speaker 1>to now it's a,</v>

4474
01:49:49.630 --> 01:49:50.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking torpedo.</v>

4475
01:49:50.691 --> 01:49:51.250
<v Speaker 1>A muscle.</v>

4476
01:49:51.250 --> 01:49:51.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4477
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:51.731
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>

4478
01:49:51.731 --> 01:49:54.190
<v Speaker 1>that's the best fighting fish in the ocean.</v>

4479
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:55.121
<v Speaker 1>Tuna,</v>

4480
01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:56.080
<v Speaker 1>albacore like that.</v>

4481
01:49:56.081 --> 01:49:56.501
<v Speaker 1>Rent those,</v>

4482
01:49:56.501 --> 01:49:56.860
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

4483
01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:57.430
<v Speaker 1>those g,</v>

4484
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.971
<v Speaker 1>the jacks,</v>

4485
01:49:57.971 --> 01:49:58.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4486
01:49:58.630 --> 01:49:59.441
<v Speaker 1>maybe like yellow tail.</v>

4487
01:49:59.441 --> 01:50:00.274
<v Speaker 1>But tuna is the best.</v>

4488
01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:00.701
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

4489
01:50:00.701 --> 01:50:01.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4490
01:50:01.450 --> 01:50:04.150
<v Speaker 1>and then also the best eating drought was fun.</v>

4491
01:50:04.151 --> 01:50:04.571
<v Speaker 1>The pretty,</v>

4492
01:50:04.571 --> 01:50:05.141
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4493
01:50:05.141 --> 01:50:05.830
<v Speaker 1>we're selfish.</v>

4494
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:06.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4495
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:06.641
<v Speaker 1>there was a fun,</v>

4496
01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:07.090
<v Speaker 1>pretty bad,</v>

4497
01:50:07.090 --> 01:50:07.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4498
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:10.360
<v Speaker 1>tune is unbelievably delicious.</v>

4499
01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:10.931
<v Speaker 1>Especially,</v>

4500
01:50:10.931 --> 01:50:11.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4501
01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:13.720
<v Speaker 1>it's so delicious that it's preferred raw.</v>

4502
01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4503
01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean tuners preferred raw more than anything?</v>

4504
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:17.081
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese,</v>

4505
01:50:17.081 --> 01:50:19.000
<v Speaker 1>it paid over a million dollars for one fish.</v>

4506
01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I love Sushi.</v>

4507
01:50:22.150 --> 01:50:23.050
<v Speaker 1>How's that possible?</v>

4508
01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:24.213
<v Speaker 1>How's that possible?</v>

4509
01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:25.560
<v Speaker 1>You should not sure she makes it.</v>

4510
01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:25.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4511
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4512
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:27.220
<v Speaker 1>You can Google that shit.</v>

4513
01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:28.173
<v Speaker 1>You can't Google like,</v>

4514
01:50:28.350 --> 01:50:28.720
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

4515
01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:30.310
<v Speaker 1>this is at least 50 people listen to us.</v>

4516
01:50:30.311 --> 01:50:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I have to be really careful about telling the truth.</v>

4517
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.830
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

4518
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4519
01:50:33.250 --> 01:50:34.810
<v Speaker 1>largest amount paid for a tuna.</v>

4520
01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4521
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:37.360
<v Speaker 1>but they regularly get like 30,</v>

4522
01:50:37.361 --> 01:50:38.980
<v Speaker 1>$40,000 for a tuna catch.</v>

4523
01:50:38.981 --> 01:50:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4524
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:40.121
<v Speaker 1>If you go out,</v>

4525

4529
01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:46.990
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

4530
01:50:46.990 --> 01:50:47.830
<v Speaker 1>you were wrong.</v>

4531
01:50:48.110 --> 01:50:51.280
<v Speaker 1>You're ready for this 1.8 million.</v>

4532
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:51.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4533
01:50:51.441 --> 01:50:52.480
<v Speaker 1>well fuck me running.</v>

4534

<v Speaker 1>point $8 million.</v>

4537
01:51:00.731 --> 01:51:00.941
<v Speaker 1>We didn't,</v>

4538
01:51:00.941 --> 01:51:01.361
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

4539
01:51:01.361 --> 01:51:02.380
<v Speaker 1>It just means that they're there.</v>

4540
01:51:02.381 --> 01:51:05.230
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get them endangered because there are 500 pound,</v>

4541
01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:06.071
<v Speaker 1>a moderate size,</v>

4542
01:51:06.071 --> 01:51:11.071
<v Speaker 1>500 pound bluefin attentive and sold for an unimaginable price of nearly 1.8</v>

4543
01:51:12.281 --> 01:51:13.840
<v Speaker 1>million US dollars.</v>

4544
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.930
<v Speaker 1>A new record at a Tokyo fish auction.</v>

4545
01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4546
01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4547
01:51:19.090 --> 01:51:19.631
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4548
01:51:19.631 --> 01:51:21.860
<v Speaker 1>so that must be because the,</v>

4549
01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:24.350
<v Speaker 1>the supply is way down know.</v>

4550
01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4551
01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:26.410
<v Speaker 1>it's it because that those we need to stop.</v>

4552
01:51:26.411 --> 01:51:26.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4553
01:51:26.621 --> 01:51:28.120
<v Speaker 1>as much as I loved Bluefin Tuna,</v>

4554
01:51:28.150 --> 01:51:30.750
<v Speaker 1>we need to farm it and we need to let it rebuild in the,</v>

4555
01:51:30.751 --> 01:51:30.941
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

4556
01:51:30.941 --> 01:51:31.181
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

4557
01:51:31.181 --> 01:51:31.421
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

4558
01:51:31.421 --> 01:51:32.050
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking,</v>

4559
01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:33.670
<v Speaker 1>if we ever want to fish it again because,</v>

4560
01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:34.751
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4561
01:51:34.751 --> 01:51:35.441
<v Speaker 1>But hold on.</v>

4562
01:51:35.441 --> 01:51:39.580
<v Speaker 1>There's some fuckery here at saint supposedly the high prices paid at the annual</v>

4563
01:51:39.581 --> 01:51:40.241
<v Speaker 1>new year's.</v>

4564
01:51:40.241 --> 01:51:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Tuna's auction,</v>

4565
01:51:41.291 --> 01:51:44.050
<v Speaker 1>tuna auction in Tokyo are a way to celebrate,</v>

4566
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:49.270
<v Speaker 1>more likely is about publicity and do not reflect actual market price.</v>

4567
01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:50.711
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

4568
01:51:50.711 --> 01:51:54.550
<v Speaker 1>the continued increasing price buyers are paying for Bluefin tuna mirrors.</v>

4569
01:51:54.551 --> 01:51:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It's increasing rarity.</v>

4570
01:51:55.930 --> 01:51:56.231
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4571
01:51:56.231 --> 01:52:00.010
<v Speaker 1>so this is a really unusual circumstance for this.</v>

4572
01:52:00.011 --> 01:52:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Probably fuckery.</v>

4573
01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:01.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4574
01:52:01.661 --> 01:52:03.970
<v Speaker 1>they probably did that just so people are paying attention.</v>

4575
01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4576
01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:06.070
<v Speaker 1>There could be some crazy shit going on.</v>

4577
01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:08.260
<v Speaker 1>The old price was pretty high anyway though.</v>

4578
01:52:08.261 --> 01:52:11.260
<v Speaker 1>The old record was $740,000.</v>

4579
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4580
01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Holy fucking shit.</v>

4581
01:52:13.091 --> 01:52:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And that wasn't even supposedly fucked with that.</v>

4582
01:52:15.701 --> 01:52:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly a real record.</v>

4583
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.160
<v Speaker 1>That's biggest.</v>

4584
01:52:18.161 --> 01:52:18.994
<v Speaker 1>Those things get,</v>

4585
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I got to be a thousand pounds.</v>

4586
01:52:20.351 --> 01:52:22.000
<v Speaker 1>I think you gotta be okay.</v>

4587
01:52:22.001 --> 01:52:22.601
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out.</v>

4588
01:52:22.601 --> 01:52:23.500
<v Speaker 1>World record tuna.</v>

4589
01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared now.</v>

4590
01:52:24.610 --> 01:52:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of catching it.</v>

4591
01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine you're just,</v>

4592
01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you're in for a fucking fights on if he's gonna rip your arms off,</v>

4593
01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:31.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4594
01:52:31.121 --> 01:52:34.060
<v Speaker 1>that has a thousand pound ball or whatever,</v>

4595
01:52:34.090 --> 01:52:35.260
<v Speaker 1>but however many pounds it is,</v>

4596
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.100
<v Speaker 1>ball of muscle that just wants to eat and I mean,</v>

4597
01:52:39.101 --> 01:52:40.030
<v Speaker 1>those things could eat us.</v>

4598
01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Biggest fish I ever caught was a Marlin,</v>

4599
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Amanda.</v>

4600
01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:43.961
<v Speaker 1>It was not that big.</v>

4601
01:52:43.961 --> 01:52:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It was only about 70 pounds,</v>

4602
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:46.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

4603
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:50.480
<v Speaker 1>my oldest daughter was a vegetarian a little bit.</v>

4604
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:51.560
<v Speaker 1>She's trying to be a vegetarian.</v>

4605
01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:52.280
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

4606
01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:52.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4607
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:53.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4608
01:52:53.061 --> 01:52:54.200
<v Speaker 1>she's just a kind person.</v>

4609
01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4610
01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:55.760
<v Speaker 1>And at the time,</v>

4611
01:52:55.761 --> 01:52:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I think she's about probably 12,</v>

4612
01:52:57.580 --> 01:52:58.413
<v Speaker 1>if it makes sense.</v>

4613
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4614
01:52:59.120 --> 01:52:59.953
<v Speaker 1>About 12.</v>

4615
01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.710
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

4616
01:53:00.710 --> 01:53:01.230
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

4617
01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:02.570
<v Speaker 1>let's let's go fishing.</v>

4618
01:53:02.770 --> 01:53:03.441
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

4619
01:53:03.441 --> 01:53:04.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll catch a fish,</v>

4620
01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:04.911
<v Speaker 1>we'll cook it,</v>

4621
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:08.690
<v Speaker 1>will eat it and we'll understand sort of the cycle of life because you know we</v>

4622
01:53:08.691 --> 01:53:11.450
<v Speaker 1>buy things in the supermarket and we're very disconnected from it.</v>

4623
01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:12.950
<v Speaker 1>But you have to understand like these animals,</v>

4624
01:53:12.951 --> 01:53:14.660
<v Speaker 1>they eat each other and this is like,</v>

4625
01:53:14.661 --> 01:53:17.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a natural way for people to acquire food and its way.</v>

4626
01:53:17.301 --> 01:53:18.500
<v Speaker 1>People have done it throughout history,</v>

4627
01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:20.390
<v Speaker 1>but she tried to be like this really kind person.</v>

4628
01:53:20.391 --> 01:53:20.990
<v Speaker 1>So it was a,</v>

4629
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:22.190
<v Speaker 1>it was a moral reason.</v>

4630
01:53:22.191 --> 01:53:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Like she didn't want her to end.</v>

4631
01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Of course she loved animals.</v>

4632
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.883
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

4633
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.903
<v Speaker 1>we're fishing,</v>

4634
01:53:26.050 --> 01:53:28.940
<v Speaker 1>we fishing for maybe 15 minutes.</v>

4635
01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4636
01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:32.300
<v Speaker 1>And I hook a Marlin maybe 15 minutes.</v>

4637
01:53:32.301 --> 01:53:33.134
<v Speaker 1>That's unheard of.</v>

4638
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Like people fish for years and they never catch a Marlin.</v>

4639
01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.550
<v Speaker 1>It's total stupid lock.</v>

4640
01:53:37.570 --> 01:53:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4641
01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause there were trolling,</v>

4642
01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:40.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not like no skill whatsoever.</v>

4643
01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.080
<v Speaker 1>It just happened to hit my line.</v>

4644
01:53:42.230 --> 01:53:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So we get this mileage jumping through the air.</v>

4645
01:53:45.201 --> 01:53:46.040
<v Speaker 1>It's wild man.</v>

4646
01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:46.700
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool.</v>

4647
01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:47.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big.</v>

4648
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:48.970
<v Speaker 1>It's only like 70 pounds.</v>

4649
01:53:48.971 --> 01:53:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4650
01:53:49.290 --> 01:53:49.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4651
01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:50.513
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

4652
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4653
01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:52.003
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

4654
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:52.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many feet long,</v>

4655
01:53:52.881 --> 01:53:53.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's about,</v>

4656
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:54.610
<v Speaker 1>the guy said it was about 75 feet long.</v>

4657
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:57.790
<v Speaker 1>They get hundreds thousand over a thousand pounds.</v>

4658
01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Well this fucking thing,</v>

4659
01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:00.200
<v Speaker 1>they pull it,</v>

4660
01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.130
<v Speaker 1>they gaff it,</v>

4661
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:05.960
<v Speaker 1>they bring it in the boat and then they beat the fucking shit out of it with a</v>

4662
01:54:05.961 --> 01:54:06.794
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

4663
01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:08.120
<v Speaker 1>And the way it works,</v>

4664
01:54:08.121 --> 01:54:08.954
<v Speaker 1>we were in Hawaii,</v>

4665
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:10.130
<v Speaker 1>in Hawaii,</v>

4666
01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:10.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4667
01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:11.001
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4668
01:54:11.001 --> 01:54:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the owners of the boat,</v>

4669
01:54:12.710 --> 01:54:13.690
<v Speaker 1>they own the fish.</v>

4670
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Like if you catch fish,</v>

4671
01:54:14.901 --> 01:54:16.400
<v Speaker 1>they'll take you and you'll enjoy it.</v>

4672
01:54:16.401 --> 01:54:17.940
<v Speaker 1>But it's also their livelihood.</v>

4673
01:54:17.941 --> 01:54:18.890
<v Speaker 1>It's how they make living.</v>

4674
01:54:18.891 --> 01:54:19.724
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

4675
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:22.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a different sort of a situation that a lot of charters,</v>

4676
01:54:22.251 --> 01:54:22.741
<v Speaker 1>it's like they,</v>

4677
01:54:22.741 --> 01:54:24.530
<v Speaker 1>they want you to have a good time and,</v>

4678
01:54:24.531 --> 01:54:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but we know you're in a resort and this is our livelihood and we would like the</v>

4679
01:54:27.321 --> 01:54:27.801
<v Speaker 1>food too.</v>

4680
01:54:27.801 --> 01:54:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that cool?</v>

4681
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.941
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's like,</v>

4682
01:54:28.941 --> 01:54:29.091
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4683
01:54:29.091 --> 01:54:29.331
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>

4684
01:54:29.331 --> 01:54:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Cause otherwise like sometimes the food would go to waste and that's terrible.</v>

4685
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:36.680
<v Speaker 1>And I think they recognize that really early and they put the Kabash on it and</v>

4686
01:54:36.681 --> 01:54:37.011
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

4687
01:54:37.011 --> 01:54:37.191
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4688
01:54:37.191 --> 01:54:38.510
<v Speaker 1>people are just trying to have some fun.</v>

4689
01:54:38.630 --> 01:54:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's have them have some fun,</v>

4690
01:54:39.651 --> 01:54:40.131
<v Speaker 1>catch the fish,</v>

4691
01:54:40.131 --> 01:54:40.964
<v Speaker 1>but we'll eat the fish.</v>

4692
01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:45.020
<v Speaker 1>So they were gonna take it and apparently they bring it to a Luau and they</v>

4693
01:54:45.021 --> 01:54:45.854
<v Speaker 1>smoked the Moreland.</v>

4694
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:48.080
<v Speaker 1>And my poor little 12 year old is just sitting there.</v>

4695
01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And while this Marlin kitchen hope love,</v>

4696
01:54:52.730 --> 01:54:54.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's a big animal,</v>

4697
01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's in a boat with us and it's a fairly big beautiful animal that once</v>

4698
01:54:57.411 --> 01:54:57.861
<v Speaker 1>you kill it,</v>

4699
01:54:57.861 --> 01:54:58.790
<v Speaker 1>the color goes away.</v>

4700
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4701
01:54:59.270 --> 01:55:00.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's the size of a dog.</v>

4702
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4703
01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:03.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like a golden retriever size.</v>

4704
01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Wheaton it with clubs and it's,</v>

4705
01:55:06.110 --> 01:55:07.130
<v Speaker 1>it's real man.</v>

4706
01:55:07.131 --> 01:55:07.911
<v Speaker 1>Some real shit.</v>

4707
01:55:07.911 --> 01:55:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And when you're a 12 year old girl wanted to be a vegetarian,</v>

4708
01:55:10.281 --> 01:55:10.760
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

4709
01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:12.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucked up thing to say.</v>

4710
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4711
01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:13.430
<v Speaker 1>It didn't die right away either,</v>

4712
01:55:13.431 --> 01:55:14.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4713
01:55:14.150 --> 01:55:15.200
<v Speaker 1>It was flopping around,</v>

4714
01:55:15.201 --> 01:55:16.490
<v Speaker 1>they had ice on it and it did.</v>

4715
01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:17.660
<v Speaker 1>It was fine.</v>

4716
01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:18.620
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't moving at all.</v>

4717
01:55:18.621 --> 01:55:20.230
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw out of nowhere to fuck off,</v>

4718
01:55:20.231 --> 01:55:20.351
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

4719
01:55:20.351 --> 01:55:20.471
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

4720
01:55:20.471 --> 01:55:20.621
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

4721
01:55:20.621 --> 01:55:20.771
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

4722
01:55:20.771 --> 01:55:20.921
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

4723
01:55:20.921 --> 01:55:21.081
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

4724
01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:21.800
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

4725
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:24.020
<v Speaker 1>It was devastating,</v>

4726
01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:24.861
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>

4727
01:55:24.861 --> 01:55:27.230
<v Speaker 1>And we didn't catch another fucking thing for the rest of the trip.</v>

4728
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:28.341
<v Speaker 1>We caught this one,</v>

4729
01:55:28.341 --> 01:55:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Marlin.</v>

4730
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:32.090
<v Speaker 1>And then the rest of the day was just looking down at this murder victim was in</v>

4731
01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:32.924
<v Speaker 1>the boat.</v>

4732
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:34.640
<v Speaker 1>They're dead.</v>

4733
01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.980
<v Speaker 1>And then afterwards taking photos together.</v>

4734
01:55:36.981 --> 01:55:40.160
<v Speaker 1>This is like really a weird look on her face.</v>

4735
01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking murder victim that we clubbed to death.</v>

4736
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.060
<v Speaker 2>We didn't clubbed to death,</v>

4737
01:55:45.090 --> 01:55:46.470
<v Speaker 2>but we aided and abetted.</v>

4738
01:55:46.490 --> 01:55:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4739
01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:48.090
<v Speaker 2>tricked it into the boat.</v>

4740
01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:49.980
<v Speaker 2>But they're uh,</v>

4741
01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:51.870
<v Speaker 2>apparently you can't eat Marlin.</v>

4742
01:55:51.871 --> 01:55:52.740
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't know.</v>

4743
01:55:52.741 --> 01:55:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know you can't eat them,</v>

4744
01:55:53.761 --> 01:55:54.690
<v Speaker 2>but apparently you can.</v>

4745
01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:55.920
<v Speaker 2>What is the size of that one?</v>

4746
01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:57.900
<v Speaker 2>920 pound tuna caught last week.</v>

4747
01:55:58.020 --> 01:55:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

4748
01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>

4749
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:01.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4750
01:56:01.351 --> 01:56:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I hope my dad's watching this.</v>

4751
01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.331
<v Speaker 2>What a fuck.</v>

4752
01:56:03.331 --> 01:56:06.240
<v Speaker 2>And they have to attach it to a fucking crane,</v>

4753
01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:08.670
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen to get it out of the water.</v>

4754
01:56:08.671 --> 01:56:10.290
<v Speaker 2>They hook it up to a crane.</v>

4755
01:56:11.710 --> 01:56:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I love Kimmy Fishman.</v>

4756
01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Killin fishes is a good time.</v>

4757
01:56:14.490 --> 01:56:14.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4758
01:56:14.641 --> 01:56:16.110
<v Speaker 2>if you grew up near the ocean,</v>

4759
01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:18.840
<v Speaker 2>did it look at the size of this fucking thing?</v>

4760
01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

4761
01:56:21.150 --> 01:56:21.990
<v Speaker 2>that's a tuna.</v>

4762
01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:23.130
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

4763
01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:25.050
<v Speaker 2>What a big animal.</v>

4764
01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:25.943
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

4765
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean that thing you think of the speed,</v>

4766
01:56:28.710 --> 01:56:32.580
<v Speaker 2>those things get so big they die off because they can't get enough food.</v>

4767
01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:34.680
<v Speaker 2>They just eat and eat and eat.</v>

4768
01:56:34.681 --> 01:56:34.891
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4769
01:56:34.891 --> 01:56:36.390
<v Speaker 2>that's their whole life is spent hunting.</v>

4770
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4771
01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:38.493
<v Speaker 2>they are like,</v>

4772
01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:39.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4773
01:56:39.150 --> 01:56:39.983
<v Speaker 2>vicious.</v>

4774
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:42.390
<v Speaker 2>What is the biggest one ever?</v>

4775
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:43.743
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

4776
01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4777
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:48.030
<v Speaker 2>we've got to find out now because the biggest two never caught it's gotta be</v>

4778
01:56:48.810 --> 01:56:49.351
<v Speaker 2>that one was what?</v>

4779
01:56:49.351 --> 01:56:53.130
<v Speaker 2>900 what it's gotta be maybe 12 1300 pounds,</v>

4780
01:56:53.131 --> 01:56:53.870
<v Speaker 2>I would think.</v>

4781
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4782
01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:54.900
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

4783
01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:56.580
<v Speaker 2>What's the world record tune await.</v>

4784
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:59.340
<v Speaker 2>They're so cool looking to man.</v>

4785
01:56:59.490 --> 01:57:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if there was like tuna that had four legs and when run down a</v>

4786
01:57:03.631 --> 01:57:05.310
<v Speaker 2>field looking like that?</v>

4787
01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Glistening and blue.</v>

4788
01:57:06.801 --> 01:57:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Just running like a bullet.</v>

4789
01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Fucking up every other animal in his path at pack hunting.</v>

4790
01:57:11.611 --> 01:57:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Just eating lions and shits.</v>

4791
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Managing of a fucking tuna could run on ground as fast as it could swim.</v>

4792
01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:19.891
<v Speaker 2>That's frightening.</v>

4793
01:57:19.891 --> 01:57:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4794
01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:20.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4795
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I always think of weird shit like that.</v>

4796
01:57:22.530 --> 01:57:23.363
<v Speaker 2>Like about the fucking,</v>

4797
01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:25.270
<v Speaker 2>what if parents were the size of,</v>

4798
01:57:25.330 --> 01:57:28.480
<v Speaker 2>and they walked off for us like dogs and I,</v>

4799
01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of birds in general cause they always hate me.</v>

4800
01:57:30.361 --> 01:57:31.800
<v Speaker 2>But you should be afraid of birds.</v>

4801
01:57:31.801 --> 01:57:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Birds are cunts.</v>

4802
01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:32.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4803
01:57:32.881 --> 01:57:34.140
<v Speaker 2>And the evil man.</v>

4804
01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 2>And they're vicious killers.</v>

4805
01:57:36.961 --> 01:57:37.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4806
01:57:37.201 --> 01:57:38.520
<v Speaker 2>They fucking art man.</v>

4807
01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:39.280
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

4808
01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.113
<v Speaker 2>they're creepy.</v>

4809
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:41.300
<v Speaker 2>The creepy animal.</v>

4810
01:57:41.301 --> 01:57:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

4811
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:42.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4812
01:57:42.630 --> 01:57:44.400
<v Speaker 2>they don't really give a fuck about anything.</v>

4813
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>

4814
01:57:45.531 --> 01:57:50.531
<v Speaker 2>they're in a real survival of the fittest gene pool situation.</v>

4815
01:57:50.731 --> 01:57:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4816
01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:51.903
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4817
01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:54.540
<v Speaker 2>we're just lucky that they're not that big.</v>

4818
01:57:55.130 --> 01:57:57.090
<v Speaker 2>He management birds like the size of giraffes.</v>

4819
01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:59.040
<v Speaker 2>If Eagles like the size of the giraffes,</v>

4820
01:57:59.041 --> 01:58:01.080
<v Speaker 2>they would be eating people all day.</v>

4821
01:58:01.110 --> 01:58:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Nothing we could do to stop him.</v>

4822
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:02.641
<v Speaker 2>We'd have,</v>

4823
01:58:02.641 --> 01:58:03.810
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to kill them all.</v>

4824
01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:05.880
<v Speaker 2>And it sounds like a ridiculous thing to say.</v>

4825
01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Marriage in the world of two and who could run the world?</v>

4826
01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Egos and size of drafts.</v>

4827
01:58:10.531 --> 01:58:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what asshole.</v>

4828
01:58:11.730 --> 01:58:13.380
<v Speaker 2>A giraffe's the size of a giraffe.</v>

4829
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4830
01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:15.720
<v Speaker 2>There are animals that are that big.</v>

4831
01:58:15.930 --> 01:58:17.520
<v Speaker 2>We're just lucky they don't eat people.</v>

4832
01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

4833
01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:18.990
<v Speaker 2>We're lucky they're not against us.</v>

4834
01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:20.880
<v Speaker 2>We probably would've never got to this place that they did.</v>

4835
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where we're,</v>

4836
01:58:23.590 --> 01:58:24.450
<v Speaker 2>we're kinda tricky.</v>

4837
01:58:24.451 --> 01:58:24.691
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

4838
01:58:24.691 --> 01:58:26.130
<v Speaker 2>we've seem to Conaway this far.</v>

4839
01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think it would have happened.</v>

4840
01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.001
<v Speaker 2>I think we,</v>

4841
01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:29.330
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

4842
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:31.320
<v Speaker 2>we came along like the premiere,</v>

4843
01:58:31.321 --> 01:58:35.010
<v Speaker 2>like boxes that became heavyweights after Mike Tyson and lost his prime.</v>

4844
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I like finding a gap.</v>

4845
01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:40.890
<v Speaker 2>We were like falling into this like relaxed period.</v>

4846
01:58:41.290 --> 01:58:42.050
<v Speaker 2>My way through this.</v>

4847
01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:42.851
<v Speaker 1>Through evolution.</v>

4848
01:58:42.851 --> 01:58:44.540
<v Speaker 1>It was way easier to survive ourselves.</v>

4849
01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs got hit by that rock,</v>

4850
01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:47.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4851
01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:49.810
<v Speaker 1>after buster Douglas came along and he shrunk Tyson,</v>

4852
01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:51.280
<v Speaker 1>the world got a little safer.</v>

4853
01:58:51.590 --> 01:58:52.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4854
01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:54.640
<v Speaker 1>back in those days I cried myself to sleep and that happened.</v>

4855
01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:58.120
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird thing to see because I watched it after the fact.</v>

4856
01:58:58.121 --> 01:58:59.260
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see the fight live.</v>

4857
01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I had heard what happened and I still didn't believe it happened.</v>

4858
01:59:01.611 --> 01:59:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Now I was watching it.</v>

4859
01:59:02.471 --> 01:59:02.681
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4860
01:59:02.681 --> 01:59:03.251
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get up.</v>

4861
01:59:03.251 --> 01:59:04.150
<v Speaker 1>He's going to kick his ass.</v>

4862
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:05.171
<v Speaker 1>That's my game.</v>

4863
01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:06.760
<v Speaker 1>My brother both literally cried.</v>

4864
01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:07.773
<v Speaker 1>I turned around,</v>

4865
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I cried.</v>

4866
01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I like bawling to our parents.</v>

4867
01:59:10.031 --> 01:59:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4868
01:59:10.450 --> 01:59:10.850
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

4869
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:11.151
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

4870
01:59:11.151 --> 01:59:11.980
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

4871
01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Why did that happen?</v>

4872
01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't remember the last time I got emotionally attached to a fight and I</v>

4873
01:59:17.121 --> 01:59:21.400
<v Speaker 1>was devastated when a fighter lost it was Mike Mccallum when he knocked out</v>

4874
01:59:21.401 --> 01:59:22.234
<v Speaker 1>Donald Curry.</v>

4875
01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:23.890
<v Speaker 1>I was a big Donald Curry fan.</v>

4876
01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Donald Curry was the welterweight champion at the time.</v>

4877
01:59:26.041 --> 01:59:26.551
<v Speaker 1>Donald McKinney,</v>

4878
01:59:26.551 --> 01:59:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I think he went up to one 54.</v>

4879
01:59:28.090 --> 01:59:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Donald Curry like ruined his career because he kept cutting weight down to one</v>

4880
01:59:31.511 --> 01:59:32.260
<v Speaker 1>47.</v>

4881
01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't do it anymore.</v>

4882
01:59:33.730 --> 01:59:34.990
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't do it anymore.</v>

4883
01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:36.153
<v Speaker 1>He had um,</v>

4884
01:59:36.610 --> 01:59:38.500
<v Speaker 1>those fights with a,</v>

4885
01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:39.361
<v Speaker 1>not Macau,</v>

4886
01:59:39.361 --> 01:59:40.210
<v Speaker 1>but who was the other,</v>

4887
01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:41.620
<v Speaker 1>there was another like really strong,</v>

4888
01:59:41.621 --> 01:59:46.390
<v Speaker 1>well Twitter Cronk fighter from that era and he'd knocked that dude out and</v>

4889
01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Donald Curry merge.</v>

4890
01:59:47.461 --> 01:59:49.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like the top pound for pound guy.</v>

4891
01:59:49.151 --> 01:59:52.330
<v Speaker 1>But then he fought Lloyd Huntington and he was just too dehydrated.</v>

4892
01:59:52.331 --> 01:59:53.430
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't fucking do it anymore.</v>

4893
01:59:53.431 --> 01:59:54.610
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't the same guy.</v>

4894
01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:55.391
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's like,</v>

4895
01:59:55.391 --> 01:59:56.860
<v Speaker 1>that's the top pound for pound fighter.</v>

4896
01:59:56.861 --> 01:59:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And that one beating to Lloyd Huntington,</v>

4897
01:59:59.170 --> 01:59:59.700
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

4898
01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:00.730
<v Speaker 1>he never was the same again.</v>

4899
02:00:00.731 --> 02:00:04.330
<v Speaker 1>He went up to one 54 and then he didn't have the physical advantages.</v>

4900
02:00:04.331 --> 02:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>And you had it 47 and when you see the UFC and you see like that this is,</v>

4901
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>especially in a higher way classes,</v>

4902
02:00:12.190 --> 02:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>there's know big gaps,</v>

4903
02:00:13.570 --> 02:00:13.870
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>

4904
02:00:13.870 --> 02:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>And between the way classes,</v>

4905
02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>what would you like it,</v>

4906
02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:17.140
<v Speaker 1>how would you,</v>

4907
02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:17.830
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

4908
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>if someone could like allow you to create the optimum weight divisions,</v>

4909
02:00:22.481 --> 02:00:23.470
<v Speaker 1>what do you think it would be?</v>

4910
02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:25.473
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4911
02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:28.480
<v Speaker 1>she just don't want too many,</v>

4912
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:29.201
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4913
02:00:29.201 --> 02:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>But I think there would be,</v>

4914
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>we would really figure out who is pound for pound the best,</v>

4915
02:00:34.630 --> 02:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4916
02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

4917
02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:37.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 pounds cause boxing,</v>

4918
02:00:37.571 --> 02:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>there's so many champions he just gets,</v>

4919
02:00:39.610 --> 02:00:40.450
<v Speaker 1>it gets diluted.</v>

4920
02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4921
02:00:40.930 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 1>in boxing is a sport in general is a box that has a bunch of different</v>

4922
02:00:43.691 --> 02:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>sanctioning buddies too.</v>

4923
02:00:44.631 --> 02:00:45.850
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets really weird.</v>

4924
02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:46.751
<v Speaker 1>It's almost weird.</v>

4925
02:00:46.751 --> 02:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Are there?</v>

4926
02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4927
02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Because of that than it is because of the amount of weight classes.</v>

4928
02:00:50.530 --> 02:00:50.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4929
02:00:50.771 --> 02:00:51.291
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's,</v>

4930
02:00:51.291 --> 02:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4931
02:00:51.530 --> 02:00:51.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

4932
02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:52.623
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

4933
02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

4934
02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:54.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just all a cluster fuck,</v>

4935
02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4936
02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4937
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:57.790
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize how many weight classes there aren't boxing,</v>

4938
02:00:57.791 --> 02:00:58.511
<v Speaker 1>but it's crazy.</v>

4939
02:00:58.511 --> 02:01:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And they start at like one oh six right,</v>

4940
02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

4941
02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

4942
02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>what's like light flyweight it's to be something that's like it's,</v>

4943
02:01:03.431 --> 02:01:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I know I started like really light and they go all the way up to one 95 and then</v>

4944
02:01:08.411 --> 02:01:09.910
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight and that's the deviation.</v>

4945
02:01:09.911 --> 02:01:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Like the USC the only gap they have.</v>

4946
02:01:11.981 --> 02:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>It's more interesting as the two oh five to two 65 yeah.</v>

4947
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>That's where they need to put at least I think a weight class at two 40 or</v>

4948
02:01:19.451 --> 02:01:19.850
<v Speaker 1>something too.</v>

4949
02:01:19.850 --> 02:01:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think also in between 85 and two oh five it would be good.</v>

4950
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:23.201
<v Speaker 1>I think have to tell you.</v>

4951
02:01:23.201 --> 02:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I could see that because you know,</v>

4952
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>just making every 10 pounds.</v>

4953
02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:26.913
<v Speaker 1>I think so too.</v>

4954
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:28.091
<v Speaker 1>I think so too.</v>

4955
02:01:28.091 --> 02:01:32.230
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the big example of that is between 55 and one 70 that's</v>

4956
02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>especially as you get low in percentage of body weight.</v>

4957
02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:36.011
<v Speaker 1>That's those,</v>

4958
02:01:36.011 --> 02:01:36.940
<v Speaker 1>those jumps,</v>

4959
02:01:36.941 --> 02:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>the between that one and the one 85 to light heavy.</v>

4960
02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Those are big jumps in</v>

4961
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.340
<v Speaker 2>math.</v>

4962
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:41.760
<v Speaker 2>15 pounds is a uh,</v>

4963
02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:43.010
<v Speaker 2>is a lot of person.</v>

4964
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:44.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4965
02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And it's also,</v>

4966
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:49.370
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing these guys who are making these cuts to get to two oh five</v>

4967
02:01:49.410 --> 02:01:50.510
<v Speaker 2>salaried guy like Jon Jones.</v>

4968
02:01:50.511 --> 02:01:53.480
<v Speaker 2>He's coming down from like two 25 to 30 yeah,</v>

4969
02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:58.720
<v Speaker 2>like big shit at two oh five and if you're like Kinda like don't want to cut</v>

4970
02:01:59.001 --> 02:02:02.660
<v Speaker 2>weight but you're really a one 80 fiver and you find him,</v>

4971
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.741
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

4972
02:02:03.741 --> 02:02:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh God no,</v>

4973
02:02:05.031 --> 02:02:06.200
<v Speaker 2>I got to lose the weight now.</v>

4974
02:02:06.230 --> 02:02:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Like you gotta you gotta be realistic about this.</v>

4975
02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:11.570
<v Speaker 2>And especially because the way the sport's evolved,</v>

4976
02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:15.280
<v Speaker 2>people get stuck in certain weight classes because they're good for that weight</v>

4977
02:02:15.281 --> 02:02:18.890
<v Speaker 2>class and then they try and cut weight or they try and gain weight and then they</v>

4978
02:02:18.891 --> 02:02:21.890
<v Speaker 2>end up not having the advantages you know of of that they had,</v>

4979
02:02:21.891 --> 02:02:25.250
<v Speaker 2>they had before and they don't work on it or they don't have it at all.</v>

4980
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:26.120
<v Speaker 2>They just can't get it.</v>

4981
02:02:26.121 --> 02:02:29.690
<v Speaker 2>So then they ended up getting beat up by someone smaller or something like that.</v>

4982
02:02:29.691 --> 02:02:31.640
<v Speaker 2>What is it like to be a part of this,</v>

4983
02:02:31.641 --> 02:02:33.410
<v Speaker 2>this sport right now for you?</v>

4984
02:02:33.411 --> 02:02:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Like as a top level professional fighter because it's a really interesting time</v>

4985
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:39.500
<v Speaker 2>as far as the sport,</v>

4986
02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:40.170
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

4987
02:02:40.170 --> 02:02:42.890
<v Speaker 2>it's evolved to this point where there's,</v>

4988
02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:48.050
<v Speaker 2>there's clearly like the best athletes that have ever been involved in MMA or</v>

4989
02:02:48.051 --> 02:02:48.950
<v Speaker 2>involved in and me now.</v>

4990
02:02:48.951 --> 02:02:52.310
<v Speaker 2>And the higher the level of fighting and competition is as high as it's ever</v>

4991
02:02:52.311 --> 02:02:52.761
<v Speaker 2>been before.</v>

4992
02:02:52.761 --> 02:02:53.594
<v Speaker 2>Now how by far,</v>

4993
02:02:53.630 --> 02:02:57.350
<v Speaker 2>but you've had a chance to see it from the outside for a long ass time.</v>

4994
02:02:57.560 --> 02:02:58.101
<v Speaker 2>Like what is,</v>

4995
02:02:58.101 --> 02:02:59.330
<v Speaker 2>what is it like for you now,</v>

4996
02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:00.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4997
02:03:00.081 --> 02:03:01.260
<v Speaker 2>the evolution of,</v>

4998
02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:01.731
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

4999
02:03:01.731 --> 02:03:02.130
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

5000
02:03:02.130 --> 02:03:04.490
<v Speaker 2>the people of the fighters.</v>

5001
02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:05.661
<v Speaker 2>I think as a,</v>

5002
02:03:05.661 --> 02:03:06.494
<v Speaker 2>as a country,</v>

5003
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:08.390
<v Speaker 2>I think we're getting pussified,</v>

5004
02:03:08.391 --> 02:03:08.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5005
02:03:08.571 --> 02:03:09.680
<v Speaker 2>kids aren't allowed to get in fist fights.</v>

5006
02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a rite of passage for young men to get in fist fights,</v>

5007
02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:12.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5008
02:03:12.501 --> 02:03:13.360
<v Speaker 2>and not jumping each other.</v>

5009
02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:14.211
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking no weapons,</v>

5010
02:03:14.211 --> 02:03:14.480
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

5011
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:14.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5012
02:03:14.991 --> 02:03:16.730
<v Speaker 2>just Duke it out and deal with your problems.</v>

5013
02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't want to do that though.</v>

5014
02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:20.400
<v Speaker 2>And they don't want to be harassed by people who want to be,</v>

5015
02:03:20.401 --> 02:03:21.101
<v Speaker 2>if they don't want it,</v>

5016
02:03:21.101 --> 02:03:21.611
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to do.</v>

5017
02:03:21.611 --> 02:03:22.490
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't have to.</v>

5018
02:03:22.690 --> 02:03:23.001
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5019
02:03:23.001 --> 02:03:24.410
<v Speaker 2>But how do you stop that though?</v>

5020
02:03:24.690 --> 02:03:25.380
<v Speaker 2>The exactly.</v>

5021
02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>

5022
02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:26.410
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5023
02:03:26.410 --> 02:03:27.530
<v Speaker 2>but that's not been just saying,</v>

5024
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:28.281
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>

5025
02:03:28.281 --> 02:03:29.900
<v Speaker 2>we're building better athletes in the gym,</v>

5026
02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:32.150
<v Speaker 2>but we have to now.</v>

5027
02:03:32.151 --> 02:03:32.781
<v Speaker 2>Now I,</v>

5028
02:03:32.781 --> 02:03:33.140
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>

5029
02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5030
02:03:33.370 --> 02:03:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I get as a good thing.</v>

5031
02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:35.511
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

5032
02:03:35.511 --> 02:03:36.830
<v Speaker 2>if we want to build a tough kid,</v>

5033
02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:37.940
<v Speaker 2>if we want to make him tough,</v>

5034
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:38.930
<v Speaker 2>we'll blow them in the gym.</v>

5035
02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:42.860
<v Speaker 2>And that maybe you know that that is a good thing because not only is he going</v>

5036
02:03:42.861 --> 02:03:43.341
<v Speaker 2>to be tough,</v>

5037
02:03:43.341 --> 02:03:45.520
<v Speaker 2>but he's not going to be a dick like I used to be know.</v>

5038
02:03:45.850 --> 02:03:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Because like I said,</v>

5039
02:03:46.881 --> 02:03:50.180
<v Speaker 2>I started out beating up bullies and then I ended up just being a bully.</v>

5040
02:03:50.570 --> 02:03:51.280
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

5041
02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you're really honest about that,</v>

5042
02:03:53.121 --> 02:03:53.421
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5043
02:03:53.421 --> 02:03:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really important because I think,</v>

5044
02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:56.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5045
02:03:56.391 --> 02:03:59.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of kids out there that are fighting that watch guy like you and</v>

5046
02:03:59.421 --> 02:04:03.110
<v Speaker 2>look up to you and when maybe they might be on a similar path and they hear that</v>

5047
02:04:03.111 --> 02:04:04.520
<v Speaker 2>and they can learn from your mistakes.</v>

5048
02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5049
02:04:04.730 --> 02:04:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I've made just about every mistake that it is,</v>

5050
02:04:06.801 --> 02:04:07.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5051
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:09.830
<v Speaker 2>whether it's that or Diana Diana of drugs,</v>

5052
02:04:09.831 --> 02:04:10.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5053
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:12.620
<v Speaker 2>drug overdose or whatever or whatever.</v>

5054
02:04:12.621 --> 02:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I've done a lot of things and it's just,</v>

5055
02:04:14.021 --> 02:04:14.390
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5056
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:17.150
<v Speaker 2>there's so many things that I feel like I can share.</v>

5057
02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:18.403
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5058
02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:19.341
<v Speaker 2>and it do,</v>

5059
02:04:19.341 --> 02:04:20.810
<v Speaker 2>I can help one person change.</v>

5060
02:04:20.811 --> 02:04:21.031
<v Speaker 2>That'll be,</v>

5061
02:04:21.031 --> 02:04:21.610
<v Speaker 2>that'll work.</v>

5062
02:04:21.610 --> 02:04:21.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5063
02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:22.330
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

5064
02:04:22.330 --> 02:04:24.110
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'd like to help as many as possible,</v>

5065
02:04:24.111 --> 02:04:25.110
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

5066
02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:25.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5067
02:04:25.401 --> 02:04:27.170
<v Speaker 2>just try and,</v>

5068
02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:27.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5069
02:04:27.770 --> 02:04:29.090
<v Speaker 2>especially with the people that are closest to me,</v>

5070
02:04:29.091 --> 02:04:30.560
<v Speaker 2>like we've got some amateur guys that I'm trying to,</v>

5071
02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:33.440
<v Speaker 2>trying to just turn into super athletes and they already are,</v>

5072
02:04:33.441 --> 02:04:36.440
<v Speaker 2>but just get them focused and ready and not make any mistakes.</v>

5073
02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for a</v>

5074
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:41.370
<v Speaker 1>fighter to transition from being a fighter too,</v>

5075
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:47.030
<v Speaker 1>like mainstream life to going back to being like a regular person with a regular</v>

5076
02:04:48.151 --> 02:04:52.800
<v Speaker 1>job who you know doesn't have those big crazy thrills every few months.</v>

5077
02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:53.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5078
02:04:53.461 --> 02:04:57.260
<v Speaker 1>you just have sort of like this weird steady drip of of,</v>

5079
02:04:57.340 --> 02:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>of life juice instead of this wild rollercoaster rush that everybody knows you</v>

5080
02:05:02.521 --> 02:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>can only stay on for so long.</v>

5081
02:05:03.721 --> 02:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5082
02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that I always try to stress with people is that like one of the</v>

5083
02:05:09.061 --> 02:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>best things about martial arts is the development of the ability to do something</v>

5084
02:05:13.711 --> 02:05:14.011
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

5085
02:05:14.011 --> 02:05:16.620
<v Speaker 1>to be good at something and know what it's like to be good at something.</v>

5086
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:17.700
<v Speaker 1>And then from there,</v>

5087
02:05:17.701 --> 02:05:19.380
<v Speaker 1>like you knew how hard it was to get good.</v>

5088
02:05:19.381 --> 02:05:20.340
<v Speaker 1>You didn't start out good,</v>

5089
02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you started out Shitty,</v>

5090
02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.810
<v Speaker 1>but you got better and he got better and you get that.</v>

5091
02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:25.590
<v Speaker 1>That understanding of that is,</v>

5092
02:05:25.650 --> 02:05:27.240
<v Speaker 1>it's so important for everything.</v>

5093
02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Don't look at like the finish line and go,</v>

5094
02:05:29.251 --> 02:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to get there.</v>

5095
02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Look at progress and you can get anywhere as long as there's not some crazy</v>

5096
02:05:34.321 --> 02:05:35.240
<v Speaker 1>physical limitation.</v>

5097
02:05:35.330 --> 02:05:35.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5098
02:05:35.591 --> 02:05:35.721
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

5099
02:05:35.721 --> 02:05:36.020
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

5100
02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:36.741
<v Speaker 2>that's what I tell people,</v>

5101
02:05:36.741 --> 02:05:38.930
<v Speaker 2>cause they always turn to me for rehab stories,</v>

5102
02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:39.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5103
02:05:39.061 --> 02:05:40.010
<v Speaker 2>the drunk stories or whatever.</v>

5104
02:05:40.011 --> 02:05:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Cause I had been to two rehabs and whatnot.</v>

5105
02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:43.663
<v Speaker 2>How old are you?</v>

5106
02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:44.420
<v Speaker 2>29.</v>

5107
02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:46.370
<v Speaker 2>How old were you when you went through your first rehab?</v>

5108
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I was 19,</v>

5109
02:05:49.281 --> 02:05:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

5110
02:05:49.730 --> 02:05:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5111
02:05:50.210 --> 02:05:51.043
<v Speaker 2>What was it for?</v>

5112
02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5113
02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I got caught with,</v>

5114
02:05:52.670 --> 02:05:53.900
<v Speaker 2>with some pills and then,</v>

5115
02:05:53.901 --> 02:05:54.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5116
02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:55.093
<v Speaker 2>I was appeal guy.</v>

5117
02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5118
02:05:55.730 --> 02:05:57.800
<v Speaker 2>and then it was just through the court.</v>

5119
02:05:58.070 --> 02:06:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I had to check in and I got kicked out of some like class things and they,</v>

5120
02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:01.641
<v Speaker 2>and they put me in like,</v>

5121
02:06:01.641 --> 02:06:01.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5122
02:06:01.810 --> 02:06:02.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5123
02:06:02.170 --> 02:06:02.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5124
02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:03.740
<v Speaker 2>outpatient rehab program.</v>

5125
02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:05.060
<v Speaker 2>And then I ended up,</v>

5126
02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:05.923
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5127
02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>the second one was,</v>

5128
02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:08.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5129
02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:12.900
<v Speaker 2>before in between WBC and tachy when I,</v>

5130
02:06:12.901 --> 02:06:13.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5131
02:06:13.161 --> 02:06:14.060
<v Speaker 2>became world champ.</v>

5132
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:15.283
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5133
02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:16.603
<v Speaker 2>I got in trouble,</v>

5134
02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:17.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5135
02:06:17.541 --> 02:06:18.231
<v Speaker 2>got arrested,</v>

5136
02:06:18.231 --> 02:06:21.710
<v Speaker 2>was looking at probably going to prison for like three to five for just doing</v>

5137
02:06:21.711 --> 02:06:22.160
<v Speaker 2>some dumb shit.</v>

5138
02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:22.993
<v Speaker 2>And then I had,</v>

5139
02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:23.661
<v Speaker 2>I had a record,</v>

5140
02:06:23.661 --> 02:06:26.560
<v Speaker 2>so me doing anything bad but put me in prison.</v>

5141
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:28.760
<v Speaker 2>So I checked myself into Rehab and they were like,</v>

5142
02:06:28.761 --> 02:06:29.421
<v Speaker 2>oh good job,</v>

5143
02:06:29.421 --> 02:06:29.861
<v Speaker 2>little buddy.</v>

5144
02:06:29.861 --> 02:06:30.621
<v Speaker 2>And they'll pat on the head,</v>

5145
02:06:30.621 --> 02:06:31.700
<v Speaker 2>you can stay there for six months.</v>

5146
02:06:31.701 --> 02:06:32.534
<v Speaker 2>And it was live in and,</v>

5147
02:06:32.830 --> 02:06:34.370
<v Speaker 2>and at first it was just escape,</v>

5148
02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:36.620
<v Speaker 2>just to scapegoat for me not to go to prison.</v>

5149
02:06:36.650 --> 02:06:37.790

02:07:17.361 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a cockroach or something.</v>

5185
02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:19.141
<v Speaker 2>There's something,</v>

5186
02:07:19.141 --> 02:07:19.680
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

5187
02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:20.910
<v Speaker 2>there's something inherently,</v>

5188
02:07:21.330 --> 02:07:22.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's right or wrong.</v>

5189
02:07:22.501 --> 02:07:23.790
<v Speaker 2>I hope nobody tries to imitate it.</v>

02:07:24.331 --> 02:07:25.380
<v Speaker 2>do not do what I've done.</v>

5193
02:07:25.410 --> 02:07:25.951
<v Speaker 2>They'll learn,</v>

5194
02:07:25.951 --> 02:07:26.820
<v Speaker 2>learn from that.</v>

5195
02:07:26.850 --> 02:07:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

5196
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm a walking mistake.</v>

5197
02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:29.101
<v Speaker 2>Go to the gym,</v>

5198
02:07:29.101 --> 02:07:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Bitch.</v>

5199
02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:30.151
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

5200
02:07:30.151 --> 02:07:30.984
<v Speaker 2>The gym first.</v>

5201
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:32.760
<v Speaker 2>If I would have spent those extra,</v>

5202
02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean hours that I was doing stupid</v>

5203
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.113
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

5204
02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:37.661
<v Speaker 1>I believe me,</v>

5205
02:07:37.661 --> 02:07:37.831
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

5206
02:07:37.831 --> 02:07:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I've done calculations to everything I could have put in that,</v>

5207
02:07:41.441 --> 02:07:44.590
<v Speaker 1>that cause they say it's 10,000 hours to master something,</v>

5208
02:07:44.591 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

5209
02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:45.291
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5210
02:07:45.291 --> 02:07:50.140
<v Speaker 1>So I could have put an extra 10,000 hours into Jiu Jitsu and extra 10,000 and to</v>

5211
02:07:50.141 --> 02:07:52.120
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing and extra 10,000 and the wrestling.</v>

5212
02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:56.050
<v Speaker 1>If I would've done that because I've been training for that long,</v>

5213
02:07:56.051 --> 02:07:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I could have fit that in there.</v>

5214
02:07:57.490 --> 02:07:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I would be,</v>

5215
02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I would make everyone else look silly.</v>

5216
02:08:00.970 --> 02:08:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Well don't you think though that the something about you that is the way you are</v>

5217
02:08:05.171 --> 02:08:07.180
<v Speaker 1>because of the adversity that you've gone through?</v>

5218
02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:07.310

<v Speaker 1>of course I wouldn't change a thing.</v>

5220
02:08:08.561 --> 02:08:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that right,</v>

5221
02:08:09.590 --> 02:08:10.423
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that weird?</v>

5222
02:08:11.330 --> 02:08:12.040

<v Speaker 1>like tainted if it's all scratched up.</v>

5295
02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:36.581
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5296
02:09:36.581 --> 02:09:37.414
<v Speaker 1>not interested.</v>

5297
02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:38.890
<v Speaker 1>This thing's a piece of shit now.</v>

5298
02:09:38.891 --> 02:09:39.724
<v Speaker 1>I really want it.</v>

5299
02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:41.950
<v Speaker 1>There you have it and it cost me a hundred grand to fix.</v>

5300
02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:43.360
<v Speaker 1>He used to wear furs and shit.</v>

5301
02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:46.390
<v Speaker 1>He used to walk around like Jack Dempsey style,</v>

5302
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:47.380
<v Speaker 1>like with the hat,</v>

5303
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:50.800
<v Speaker 1>like Jack Johnson when Jack Johnson was the heavyweight champion was hanging out</v>

5304
02:09:50.801 --> 02:09:51.634
<v Speaker 1>with all these white chicks.</v>

5305
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:53.651
<v Speaker 1>Nobody did it.</v>

5306
02:09:53.651 --> 02:09:58.651
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to make those laws so he could just state people don't even</v>

5307
02:09:58.721 --> 02:10:00.130
<v Speaker 1>know if you ever seen,</v>

5308
02:10:00.730 --> 02:10:02.440
<v Speaker 1>was it unforgivable blackness?</v>

5309
02:10:02.441 --> 02:10:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Is that what the documentary is called?</v>

5310
02:10:03.851 --> 02:10:05.020
<v Speaker 1>What is the documentary called?</v>

5311
02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I need to quote it because it's an amazing documentary.</v>

5312
02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll just blackness.</v>

5313
02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Jack Johnson.</v>

5314
02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:11.441
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

5315
02:10:11.441 --> 02:10:13.250
<v Speaker 1>am I going to jail for fucking do a Google search?</v>

5316
02:10:13.251 --> 02:10:14.084
<v Speaker 1>I'm my show.</v>

5317
02:10:15.610 --> 02:10:15.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5318
02:10:15.821 --> 02:10:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

5319
02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5320
02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who made it.</v>

5321
02:10:17.411 --> 02:10:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was Ken Burns.</v>

5322
02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5323
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:21.031
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

5324
02:10:21.031 --> 02:10:23.430
<v Speaker 1>he does a lot of those unforgivable blackness.</v>

5325
02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's called.</v>

5326
02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:27.673
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

5327
02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Is it Ken Burns?</v>

5328
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I saw it as Ken Burns movie,</v>

5329
02:10:31.610 --> 02:10:32.900
<v Speaker 1>but I saw it read pretty recently.</v>

5330
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:33.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5331
02:10:33.081 --> 02:10:33.914
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

5332
02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:35.173
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

5333
02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:36.013
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

5334
02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've got,</v>

5335
02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:41.620
<v Speaker 1>people don't realize what a bad mother fucker this guy was and what incredible</v>

5336
02:10:42.111 --> 02:10:44.360
<v Speaker 1>racism he encountered,</v>

5337
02:10:44.630 --> 02:10:48.530
<v Speaker 1>like the racism that fighter's encountered today or people encountered today.</v>

5338
02:10:48.531 --> 02:10:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Like here's a perfect example,</v>

5339
02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:51.860
<v Speaker 1>the recent thing with Oprah Winfrey,</v>

5340
02:10:51.861 --> 02:10:52.730
<v Speaker 1>do you know about this thing?</v>

5341
02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:53.593
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5342
02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:54.321
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5343
02:10:54.321 --> 02:10:54.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5344
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:55.970
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't have done it.</v>

5345
02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:58.940
<v Speaker 1>She went to a store in Switzerland or some shit.</v>

5346
02:10:58.970 --> 02:10:59.803
<v Speaker 1>Is that where it was?</v>

5347
02:11:01.090 --> 02:11:01.701
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

5348
02:11:01.701 --> 02:11:02.150
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

5349
02:11:02.150 --> 02:11:02.900
<v Speaker 1>there was a purse,</v>

5350
02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:06.500
<v Speaker 1>it was a very expensive purse and she asked to see it and the store clerks said,</v>

5351
02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:06.741
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5352
02:11:06.741 --> 02:11:08.120
<v Speaker 1>you can't afford that purse.</v>

5353
02:11:08.150 --> 02:11:10.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't only want to look at it like we should.</v>

5354
02:11:10.071 --> 02:11:11.540
<v Speaker 1>You should look at something less money.</v>

5355
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And Roper was like,</v>

5356
02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

5357
02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:14.653
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

5358
02:11:14.690 --> 02:11:14.901
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5359
02:11:14.901 --> 02:11:19.901
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of racism that Oprah has to experience in 2013 with Jack Johnson</v>

5360
02:11:21.081 --> 02:11:21.590
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

5361
02:11:21.590 --> 02:11:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like to these people,</v>

5362
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:25.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like they wanted him dead.</v>

5363
02:11:25.701 --> 02:11:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And slavery had just ended like inside of their lifetime,</v>

5364
02:11:29.541 --> 02:11:30.680
<v Speaker 1>1865.</v>

5365
02:11:30.681 --> 02:11:34.670
<v Speaker 1>So you're dealing with just a few decades later and all of a sudden there's this</v>

5366
02:11:34.671 --> 02:11:39.671
<v Speaker 1>dude just knockin white dudes senseless and taking these white chicks.</v>

5367
02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And impaling them on this fucking Super Dick,</v>

5368
02:11:44.541 --> 02:11:47.600
<v Speaker 1>the likes of which white women had never seen before and they were just</v>

5369
02:11:47.601 --> 02:11:48.490
<v Speaker 1>following them around,</v>

5370
02:11:48.491 --> 02:11:50.600
<v Speaker 1>a fallen out of his car while he's driving down the street.</v>

5371
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5372
02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:52.101
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

5373
02:11:52.101 --> 02:11:56.210
<v Speaker 1>he was like the first black I ever with dope cars that get across that border</v>

5374
02:11:56.211 --> 02:11:57.140
<v Speaker 1>and just kill it.</v>

5375
02:11:57.141 --> 02:11:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And he just did it like,</v>

5376
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.971
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

5377
02:11:58.971 --> 02:11:59.720
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>

5378
02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:01.370
<v Speaker 1>He would take them across state lines.</v>

5379
02:12:01.371 --> 02:12:02.780
<v Speaker 1>They try to get them for all kinds of shit.</v>

5380
02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Transporting white women and across dirt lines that they drew.</v>

5381
02:12:05.590 --> 02:12:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Who government was after you for sleeping with white women that you're,</v>

5382
02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:11.753
<v Speaker 1>you're waiting sir.</v>

5383
02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Sad,</v>

5384
02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:13.850
<v Speaker 1>sad movie.</v>

5385
02:12:13.851 --> 02:12:15.860
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end when he throws a fight,</v>

5386
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:16.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5387
02:12:16.131 --> 02:12:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you could tell he throws a fight.</v>

5388
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

5389
02:12:18.110 --> 02:12:18.421
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5390
02:12:18.421 --> 02:12:19.251
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just Willard.</v>

5391
02:12:19.251 --> 02:12:20.084
<v Speaker 1>Who was it that he froze?</v>

5392
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:21.223
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

5393
02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:21.981
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

5394
02:12:21.981 --> 02:12:22.221
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

5395
02:12:22.221 --> 02:12:22.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5396
02:12:22.700 --> 02:12:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to tell you.</v>

5397
02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:24.111
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

5398
02:12:24.111 --> 02:12:24.921
<v Speaker 1>even if I did remember,</v>

5399
02:12:24.921 --> 02:12:25.640
<v Speaker 1>you should watch it.</v>

5400
02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:26.201
<v Speaker 1>Go get it.</v>

5401
02:12:26.201 --> 02:12:28.520
<v Speaker 1>So it's an amazing documentary and it's just,</v>

5402
02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:30.111
<v Speaker 1>we see like,</v>

5403
02:12:30.111 --> 02:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>like those old Jack Johnson fights or um,</v>

5404
02:12:34.370 --> 02:12:36.740
<v Speaker 1>you see Jack Dempsey's old fights.</v>

5405
02:12:37.010 --> 02:12:37.191
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5406
02:12:37.191 --> 02:12:37.520
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

5407
02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:39.890
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a totally different kind of human being.</v>

5408
02:12:39.891 --> 02:12:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Back then it was a lot different.</v>

5409
02:12:42.531 --> 02:12:43.370
<v Speaker 1>There were animals,</v>

5410
02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:43.900
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5411
02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:44.733
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

5412
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I think we're slowly losing that,</v>

5413
02:12:46.351 --> 02:12:46.701
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

5414
02:12:46.701 --> 02:12:47.540
<v Speaker 1>that piece of us,</v>

5415
02:12:47.970 --> 02:12:48.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5416
02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:49.220
<v Speaker 1>with whatever,</v>

5417
02:12:49.221 --> 02:12:49.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever is it,</v>

5418
02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:50.733
<v Speaker 1>that's everything.</v>

5419
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Everything is taking it away from us,</v>

5420
02:12:52.251 --> 02:12:54.920
<v Speaker 1>but we're slowly losing that killer instinct.</v>

5421
02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5422
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5423
02:12:55.791 --> 02:12:59.480
<v Speaker 1>it's funny that Tyson latched on to the Jack Dempsey.</v>

5424
02:12:59.481 --> 02:13:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Jack Dempsey was like one of his like main heroes and his main idols for that</v>

5425
02:13:03.291 --> 02:13:06.710
<v Speaker 1>style of fighting that just ferocious mauling style,</v>

5426
02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:07.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5427
02:13:07.371 --> 02:13:10.250
<v Speaker 1>and Tyson sort of recognize that he was a throwback.</v>

5428
02:13:10.251 --> 02:13:10.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5429
02:13:10.401 --> 02:13:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you think about that in the 80s and then you look at like Jack Dempsey was doing</v>

5430
02:13:15.201 --> 02:13:16.400
<v Speaker 1>it when there was no TVs.</v>

5431
02:13:16.910 --> 02:13:17.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5432
02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:21.380
<v Speaker 1>they find out about fights from the radio and he was doing that exact thing that</v>

5433
02:13:21.381 --> 02:13:22.070
<v Speaker 1>long ago.</v>

5434
02:13:22.070 --> 02:13:25.850
<v Speaker 1>You were either they're in person or you were listening to guys talk.</v>

5435
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:26.601
<v Speaker 1>Jack Dempsey.</v>

5436
02:13:26.601 --> 02:13:27.890

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I probably 50 or 60 I mean,</v>

5481
02:14:35.210 --> 02:14:37.850
<v Speaker 1>those guys look like they're like on the verge of beating each other to death.</v>

5482
02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Very close.</v>

02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:40.970
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen some UFC fights.</v>

5485
02:14:40.971 --> 02:14:43.490
<v Speaker 1>It looked like that to Joe Stevenson and Bj Penn.</v>

5486
02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:44.211
<v Speaker 1>The end of that fight,</v>

5487
02:14:44.211 --> 02:14:45.980
<v Speaker 1>it looked like Joseph Stevenson got murdered.</v>

5488
02:14:45.981 --> 02:14:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5489
02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:46.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5490
02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5491
02:14:47.150 --> 02:14:48.620
<v Speaker 1>well especially those forehead cuts,</v>

5492
02:14:49.130 --> 02:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>forehead cuts are responsible for some of the craziest,</v>

5493
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>most ridiculous scenes in the octagon ever.</v>

5494
02:14:54.230 --> 02:14:54.651
<v Speaker 1>But what did,</v>

5497
02:14:58.380 --> 02:14:59.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just the wording.</v>

5498
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Giant Noggin.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The longest boxing match ever took place in New Orleans on April six of 1893 the</v>

5516
02:15:34.061 --> 02:15:36.370
<v Speaker 1>matches between Andy Bowen and Jack Burke,</v>

5517
02:15:36.610 --> 02:15:39.730
<v Speaker 1>both of whom claimed the lightweight title after the reigning Champ,</v>

5518
02:15:39.731 --> 02:15:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Jack McCall full all a fee,</v>

5521
02:15:49.901 --> 02:15:51.310
<v Speaker 1>is really the new champion,</v>

5522

5523
02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:55.570
<v Speaker 1>They fought to a finish.</v>

5524
02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

5525
02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:57.490
<v Speaker 1>All through the contest,</v>

5526
02:15:57.491 --> 02:16:00.670
<v Speaker 1>fighters went at each other aggressively pounding each other with their gloves,</v>

5527
02:16:00.710 --> 02:16:04.420
<v Speaker 1>inflicting and sustaining tremendous punishment that red,</v>

5528
02:16:04.421 --> 02:16:06.100
<v Speaker 1>like someone wrote it with their pants off.</v>

5529
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:07.840
<v Speaker 1>That red light is vigorous.</v>

5530
02:16:07.841 --> 02:16:12.841
<v Speaker 1>They masturbating hold up and shaved and yet three minute rounds wore off.</v>

5531
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

5532
02:16:14.681 --> 02:16:18.490
<v Speaker 1>They went to 111 rounds.</v>

5533
02:16:19.450 --> 02:16:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Both fighters,</v>

5534
02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:21.940
<v Speaker 1>dazed and weary,</v>

5535
02:16:21.941 --> 02:16:25.750
<v Speaker 1>gave up and did not come out of their corner pools.</v>

5536
02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:27.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5537
02:16:27.371 --> 02:16:29.560
<v Speaker 1>you can't fight 112 well,</v>

5538
02:16:29.561 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 1>more raw.</v>

5539
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:31.480
<v Speaker 1>That'd be one guy telling him,</v>

5540
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:33.820
<v Speaker 1>just get up rocky and your win.</v>

5541
02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:36.633
<v Speaker 1>All that.</v>

5542
02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:37.010
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

5543
02:16:37.010 --> 02:16:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Guinness says it's 276 rounds in 1825 but that's English people lying might,</v>

5544
02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:45.460
<v Speaker 1>we're not much longer than that.</v>

5545
02:16:46.630 --> 02:16:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Our insurance is superior.</v>

5546
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:49.780
<v Speaker 1>We've proper boxing training.</v>

5547
02:16:50.710 --> 02:16:51.940
<v Speaker 1>That sounded more South African,</v>

5548
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:53.590
<v Speaker 1>so maybe that right man,</v>

5549
02:16:53.650 --> 02:16:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

5550
02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Whoever fought over a hundred rounds.</v>

5551
02:16:55.831 --> 02:16:57.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest fucking human being that's ever lived.</v>

5552
02:16:57.751 --> 02:16:58.010
<v Speaker 1>That fight.</v>

5553
02:16:58.010 --> 02:16:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It was only four and a half hours.</v>

5554
02:16:59.590 --> 02:16:59.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5555
02:16:59.861 --> 02:17:00.430
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

5556
02:17:00.430 --> 02:17:01.660
<v Speaker 1>What do they have like 32nd rounds?</v>

5557
02:17:02.470 --> 02:17:03.161
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

5558
02:17:03.161 --> 02:17:03.994
<v Speaker 1>I can't even do the math.</v>

5559
02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5560
02:17:04.710 --> 02:17:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to try 2,500 bucks.</v>

5561
02:17:07.510 --> 02:17:08.343
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

5562
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I wonder where the welter for the welterweight championship of the world are</v>

5563
02:17:12.381 --> 02:17:13.810
<v Speaker 1>lightweight round these days.</v>

5564
02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:14.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

5565
02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:16.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good question.</v>

5566
02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I bet it'd be like 1 million bucks.</v>

5567
02:17:17.290 --> 02:17:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5568
02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:18.933
<v Speaker 1>Is that weird?</v>

5569
02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Like when when you hear about like economies imploding and then all of a sudden</v>

5570
02:17:22.661 --> 02:17:24.450
<v Speaker 1>like a loaf of bread's worth $1 million,</v>

5571
02:17:24.460 --> 02:17:25.630
<v Speaker 1>like how the fuck,</v>

5572
02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 1>what does that even mean?</v>

5573
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:27.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5574
02:17:27.041 --> 02:17:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't even understand that people have billions of dike.</v>

5575
02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:31.990
<v Speaker 1>How does that number even a real number and can I,</v>

5576
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:34.720
<v Speaker 1>how do you pull out $1 billion in cash?</v>

5577
02:17:34.721 --> 02:17:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>

5578
02:17:35.350 --> 02:17:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5579
02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:36.820

5585
02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:45.970
<v Speaker 1>When you know your guy like Bill Gates,</v>

5586
02:17:45.971 --> 02:17:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you have submarine inside your giant.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what happened here?</v>

5589
02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:51.370
<v Speaker 1>What exactly did you do?</v>

5590
02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Where are you getting all that money?</v>

5591
02:17:54.060 --> 02:17:55.000
<v Speaker 1>This isn't fair.</v>

5592
02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Escape.</v>

5593
02:17:55.860 --> 02:17:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Pause in your house,</v>

5594
02:17:57.190 --> 02:18:00.460
<v Speaker 1>jettison you to the middle of the fucking ocean whenever it fucking dangerous</v>

5595
02:18:00.461 --> 02:18:01.294
<v Speaker 1>shows up.</v>

5596
02:18:01.930 --> 02:18:02.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5597
02:18:02.111 --> 02:18:05.560
<v Speaker 1>You have a constant team of security detail around you that's like having a bank</v>

5598
02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:07.090
<v Speaker 1>around you all the time.</v>

5599
02:18:07.450 --> 02:18:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates is worth what?</v>

5600
02:18:08.981 --> 02:18:11.060
<v Speaker 1>100 billion or something crazy like that.</v>

5601
02:18:11.070 --> 02:18:12.160
<v Speaker 1>It would if it was the whole Jv,</v>

5602
02:18:12.161 --> 02:18:14.830
<v Speaker 1>him dropping $40,000 he shouldn't pick it up kind of thing.</v>

5603
02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:15.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5604
02:18:15.071 --> 02:18:15.904
<v Speaker 1>that's what they say.</v>

5605
02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:20.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like if he drops $40,000 it's worth more of his time to keep moving forward</v>

5606
02:18:20.470 --> 02:18:21.880
<v Speaker 1>than it is to turn around and pick it up.</v>

5607
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:22.620
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

5608
02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:25.810
<v Speaker 1>what happened was he just didn't turn around to pick up the bonus.</v>

5609
02:18:25.811 --> 02:18:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I just got almost for,</v>

5611
02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:31.241
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

5612
02:18:31.241 --> 02:18:32.200
<v Speaker 1>if he dropped that,</v>

5613
02:18:32.350 --> 02:18:33.183
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't pick it up.</v>

5614
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.761
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy.</v>

5615
02:18:33.761 --> 02:18:37.190
<v Speaker 1>If you think about how much more difficult MMA is.</v>

5616
02:18:37.191 --> 02:18:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5617
02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:42.660

5618
02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:48.490
<v Speaker 1>like besides being a soldier or a cop or a fireman,</v>

5619
02:18:48.730 --> 02:18:52.330
<v Speaker 1>where you're really putting your life in danger on a daily basis with fires and</v>

5620
02:18:52.331 --> 02:18:53.020
<v Speaker 1>bullets.</v>

5621
02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Take all those out.</v>

02:21:21.281 --> 02:21:22.130
<v Speaker 1>in Alaska.</v>

5723
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Like the Guy I've seen pictures of him with with polar bear,</v>

5724
02:21:26.031 --> 02:21:26.864
<v Speaker 1>he killed like,</v>

5725
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5726
02:21:27.290 --> 02:21:29.900
<v Speaker 1>it's just this big mountain and polar bear.</v>

5727
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

5728
02:21:30.740 --> 02:21:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a polar bear rug.</v>

5729
02:21:31.881 --> 02:21:34.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not have a house to put it in yet.</v>

5730
02:21:34.131 --> 02:21:34.580
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

5731
02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:35.370
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's just,</v>

5732
02:21:35.370 --> 02:21:37.970
<v Speaker 1>it that's like that guys is just weathered.</v>

5733
02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Like he don't eat polar bear.</v>

5734
02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5735
02:21:39.690 --> 02:21:41.060
<v Speaker 1>D I don't think so.</v>

5736
02:21:41.061 --> 02:21:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I think he just just did it to do,</v>

5737
02:21:42.831 --> 02:21:44.270
<v Speaker 1>but at the back then he's said guys almost 80.</v>

5738
02:21:44.271 --> 02:21:45.350
<v Speaker 1>So back then it was okay.</v>

5739
02:21:45.351 --> 02:21:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean he doesn't hunt anymore.</v>

5740
02:21:46.850 --> 02:21:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Then we own black people,</v>

5741
02:21:48.021 --> 02:21:49.220
<v Speaker 1>which shot polar bears,</v>

5742
02:21:49.221 --> 02:21:49.701
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

5743
02:21:49.701 --> 02:21:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

5744
02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:51.350
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

5745
02:21:51.350 --> 02:21:55.220
<v Speaker 1>We drove drunk shooting in polar bears out the window of the car.</v>

5746
02:21:56.210 --> 02:21:56.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5747
02:21:56.451 --> 02:21:56.661
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

5748
02:21:56.661 --> 02:21:56.901
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

5749
02:21:56.901 --> 02:21:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to hunt certain Predator Bairstow though.</v>

5750
02:21:59.751 --> 02:22:01.220
<v Speaker 1>They have to keep their numbers down.</v>

5751
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:02.120
<v Speaker 1>People don't like that,</v>

5752
02:22:02.270 --> 02:22:03.103
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>

5753
02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:05.780
<v Speaker 1>But it does become a real problem when you have,</v>

5754
02:22:05.781 --> 02:22:06.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5755
02:22:06.350 --> 02:22:07.220
<v Speaker 1>there's like the,</v>

5756
02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:10.700
<v Speaker 1>the game wardens in these areas and the department of fish and game.</v>

5757
02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5758
02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:15.320
<v Speaker 1>They're very meticulous about keeping track of numbers of both animals that are</v>

5759
02:22:15.321 --> 02:22:16.400
<v Speaker 1>pray like dear.</v>

5760
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:17.780
<v Speaker 1>And then animals that are,</v>

5761
02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:18.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5762
02:22:18.290 --> 02:22:21.770
<v Speaker 1>there are also predators like cats and bears and shit like that.</v>

5763
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And they're pretty good at figuring out how to manage that stuff.</v>

5764
02:22:25.050 --> 02:22:26.280
<v Speaker 1>But you have to kill some of them,</v>

5765
02:22:26.281 --> 02:22:27.114
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

5766
02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5767
02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I understand that people hate that idea because they're so beautiful and</v>

5768
02:22:30.901 --> 02:22:31.471
<v Speaker 1>majestic,</v>

5769
02:22:31.471 --> 02:22:36.471
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of biology is that there has to be a certain balance of Predator</v>

5770
02:22:37.141 --> 02:22:38.820
<v Speaker 1>and prey because if there's not,</v>

5771
02:22:38.821 --> 02:22:40.200
<v Speaker 1>then we become a danger.</v>

5772
02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:41.310
<v Speaker 1>They're going to come fuck us.</v>

5773
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And nobody likes that idea.</v>

5774
02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:43.830
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

5775
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:44.700
<v Speaker 1>people that are like,</v>

5776
02:22:44.701 --> 02:22:47.010
<v Speaker 1>especially like people were animal rights people or you know,</v>

5777
02:22:47.011 --> 02:22:48.330
<v Speaker 1>people love animals.</v>

5778
02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:51.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that their dogs are like their best fucking friends.</v>

5779
02:22:51.130 --> 02:22:52.800
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that they can count on for love,</v>

5780
02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:53.431
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

5781
02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:54.480
<v Speaker 1>That's not even a bad thing.</v>

5782
02:22:54.690 --> 02:22:55.141
<v Speaker 1>Not a bad thing.</v>

5783
02:22:55.141 --> 02:22:55.560
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

5784
02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So I understand where they're coming from.</v>

5785
02:22:57.421 --> 02:22:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you would think about the a bear.</v>

5786
02:22:59.041 --> 02:23:00.000
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a big dog,</v>

5787
02:23:00.001 --> 02:23:00.980
<v Speaker 1>but this is a big dog.</v>

5788
02:23:00.981 --> 02:23:02.150
<v Speaker 1>They will eat your asshole.</v>

5789
02:23:02.190 --> 02:23:02.490
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

5790
02:23:02.490 --> 02:23:03.980
<v Speaker 1>The thing doesn't give a shit about you.</v>

5791
02:23:03.981 --> 02:23:04.321
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5792
02:23:04.321 --> 02:23:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Without even it.</v>

5793
02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:05.791
<v Speaker 1>It wants to eat.</v>

5794
02:23:05.791 --> 02:23:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5795
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a heartless monster and for the most part they're harmless.</v>

5796
02:23:09.690 --> 02:23:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't go near them.</v>

5797
02:23:10.681 --> 02:23:12.390
<v Speaker 1>You stay away from them for the most part.</v>

5798
02:23:12.391 --> 02:23:12.811
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

5799
02:23:12.811 --> 02:23:13.560
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be fine.</v>

5800
02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is when they get to a certain number and they start taking down</v>

5801
02:23:17.011 --> 02:23:20.400
<v Speaker 1>elk in front of people at the camp site and scaring the shit out of everybody.</v>

5802
02:23:20.410 --> 02:23:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5803
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:23.020
<v Speaker 1>You ever see a 12 foot bear take out a moose?</v>

5804
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I haven't either,</v>

5805
02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:26.070
<v Speaker 1>but just I'm trying to get,</v>

5806
02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:28.410
<v Speaker 1>here is a video of a bear in a,</v>

5807
02:23:28.411 --> 02:23:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I've never forgot this.</v>

5808
02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:29.971
<v Speaker 1>Pull this shit up,</v>

5809
02:23:29.971 --> 02:23:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

5810
02:23:30.450 --> 02:23:31.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a bear.</v>

5811
02:23:31.441 --> 02:23:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Eats a moose in a driveway,</v>

5812
02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:35.610
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

5813
02:23:35.610 --> 02:23:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5814
02:23:36.270 --> 02:23:37.740
<v Speaker 1>just dude.</v>

5815
02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:38.873
<v Speaker 1>Imagine.</v>

5816
02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're living in Alaska.</v>

5817
02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:41.633
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5818
02:23:41.970 --> 02:23:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm five eight.</v>

5819
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5820
02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:46.320
<v Speaker 1>I stood next to a moose and it's fucking huge.</v>

5821
02:23:46.350 --> 02:23:48.090
<v Speaker 1>It's Dick was over my head.</v>

5822
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:50.370
<v Speaker 1>They're gigantic.</v>

5823
02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:50.971
<v Speaker 1>I went to Alaska.</v>

5824
02:23:50.971 --> 02:23:51.361
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid.</v>

5825
02:23:51.361 --> 02:23:53.580
<v Speaker 1>That place is fucking beautiful and they're gigantic.</v>

5826
02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:53.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5827
02:23:53.941 --> 02:23:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

5828
02:23:54.450 --> 02:23:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get really close enough to him.</v>

5829
02:23:56.081 --> 02:23:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It was to get his stick over my head.</v>

5830
02:23:57.331 --> 02:23:58.164
<v Speaker 1>But look at this,</v>

5831
02:23:58.320 --> 02:23:59.190
<v Speaker 1>but this Mousse,</v>

5832
02:23:59.191 --> 02:24:00.300
<v Speaker 1>which is gigantic,</v>

5833
02:24:00.330 --> 02:24:00.810
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5834
02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:05.340
<v Speaker 1>is killed by a grizzly bear and this guy's fucking driveway.</v>

5835
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:08.550
<v Speaker 1>So could you imagine there's a thing that's,</v>

5836
02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:09.391
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5837
02:24:09.391 --> 02:24:09.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5838
02:24:09.901 --> 02:24:10.470
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

5839
02:24:10.470 --> 02:24:15.470
<v Speaker 1>10 times his size of a deer and it gets killed by a giant wild dog.</v>

5840
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:19.260
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially what a bear is.</v>

5841
02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:23.040
<v Speaker 1>A giant bulletproof wild dog Moose or what?</v>

5842
02:24:23.041 --> 02:24:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Like 12 feet tall.</v>

5843
02:24:23.970 --> 02:24:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5844
02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Fucking huge.</v>

5845
02:24:25.411 --> 02:24:26.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge animal.</v>

5846
02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:28.230
<v Speaker 1>That's not the biggest moose in the world.</v>

5847
02:24:28.470 --> 02:24:28.711
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5848
02:24:28.711 --> 02:24:29.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

5849
02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:30.330
<v Speaker 1>and it's a female.</v>

5850
02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:32.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a big fucking animal.</v>

5851
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:38.270
<v Speaker 1>And what's really crazy about bear is bear eat moose alive.</v>

5852
02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:39.630
<v Speaker 1>They'd all the animals,</v>

5853
02:24:39.631 --> 02:24:40.650
<v Speaker 1>they kill alive.</v>

5854
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:42.750
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times they go guts first.</v>

5855
02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:44.340
<v Speaker 1>They don't even bother killing the animal.</v>

5856
02:24:44.341 --> 02:24:45.300
<v Speaker 1>They just start eating them.</v>

5857
02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:49.590
<v Speaker 1>You look at the size of that fucking thing,</v>

5858
02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:52.440
<v Speaker 1>just ripping chunks off of this Moose.</v>

5859
02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:55.200
<v Speaker 1>He's eating the guts now.</v>

5860
02:24:55.201 --> 02:24:56.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what they go for the first.</v>

5861
02:24:57.810 --> 02:24:58.620
<v Speaker 1>But they're,</v>

5862
02:24:58.620 --> 02:24:59.400
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

5863
02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:00.510
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere up there.</v>

5864

5878
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:24.850

5879
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:26.320
<v Speaker 1>but when they drag it away,</v>

5899
02:26:01.031 --> 02:26:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Stepdad's not going to tell her,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but a bear a bear.</v>

5901
02:26:03.171 --> 02:26:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It was tracking them the whole time.</v>

5902
02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:04.541
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5903
02:26:04.541 --> 02:26:04.991
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

5904
02:26:04.991 --> 02:26:05.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5905
02:26:05.171 --> 02:26:06.830
<v Speaker 1>they told the whole time and like,</v>

5906
02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:07.120
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

5907
02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:07.421
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

5908
02:26:07.421 --> 02:26:08.770
<v Speaker 1>oh we're wading through like thick,</v>

5909
02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:09.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5910
02:26:09.521 --> 02:26:11.050
<v Speaker 1>brush shit and just,</v>

5911
02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:11.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5912
02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:12.783
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why.</v>

5913
02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Just her telling the story.</v>

5914
02:26:14.460 --> 02:26:15.293
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5915
02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:15.671
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5916
02:26:15.671 --> 02:26:17.530
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking frightening having something.</v>

5917
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:18.820
<v Speaker 1>If something wants to eat you,</v>

5918
02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:22.390
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy because you can get there at the wrong place and the wrong time</v>

5919
02:26:22.410 --> 02:26:26.590
<v Speaker 1>and you can get there when there's an old bear that can't catch catch moose or</v>

5920
02:26:26.591 --> 02:26:30.430
<v Speaker 1>deer anymore and they have worn out teeth and they see you and they're like,</v>

5921
02:26:30.431 --> 02:26:31.370
<v Speaker 1>oh I can catch you.</v>

5922
02:26:31.710 --> 02:26:32.710
<v Speaker 1>And then they just eat you.</v>

5923
02:26:33.070 --> 02:26:34.840
<v Speaker 1>And especially when it's late in the season,</v>

5924
02:26:34.841 --> 02:26:36.910
<v Speaker 1>they say that's when it gets really desperado.</v>

5925
02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Bears will eat their cubs and they get really desperate because there's no food.</v>

5926
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:42.160
<v Speaker 1>It can't catch any fish.</v>

5927
02:26:42.161 --> 02:26:42.470
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>

5928
02:26:42.470 --> 02:26:44.680
<v Speaker 1>There's no salmon laughed and they're starving to death.</v>

5929
02:26:44.681 --> 02:26:46.750
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll fucking eat everything in front of them.</v>

5930
02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:50.350
<v Speaker 1>You can catch them in that really intense desperation cause they're the last</v>

5931
02:26:50.351 --> 02:26:55.351
<v Speaker 1>animals that haven't hibernated the healthy fat bears that what a grizzly man</v>

5932
02:26:55.980 --> 02:26:56.141
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5933
02:26:56.141 --> 02:26:56.411
<v Speaker 1>that moves.</v>

5934
02:26:56.411 --> 02:26:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5935
02:26:57.100 --> 02:26:58.060
<v Speaker 1>I talk about that every week.</v>

5936
02:26:58.061 --> 02:26:59.620
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk about it anymore unfortunately.</v>

5937
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about that.</v>

5938
02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that it was,</v>

5939
02:27:01.841 --> 02:27:02.674
<v Speaker 1>it was like that.</v>

5940
02:27:04.170 --> 02:27:05.620
<v Speaker 1>That was exact storyline.</v>

5941
02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5942
02:27:05.890 --> 02:27:07.480
<v Speaker 1>The guys stayed way too long.</v>

5943
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:10.600
<v Speaker 1>He was there in October or November or some shit like that when they're supposed</v>

5944
02:27:10.601 --> 02:27:11.500
<v Speaker 1>to already be sleeping.</v>

5945
02:27:12.370 --> 02:27:12.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5946
02:27:12.641 --> 02:27:13.391
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing,</v>

5947
02:27:13.391 --> 02:27:13.631
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5948
02:27:13.631 --> 02:27:16.420
<v Speaker 1>To live in the presence of those crazy beasts.</v>

5949
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:20.350
<v Speaker 1>My favorite shows are all these subsistence shows like Alaska,</v>

5950
02:27:20.351 --> 02:27:21.340
<v Speaker 1>the last frontier.</v>

5951
02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:21.730
<v Speaker 1>It's my,</v>

5952
02:27:21.730 --> 02:27:22.600
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite shows.</v>

5953
02:27:22.601 --> 02:27:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I get giddy like a little schoolgirl when I shits on.</v>

5954
02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I got to watch it and it's these people they live,</v>

5955
02:27:27.011 --> 02:27:28.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a bunch of families.</v>

5956
02:27:28.450 --> 02:27:30.940
<v Speaker 1>The Kitchener family and I believe like jewel,</v>

5957
02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:33.730
<v Speaker 1>you know that a beautiful singer and incredible voice.</v>

5958
02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:36.160
<v Speaker 1>She is like related to these people.</v>

5959
02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

5960
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:42.750
<v Speaker 1>But these folks live in like a really remote part of Alaska and they have a</v>

5961
02:27:44.831 --> 02:27:46.160
<v Speaker 1>homestead with eight.</v>

5962
02:27:46.330 --> 02:27:47.950
<v Speaker 1>They're responsible for everything.</v>

5963
02:27:47.951 --> 02:27:50.260
<v Speaker 1>They're responsible for all their own repairs on their equipment.</v>

5964
02:27:50.380 --> 02:27:54.280
<v Speaker 1>They get all their own meat from either cows that they have to butcher cause</v>

5965
02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.860
<v Speaker 1>they run cattle or animals that they hunt.</v>

5966
02:27:56.890 --> 02:28:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Whether they hunt bear or a moose and they have like very specific chores they</v>

5967
02:28:00.551 --> 02:28:04.360
<v Speaker 1>do and they have maybe four or five months a year where they're just trying to</v>

5968
02:28:04.361 --> 02:28:08.890
<v Speaker 1>keep it together and then it's bundled up for the cold and their whole life is</v>

5969
02:28:08.891 --> 02:28:10.420
<v Speaker 1>about preparing for the cold.</v>

5970
02:28:10.450 --> 02:28:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5971
02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:15.310
<v Speaker 1>And they're just fucking storing fish and every is just a mad dash.</v>

5972
02:28:15.311 --> 02:28:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Getting up at six pulling nets of fishing,</v>

5973
02:28:18.250 --> 02:28:19.031
<v Speaker 1>freezing.</v>

5974
02:28:19.031 --> 02:28:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm smoking them.</v>

5975
02:28:19.931 --> 02:28:24.931
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's working around clock and then shoot the fucking frost comes in.</v>

5976
02:28:25.161 --> 02:28:27.960
<v Speaker 1>The river freezes over the point where you drive cars on it.</v>

5977
02:28:27.961 --> 02:28:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5978
02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:31.310
<v Speaker 1>it's gangster cold up there and we get to watch that.</v>

5979
02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:32.233
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

5980

6004
02:28:57.860 --> 02:29:00.950
<v Speaker 1>There's something amazing about the people that come from those spots though.</v>

6005
02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:01.941
<v Speaker 1>They have a different,</v>

6006
02:29:01.941 --> 02:29:05.780
<v Speaker 1>does a different sort of like mentality that they possess.</v>

6007
02:29:05.810 --> 02:29:07.490
<v Speaker 1>It's for a pussy like me.</v>

6008
02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:09.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a so attractive.</v>

6009
02:29:09.470 --> 02:29:10.303
<v Speaker 1>So you know this,</v>

6010
02:29:10.460 --> 02:29:11.960
<v Speaker 1>this guy that's a man right there,</v>

6011
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.010
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a bank account.</v>

6012
02:29:13.011 --> 02:29:14.390
<v Speaker 1>He's got some beaver skins.</v>

6013
02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:18.470
<v Speaker 1>He's going to trade for gasoline for his fucking snowmobile and he's driving</v>

6014
02:29:18.471 --> 02:29:21.950
<v Speaker 1>around where it's 80 below zero and he's running traps and that's how he feeds</v>

6015
02:29:21.951 --> 02:29:22.784
<v Speaker 1>his kids.</v>

6016
02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes guy.</v>

6017
02:29:23.570 --> 02:29:27.980
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking show called mountain men with this guy takes up plane every</v>

6018
02:29:27.980 --> 02:29:28.100
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>

6019
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:28.940
<v Speaker 1>He flies,</v>

6020
02:29:28.941 --> 02:29:30.050
<v Speaker 1>he leaves his family behind.</v>

6021
02:29:30.051 --> 02:29:32.210
<v Speaker 1>He flies for months and camps out in the woods.</v>

6022
02:29:32.211 --> 02:29:36.320
<v Speaker 1>He's got like these shacks up there and he runs these trap lines and just kills</v>

6023
02:29:36.321 --> 02:29:37.750
<v Speaker 1>animals in the wintertime.</v>

6024
02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:40.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like apparently easier to kill him cause they're desperado and they go and</v>

6025
02:29:40.551 --> 02:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>find the bait and snap down on it.</v>

6026
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:46.160
<v Speaker 1>And this guy just takes it all and freezes them and skins and then brings him</v>

6027
02:29:46.161 --> 02:29:46.581
<v Speaker 1>back home.</v>

6028
02:29:46.581 --> 02:29:49.550
<v Speaker 1>It'd be lives out there by himself for months and months at a time.</v>

6029
02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:50.593
<v Speaker 1>No phone,</v>

6030
02:29:50.690 --> 02:29:51.523
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

6031
02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Just a wood house.</v>

6032
02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Woodhouse in a snowmobile.</v>

6033
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:56.500

6041

<v Speaker 1>we were food fit was just how fishing.</v>

6114
02:31:33.390 --> 02:31:35.130
<v Speaker 1>So we're always hunting something.</v>

02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:35.451
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

6116
02:31:35.451 --> 02:31:35.791
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

6117
02:31:35.791 --> 02:31:36.060
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

02:31:36.060 --> 02:31:36.431
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

6119
02:31:36.431 --> 02:31:37.264
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6120
02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:38.130
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely,</v>

6121
02:31:38.130 --> 02:31:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I love doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I knew I'd also need to go fishing again.</v>

6124
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.831
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like the,</v>

6125
02:31:41.831 --> 02:31:43.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a primal thing too,</v>

6126
02:31:43.231 --> 02:31:43.831
<v Speaker 1>that almost,</v>

6127
02:31:43.831 --> 02:31:44.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6128
02:31:44.071 --> 02:31:46.080
<v Speaker 1>not obviously on the same level as fighting,</v>

6129
02:31:46.081 --> 02:31:50.490
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about like the satisfaction that you get from acquiring</v>

6130
02:31:50.491 --> 02:31:52.410
<v Speaker 1>your own food is a very primal thing.</v>

6131
02:31:52.440 --> 02:31:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It's the most intimate thing you can share with another creature is taking its</v>

6132
02:31:55.981 --> 02:31:58.530
<v Speaker 1>life sound like a fucking psycho.</v>

02:32:14.011 --> 02:32:14.580
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

6149
02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:15.413
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean.</v>

6150
02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I killed a deer for the first time in my life,</v>

6151
02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:19.190
<v Speaker 1>lasts a winter and uh,</v>

6152
02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:22.500
<v Speaker 1>it was a very intimate feeling when you're eating the liver of an animal that</v>

6153
02:32:22.501 --> 02:32:24.030
<v Speaker 1>you just shot a couple hours ago.</v>

6154
02:32:24.050 --> 02:32:24.883
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

6155
02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:26.233
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking delicious.</v>

6156
02:32:26.430 --> 02:32:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably delicious.</v>

6157
02:32:27.391 --> 02:32:31.260
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is it's the most ethical way to approach it because that animal</v>

6158
02:32:31.261 --> 02:32:33.380
<v Speaker 1>is probably not going to survive much longer anyway.</v>

6159
02:32:33.690 --> 02:32:35.300
<v Speaker 1>It gets unfucking believable.</v>

6160
02:32:35.301 --> 02:32:37.860
<v Speaker 1>He cold in Montana in the winter and a lot of them just freeze to death.</v>

6161
02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:39.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucked up picture.</v>

6163
02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:42.990
<v Speaker 1>an elk frozen to death standing up.</v>

6164
02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:43.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6165
02:32:43.951 --> 02:32:45.570
<v Speaker 1>You want to know how brutal Colorado gets?</v>

6166
02:32:45.571 --> 02:32:46.260

6169
02:32:49.921 --> 02:32:51.660
<v Speaker 1>like trying to cross a lake or something like that,</v>

6170
02:32:51.661 --> 02:32:54.390
<v Speaker 1>just like standing up frozen.</v>

6171
02:32:55.100 --> 02:33:00.100
<v Speaker 1>It was a trying to how whatever wasn't really tall snow and it's stuck standing</v>

6172
02:33:00.241 --> 02:33:03.450
<v Speaker 1>up and animals have eaten big chunks off of it.</v>

6173
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:08.510
<v Speaker 1>So it is like this freaky carcass of this standing up Zombie elk that's a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that has like these chunks taking it out of its body,</v>

6175
02:33:11.521 --> 02:33:13.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's frozen standing up.</v>

6176
02:33:14.340 --> 02:33:15.030

6183
02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:26.370

<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

6205
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.980
<v Speaker 1>It is true.</v>

6206
02:33:59.190 --> 02:34:00.510
<v Speaker 1>I comes to the weather.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

6222
02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:15.691
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

6223

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6225
02:34:17.921 --> 02:34:18.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just the body.</v>

6226
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you could see the spine and the organs are all missing in the top area by</v>

6227
02:34:24.851 --> 02:34:25.481
<v Speaker 1>the spine.</v>

6228
02:34:25.481 --> 02:34:27.100
<v Speaker 1>And the organs are all like chew dancer.</v>

6229
02:34:27.101 --> 02:34:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

6230
02:34:27.490 --> 02:34:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6231
02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:28.813
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

6232
02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:29.621
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

6233
02:34:29.621 --> 02:34:30.490
<v Speaker 1>They get right to it.</v>

6234
02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:31.421
<v Speaker 1>What you gonna do,</v>

6235
02:34:31.421 --> 02:34:31.720
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

6236
02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:33.400
<v Speaker 1>they probably ate the asshole before it even died.</v>

6237
02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

6242
02:34:38.591 --> 02:34:39.071
<v Speaker 1>It was a bear.</v>

6243
02:34:39.071 --> 02:34:42.580
<v Speaker 1>There'd be nothing that has to be probably a coyotes or something like that.</v>

6244
02:34:42.581 --> 02:34:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Cause they didn't even knock it over or chew through the bone wolves that are</v>

6245
02:34:45.741 --> 02:34:46.600
<v Speaker 1>probably chewed right through the,</v>

6256
02:34:56.991 --> 02:34:57.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6258
02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:02.230
<v Speaker 1>people that people always request this and I never get around to it.</v>

6259
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6260
02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:03.341
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

6261
02:35:03.341 --> 02:35:03.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6262
02:35:03.730 --> 02:35:05.170
<v Speaker 1>when fighters are on,</v>

6263
02:35:05.530 --> 02:35:05.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6264
02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:10.600
<v Speaker 1>to talk about upcoming cards because there's a bunch of like really interesting</v>

6265
02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:12.580
<v Speaker 1>fights coming up that people are interested in.</v>

6266
02:35:12.590 --> 02:35:13.031
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

6267
02:35:13.031 --> 02:35:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I got to ask you,</v>

6268
02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:14.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6269
02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:16.870
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about Anderson and Chris Weidman,</v>

6270
02:35:16.900 --> 02:35:17.950
<v Speaker 1>the rematch that fight?</v>

6271
02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I think this time,</v>

6272
02:35:21.850 --> 02:35:22.091
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6273
02:35:22.091 --> 02:35:23.110
<v Speaker 2>obviously Chris,</v>

6274
02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:24.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6275
02:35:24.701 --> 02:35:25.660
<v Speaker 2>can beat him I think,</v>

6276
02:35:25.690 --> 02:35:26.950
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think he's going to,</v>

6277
02:35:26.951 --> 02:35:29.230
<v Speaker 2>I think I think Anderson is going to blast through them quick.</v>

6278
02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:30.093
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

6279
02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I saw a turn in that second round where I just,</v>

6280
02:35:34.871 --> 02:35:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I thought that the tie,</v>

6281
02:35:35.801 --> 02:35:40.801
<v Speaker 2>they completely turned and Anderson does the same thing he always does and it's</v>

6282
02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:42.850
<v Speaker 2>one to dip,</v>

6283
02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:43.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6284
02:35:43.221 --> 02:35:43.591
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

6285
02:35:43.591 --> 02:35:46.180
<v Speaker 2>because it's MMA guys don't know how to box very well.</v>

6286
02:35:46.181 --> 02:35:47.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just a straight basic one,</v>

6287
02:35:47.561 --> 02:35:48.250
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

6288
02:35:48.250 --> 02:35:48.790
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

6289
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:50.260
<v Speaker 2>And he always goes the same way.</v>

6290
02:35:50.261 --> 02:35:50.651
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

6291
02:35:50.651 --> 02:35:51.041
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

6292
02:35:51.041 --> 02:35:52.810
<v Speaker 2>And then if you start to pressure him,</v>

6293
02:35:52.811 --> 02:35:55.300
<v Speaker 2>he goes back and dips to that cause that side.</v>

6294
02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:58.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the same watch other video.</v>

6295
02:35:58.491 --> 02:35:59.170
<v Speaker 2>It's what he does.</v>

6296
02:35:59.170 --> 02:35:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6297
02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:00.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6298
02:36:00.610 --> 02:36:03.160
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know why mine have not even known it,</v>

6299
02:36:03.161 --> 02:36:04.420
<v Speaker 2>but all he did was take one step.</v>

6300
02:36:04.421 --> 02:36:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I met Ray Longo knew it.</v>

6301
02:36:06.010 --> 02:36:06.670
<v Speaker 2>All he did was,</v>

6302
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6303
02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:07.773
<v Speaker 2>flash,</v>

6304
02:36:08.110 --> 02:36:09.550
<v Speaker 2>he kind of stepped into South Bulb,</v>

6305
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:12.340
<v Speaker 2>flashed out of jab and then through the hook and it was ugly.</v>

6306
02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:12.911
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

6307
02:36:12.911 --> 02:36:14.530
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't beautiful textbook punching,</v>

6308
02:36:14.531 --> 02:36:15.270
<v Speaker 2>but it worked</v>

6309
02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:15.421
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

6310
02:36:15.421 --> 02:36:15.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6311
02:36:15.631 --> 02:36:17.730
<v Speaker 1>that's that same hook that he knocked your hall out with.</v>

6312
02:36:17.731 --> 02:36:22.080
<v Speaker 1>He has a weird long hook where he is this arm like fully extended and he catches</v>

6313
02:36:22.081 --> 02:36:24.030
<v Speaker 1>you on the end with like his hand turned.</v>

6314
02:36:24.060 --> 02:36:24.421
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6315
02:36:24.421 --> 02:36:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

6316
02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:24.841
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

6317
02:36:24.841 --> 02:36:25.051
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

6318
02:36:25.051 --> 02:36:26.640
<v Speaker 1>and Anderson's used to being out here.</v>

6319
02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6320
02:36:26.990 --> 02:36:27.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6321
02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:27.860
<v Speaker 1>and he already got</v>

6322
02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:28.641
<v Speaker 2>crack coming in.</v>

6323
02:36:28.641 --> 02:36:30.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

6324
02:36:30.130 --> 02:36:33.080
<v Speaker 2>he ate mean he just got lazy to come overconfident or whatever it was.</v>

6325
02:36:33.081 --> 02:36:33.231
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

6326
02:36:33.231 --> 02:36:34.790
<v Speaker 2>but I think that he,</v>

6327
02:36:36.020 --> 02:36:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see him in blitz Weidman.</v>

6328
02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:39.801
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

6329
02:36:39.801 --> 02:36:42.500
<v Speaker 2>because I want to see Anderson do it to somebody because he does it so</v>

6330
02:36:42.501 --> 02:36:43.310
<v Speaker 2>beautifully.</v>

6331
02:36:43.310 --> 02:36:44.000
<v Speaker 2>And then nothing against</v>

6332
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:44.321
<v Speaker 1>Chris.</v>

6333
02:36:44.321 --> 02:36:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6334
02:36:44.690 --> 02:36:45.523
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

6335
02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:46.251
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

6336
02:36:46.251 --> 02:36:49.490
<v Speaker 1>He's the most beautiful guy to watch as far as movement by far.</v>

6337
02:36:49.491 --> 02:36:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6338
02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:50.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6339
02:36:50.241 --> 02:36:51.074
<v Speaker 1>He's um,</v>

6340
02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:53.280
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to wrap your head around that.</v>

6341
02:36:53.310 --> 02:36:56.000
<v Speaker 1>He could like a guy like Chris Weidman and want to see him get fucked up.</v>

6342
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.990
<v Speaker 1>People don't understand that.</v>

6343
02:36:56.991 --> 02:36:58.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not what it is.</v>

6344
02:36:58.220 --> 02:37:00.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just you want to see the performance.</v>

6345
02:37:00.290 --> 02:37:00.681
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6346
02:37:00.681 --> 02:37:01.071
<v Speaker 1>I want to see,</v>

6347
02:37:01.071 --> 02:37:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I want to see a beautiful performance and,</v>

6348
02:37:02.881 --> 02:37:05.810
<v Speaker 1>and no one makes it more beautiful than Anderson and when it's against a really</v>

6349
02:37:05.811 --> 02:37:06.501
<v Speaker 1>tough guy,</v>

6350
02:37:06.501 --> 02:37:08.630
<v Speaker 1>it makes it performance all the more spectacular.</v>

6351
02:37:08.631 --> 02:37:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6352
02:37:09.050 --> 02:37:10.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge rich Franklin fan.</v>

6353
02:37:10.730 --> 02:37:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I've always been a rich Franklin fan and he's a great guy.</v>

6354
02:37:12.771 --> 02:37:13.740
<v Speaker 1>He was a great champion.</v>

6355
02:37:13.741 --> 02:37:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6356
02:37:13.970 --> 02:37:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So when beat Franklin for the title,</v>

6357
02:37:16.611 --> 02:37:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I knew how fucking tough rich Franklin is.</v>

6358
02:37:18.810 --> 02:37:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6359
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So it made it all the more crazy.</v>

6360
02:37:20.810 --> 02:37:22.940
<v Speaker 1>When you're watching that you're like Jesus Christ.</v>

6361
02:37:22.941 --> 02:37:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

6362
02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:25.910
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know how tough Lee Marie is,</v>

6363
02:37:26.460 --> 02:37:28.060
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know how toughly Marius,</v>

6364
02:37:28.290 --> 02:37:31.370
<v Speaker 1>watch Lee Marie versus Anderson Silva Watch first of all,</v>

6365
02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:35.000
<v Speaker 1>watch lean Murray versus a host of other motherfuckers that he just slept with</v>

6366
02:37:35.001 --> 02:37:35.834
<v Speaker 1>like one punch,</v>

6367
02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:38.060
<v Speaker 1>like a mere renova already slept him.</v>

6368
02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:40.130
<v Speaker 1>He was a sniper.</v>

6369
02:37:40.131 --> 02:37:42.680
<v Speaker 1>He hit a piston of a right hand and he's that guy.</v>

6370
02:37:42.690 --> 02:37:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Different breed,</v>

6371
02:37:43.310 --> 02:37:45.530
<v Speaker 1>that gap psychopath.</v>

6372
02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Well he's in jail right now.</v>

6373
02:37:46.491 --> 02:37:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this podcast.</v>

6374
02:37:47.631 --> 02:37:49.100
<v Speaker 1>He listens to the pockets of Morocco.</v>

6375
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6376
02:37:49.850 --> 02:37:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I think he's still in Morocco.</v>

6377
02:37:51.470 --> 02:37:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I probably living in the castle,</v>

6378
02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:56.960
<v Speaker 1>they probably got like a little man hole in his gym and his uh,</v>

6379
02:37:56.961 --> 02:37:57.920
<v Speaker 1>his cage rather.</v>

6380
02:37:57.921 --> 02:37:58.760
<v Speaker 1>And like when Smith,</v>

6381
02:37:58.780 --> 02:37:59.571
<v Speaker 1>the guards go to bread.</v>

6382
02:37:59.571 --> 02:37:59.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6383
02:37:59.691 --> 02:38:01.670
<v Speaker 1>he went and got a girl pregnant while he's in the cage in prison.</v>

6384
02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:04.820
<v Speaker 1>He probably has like a little man hall and he opens it up and it's like fucking</v>

6385
02:38:04.850 --> 02:38:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Saddam Hussein's palace underneath the gym.</v>

6386
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:07.800
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

6387
02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:09.170
<v Speaker 1>he's a crazy criminal character,</v>

6388
02:38:09.530 --> 02:38:11.360
<v Speaker 1>but he was an excellent fighter.</v>

6389
02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:12.050
<v Speaker 1>His Day.</v>

6390
02:38:12.050 --> 02:38:17.050
<v Speaker 1>It very dangerous striker and Anderson Silva just ran it on him and the way he</v>

6391
02:38:17.751 --> 02:38:22.751
<v Speaker 1>attacked him so systematically his legs out from under him and Anderson just</v>

6392
02:38:22.851 --> 02:38:26.570
<v Speaker 1>fought brilliantly and also showed a fucking worldclass chin.</v>

6393
02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6394
02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:27.260
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

6395
02:38:27.260 --> 02:38:30.590
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting because this is the first time we've really seen Anderson</v>

6396
02:38:30.591 --> 02:38:32.900
<v Speaker 1>staggered and hurt and stopped.</v>

6397
02:38:32.930 --> 02:38:34.590
<v Speaker 1>It's never happened before and it's,</v>

6398
02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:34.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6399
02:38:34.970 --> 02:38:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6400
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:36.140
<v Speaker 1>it's such a cliche.</v>

6401
02:38:36.290 --> 02:38:37.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the shot you didn't expect.</v>

6402
02:38:37.521 --> 02:38:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6403
02:38:38.170 --> 02:38:38.991
<v Speaker 1>So cliche,</v>

6404
02:38:38.991 --> 02:38:41.420
<v Speaker 1>but even on a great fighter like Anderson,</v>

6405
02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean even on a great fighter like Anderson,</v>

6406
02:38:43.791 --> 02:38:44.840
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to believe,</v>

6407
02:38:44.930 --> 02:38:46.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's a shot that you didn't expect.</v>

6408
02:38:46.461 --> 02:38:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6409
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:50.600
<v Speaker 1>And perfectly landed point of the Chin Rep legs go,</v>

6410
02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:51.621
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

6411
02:38:51.621 --> 02:38:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Lights are amazing,</v>

6412
02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:54.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

6413
02:38:54.291 --> 02:38:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I think in a way it's poetic that he's the guy who got caught that way.</v>

6414
02:38:59.030 --> 02:38:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6415
02:38:59.510 --> 02:39:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Because as much as I'm a huge Anderson Silva Fan and I will never not be the guy</v>

6416
02:39:04.011 --> 02:39:07.490
<v Speaker 1>who was like a human highlight real of excellence.</v>

6417
02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:09.590
<v Speaker 1>That's how I would describe Anderson Silva's career,</v>

6418
02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:11.150
<v Speaker 1>just infection perfection.</v>

6419
02:39:11.690 --> 02:39:14.660
<v Speaker 1>But it's good for young guys to see.</v>

6420
02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:16.640
<v Speaker 1>It's good for young guys come up to go,</v>

6421
02:39:16.641 --> 02:39:16.881
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

6422
02:39:16.881 --> 02:39:17.780
<v Speaker 1>that can happen.</v>

6423
02:39:17.810 --> 02:39:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Even to that guy.</v>

6424
02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:19.793
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

6425
02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:20.850
<v Speaker 1>That can happen either.</v>

6426
02:39:20.850 --> 02:39:21.740
<v Speaker 1>But you can do that though.</v>

6427
02:39:21.741 --> 02:39:22.131
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

6428
02:39:22.131 --> 02:39:23.920
<v Speaker 1>You can do it only out.</v>

6429
02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Only for so long.</v>

6430
02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:25.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6431
02:39:25.731 --> 02:39:29.930
<v Speaker 1>we're there with depends on who you're fighting to and what's the circumstance.</v>

6432
02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:30.793
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

6433

6442
02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:42.490
<v Speaker 1>going to beat the crap out of each other.</v>

6443
02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:44.060
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of people who don't know.</v>

6444
02:39:44.061 --> 02:39:46.520
<v Speaker 1>If you don't remember John Howard and you know,</v>

6447
02:39:51.591 --> 02:39:52.880
<v Speaker 1>fucking competition.</v>

6448
02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:54.450
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate fighter is like the,</v>

6449
02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:54.661
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

6450
02:39:54.661 --> 02:39:56.300
<v Speaker 1>the highlight reel of ultimate fighter.</v>

6451
02:39:56.301 --> 02:39:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt at the tops arrival hall.</v>

6452
02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:58.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6453
02:39:58.121 --> 02:39:58.580
<v Speaker 1>by far,</v>

6454
02:39:58.580 --> 02:39:59.331
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>

6455
02:39:59.331 --> 02:40:03.290
<v Speaker 1>That wheel kick k that the right hand to make it into the finals.</v>

6456
02:40:03.291 --> 02:40:03.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6457
02:40:03.471 --> 02:40:05.030
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking monster,</v>

6458
02:40:05.031 --> 02:40:05.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6459
02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:06.440
<v Speaker 1>He is really tough.</v>

6460
02:40:06.470 --> 02:40:07.580
<v Speaker 1>His striking is so,</v>

6461
02:40:07.581 --> 02:40:11.900
<v Speaker 1>but you know who throws fucking hammers dooms day.</v>

6462
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:13.063
<v Speaker 1>John Howard,</v>

6463
02:40:13.260 --> 02:40:14.460
<v Speaker 1>a good Yammer,</v>

6464
02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:15.420
<v Speaker 2>tie striker.</v>

6465
02:40:15.421 --> 02:40:18.090
<v Speaker 2>He's real good able to do that and I think it's,</v>

6466
02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:19.831
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

6467
02:40:19.831 --> 02:40:20.121
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

6468
02:40:20.121 --> 02:40:20.821
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough call.</v>

6469
02:40:20.821 --> 02:40:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to go with your idea I think,</v>

6470
02:40:22.531 --> 02:40:26.640
<v Speaker 2>but I mean if anyone's going to end up spoiling that party,</v>

6471
02:40:26.641 --> 02:40:27.474
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be Howard.</v>

6472
02:40:27.850 --> 02:40:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Well you know Howard is also only like five seven.</v>

6473
02:40:30.670 --> 02:40:30.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6474
02:40:30.881 --> 02:40:31.770
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying is short.</v>

6475
02:40:31.930 --> 02:40:32.763
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

6476
02:40:32.980 --> 02:40:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

6477
02:40:33.821 --> 02:40:35.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's off thick motherfucker.</v>

6478
02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:37.470
<v Speaker 1>There's some guys that even at,</v>

6479
02:40:37.471 --> 02:40:39.250
<v Speaker 1>especially as they get older in their career,</v>

6480
02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:41.170
<v Speaker 1>they actually do better when they go up in weight.</v>

6481
02:40:41.470 --> 02:40:41.861
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

6482
02:40:41.861 --> 02:40:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's going to be the case where a wonder if he can carry that</v>

6483
02:40:44.501 --> 02:40:44.861
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

6484
02:40:44.861 --> 02:40:45.970
<v Speaker 1>that one 70 pounds.</v>

6485
02:40:46.270 --> 02:40:49.330
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker carries that power so hard.</v>

6486
02:40:49.690 --> 02:40:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It does it.</v>

6487
02:40:50.180 --> 02:40:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got that kind of hit hardware.</v>

6488
02:40:52.060 --> 02:40:54.040
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if he goes up a weight class,</v>

6489
02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you know it's probably the guys are going to be able to absorb it better.</v>

6490
02:40:57.010 --> 02:40:57.550
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

6491
02:40:57.550 --> 02:41:02.550
<v Speaker 1>he throws some stupid one punch power that hauls got a very diverse game too</v>

6492
02:41:03.221 --> 02:41:03.850
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

6493
02:41:03.850 --> 02:41:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Hall does a lot of wild shit.</v>

6494
02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6495
02:41:06.470 --> 02:41:06.980
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

6496
02:41:06.980 --> 02:41:07.880
<v Speaker 2>that's a very,</v>

6497
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.830
<v Speaker 2>cause you,</v>

6498
02:41:08.830 --> 02:41:09.621
<v Speaker 2>when you get the guy that's,</v>

6499
02:41:09.621 --> 02:41:10.454
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>

6500
02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:11.390
<v Speaker 2>very [inaudible],</v>

6501
02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:12.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6502
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:16.190
<v Speaker 2>sometimes that random shits either going to work really well or it's going to</v>

6503
02:41:16.191 --> 02:41:18.320
<v Speaker 2>get you in some trouble and you're gonna take a fucking beating.</v>

6504
02:41:18.530 --> 02:41:18.951
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

6505
02:41:18.951 --> 02:41:19.131
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6506
02:41:19.131 --> 02:41:22.580
<v Speaker 2>If you miss and you slept and your back is turned and did you just going to get</v>

6507
02:41:22.581 --> 02:41:23.240
<v Speaker 2>bludgeoned,</v>

6508
02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:23.920
<v Speaker 2>especially if you can</v>

6509
02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:24.840
<v Speaker 1>catch your legs.</v>

6510
02:41:25.210 --> 02:41:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's interesting.</v>

6511
02:41:26.430 --> 02:41:26.701
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

6512
02:41:26.701 --> 02:41:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting thing because your eye has a,</v>

6513
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6514
02:41:28.980 --> 02:41:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean he obviously has a lot of Moitai skills as well,</v>

6515
02:41:31.291 --> 02:41:34.470
<v Speaker 1>but he also has a lot of traditional like karate style,</v>

6516
02:41:34.471 --> 02:41:36.150
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo style techniques.</v>

6517
02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It's always interesting when you see those,</v>

6518
02:41:38.071 --> 02:41:38.201
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

6519
02:41:38.201 --> 02:41:39.034
<v Speaker 1>the clash of those.</v>

6520
02:41:39.390 --> 02:41:39.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6521
02:41:39.631 --> 02:41:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I was actually just talking to a layout as brother on the way back from the,</v>

6522
02:41:43.471 --> 02:41:46.440
<v Speaker 2>from the fight to the hotel and uh,</v>

6523
02:41:47.290 --> 02:41:48.031
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of awkward.</v>

6524
02:41:48.031 --> 02:41:48.230
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

6525
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:49.500
<v Speaker 2>so who do you think one?</v>

6526
02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

6527
02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:52.193
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

6528
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:53.310
<v Speaker 2>honestly that fight sucked.</v>

6529
02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:55.220
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the best fight of,</v>

6530
02:41:55.221 --> 02:41:56.070
<v Speaker 2>but I enjoyed it.</v>

6531
02:41:56.130 --> 02:41:56.910
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

6532
02:41:56.910 --> 02:41:57.681
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that fight,</v>

6533
02:41:57.681 --> 02:41:58.351
<v Speaker 2>so it was just,</v>

6534
02:41:58.351 --> 02:41:58.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6535
02:41:58.800 --> 02:41:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean for,</v>

6536
02:41:59.520 --> 02:41:59.861
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

6537
02:41:59.861 --> 02:42:04.510
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like it very much because I think that neither of them did enough to,</v>

6538
02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:05.940
<v Speaker 2>to really win that much.</v>

6539
02:42:05.941 --> 02:42:06.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6540
02:42:06.121 --> 02:42:06.331
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

6541
02:42:06.331 --> 02:42:06.490
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

6542
02:42:06.490 --> 02:42:07.470
<v Speaker 2>it was a toss up.</v>

6543
02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:07.981
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

6544
02:42:07.981 --> 02:42:09.540
<v Speaker 2>it was just not exciting to me.</v>

6545
02:42:09.541 --> 02:42:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're so crazy.</v>

6546
02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was very exciting.</v>

6547
02:42:12.030 --> 02:42:14.400
<v Speaker 2>It was just so crazy.</v>

6548
02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:15.930
<v Speaker 2>It was just one of the things that,</v>

6549
02:42:15.931 --> 02:42:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6550
02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:16.891
<v Speaker 2>it had,</v>

6551
02:42:16.891 --> 02:42:17.940
<v Speaker 2>it had flashes of brilliance.</v>

6552
02:42:17.941 --> 02:42:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Both guys are awesome.</v>

6553
02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I liked both guys a lot.</v>

6554
02:42:20.011 --> 02:42:20.341
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

6555
02:42:20.341 --> 02:42:21.510
<v Speaker 2>it just was a bad matchup.</v>

6556
02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:22.291
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work out well.</v>

6557
02:42:22.291 --> 02:42:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6558
02:42:22.430 --> 02:42:23.300
<v Speaker 1>you know what I think,</v>

6559
02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that it wasn't as exciting as it could have been because not a lot of</v>

6560
02:42:28.671 --> 02:42:29.810
<v Speaker 1>action took place.</v>

6561
02:42:29.811 --> 02:42:34.370
<v Speaker 1>But to me it was very entertaining because I was watching a puzzle take place.</v>

6562
02:42:34.371 --> 02:42:34.760
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

6563
02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:36.320
<v Speaker 1>And I was watching it trying to be solved.</v>

6564
02:42:36.321 --> 02:42:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I was watching Phil Davis tried to hit to take down.</v>

6565
02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6566
02:42:38.420 --> 02:42:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I was watching Liotta try to defend and land shots.</v>

6567
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:42.980
<v Speaker 1>And Phil Davis landing shots of his own.</v>

6568
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6569
02:42:43.730 --> 02:42:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's interesting,</v>

6570
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:45.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6571
02:42:45.111 --> 02:42:48.890
<v Speaker 1>if it was just a kickboxing match it would be curious to see how it would have</v>

6572
02:42:48.891 --> 02:42:49.724
<v Speaker 1>gone down.</v>

6573
02:42:49.730 --> 02:42:52.280
<v Speaker 1>But you throw in the wrestling and you know,</v>

6574
02:42:52.281 --> 02:42:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Davis accounted himself very well on the feet.</v>

6575
02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6576
02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Which I think surprised a lot of people.</v>

6577
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:57.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6578
02:42:57.141 --> 02:42:59.000
<v Speaker 1>you look at the way Machida knocked out.</v>

6579
02:42:59.001 --> 02:42:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Bader,</v>

6580
02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:03.740
<v Speaker 1>you look at the way Machida knocked out Thiago Silva Machida's used that sniping</v>

6581
02:43:03.741 --> 02:43:07.880
<v Speaker 1>style on some really highly skilled strikers and fuck them up bad.</v>

6582
02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:08.200
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

6583
02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:08.290
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

6584
02:43:08.290 --> 02:43:09.710
<v Speaker 1>especially the Thiago Silva fight,</v>

6585
02:43:09.711 --> 02:43:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ooh.</v>

6586
02:43:10.930 --> 02:43:13.570
<v Speaker 1>And Bader man caught him with one punch coming in.</v>

6587
02:43:13.571 --> 02:43:15.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a bad motherfucker as far as his counters.</v>

6588
02:43:16.180 --> 02:43:19.360
<v Speaker 1>And Phil Davis didn't really take any of them full clip.</v>

6589
02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:19.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6590
02:43:19.930 --> 02:43:20.770
<v Speaker 1>he avoided,</v>

6591
02:43:21.010 --> 02:43:23.170
<v Speaker 1>he took some shots but he rolled with a lot of them.</v>

6592
02:43:23.380 --> 02:43:24.550
<v Speaker 1>He had good defense,</v>

6593
02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:25.540
<v Speaker 1>took a good shot.</v>

6594
02:43:25.541 --> 02:43:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Like it showed good chin constantly.</v>

6595
02:43:27.701 --> 02:43:27.791
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

6596
02:43:27.791 --> 02:43:28.780
<v Speaker 1>He never was squared up.</v>

6597
02:43:28.781 --> 02:43:29.291
<v Speaker 1>He was constant.</v>

6598
02:43:29.291 --> 02:43:31.270
<v Speaker 1>He was constantly moving back and forth and,</v>

6599
02:43:31.271 --> 02:43:32.260
<v Speaker 1>and had good head movement.</v>

6600
02:43:32.410 --> 02:43:33.250
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

6601
02:43:33.251 --> 02:43:35.110
<v Speaker 1>I think Machida landed more strikes.</v>

6602
02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

6603
02:43:35.530 --> 02:43:35.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6604
02:43:35.741 --> 02:43:39.010
<v Speaker 1>so it becomes a matter of what's more important is to take down more important.</v>

6605
02:43:39.250 --> 02:43:41.140
<v Speaker 1>But when he did he hit a take down what,</v>

6606
02:43:41.141 --> 02:43:43.510
<v Speaker 1>how much damage was actually accomplished during a tank down.</v>

6607
02:43:43.511 --> 02:43:44.344
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6608
02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like there's like a,</v>

6609
02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:48.600
<v Speaker 1>an overhaul that needs to be done with the scoring system?</v>

6610
02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:52.330
<v Speaker 1>They definitely need to figure this out because there's been so many,</v>

6611
02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6612
02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:53.370
<v Speaker 1>put my,</v>

6613
02:43:53.370 --> 02:43:54.880
<v Speaker 1>my shitty call aside.</v>

6614
02:43:54.910 --> 02:43:55.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6615
02:43:55.151 --> 02:43:57.460
<v Speaker 1>there's been so many that are bad that,</v>

6616
02:43:57.520 --> 02:43:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean they need to have a,</v>

6617
02:43:58.930 --> 02:43:59.763
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6618
02:43:59.890 --> 02:44:04.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a scoring system where a takedown is this much,</v>

6619
02:44:04.450 --> 02:44:04.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6620
02:44:04.631 --> 02:44:05.110
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

6621
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:08.860
<v Speaker 1>it just has to be like fought over by a big group people to just to just figure</v>

6622
02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:09.850
<v Speaker 1>out every angle,</v>

6623
02:44:09.851 --> 02:44:10.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6624
02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:10.721
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

6625
02:44:10.721 --> 02:44:13.540
<v Speaker 1>and because people are going to keep on getting screwed no matter what.</v>

6626
02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:14.980
<v Speaker 1>And for folks who don't understand,</v>

6627
02:44:14.981 --> 02:44:15.610
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

6628
02:44:15.610 --> 02:44:17.620
<v Speaker 1>we talked about if you're not like a fan of the sport,</v>

6629
02:44:17.650 --> 02:44:18.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

6630
02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:18.401
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

6631
02:44:18.401 --> 02:44:21.250
<v Speaker 1>the state athletic commission is the one who uh,</v>

6632
02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:23.680
<v Speaker 1>choose the judges and you know,</v>

6633
02:44:23.681 --> 02:44:27.220
<v Speaker 1>the rules are in place essentially like piggyback from boxing.</v>

6634
02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6635
02:44:27.490 --> 02:44:28.000
<v Speaker 1>they paid,</v>

6636
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:29.500
<v Speaker 1>they took the ten nine system.</v>

6637
02:44:29.550 --> 02:44:31.150
<v Speaker 1>So one fighter,</v>

6638
02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:31.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6639
02:44:31.570 --> 02:44:32.351
<v Speaker 1>if they win,</v>

6640
02:44:32.351 --> 02:44:33.160
<v Speaker 1>they get 10 points.</v>

6641
02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:33.971
<v Speaker 1>If they lose the round,</v>

6642
02:44:33.971 --> 02:44:37.360
<v Speaker 1>they get nine points and the difference is in a boxing match,</v>

6643
02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:38.201
<v Speaker 1>there's 10,</v>

6644
02:44:38.201 --> 02:44:39.280
<v Speaker 1>nine and then there's 10,</v>

6645
02:44:39.281 --> 02:44:39.551
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

6646
02:44:39.551 --> 02:44:40.320
<v Speaker 1>If there's a knockdown,</v>

6647
02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:40.541
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

6648
02:44:40.541 --> 02:44:42.210
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to define ten seventh,</v>

6649
02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:42.991
<v Speaker 1>there's two knocked down.</v>

6650
02:44:42.991 --> 02:44:43.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

6651
02:44:43.090 --> 02:44:44.290
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty easy to define.</v>

6652
02:44:44.410 --> 02:44:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that fighter gets knocked down but wins the round.</v>

6653
02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in MMA you're dealing with a longer round and you're dealing with all</v>

6654
02:44:51.611 --> 02:44:52.391
<v Speaker 1>these other variables,</v>

6655
02:44:52.391 --> 02:44:54.670
<v Speaker 1>kicks and take downs near submission attempts.</v>

6656
02:44:54.850 --> 02:44:56.560
<v Speaker 1>If a guy like peppers,</v>

6657
02:44:56.620 --> 02:45:00.370
<v Speaker 1>a guy with a with strikes and then he gets taken down.</v>

6658
02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:03.820
<v Speaker 1>But absolutely nothing happens while he's on the ground.</v>

6659
02:45:03.821 --> 02:45:04.960
<v Speaker 1>He just ties the guy up.</v>

6660
02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:08.710
<v Speaker 1>How much damage does he take and is it equal to all the punches that he landed</v>

6661
02:45:08.711 --> 02:45:09.491
<v Speaker 1>before you were taking?</v>

6662
02:45:09.491 --> 02:45:10.324
<v Speaker 1>He was taken down.</v>

6663
02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a weird situation of like what's worth more forcing the fight into</v>

6664
02:45:14.231 --> 02:45:15.610
<v Speaker 1>the area where the fighter wants it,</v>

6665
02:45:15.611 --> 02:45:19.330
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through a takedown or forcing the fight by standing up and landing</v>

6666
02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:20.710
<v Speaker 1>strikes Leister by stopping the tape.</v>

6667
02:45:20.750 --> 02:45:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6668
02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:21.851
<v Speaker 1>What is more,</v>

6669
02:45:21.851 --> 02:45:22.601
<v Speaker 1>what's worth more?</v>

6670
02:45:22.601 --> 02:45:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Is it a,</v>

6671
02:45:23.410 --> 02:45:23.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6672
02:45:23.711 --> 02:45:26.980
<v Speaker 1>a take down or defending yourself and attacking from the guard and getting a</v>

6673
02:45:26.981 --> 02:45:27.581
<v Speaker 1>near submission?</v>

6674
02:45:27.581 --> 02:45:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6675
02:45:27.970 --> 02:45:30.250
<v Speaker 1>like if a guy takes you down but you almost get them in a triangle like,</v>

6676
02:45:30.730 --> 02:45:31.240
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

6677
02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:33.180
<v Speaker 1>how does a judge really know how to score that correctly?</v>

6678
02:45:33.250 --> 02:45:34.330
<v Speaker 1>That's it gets tricky.</v>

6679
02:45:34.331 --> 02:45:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6680
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Especially not some random person who got their job just because they know they</v>

6681
02:45:39.071 --> 02:45:40.240
<v Speaker 1>know someone who works there.</v>

6682
02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:40.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6683
02:45:40.571 --> 02:45:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure they teach them some stuff,</v>

6684
02:45:42.490 --> 02:45:44.590
<v Speaker 1>but my take on it has always been there.</v>

6685
02:45:44.591 --> 02:45:49.060
<v Speaker 1>So many fans out there that would love that Gig and they were like huge fans of</v>

6686
02:45:49.061 --> 02:45:50.980
<v Speaker 1>MMA and would do a good job.</v>

6687
02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Much better job.</v>

6688
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6689
02:45:52.180 --> 02:45:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be like a Yelp thing and the Internet Yelp thing.</v>

6690
02:45:54.730 --> 02:45:56.530
<v Speaker 1>They should do what you do without at the UFC from now on,</v>

6691
02:45:56.531 --> 02:46:01.390
<v Speaker 1>which do online vote came to give them an opportunity for an online metro pcs</v>

6692
02:46:01.391 --> 02:46:01.840
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>

6693
02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:02.591
<v Speaker 1>Metro pcs.</v>

6694
02:46:02.591 --> 02:46:03.424
<v Speaker 1>Let's make this happen.</v>

6695
02:46:03.540 --> 02:46:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a bud light vote,</v>

6696
02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:04.781
<v Speaker 1>bud light.</v>

6697
02:46:04.781 --> 02:46:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Bud light doesn't like us anymore.</v>

6698
02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:07.090
<v Speaker 1>The Culinary Union got rid of him.</v>

6699
02:46:07.340 --> 02:46:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

6700
02:46:07.740 --> 02:46:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bud light or Miller,</v>

6701
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:09.943
<v Speaker 1>wherever it was.</v>

6702
02:46:10.270 --> 02:46:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

6703
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6718
02:46:25.361 --> 02:46:25.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6719
02:46:25.601 --> 02:46:25.811
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

6720
02:46:25.811 --> 02:46:26.631
<v Speaker 1>we saw that in,</v>

6721
02:46:26.631 --> 02:46:26.921
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

6722
02:46:26.921 --> 02:46:27.611
<v Speaker 1>in the Silva fight.</v>

6723
02:46:27.611 --> 02:46:28.331
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out.</v>

6724
02:46:28.331 --> 02:46:30.340
<v Speaker 1>He's a better fighter technically.</v>

6725
02:46:30.610 --> 02:46:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Then I think just about anyone in the heavyweight division,</v>

6726
02:46:32.711 --> 02:46:34.540
<v Speaker 1>if you break down just about each aspect,</v>

6727
02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:35.733
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

6728
02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:36.270
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

6729
02:46:36.270 --> 02:46:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's his lazy or what it is.</v>

6730
02:46:37.941 --> 02:46:38.220
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

6731
02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:38.851
<v Speaker 1>he casts out.</v>

6732
02:46:38.851 --> 02:46:40.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's something wrong with him.</v>

6733
02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:40.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6734
02:46:40.381 --> 02:46:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I think you also asked to deal with his hormones.</v>

6735
02:46:42.570 --> 02:46:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6736
02:46:43.140 --> 02:46:43.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6737
02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:44.790
<v Speaker 1>of course this is a reality of that.</v>

6738
02:46:44.890 --> 02:46:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Let,</v>

6739
02:46:45.270 --> 02:46:46.140
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest here.</v>

6740
02:46:46.220 --> 02:46:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6741
02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:47.910
<v Speaker 1>You can't not talk about that exactly.</v>

6742
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:53.070
<v Speaker 1>He had a completely different shape to his body when he came back after testing</v>

6743
02:46:53.551 --> 02:46:55.260
<v Speaker 1>positive for testosterone.</v>

6744
02:46:55.261 --> 02:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6745
02:46:55.710 --> 02:46:56.490
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

6746
02:46:56.490 --> 02:46:57.323
<v Speaker 1>when you do that,</v>

6747
02:46:57.450 --> 02:46:57.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6748
02:46:57.781 --> 02:46:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6749
02:46:58.320 --> 02:46:58.740
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

6750
02:46:58.740 --> 02:46:59.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6751
02:46:59.101 --> 02:47:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason to believe that he didn't accidentally get this injection by</v>

6752
02:47:03.451 --> 02:47:05.370
<v Speaker 1>this doctor who was going to fix your shoulder.</v>

6753
02:47:05.430 --> 02:47:05.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6754
02:47:05.551 --> 02:47:06.720
<v Speaker 1>It might have happened that way,</v>

6755
02:47:07.140 --> 02:47:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6756
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:11.940
<v Speaker 1>or it might've been that in pride and there's other organizations and k one you</v>

6757
02:47:11.941 --> 02:47:14.340
<v Speaker 1>could get away with doing things and then when you get off those things,</v>

6758
02:47:14.341 --> 02:47:16.890
<v Speaker 1>the problem is your body doesn't exactly know what the fucking do exactly.</v>

6759
02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:17.371
<v Speaker 1>Because uh,</v>

6760
02:47:17.371 --> 02:47:17.671
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

6761
02:47:17.671 --> 02:47:19.180
<v Speaker 1>your testosterone is really low and he,</v>

6762
02:47:19.181 --> 02:47:22.440
<v Speaker 1>so he tested like really low for his last fight against big foot.</v>

6763
02:47:22.470 --> 02:47:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6764
02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Like almost in like a dangerous area.</v>

6765
02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Like whoa,</v>

6766
02:47:25.230 --> 02:47:28.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a professional athlete and this is like really low and you're that big.</v>

6767
02:47:29.250 --> 02:47:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6768
02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:32.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting and it's unfortunate because man,</v>

6769
02:47:32.601 --> 02:47:35.070
<v Speaker 1>you juiced up dude up and he's a motherfucker.</v>

6770
02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6771
02:47:35.370 --> 02:47:36.203
<v Speaker 1>You know when,</v>

6772
02:47:36.270 --> 02:47:37.800
<v Speaker 1>when he was finding Brock Lesnar,</v>

6773
02:47:37.801 --> 02:47:38.940
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying he was juiced up,</v>

6774
02:47:38.941 --> 02:47:40.080
<v Speaker 1>but let's just say for instance,</v>

6775
02:47:40.081 --> 02:47:40.891
<v Speaker 1>if he was juiced up,</v>

6776
02:47:40.891 --> 02:47:42.300
<v Speaker 1>then God damn,</v>

6777
02:47:42.301 --> 02:47:43.560
<v Speaker 1>he looked good and scary.</v>

6778
02:47:44.010 --> 02:47:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Dude that fight against Brock Lesnar,</v>

6779
02:47:45.541 --> 02:47:46.980
<v Speaker 1>he ragdolled Lesnar,</v>

6780
02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:50.570
<v Speaker 1>he slammed those kicks into his body and he was kicking Lesnar and Lesnar was</v>

6781
02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:51.900
<v Speaker 1>just like ultra wrestler.</v>

6782
02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6783
02:47:52.270 --> 02:47:53.041
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give a fuck.</v>

6784
02:47:53.041 --> 02:47:56.110
<v Speaker 1>You still slamming kicks into objects and knees and do his midsection.</v>

6785
02:47:56.490 --> 02:47:59.070
<v Speaker 1>The clench and Laszlow couldn't take him down.</v>

6786
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.281
<v Speaker 1>You like,</v>

6787
02:47:59.281 --> 02:48:03.000
<v Speaker 1>how is this pain hundred pound guys that were just clubbing each other like,</v>

6788
02:48:03.001 --> 02:48:04.320
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>

6789
02:48:04.410 --> 02:48:05.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever he was on,</v>

6790
02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:06.660
<v Speaker 1>let's say he was on nothing.</v>

6791
02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6792
02:48:07.260 --> 02:48:08.100
<v Speaker 1>whatever that,</v>

6793
02:48:08.130 --> 02:48:10.050
<v Speaker 1>that shape that he was in back then,</v>

6794
02:48:10.170 --> 02:48:11.360
<v Speaker 1>that's the scary it.</v>

6795
02:48:11.370 --> 02:48:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6796
02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:12.511
<v Speaker 1>That's the Overeem.</v>

6797
02:48:12.511 --> 02:48:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Did everybody thought it was going to be the greatest heavyweight?</v>

6798
02:48:15.220 --> 02:48:15.841
<v Speaker 1>You've all time,</v>

6799
02:48:15.841 --> 02:48:17.450
<v Speaker 1>just wicked ground game.</v>

02:48:17.451 --> 02:48:17.971
<v Speaker 1>So Mitzvah,</v>

6801

<v Speaker 1>Torah,</v>

6802
02:48:18.151 --> 02:48:18.721
<v Speaker 1>Belford winds,</v>

6803
02:48:18.721 --> 02:48:20.040
<v Speaker 1>the Abu Dhabi trials.</v>

6804
02:48:20.310 --> 02:48:20.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

6805
02:48:20.691 --> 02:48:21.730
<v Speaker 1>he's a motherfucker one.</v>

6806
02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:22.583
<v Speaker 1>The Europeans,</v>

6807
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:23.521
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

6808
02:48:23.521 --> 02:48:24.100
<v Speaker 1>a grappler,</v>

6809
02:48:24.100 --> 02:48:24.960
<v Speaker 1>straight grappler.</v>

6810
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:26.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

6811
02:48:26.220 --> 02:48:27.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a big fucking fight,</v>

6812
02:48:27.331 --> 02:48:27.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6813
02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:28.240
<v Speaker 1>You know what else?</v>

6814
02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:29.073
<v Speaker 1>A big fine.</v>

6815
02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:31.753
<v Speaker 1>Travis.</v>

6816
02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6817
02:48:32.270 --> 02:48:32.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6818
02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:32.921
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>

6819
02:48:32.921 --> 02:48:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Matt Brown versus Mike Pyle.</v>

6820
02:48:35.290 --> 02:48:36.690
<v Speaker 1>That's another very interesting fight.</v>

6821
02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:37.360
<v Speaker 1>A good fight.</v>

6822
02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go,</v>

6823
02:48:37.770 --> 02:48:38.603
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with Mike.</v>

6824
02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6825
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:40.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

6826
02:48:40.030 --> 02:48:40.691
<v Speaker 1>I think piles too.</v>

6827
02:48:40.691 --> 02:48:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Crafty.</v>

6828
02:48:41.470 --> 02:48:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6829
02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:43.090
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I think it is.</v>

6830
02:48:43.091 --> 02:48:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that that Brown's good.</v>

6831
02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:45.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

6832
02:48:45.131 --> 02:48:45.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6833
02:48:45.341 --> 02:48:46.960
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously been in forever for a reason,</v>

6834
02:48:46.961 --> 02:48:47.651
<v Speaker 1>but I think that,</v>

6835
02:48:47.651 --> 02:48:48.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6836
02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:49.360
<v Speaker 1>that piles to crafty,</v>

6837
02:48:49.361 --> 02:48:49.541
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

6838
02:48:49.541 --> 02:48:52.260
<v Speaker 1>he'll end up getting him as something piles a craft and motherfucker,</v>

6839
02:48:52.270 --> 02:48:52.550
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

6840
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:54.070
<v Speaker 1>he's an underdog man.</v>

6841
02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's not in this fight necessarily.</v>

6842
02:48:56.411 --> 02:48:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it probably is listed as an underdog with Matt Brown coming off his</v>

6843
02:48:59.861 --> 02:49:00.460
<v Speaker 1>last fight.</v>

6844
02:49:00.460 --> 02:49:01.450
<v Speaker 1>But I meaning that division,</v>

6845
02:49:01.451 --> 02:49:02.350
<v Speaker 1>he's like a dark horse.</v>

6846
02:49:02.351 --> 02:49:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you can be sure.</v>

6847
02:49:03.020 --> 02:49:04.810
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the top guys,</v>

6848
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6849
02:49:05.261 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 1>and everybody that trains with Mike Pyle will you that like Mike Pyle and the</v>

6850
02:49:08.251 --> 02:49:09.950
<v Speaker 1>gym is this motherfucker.</v>

6851
02:49:09.970 --> 02:49:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6852
02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Like he's even guys that have beaten him.</v>

6853
02:49:12.031 --> 02:49:13.710
<v Speaker 1>He fucking trounces in the gym.</v>

6854
02:49:14.130 --> 02:49:14.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6855
02:49:14.491 --> 02:49:17.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like just sort of coming into his own final as a fighter.</v>

6856
02:49:18.510 --> 02:49:19.590
<v Speaker 1>And he's had a long career already,</v>

6857
02:49:19.800 --> 02:49:22.200
<v Speaker 1>but Matt Brown is a special kind of savage.</v>

6858
02:49:22.230 --> 02:49:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6859
02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:23.191
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

6860
02:49:23.191 --> 02:49:27.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a darkness to that man's heart when he fucking comes after dudes.</v>

6861
02:49:27.750 --> 02:49:28.530
<v Speaker 1>You could like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think they're beneficial for everybody.</v>

02:52:58.871 --> 02:53:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a perfect person.</v>

<v Speaker 1>perfect person.</v>

7024
02:53:01.751 --> 02:53:04.750

7034
02:53:14.321 --> 02:53:15.550
