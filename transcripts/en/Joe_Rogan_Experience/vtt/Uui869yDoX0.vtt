<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 2>it broke down the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

20
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.520
<v Speaker 2>how Fidel took over it from three </v>
<v Speaker 2>different cities,</v>

21
00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 2>how it was going down in three different</v>
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>

22
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.553
<v Speaker 2>And then I heard that he was writing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book about West New York and you city </v>

23
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Cubans where I grew up and I emailed him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I told him who I was,</v>

24
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:11.774
<v Speaker 2>that my mother had a bar and I grew up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that shit and he hit me back and we </v>

25
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 2>became friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came to a show and</v>

26
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

27

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

28
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 1>he reached out to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately when I was just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>finishing this book,</v>

30
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>so I had done most of the work and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was down on paper,</v>

31
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>but it was a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like he was,</v>

32
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.523
<v Speaker 1>he was like a character who walked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the book and I wished I'd met him </v>

33
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>earlier because I hadn't met too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters like him.</v>

34
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.653
<v Speaker 1>You need city's amazing place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people realize that it's </v>

35
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>one of those little enclaves happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be Cuban.</v>

36
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Mafia neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was Cubans,</v>

37
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>not Italians or it was like hell's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchen,</v>

38
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>which I wrote about in the Westies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was an Irish neighborhood,</v>

39
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>very intense neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A high premium on loyalty.</v>

40
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.873
<v Speaker 1>I'm young males running loyalty games on</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other all the time from the age of </v>

41
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we didn't know how far you'll go turn</v>

42
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>this sucker up.</v>

43
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>How far?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far will you go for me?</v>

44
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.153
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you willing to do for me in the</v>

46
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>case of Hell's kitchen in the westies it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was cut up bodies was not only would you</v>

47
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>kill somebody for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but will you make the potty disappear?</v>

48
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.373
<v Speaker 1>And they tested each other with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the cutting up of the bodies and </v>

49
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>union city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it was,</v>

50
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.130
<v Speaker 1>was political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it was political.</v>

51
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>How antifa Idella you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how badly do you want to kill,</v>

52
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fidel and help us reclaim our last </v>

53
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>homeland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of behind a lot of things.</v>

54
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:45.654
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't spoken about a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was sort of the hidden </v>

55
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Westies was a really fantastic book.</v>

56
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.463
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went deep into that whole sort of </v>

57
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 1>sub scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:57.954
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting crime infested </v>

59
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:00.814
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

60
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

61
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>what I try to do with these books is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the macro story.</v>

62
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.470
<v Speaker 1>The larger historical sociopolitical </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and then get intimate and tell the</v>

63
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:13.234
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal stories between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters that actually lived this </v>

64
00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a challenge.</v>

65
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.233
<v Speaker 1>You've got to find people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to talk to you and share </v>

66
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.923
<v Speaker 1>information with you that they've kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet probably most of their lives and </v>

67
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.144
<v Speaker 1>then you get at the interpersonal stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because these stories really are just </v>

68
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>human beings caught up in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bigger than them.</v>

69
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.133
<v Speaker 1>And how long when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're writing a book like the </v>

70
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:37.024
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your new book or Westies are </v>

71
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:39.454
<v Speaker 1>any of your books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you spend doing the </v>

72
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>research and how much time do you spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually writing the book,</v>

73
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.363
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes about three years to do these </v>

74
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>books on average and an n two of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>years is research probably.</v>

75
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>So you do bring this to the Book </v>
<v Speaker 1>Company,</v>

77
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>the publisher and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

78
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want to write a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do a proposal and I do very,</v>

79
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>very detailed proposals for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation.</v>

80
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I did a proposal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 125 pages long and it's a chapter</v>

81
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:09.064
<v Speaker 1>by chapter breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a condensed version of </v>

82
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:16.411
<v Speaker 1>the book and you get more money from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>publisher that way as an advance because</v>

83
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>you're showing them the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>practically.</v>

84
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>They can see the finished product </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>

85
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the movie interests.</v>

86
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>There was movie interest in this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corporation based on that,</v>

87
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 1>on that proposal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

88
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was option to,</v>

89
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 1>based on that proposal before I even </v>
<v Speaker 1>started writing the book.</v>

90
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>So what is the corporation about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>

92
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.553
<v Speaker 1>the story of the Cuban American </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized crime organization that began </v>

93
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>in the mid 19 sixties and existed all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to the end of the century and it</v>

94
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>was led by this mobster named Jose </v>
<v Speaker 1>Miguel battle,</v>

95
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.313
<v Speaker 1>who was kind of a legendary figure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuban American circles because he was a </v>

96
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>hero from the Bay of Pigs invasion.</v>

97
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.800
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>the attempt to reclaim Cuba take back </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

99
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.073
<v Speaker 1>the invasion in 1961,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a disaster for everyone </v>

100
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle wound up in prison along with the</v>

101
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>rest of the brigade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he got out and came back to the</v>

102
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:19.861
<v Speaker 1>US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was determined to get Castro and take</v>

103
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:20.824
<v Speaker 1>back Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he set up this criminal thing and it </v>

104
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:28.861
<v Speaker 1>was based on a one racket primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolita the number,</v>

105
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.793

<v Speaker 1>the illegal lottery for the lottery was </v>

106
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.783
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was illegal and it was controlled by </v>

107
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>organized crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a huge moneymaker,</v>

108
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>big money maker for the mob going back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the 19 twenties.</v>

109
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the number of little old ladies,</v>

110
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.610
<v Speaker 1>but the number of priests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops,</v>

<v Speaker 1>hugely profitable for whoever controls </v>
<v Speaker 1>and organizes it.</v>

114
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.054
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cubans controlled and organized it </v>

115

<v Speaker 1>and he became legendary.</v>

118
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:06.734
<v Speaker 1>Based on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they controlled the whole number system </v>

119
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:11.190
<v Speaker 1>because I know there's a lot of Italians</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were involved.</v>

120
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.760
<v Speaker 1>They went to the Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the first things battle.</v>

121
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>That battle had been a cop of ice cop in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Havana in the 19 fifties.</v>

122
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 1>During the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the turnover.</v>

123
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the era when the mob joey was </v>

124
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>talking about Havana Nocturne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that book was about.</v>

125
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>The era of the mob in Havana in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties.</v>

126
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.803
<v Speaker 1>Meyer Lansky Santa traffic content and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they controlled that until Castro </v>

127
00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:34.854
<v Speaker 1>came along and spoiled the party and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution happened and they got chased </v>

128
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.343
<v Speaker 1>out of their battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had been a vice cop in Havana during </v>

129
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:44.170
<v Speaker 1>those years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he knew all those,</v>

130
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high ranking mobsters in effect.</v>

131
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.443
<v Speaker 1>He was a bag man who delivered money </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Skimm at the casinos in Havana </v>

132
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>to the presidential palace.</v>

133
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>So battle knew how the world went round </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he made those connections.</v>

134
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And when he finally gets to the US and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to start his own thing,</v>

135
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 1>first thing he does is go to Santa </v>
<v Speaker 1>Traffic.</v>

136
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.174
<v Speaker 1>Content says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you make the proper introductions </v>

137
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:08.234
<v Speaker 1>for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Profit content introduces him to fat </v>

138
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Tony Salerno in New York City who </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls the numbers racket for all five</v>

139
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 1>families and battle says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

140
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>things are changing in Cuba over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next couple of decades.</v>

141
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:21.974
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have tens of thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not hundreds of thousands of Cubans </v>

142
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>coming to live in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all bet the number.</v>

143
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.773
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you let me take over this thing and </v>

144
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>organize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will get a piece of,</v>

145
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>you will get your piece of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Mafia said yes.</v>

146
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And so the Cubans took over and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>control everything.</v>

147
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:43.274
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York City in the seventies and </v>

148
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:45.854
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were probably 200 to 300 belita </v>

149
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 1>spots where you could go bet the number.</v>

150
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the Cubans call it bullying a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little ball.</v>

151
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they controlled it and they took care</v>

152
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:02.561
<v Speaker 1>of the mafia and everybody was got fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and happy for awhile until it turned bad</v>

153
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 1>and they started killing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

154
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>when Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you heard about this book,</v>

155
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.843
<v Speaker 1>this is something that you were very </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimately involved in when you were a </v>

156
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:10.900
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

157
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come on your show and I'll tell you,</v>

158
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.330
<v Speaker 1>there's 100 stories I could tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thousand dollars I can't.</v>

159
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>And when he told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I read the thesis for this book,</v>

160
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I just knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking know,</v>

161
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in numbers when I went to </v>

162
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:32.411
<v Speaker 1>Catholic school on Saturdays when I came</v>
<v Speaker 1>home on Fridays and Saturdays at the age</v>

163
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 1>of Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sent to different locations in the</v>

164
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bronx,</v>

165
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn and I will make $50 going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the errands,</v>

166
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>running numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go tell this guy.</v>

167
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>The first number of the day is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

168
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.583
<v Speaker 1>So I grew up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a house where the bookie </v>

169
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>would call my mother by 3:00 and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the numbers for the day?</v>

170
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>And My mother would give him a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>laundry list,</v>

171
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

172
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.160
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting in this book he </v>
<v Speaker 2>also covers the mysticism of the number.</v>

173
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.733
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm at your house and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter walks in with a hockey shirt </v>

174
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 2>and her number is 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at you and go,</v>

175
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:11.214
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a number from zero to nine five </v>

176
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.970

<v Speaker 2>I put $5 on five or six.</v>

180
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 2>If I have a dream about an eagle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I go down to the belief that spot,</v>

181
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 2>there's books that they sell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>books or dreams.</v>

182
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.530

<v Speaker 2>Grandmother was Sicilian.</v>

00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 2>weren't seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

233
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Because they didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't bring it out,</v>

234
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.263
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black people and Spanish people bitch </v>

235
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:10.744
<v Speaker 2>slap them to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the same thing happened with Bolita </v>

236
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Fat Tony Salerno knew that he had a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing coming with the Cubans.</v>

237
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 2>The Cubans want to put a bedroom with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cubans.</v>

238
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.543
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.383
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand the Italians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to put a bedroom with </v>

240
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Italians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Ricans.</v>

241
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 2>They want to put a better than with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican.</v>

242
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was with the numbers.</v>

243
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 2>It was that there was a community thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about the numbers.</v>

244
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.973
<v Speaker 2>Like the lottery is some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>government funded thing and it seems </v>

245
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 2>like it's got a lot of red tape and </v>
<v Speaker 2>official and there's no wiggle room.</v>

246
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.203
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers seemed to be closer to like </v>

247
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.300
<v Speaker 2>the community,</v>

248
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.620
<v Speaker 1>especially with Latinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with lucky.</v>

249
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the,</v>

250
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.933
<v Speaker 1>in some ways the core of the community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of spots where everybody </v>

251
00:12:55.701 --> 00:12:57.020
<v Speaker 1>would hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to here,</v>

252
00:12:57.021 --> 00:13:02.021
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood lobola and the gossip </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the streets.</v>

253
00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:04.310
<v Speaker 1>He'd go there and here in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood gossip.</v>

254
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

255
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:06.683
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was never meant to be violent </v>

256
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 1>back in Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belita was not violent.</v>

257
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:15.680
<v Speaker 1>It was illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't violent and it turned very</v>

258
00:13:15.681 --> 00:13:20.681
<v Speaker 1>violent in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The corporation became so profitable.</v>

259
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.673
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about millions of dollars </v>

260
00:13:23.541 --> 00:13:24.374
<v Speaker 1>on a monthly basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars over the course of </v>

261
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:28.184
<v Speaker 1>the life of this organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars more than they </v>

262
00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:32.990
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The artist thing they had was what to do</v>

263
00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:34.310
<v Speaker 1>with the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:13:34.311 --> 00:13:34.851
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

265
00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:35.684
<v Speaker 1>they would literally strap money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to as money couriers to try to </v>

266
00:13:39.891 --> 00:13:40.724
<v Speaker 1>get it out of the country to get it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into offshore bank accounts and </v>

267
00:13:45.021 --> 00:13:45.790
<v Speaker 1>launder the money.</v>

268
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.240
<v Speaker 1>They had more money than they knew what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

269
00:13:47.241 --> 00:13:50.060
<v Speaker 1>A license to print money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which hugely profitable.</v>

270
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.313
<v Speaker 1>That's what made it violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you started having gangsters vying </v>

271
00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:57.560
<v Speaker 1>for territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>territorial disputes,</v>

272
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.180
<v Speaker 1>greed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greed took over.</v>

273
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.290
<v Speaker 1>And it got very ugly nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This between Cubans,</v>

274
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.320
<v Speaker 1>between Cubans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the Cubans and the Italians.</v>

275
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.573
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy battle was very charismatic </v>

276
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.780
<v Speaker 1>leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

277
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:13.543
<v Speaker 1>with some great leadership qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd been a hero in the Bay of Pigs </v>

278
00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:18.830
<v Speaker 1>invasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saved some guys lives.</v>

279
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first heard that story,</v>

280
00:14:21.591 --> 00:14:22.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

281
00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:23.474
<v Speaker 1>I got to verify that maybe this is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story I got told about himself to </v>

282
00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:27.974
<v Speaker 1>burnish his legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I found the guys that he saved and I </v>

283
00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:33.914
<v Speaker 1>found the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two brothers who went with him to save </v>

284
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.423
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that he saved and I went to </v>

285
00:14:39.231 --> 00:14:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Bay of pigs to the exact location</v>

286
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.400
<v Speaker 1>where he saved these guys to verify this</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

287
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.020
<v Speaker 1>And it was absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and in an act of incredible heroism,</v>

288
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 1>he saved the life of a number of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>platoon members.</v>

289
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And so that was his reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From then on,</v>

290
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.393
<v Speaker 1>he was revered in the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a hero and people defended him </v>

291
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:02.834
<v Speaker 1>even even when it turned ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he became a ruthless boss who was </v>

292
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:07.454
<v Speaker 1>killing people left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had his defenders because of his </v>

293
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:15.611
<v Speaker 1>legend as a hero in the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the power that he had.</v>

294
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.490
<v Speaker 1>But he also had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.810
<v Speaker 1>joey and I were talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tubing tab.</v>

296
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 1>This Latinos have this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has it,</v>

297
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:30.041
<v Speaker 1>but Cubans have a desire for revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

298
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bay of Pigs invasion was an attempt </v>

299
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:36.110
<v Speaker 1>that revenge to get revenge against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Castro.</v>

300
00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:38.630
<v Speaker 1>And they were humiliated by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

301
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.823
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the guys from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation had an unfinished agenda for </v>

302
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 1>revenge.</v>

303
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So if you wrong this guy battle in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>way he was going to get you,</v>

304
00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:51.740
<v Speaker 1>even if it took years and years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculation.</v>

305
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:53.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are stories in the book about this</v>

306
00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:56.520
<v Speaker 1>one guy who killed his brother named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pilou.</v>

307
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.853
<v Speaker 1>He took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took nine years and 12 attempts </v>

308
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.180
<v Speaker 1>before they finally killed this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>polluted.</v>

309
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Speaker 1>They shot him in his hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in the hospital,</v>

310
00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:06.344
<v Speaker 1>they shot him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had an assassin dressed up as a male </v>

311
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:08.954
<v Speaker 1>nurse and go into the hospital and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>him between the eyes because there had </v>

312
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 1>been so many failed attempts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't going to fail this time.</v>

313
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's embattled for 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took night and kissed his ass.</v>

314
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:20.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never caught him.</v>

315
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bank disappeared.</v>

316
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 1>And I believe the assassin got killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>later because he was talking about it,</v>

317
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 1>having done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so battle had him killed.</v>

318
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

319
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.473
<v Speaker 1>So that the revenge motive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revenge motive Kinda drove battle </v>

320
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.390
<v Speaker 1>off the deep end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

321
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line he broke bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

322
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he was ever good and had</v>

323
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:46.304
<v Speaker 1>to break bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he started doing internal killings </v>

324
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 1>that really had nothing to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

325
00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 1>They're all about revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

326
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 1>this is a theme that happens a lot with </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized crime people.</v>

327
00:16:56.211 --> 00:16:57.044
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they just get a taste of </v>

328
00:16:57.711 --> 00:16:58.040
<v Speaker 1>killing</v>

329
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.850
<v Speaker 2>people and it becomes easier and easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that was the thing about murder</v>

330
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:02.684
<v Speaker 2>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

331
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:04.660
<v Speaker 2>About Roy Demeo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

332
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.910
<v Speaker 2>It just was killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to it.</v>

333
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.660
<v Speaker 2>After awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another book you gave me.</v>

334
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.653
<v Speaker 2>I was reading all those books on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road because I was auditioning for so </v>

335
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 2>many Italian roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really knew the history of it,</v>

336
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.143
<v Speaker 2>so I was just trying to read all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>books just so when I went in I had an </v>

337
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 2>idea of what these characters and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>

338
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I saw them growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw these guys,</v>

339
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>

340
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.284
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The interesting thing about this book </v>

341
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:36.830
<v Speaker 2>was talking to the Bay of Pacers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they knew that they were coming,</v>

342
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:39.970
<v Speaker 2>like for dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no common.</v>

343
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.380
<v Speaker 2>He put Bob wire or something and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarterly,</v>

344
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.390
<v Speaker 2>the soldiers all slashed their feet as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were landing.</v>

345
00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 2>There was four battalions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

346
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

347
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 1>think the 250,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened when they landed,</v>

348
00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.860
<v Speaker 1>there were Klieg lights set up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>

349
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:56.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew that.</v>

350
00:17:56.411 --> 00:17:59.430
<v Speaker 1>They landed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they flipped the lights on and it lit it</v>

351
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:01.680
<v Speaker 1>up like a movie set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

352
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 1>When these guys landed Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got slaughtered,</v>

353
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.083
<v Speaker 1>they got slaughtered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they felt they'd been betrayed by </v>

354
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 1>that they were supposed to be air cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the air cover never came.</v>

356
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 1>And why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Kennedy,</v>

357
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.303
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy always had this operation was </v>
<v Speaker 1>started by the Eisenhower </v>

358
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the CIA was a CIA operation.</v>

359
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy inherited it and he never </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

360
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.280
<v Speaker 1>He always had mixed feelings about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

361
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:31.830
<v Speaker 1>it was illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

362
00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:33.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an illegal secret,</v>

363
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 1>covert operation and attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overthrow a government.</v>

364
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.650
<v Speaker 1>It would have been seen as an illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>

365
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.503
<v Speaker 1>the eyes of the world to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Kennedy was trying to do it so it </v>

366
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:47.004
<v Speaker 1>could be done in such a way that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could never blow back on his </v>

367
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he,</v>

368
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:54.270
<v Speaker 1>he withheld air cover at a crucial point</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>

369
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.620
<v Speaker 1>in that war lasted three days and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got slaughtered and they got in,</v>

370
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.180
<v Speaker 1>they got imprisoned and they had a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of resentment towards Kennedy.</v>

371
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.223
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go into the book though a little bit </v>

372
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>about the Kennedy assassination and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief that a lot of that,</v>

373
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:11.244
<v Speaker 1>a handful of those Cubans may have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in the Kennedy assassination </v>

374
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:14.844
<v Speaker 1>along with the Italians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the mob because they were working </v>

375
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:21.030
<v Speaker 1>hand in hand with the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

376
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:21.864
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the leading conspiracies</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the CIA killing him and even </v>

377
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:29.090
<v Speaker 1>the CIA killing him was a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bay,</v>

378
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.203
<v Speaker 1>the Bay of pigs conspiracy and also the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that he wanted to disband the </v>

379
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:34.284
<v Speaker 1>CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a really interesting article </v>

380
00:19:35.251 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was dismissing almost every single</v>

381
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.890
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory about the Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassination.</v>

382
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.380
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the CIA one,</v>

383
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:47.190
<v Speaker 1>there's legitimate possibilities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the CIO.</v>

384
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can bet your ass that if the CIA was</v>

385
00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:53.160
<v Speaker 1>involved in Cubans orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let me ask something in the book.</v>

386
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.130
<v Speaker 1>You speak about Fidel's Mr.</v>

387
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got one with her at this particular </v>

388
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.750
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merita.</v>

389
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.410
<v Speaker 1>She had gone to New Orleans or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas.</v>

390
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 1>My Retail Lorena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very interesting,</v>

391
00:20:06.661 --> 00:20:08.550
<v Speaker 1>notorious figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a child with him,</v>

392
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.413
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had an abortion and didn't have the </v>

393
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:13.230
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got pregnant with Fidel.</v>

394
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.180
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Castro admitted as much.</v>

395
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.220
<v Speaker 1>She got pregnant with Castro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a,</v>

396
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:22.490
<v Speaker 1>she had an abortion and then the CIA </v>
<v Speaker 1>used her to try to assassinate Castro.</v>

397
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.860
<v Speaker 1>She had was supposed to slip him a pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she put it in her face cream and the</v>

398
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:33.144
<v Speaker 1>pill dissolves in her face cream and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the pill she was going to try </v>

399
00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:36.714
<v Speaker 1>to slip to Castro her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her case agent was a guy named frank </v>

400
00:20:41.101 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 1>sturgeous who wound up being one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Watergate burglars.</v>

401
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 1>See the thing about Bay of pigs and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cubans,</v>

402
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.343
<v Speaker 1>the Bay of Pigs invasion is the key to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the whole ladder part of </v>

403
00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century politics in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

404
00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.550
<v Speaker 1>The Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the alliance between the CIA and</v>

405
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:01.384
<v Speaker 1>the Cubans rears its head constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the latter part of the 20th </v>

406
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:07.930
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Watergate burglary,</v>

407
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.480
<v Speaker 1>five out of seven of the burglars were </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cubans.</v>

408
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Bay of Pigs Veterans Day had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruited by a guy named Ed Howard Hunt.</v>

409
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 1>CIA agent who was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orchestrators of the Bay of pigs.</v>

410
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:19.654
<v Speaker 1>Invasion was also one of the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>on his deathbed said that he was </v>

411
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 1>involved in the assassination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy.</v>

412
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

413
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 1>So the CIA would come to these Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 1>exiles,</v>

414
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 1>the militant exiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'd say,</v>

415
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 1>go do this operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go do this burglary at the,</v>

416
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 1>at the Watergate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we go get fidel,</v>

417
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.650
<v Speaker 1>go do this assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we go get fidel.</v>

418
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:39.543
<v Speaker 1>And the Cubans were always ready and </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing because it was all leading back </v>

419
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:44.630
<v Speaker 1>to getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all leading back to.</v>

420
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the images of what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>said was Ed Howard Hunt?</v>

421
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the people that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested.</v>

422
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 1>There was a series of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

423
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:52.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a bunch of guys that were </v>

424
00:21:53.321 --> 00:21:54.154
<v Speaker 1>arrested that were on trains that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling them hobos were all very well </v>

425
00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:58.774
<v Speaker 1>dressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

426
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 1>that were near where the grassy knoll </v>
<v Speaker 1>men on the grass.</v>

427
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of rumors about that,</v>

428
00:22:04.681 --> 00:22:05.514
<v Speaker 1>that Howard hunt was one of those men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was even a reference that Jose </v>

429
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.833
<v Speaker 1>Miguel battle was one of those men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that couldn't have been the case </v>

430
00:22:12.641 --> 00:22:16.480
<v Speaker 1>because he was in the army at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the US army.</v>

431
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

432
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.570
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a,</v>

433
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:24.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like a subterranean narrative that </v>
<v Speaker 1>runs through the latter part of the 20th</v>

434
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:25.444
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CIA and right wing elements in </v>

435
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.003
<v Speaker 1>American politics using the Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans to do all kinds of dirty </v>

436
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.104
<v Speaker 1>covert deeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're talking about terrorist </v>

437
00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:37.894
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assassination of an ambassador from </v>

438
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:41.284
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in Washington DC blew up his car </v>

439
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 1>because he was sympathetic to Castro.</v>

440
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.043
<v Speaker 1>A bomb planted on a Cuban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a jetliner flying from Panama City to </v>

441
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:51.904
<v Speaker 1>advantage 73 people killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Innocent people occluding the fencing </v>

442
00:22:55.721 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 1>team from Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young people,</v>

443
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:03.050
<v Speaker 1>a dirty war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dirty war was waged by the anti-castro</v>

444
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.760
<v Speaker 1>underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

445
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.310
<v Speaker 1>in combination in partnership with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>CIA and this,</v>

446
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 1>we know about it now because a lot of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been declassified and it's come out,</v>

447
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.150
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know about it at the time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was taking place,</v>

448
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:21.100
<v Speaker 1>why they blow up the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an act of terrorism against Cuba to</v>

449
00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:21.934
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show them that it could be done to </v>

450
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:27.220
<v Speaker 1>instill fear and paranoia in the queue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

451
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.183
<v Speaker 1>the concept was to destabilize the Cuban</v>
<v Speaker 1>government so they'd be vulnerable and </v>

452
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:34.210
<v Speaker 1>then you could take them over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So any,</v>

453
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.420
<v Speaker 1>any act against Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean asking why blow the plane would,</v>

454
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.860
<v Speaker 1>is asking like why fly planes into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>World Trade Center?</v>

455
00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a destructive act.</v>

456
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing how resilient Castro</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

457
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>

458
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 1>The guy's 90 miles away from Miami and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just ran shit through the sixties,</v>

459
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 1>the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties,</v>

460
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:55.964
<v Speaker 1>the nineties into the 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say there was something like 632 </v>

461
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.730
<v Speaker 1>known plots to over over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five decades to kill category.</v>

462

<v Speaker 1>this gangster story of the corporation </v>

472
00:24:31.611 --> 00:24:35.690
<v Speaker 1>so interesting and different is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>political context,</v>

473
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.763
<v Speaker 1>the framework that all this shit was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place against the backdrop of </v>

474
00:24:40.911 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 1>this desire to kill Castro and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

475
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.863
<v Speaker 1>take back the homeland and anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was involved in that was seen as a hero </v>

476
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 1>within the community.</v>

477
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Joey can tell you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union city,</v>

478
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:56.720
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey and Miami where the hotbeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the anti-castro movement.</v>

479
00:24:56.721 --> 00:24:57.554
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>

<v Speaker 1>city called Omega seven and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>one in Miami called Alpha 66.</v>

481
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.363
<v Speaker 1>These were terror organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secret organizations that existed to </v>

482
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.003
<v Speaker 1>plant bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would plant bombs at embassies in </v>

<v Speaker 1>the united,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

484

485
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.860
<v Speaker 1>they would put bombs at Lincoln Center </v>
<v Speaker 1>when a,</v>

486
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:19.723
<v Speaker 1>when a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when an orchestra from Cuba was making </v>

487
00:25:21.861 --> 00:25:22.694
<v Speaker 1>an appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to shut down any </v>

488
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.323
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the US and Cuba and</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments that were sympathetic to </v>

489
00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

490
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.660
<v Speaker 1>they would do actions against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this went on for like 40 years.</v>

491
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unbelievable.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You mentioned for dome the Seventies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union city,</v>

493
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.440
<v Speaker 1>like a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a joke.</v>

494
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't even don't even bring them up dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you will get some mad now.</v>

495
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Was there any pro for Dell support </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst Cubans?</v>

496
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.380
<v Speaker 1>There was and bad things would happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

497
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States and Cuba though.</v>

498
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.550
<v Speaker 1>What about in Cuba Pro Castro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>

499
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

500
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it real or was it out of?</v>

501
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Fear is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

502
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there numerous times,</v>

503
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the killing people made a choice,</v>

504
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:11.263
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the revolution I believe would have </v>

505
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:19.061
<v Speaker 1>happened with or without Fidel Castro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who was in power bi.</v>

506
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Tiesta had taken over the government and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coup d'etat,</v>

507
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was kind of a fraudulent president</v>

508
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.613
<v Speaker 1>and there was an ever since he got in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people knew it was a fraudulent </v>

509
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 1>president and there was attempts to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ouster him and that's why he was such</v>

510
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:37.790
<v Speaker 1>a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew they wanted the house to him,</v>

511
00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:38.624
<v Speaker 1>so he used the military to repress any </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of movement against him and it was </v>

512
00:26:43.711 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 1>ugly and the people rose up against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

513
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:47.544
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't so in my belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolution in Cuba happened for a </v>

514
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>very legitimate reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After it happened in power,</v>

515
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.430
<v Speaker 1>it was revealed that Castro and Che </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guevara were communists.</v>

516
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.720
<v Speaker 1>He casta was very cagey about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the revolution,</v>

517
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.740
<v Speaker 1>they never talked about Marxism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being communists or any of that,</v>

518
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.200
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fidel came to union city,</v>

519
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.423
<v Speaker 1>came to the United States to raise money</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the revolution while it was going </v>

520
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:15.630
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got arrested.</v>

521
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.760
<v Speaker 1>My friend's mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the escalades,</v>

522
00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>

523
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:22.254
<v Speaker 1>she still remembers taking the bus in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning in union city and Fidel's </v>

524
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.770
<v Speaker 1>welcome to underwhelm talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you doing?</v>

525
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Susan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

526
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got in a bar room room.</v>

527
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 1>He got in a bar room argument in a union</v>
<v Speaker 1>city and he got arrested over what,</v>

528
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 1>a probably politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was a political discussion.</v>

529
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

530
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 1>so then the revolution happened and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

531
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Cuba becomes a repressive communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalinist dictatorship.</v>

532
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.730
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of Cubans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they saw it as,</v>

533
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Speaker 1>that was the choice they made to go with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fidel.</v>

534
00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:02.250
<v Speaker 1>He did have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

535
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.143
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

536
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.030
<v Speaker 1>popularity of the people following of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people.</v>

537
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Some people are quite proud of Castro </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up to the United States.</v>

538
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.913
<v Speaker 1>Cubans are very proud people and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a lot of pride in the fact that </v>

539
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.810
<v Speaker 1>even though there's so much hardship </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that um,</v>

540
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a choice they made to go in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

541
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.460
<v Speaker 1>At least they have their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their self pride,</v>

542
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more in the,</v>

543
00:28:29.231 --> 00:28:33.990
<v Speaker 1>can be said in some ways about Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rico and Jamaica and Dominican Republic,</v>

544
00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:38.991
<v Speaker 1>all these other countries in that region</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are just as poor as Cuba.</v>

545
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he has his supporters.</v>

546
00:28:42.691 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 1>He always had his support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

547
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 1>He also had his detractors even within </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>

548
00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:49.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of those people are the ones who </v>

549
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:55.581
<v Speaker 1>got on rafts and tried to leave the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island at great risk to themselves to do</v>

550
00:28:56.071 --> 00:28:56.904
<v Speaker 1>anything to get out of there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize fidel was so popular from </v>

551
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:01.824
<v Speaker 1>within the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are never gonna be able to take him </v>

552
00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:04.824
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they made the decision to go out in </v>

553
00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:07.554
<v Speaker 1>the ocean and try to brave the risks of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of either swimming or sailing or across </v>

554
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Speaker 1>the Florida Straits,</v>

555
00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:16.773
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck happened with Che Guevara.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did Che Guevara all of a sudden </v>

556
00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:21.963
<v Speaker 4>emerge as this leftist political icon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in this really weird sort of </v>

557
00:29:27.761 --> 00:29:28.594
<v Speaker 4>clueless way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they really didn't understand his </v>

558
00:29:30.281 --> 00:29:31.114
<v Speaker 4>background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really didn't understand who he was and </v>

559
00:29:32.231 --> 00:29:34.870
<v Speaker 4>what he had done and the atrocities that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had committed.</v>

560
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:39.730
<v Speaker 4>But these fucking tee shirts that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these dopey liberal kids,</v>

561
00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 4>those fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking crazy.</v>

562
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 4>If you find out who that guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

563
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:48.391
<v Speaker 4>you're wearing a mass murderers t shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he was a fucking ruthless cut.</v>

564
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:54.030
<v Speaker 4>And these people are wearing this shirt </v>
<v Speaker 4>is if he symbols symbolizes like liberty</v>

565
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:58.160
<v Speaker 4>or freedom from an oppressive government</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

566
00:29:58.161 --> 00:29:58.994
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was a long period of time where </v>

567
00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:01.894
<v Speaker 4>you didn't have any Che Guevara.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no discussion of it and that </v>

568
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 4>it seems like somewhere in the two </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands it picked up.</v>

569
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:09.154
<v Speaker 4>Am I right?</v>

570
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight.</v>

571
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so personal for awhile.</v>

572
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:15.343
<v Speaker 2>Like I have Argentinian friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the seventies there was a rift </v>

573
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 2>between Argentenians in Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how personal it is.</v>

574
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Argentinians is Argentina and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a rift like because of him,</v>

575
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.793
<v Speaker 2>because of him like Cuban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the FEC data here really welcomed </v>

576
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:35.490
<v Speaker 2>that extra the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was raised to go out and look for </v>

667
00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:25.964
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

<v Speaker 2>own or were you actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

<v Speaker 2>my mother put up a big gold chain on me.</v>

675

677
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.060

<v Speaker 2>and my mother yelled from the window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let them touch your fucking chain.</v>

681
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Yesterday I went to Glendale and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter was throwing hoops hoop and she</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's an effective way of parenting.</v>

689
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.733

702
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.223
<v Speaker 2>because I knew what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a young age if I hung out with </v>

<v Speaker 1>they come in.</v>

712
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.890

<v Speaker 4>One of the things that she said that one</v>

718
00:37:44.651 --> 00:37:46.210
<v Speaker 4>of the reasons why she came a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

719
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:47.343
<v Speaker 4>Somebody came up to her in a parking lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>when she was holding her infant </v>

720
00:37:49.571 --> 00:37:51.250
<v Speaker 4>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if this is true.</v>

721
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.860
<v Speaker 4>This is what she says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone came up to her and said,</v>

722
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:54.783
<v Speaker 4>you have a beautiful daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a shame if anything happened to </v>

<v Speaker 4>her mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now stop talking about president trump </v>

728
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.350
<v Speaker 4>really geared up or animosity towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Imagine that Shit.</v>

730
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.680

<v Speaker 1>in the narco world,</v>

731
00:38:14.681 --> 00:38:19.060
<v Speaker 1>there's cases of what they would do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they will do a video tape.</v>

732
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.980
<v Speaker 1>There was somebody they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidate.</v>

733
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.180
<v Speaker 1>They'd videotape their kid being taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>to school every morning,</v>

734
00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.780
<v Speaker 1>being dropped off for school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picked up after school.</v>

735
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.793
<v Speaker 1>They videotape the daily routine of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child and then they'd send the video </v>

736
00:38:33.091 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>tape to that person and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to</v>

737
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.890
<v Speaker 2>know where your kid is every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every minute of the day.</v>

738
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Do what we tell you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't fuck with me though.</v>

739
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.080
<v Speaker 2>I was never fucked with.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was never fucked with.</v>

741
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I was just raised to understand what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing it.</v>

742
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:57.430
<v Speaker 2>There's consequences and I was allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to repeat it.</v>

743
00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 2>So when I would come to you and you will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be talking about whatever.</v>

744
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Even if I knew you were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never correct you.</v>

745
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.150
<v Speaker 2>So that's how I was raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never correct you.</v>

746
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 2>He would if I knew you were talking shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>because how do you know?</v>

747
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.473
<v Speaker 2>How do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just at the fucking bar and they </v>

748
00:39:12.041 --> 00:39:12.874
<v Speaker 2>were talking about I tried to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know my mom didn't hide nothing from </v>

749
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:16.624
<v Speaker 2>me growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good and bad that it had good </v>

750
00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:22.180
<v Speaker 2>things for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of bad things to me,</v>

751
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:23.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that he touched upon </v>

752
00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 2>this book was not only about Jose </v>
<v Speaker 2>battle,</v>

753
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:33.050
<v Speaker 2>but the political corruption that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it in 20 years.</v>

754
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Have I ever talked to you about bottling</v>
<v Speaker 2>things to ever.</v>

755
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't listen to politics if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid me because it's all bullshit.</v>

756
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I saw it and I and a micro level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when you,</v>

757
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.200
<v Speaker 2>when you a president who do you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>donations from?</v>

758
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Big Farm guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

759
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.860
<v Speaker 2>When you're a small mayor who they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>donations from the pharmacy,</v>

760
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 2>the pizza place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers.</v>

761
00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:58.803
<v Speaker 2>So I came from a society where those </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers are controlling everything and </v>

762
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Speaker 2>in North Bergen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>union city and West New York,</v>

763
00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 2>and we remember that Shit's a felony in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey misdemeanor in New York.</v>

764
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Numbers.</v>

765
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 2>It used to be misdemeanor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>

766
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.440
<v Speaker 2>they would call you never go Joe </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lieutenant.</v>

767
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.210
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't say that because the phones </v>
<v Speaker 2>would take.</v>

768
00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.800
<v Speaker 2>He would just call you and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a visit today.</v>

769
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.200
<v Speaker 2>That means if you've got $5,000 in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket and give it to Jamie,</v>

770
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:33.040
<v Speaker 2>cleaned out the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave some paperwork at 2:00,</v>

771
00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 2>I come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I handcuff you,</v>

772
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.853
<v Speaker 2>I take your money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write your summons and bring it down </v>

773
00:40:38.891 --> 00:40:39.580
<v Speaker 2>to the station.</v>

774
00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.680
<v Speaker 2>We get go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after I let you,</v>

775
00:40:41.681 --> 00:40:44.370
<v Speaker 2>how did I meet you around the corner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had $2,500.</v>

776
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you 1250 [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a cost of doing business.</v>

777
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.553
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a funny line in Goodfellas when </v>

778
00:40:50.651 --> 00:40:51.484
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I go to school with all that </v>

779
00:40:53.111 --> 00:40:55.240
<v Speaker 2>goody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goody bullshit and salute the flag.</v>

780
00:40:55.241 --> 00:40:56.820
<v Speaker 2>When I left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the same one.</v>

781
00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Like I saw what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the political system.</v>

782
00:41:01.571 --> 00:41:02.404
<v Speaker 2>I saw two cops coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one detective once a week and one big </v>

783
00:41:06.801 --> 00:41:07.634
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom would give him a drink and an </v>

784
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:09.780
<v Speaker 2>envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:41:09.781 --> 00:41:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what my grandmother did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what she was involved,</v>

786
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.670
<v Speaker 2>but I told her she went to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jail for running the numbers.</v>

787
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:18.160
<v Speaker 2>She went to jail because she wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>give anybody up.</v>

788
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.000
<v Speaker 2>They wanted her to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever the fuck was at the other end of</v>

789
00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:22.834
<v Speaker 2>the organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so for like six months we were </v>

790
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:26.374
<v Speaker 2>always trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the fuck is grandma still all </v>

791
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.020
<v Speaker 2>she's visiting her sister who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

792
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.420
<v Speaker 2>She's visiting Aunt Josie and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing for bookmaking</v>

793
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.560
<v Speaker 1>and Jersey six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five months,</v>

794
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.483
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they put you on house arrest and </v>

795
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:41.110
<v Speaker 1>you had done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would knit sweaters and shit for the</v>

796
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 1>fucking guards in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

797
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:47.000
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times battle would own the </v>
<v Speaker 1>judges.</v>

798
00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:49.140
<v Speaker 1>So you wouldn't do any time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might get it,</v>

799
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.993
<v Speaker 1>you might get a summons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go before a magistrate judge and </v>

800
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 1>they let you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating to me is about,</v>

801
00:41:56.331 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 1>this is all so fascinating about the job</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself was that a lot of it is basically</v>

802
00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:05.090
<v Speaker 1>dissolved that all this came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration and that this,</v>

803
00:42:05.091 --> 00:42:05.924
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this melting pot of the United States </v>

804
00:42:08.031 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 1>and they all came from all these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>places and all this organized crime sort</v>

805
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:16.010
<v Speaker 1>of like was running the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cities in the east coast.</v>

806
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 1>But most of it is kind of gone the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wayside.</v>

807
00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I would dispute that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think traditional organized crime,</v>

808
00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 1>as we knew it in the 20th centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone by the wayside,</v>

809
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish,</v>

810
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of assimilated into the system</v>

811
00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.410
<v Speaker 1>and has dissipated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's new generations,</v>

812
00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:40.430
<v Speaker 1>immigrants that are playing this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamaicans to make Americans,</v>

813
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians,</v>

814
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans.</v>

815
00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.640
<v Speaker 1>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I further make the argument that the</v>

816
00:42:46.641 --> 00:42:50.960
<v Speaker 1>corruption that was created during </v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibition in the 19 twenties,</v>

817
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:54.950
<v Speaker 1>that's where the system was created </v>
<v Speaker 1>during prohibition in the 19 twenties,</v>

818
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

819
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.700
<v Speaker 1>alliance between the underworld and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper world,</v>

820
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 1>the connection between the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparatus,</v>

821
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:04.520
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement and the criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>rackets.</v>

822
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 1>That template was laid down during </v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibition and it was an effect for the</v>

823
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 1>next 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that templates still exists.</v>

824
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Speaker 1>You pick up a newspaper in any US city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large or mid sized city.</v>

825
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.570
<v Speaker 1>And what are you going to see on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first couple of pages,</v>

826
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.553
<v Speaker 1>some local representative who just got </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicted for taking money from some </v>

827
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:26.263
<v Speaker 1>criminal element to see that they got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>law passed or that they got some </v>

828
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:32.410
<v Speaker 1>municipal contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

829
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.630
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't gone away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That still exists everywhere.</v>

830
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.010
<v Speaker 1>What happens is there's an ebb and flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain rackets come and go,</v>

831
00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:42.890
<v Speaker 1>it was illegal booze and it was labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>racketeering.</v>

832
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Now it's narcotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Belita at one time.</v>

833
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.530
<v Speaker 1>There's always something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

834
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:51.650
<v Speaker 1>as long as there's commerce being done </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a large scale,</v>

835
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.513
<v Speaker 1>there's always room for corruption as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as there's things that are illegal </v>

836
00:43:55.701 --> 00:43:58.770
<v Speaker 1>with this market for like marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

837
00:43:58.830 --> 00:43:59.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

838
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:00.374
<v Speaker 1>The big argument about marijuana laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States is if they made it </v>

839
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:06.140
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would severely limit the power to the</v>

840
00:44:06.141 --> 00:44:08.850
<v Speaker 1>cartel in Mexico has cut all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence out.</v>

841
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Basically the same shit that was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on with Al Capone and,</v>

842
00:44:11.751 --> 00:44:16.360
<v Speaker 1>and everything during the liquor there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time with liquids.</v>

843
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:17.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the criminal rackets feed the </v>

844
00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:19.904
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are flawed human beings at </v>

845
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:24.980
<v Speaker 1>every level of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dirty cops,</v>

846
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.050
<v Speaker 1>cops on the take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

847
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.660
<v Speaker 1>is it more difficult now for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull something like this off?</v>

848
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 1>It's less systemic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

849
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

850
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

851
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.970
<v Speaker 1>you'd have corruption that was all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way through the chain of command,</v>

852
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone was sort of in on it.</v>

853
00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Now you see the seven five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

854
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:43.554
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also saw your interview with Michael </v>

855
00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Dell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

856
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fascinating.</v>

857
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

858
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.863
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

859
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.793
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was 20 years after the nap nap </v>

860
00:44:54.811 --> 00:44:58.080
<v Speaker 1>commission which revealed that level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>

861
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

862
00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:00.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see there's,</v>

863
00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you have social systems and you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>have corruption.</v>

864
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.980
<v Speaker 1>You have a money making system like </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>

865
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.830
<v Speaker 1>you will have corruption that doesn't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

866
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Organized crime has the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized crime has changed quite a bit,</v>

867
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 1>but the core of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that corrupt relationship between the</v>

868
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 1>underworld and the upper world still </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>

869
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:26.900
<v Speaker 2>So is it the most disenfranchised sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of members of the community,</v>

870
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.810
<v Speaker 2>the most recent immigrants?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

871
00:45:29.811 --> 00:45:30.530
<v Speaker 2>what is it that.</v>

872
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written about this a lot,</v>

873
00:45:32.511 --> 00:45:33.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two different books and through </v>

874
00:45:33.981 --> 00:45:38.210
<v Speaker 1>journalism I've come to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the American story.</v>

875
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:40.483
<v Speaker 1>This process of going through organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and gangsterism before you become </v>

876
00:45:45.141 --> 00:45:48.390
<v Speaker 1>accepted as a full blown American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

877
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.393
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every ethnic group has gone </v>

878
00:45:50.391 --> 00:45:55.100
<v Speaker 1>through some version of it in the US and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still an is still going through it.</v>

879
00:45:55.101 --> 00:45:58.940
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the American process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get here as a group,</v>

880
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.983
<v Speaker 1>your your cutout of access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a immediate access anyway to to power </v>

881
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:07.603
<v Speaker 1>and so you create your own path and </v>
<v Speaker 1>initially in these organizations it's </v>

882
00:46:12.471 --> 00:46:14.750
<v Speaker 1>usually those ethnic groups praying on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own,</v>

883
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.273
<v Speaker 1>preying on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's usually the first stage of this </v>

884
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.843
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes a creating a system </v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to deal with larger system of </v>

885
00:46:25.251 --> 00:46:27.110
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Jose Miguel battle.</v>

886
00:46:27.111 --> 00:46:31.970
<v Speaker 1>What he did was so brilliant by creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corporation is he created a path for</v>

887
00:46:31.971 --> 00:46:32.804
<v Speaker 1>himself within American organized crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>which was controlled primarily by the </v>

888
00:46:37.041 --> 00:46:37.874
<v Speaker 1>mafia and he created an alliance with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mafia that made it possible for the </v>

889
00:46:42.051 --> 00:46:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Cubans to have their thing and and fly </v>
<v Speaker 1>below the radar.</v>

890
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean while he Italians were getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>busted left and right.</v>

891
00:46:49.281 --> 00:46:50.840
<v Speaker 1>The Cubans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cubans.</v>

892
00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:51.674
<v Speaker 1>This corporation existed for 40 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't really get messed </v>

893
00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:54.890
<v Speaker 1>with with</v>

894
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:57.060
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that like what was it the.</v>

895
00:46:57.061 --> 00:46:59.960
<v Speaker 2>The way the Italians there were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>flashy,</v>

896
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:02.810
<v Speaker 2>like particularly when you got the God </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the most ridiculous,</v>

897
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.650
<v Speaker 2>were pretty damn flashy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them.</v>

898
00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Some of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them I,</v>

899
00:47:09.501 --> 00:47:14.501
<v Speaker 2>I till this day I detest nice cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the test show calling attention to</v>

900
00:47:16.971 --> 00:47:20.000
<v Speaker 2>yourself because I saw too tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right now,</v>

901
00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:20.893
<v Speaker 2>like I would love to talk to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>producers of this film because they're </v>

902
00:47:24.291 --> 00:47:26.860
<v Speaker 2>going to miss a lot of authentic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that we'll have.</v>

903
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.240
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a present for you.</v>

904

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:31.710
<v Speaker 2>he had his message is delivered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then in 1970,</v>

924
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:32.563
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at both of you gentlemen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you that one would not even </v>

925
00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:36.424
<v Speaker 2>have a conversation if there was a phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the room and it was hung up because </v>

926
00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:43.290
<v Speaker 2>in his mind that phone was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapped,</v>

927
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a genius.</v>

928
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.810
<v Speaker 2>If he had a meet Joe Rogan for a meeting</v>
<v Speaker 2>at nine at 5:30 in the morning,</v>

929
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:51.123
<v Speaker 2>he'd come and put a gun under a car just</v>
<v Speaker 2>in case there was a problem with Joe </v>

930
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Rogan.</v>

931
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 2>He will hug you and you searched him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would hug you and tap your back for a</v>

932
00:48:58.811 --> 00:49:03.650
<v Speaker 2>wire and tell you you will lose some </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight and rub your belly at all.</v>

933
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Then they hug you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that feeling you for a pink one.</v>

934
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:09.123
<v Speaker 2>When my mother died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he still had the same car that he had </v>

935
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:16.501
<v Speaker 2>when he died with $5 million cash and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived in a four story walk up.</v>

936
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.390
<v Speaker 2>When he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his friends said,</v>

937
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:24.780
<v Speaker 2>what a miserable life to make money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to hide it like that one would walk</v>

938
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:29.740
<v Speaker 2>around with jeans and t shirts the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit every day.</v>

939
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.060
<v Speaker 2>And a wad of hundreds like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hidden one.</v>

940
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:37.060
<v Speaker 2>The other one was single.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you thought he was broke.</v>

941
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:39.730
<v Speaker 2>If he talked to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked to you in English.</v>

942
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Once the cops came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He was under the next day.</v>

975
00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:20.510
<v Speaker 5>The Lucas don't play game Deluca.</v>

976
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:21.993
<v Speaker 5>Don't play games now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now and answer Joe and answer to your </v>

977
00:51:24.501 --> 00:51:25.334
<v Speaker 5>question about the Cubans and why they </v>
<v Speaker 5>existed for so long and didn't get </v>

978
00:51:28.221 --> 00:51:29.600
<v Speaker 5>busted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

979
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:34.610
<v Speaker 5>the rumor was that they had a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>mystique because of this CIA,</v>

980
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:40.190
<v Speaker 5>a pedigree and that they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>untouchable and in factor.</v>

981
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 5>I mentioned it in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a case where the FBI is thinking</v>

982
00:51:43.881 --> 00:51:47.480
<v Speaker 5>about making a case against battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is way back in the sixties.</v>

983
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:48.793
<v Speaker 5>They contact the US Treasury Department </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they figure he's not paying </v>

984
00:51:51.321 --> 00:51:55.820
<v Speaker 5>taxes and they can make some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>case against him and a tax violation.</v>

985
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:59.810
<v Speaker 5>They got a letter from the Treasury </v>
<v Speaker 5>Department saying,</v>

986
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:01.063
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to go after this guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he's anti-castro and he's a </v>

987
00:52:04.161 --> 00:52:07.520
<v Speaker 5>veteran of the Bay of pigs invasion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's right there in a,</v>

988
00:52:07.521 --> 00:52:09.980
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a letter from the Treasury Department</v>

989
00:52:09.981 --> 00:52:11.330
<v Speaker 5>to the FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

990
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.253
<v Speaker 5>So there were elements within the </v>
<v Speaker 5>government that we're protecting these </v>

991
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:17.270
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly bay of Pigs veterans.</v>

992
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:19.610
<v Speaker 5>We will not prosecute them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>

993
00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:22.830
<v Speaker 5>And so he had that kind of protection </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a name too,</v>

994
00:52:22.831 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jose battle bottling.</v>

995
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His name is Spanish.</v>

996
00:52:26.661 --> 00:52:29.150
<v Speaker 5>Was bothy a bat l,</v>
<v Speaker 5>l e,</v>

997
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.010
<v Speaker 5>and he changed it to balance a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

998
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:31.873
<v Speaker 5>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're a writer and a novelist and </v>

999
00:52:33.501 --> 00:52:34.334
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to think of a good name </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the character that she can't do any </v>

1000
00:52:36.591 --> 00:52:37.424
<v Speaker 5>better than.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I grew up with a kid named major battle </v>

1001
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.200
<v Speaker 5>God to taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His name was major battle.</v>

1002
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:43.543
<v Speaker 5>That motherfucker too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Motherfucker named major battle was his </v>

1003
00:52:47.321 --> 00:52:48.640
<v Speaker 5>middle name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bad mother fucker.</v>

1004
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:50.580
<v Speaker 5>Major bad mother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was.</v>

1005
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:55.700
<v Speaker 5>It was a black belt state champion and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the only reason why they existed,</v>

1006
00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.980
<v Speaker 5>they were very careful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a systemized union city,</v>

1007
00:53:00.981 --> 00:53:01.814
<v Speaker 5>Ran Union city becomes Jersey City and </v>
<v Speaker 5>hoboken you didn't see ran seventh </v>

1008
00:53:06.921 --> 00:53:07.754
<v Speaker 5>street to 88th street to white castle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the Cubans really controlled seven </v>

1009
00:53:12.691 --> 00:53:15.280
<v Speaker 5>to 48th street Bergen line.</v>

1010
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:17.510
<v Speaker 5>And then when you went to New York </v>
<v Speaker 5>Avenue,</v>

1011
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:19.663
<v Speaker 5>they control from $50 up to about 60th </v>
<v Speaker 5>street and they kept to themselves and </v>

1012
00:53:25.111 --> 00:53:29.370
<v Speaker 5>they didn't have social clubs and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't play cards outside.</v>

1013
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.340
<v Speaker 5>And if you want them to the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wore dress very,</v>

1014
00:53:32.341 --> 00:53:34.700
<v Speaker 5>moderately before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>From what?</v>

1015
00:53:34.701 --> 00:53:35.534
<v Speaker 5>Bookies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they only stayed there till 3:00 </v>

1016
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:38.873
<v Speaker 5>because that's when the number goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you have from nine in the morning to </v>

1017
00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:43.374
<v Speaker 5>three to play that number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's also a thing called a </v>

1018
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:49.500
<v Speaker 5>singular number,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which the odds are a little less.</v>

1019
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 5>That started about 12.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'll see you at 12 and go for it.</v>

1020
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:57.330
<v Speaker 5>Normal it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make a mother fucker.</v>

1021
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.150
<v Speaker 5>I'll never listened to that fucking kid </v>
<v Speaker 5>of mine again.</v>

1022
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.790
<v Speaker 5>Now I got to go back to the booking and </v>
<v Speaker 5>bet the second number,</v>

1023
00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.910
<v Speaker 5>call that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one number at a time.</v>

1024
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.940
<v Speaker 5>So I have an optimization putting down </v>
<v Speaker 5>$100,000 on,</v>

1025
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.270
<v Speaker 5>on what the number five is.</v>

1026
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:13.223
<v Speaker 5>What is the number of year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the potential numbers talking single </v>

1027
00:54:15.181 --> 00:54:18.270
<v Speaker 5>digits on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can play three digit.</v>

1028
00:54:18.271 --> 00:54:19.081
<v Speaker 5>Read that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You Bet.</v>

1029
00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:21.330
<v Speaker 5>Three digit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So why would it be a single number?</v>

1030
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:23.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was just a different one.</v>

1031
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.980
<v Speaker 5>A different one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Different systems,</v>

1032
00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.690
<v Speaker 5>different systems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certain ways you can do it.</v>

1033
00:54:27.691 --> 00:54:29.850
<v Speaker 5>But let's explain this where the number </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes from.</v>

1034
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:30.773
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The total mutual handle at the race </v>

1035
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 5>track is published in the newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 5>every evening and again and again in the</v>

1036
00:54:38.161 --> 00:54:41.090
<v Speaker 5>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much money was bet total at the race</v>

1037
00:54:41.091 --> 00:54:43.800
<v Speaker 5>track that day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The last three numbers.</v>

1038
00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:48.540
<v Speaker 5>That's the daily number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So everyone you know has the same number</v>

1039
00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:49.374
<v Speaker 5>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what it is as soon as it comes </v>

1040
00:54:50.791 --> 00:54:53.850
<v Speaker 5>out in the newspaper and that's how it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>determined.</v>

1041
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:58.200
<v Speaker 5>So you have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have the individual numbers and then</v>

1042
00:54:58.201 --> 00:55:01.650
<v Speaker 5>you have the early number with which is </v>
<v Speaker 5>called welcome come out of Brooklyn,</v>

1043
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:06.240
<v Speaker 5>guest Saleo in Brooklyn and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>will have the late number.</v>

1044
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.073
<v Speaker 5>What's The New York number?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's number in the New York number </v>

1045
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:10.463
<v Speaker 5>side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what it would be based on that was </v>

1046
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:16.650
<v Speaker 5>decided probably a hundred years ago by </v>
<v Speaker 5>some by some,</v>

1047
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.180
<v Speaker 5>you know a Guinea who ran,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who ran it for the Italians and maybe it</v>

1048
00:55:21.181 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 5>came from Sicily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>

1049
00:55:22.411 --> 00:55:24.960
<v Speaker 5>The origins of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't have fixed that though.</v>

1050
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:28.680
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's gambling so it can't fix </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1051
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:30.090
<v Speaker 5>Why isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's the.</v>

1052
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the track is going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make that.</v>

1053
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:33.583
<v Speaker 5>Fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How would you say you fixed the last </v>

1054
00:55:35.101 --> 00:55:36.900
<v Speaker 5>three numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Checked this out.</v>

1055
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.780
<v Speaker 5>Certain organizations like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>corporation,</v>

1056
00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:40.693
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason people wanted to bet </v>
<v Speaker 5>with them and like to bet with them is </v>

1057
00:55:44.311 --> 00:55:46.320
<v Speaker 5>they would have somebody at the race </v>
<v Speaker 5>track,</v>

1058
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:50.580
<v Speaker 5>so the minute that number was posted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'd know the number.</v>

1059
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:51.593
<v Speaker 5>So you'd get your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't have to wait around for a </v>

1060

<v Speaker 5>You just called sports live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to sit by a payphone and put </v>

1065
00:56:05.401 --> 00:56:08.170
<v Speaker 5>thirty five cents and they would run all</v>
<v Speaker 5>right that,</v>

1066
00:56:08.171 --> 00:56:11.730
<v Speaker 5>that child and after the scores and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>give you the score,</v>

1067
00:56:11.731 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 5>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You Bet.</v>

1068
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:14.660
<v Speaker 5>What's the last fucking thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1069
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 5>so you had to sit there and take that </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole.</v>

1070
00:56:16.621 --> 00:56:19.770
<v Speaker 5>We have beat mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give it to me.</v>

1071
00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:22.830
<v Speaker 5>And then when it came to them saying the</v>
<v Speaker 5>number,</v>

1072
00:56:22.831 --> 00:56:24.030
<v Speaker 5>the subway go by and</v>

1073
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you're just lost another thirty five </v>
<v Speaker 1>cents.</v>

1074
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:29.013
<v Speaker 1>But the whole number system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my mother was a degenerate numbers </v>

1075
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.173
<v Speaker 1>and then she will kill the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Yankees and the red sox later </v>

1076
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:39.370
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But her game was the numbers,</v>

1077
00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:43.060
<v Speaker 1>the three numbers didn't do your track </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now let's get greedy.</v>

1078
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we go to Otb?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1079
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:46.293
<v Speaker 1>Now see this is where.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we just go to old beat a </v>

1080
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 1>really complete your fucking day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You degenerate the brilliance of battle.</v>

1081
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:53.253
<v Speaker 1>And his organization was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do sports betting and in fact </v>

1082
00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.280
<v Speaker 1>his arrangement with the Italians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the mafia was you get Belita,</v>

1083
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:03.190
<v Speaker 1>you get numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get sports betting and you</v>

1084
00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 1>don't get these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a.</v>

1085
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:08.500
<v Speaker 1>there's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an example in this book of a,</v>

1086
00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:12.790
<v Speaker 1>of a member of the corporation who </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts against battles.</v>

1087
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Wishes starts playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing sports,</v>

1088
00:57:15.551 --> 00:57:17.590
<v Speaker 1>betting at that guy wound up dead.</v>

1089
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:18.903
<v Speaker 1>A battle killed himself because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going against the agreement going </v>

1090
00:57:21.551 --> 00:57:22.384
<v Speaker 1>against the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going against the rules that could turn </v>

1091
00:57:23.741 --> 00:57:25.660
<v Speaker 1>them off against them and bring the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing down.</v>

1092
00:57:25.661 --> 00:57:26.494
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1093
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

1094
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Now and answer your question about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they came up with that number.</v>

1095
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.870
<v Speaker 1>You got to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all gambling.</v>

1096
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.180
<v Speaker 1>This is the culture of gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1097
00:57:37.181 --> 00:57:38.260
<v Speaker 1>you're at the race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>track,</v>

1098
00:57:38.261 --> 00:57:41.860
<v Speaker 1>your bedding card games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bedding petting the number,</v>

1099
00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:42.843
<v Speaker 1>so it's logical that somewhere in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe would be how the number was </v>

1100
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.233
<v Speaker 1>determined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it came from the race track and then </v>

1101
00:57:49.571 --> 00:57:54.140
<v Speaker 1>you also have the Puerto Rican lottery </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that comes and paperwork.</v>

1102
00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's completely different.</v>

1103
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Paperwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paperwork,</v>

1104
00:57:58.090 --> 00:57:58.923
<v Speaker 1>paperwork that comes a lottery tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother would buy the whole fucking </v>

1105
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:04.570
<v Speaker 1>sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like $10 a thing,</v>

1106
00:58:04.571 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 1>but you could just buy the sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is it?</v>

1107
00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.013
<v Speaker 1>It's a Puerto Rican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Them now you know that the corporation </v>

1108
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:14.940
<v Speaker 1>use the Puerto Rican lottery to launder </v>
<v Speaker 1>their profits.</v>

1109
00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you hit the number.</v>

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:14.300
<v Speaker 5>What is fascinating to me is this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you were talking about earlier when</v>

1150
01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:16.280
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about like that this was,</v>

1151
01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:20.090
<v Speaker 5>it gave them an opportunity for hope and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it was a part of the community.</v>

1152
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 5>We're missing that in the west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the west coast,</v>

1153
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:24.200
<v Speaker 5>like offtrack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>betting.</v>

1154
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:25.063
<v Speaker 5>There's no fucking here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a few Weirdos that go to the </v>

1155
01:00:27.321 --> 01:00:29.270
<v Speaker 5>Hollywood park,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's gone now.</v>

1156
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.760
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing in the west coast.</v>

1157
01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.290
<v Speaker 5>Never had this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does nothing.</v>

1158
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing like seeing that.</v>

1159
01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.573
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw that and I saw what goes with it </v>

1160
01:00:39.471 --> 01:00:42.890
<v Speaker 5>and it may sound he spoke it in most </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1161
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.740
<v Speaker 5>but it's not who you spoke to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people who are really,</v>

1162
01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:49.280
<v Speaker 5>really Sicilian people who are normal </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cuban.</v>

1163
01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:53.110
<v Speaker 5>When you're a Sicilian in that culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's women that you go to them,</v>

1164
01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.430
<v Speaker 5>they tell you things that witches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Sicilian witches,</v>

1165
01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck you want to and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleepers remember,</v>

1166
01:01:00.201 --> 01:01:01.800
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bring the eyeballs.</v>

1167
01:01:01.801 --> 01:01:02.634
<v Speaker 5>So this lady,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what sleeper sleepers is a movie about </v>

1168
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:09.960
<v Speaker 5>for Irish kids that lay there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit because of a woman.</v>

1169
01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.590
<v Speaker 5>You remember that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about the four kids narrow place.</v>

1170
01:01:12.591 --> 01:01:13.730
<v Speaker 5>A priest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>priest,</v>

1171
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:18.731
<v Speaker 5>but a Brad Pitt grandson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1172
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.900
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Barry Levinson movies.</v>

1173
01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:23.500
<v Speaker 5>Then they got the guy on the leather </v>
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>

1174
01:01:23.501 --> 01:01:27.960
<v Speaker 5>Then he started backtracking like Steven</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seagal by the CIA involvement.</v>

1175
01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:32.430
<v Speaker 5>Lorenzo Carter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He later on became.</v>

1176
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.670
<v Speaker 5>It was a true story and it was not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>

1177
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.810
<v Speaker 5>It was based.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

1178
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:38.953
<v Speaker 5>if you look at it one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two for those two kids were supposed to </v>

1179
01:01:42.171 --> 01:01:43.450
<v Speaker 5>grow up to be west.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1180
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.320
<v Speaker 5>But it wasn't bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's bullshit.</v>

1181
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:46.940
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the two other,</v>

1182
01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:48.760
<v Speaker 5>the four of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are we talking about?</v>

1183
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.850
<v Speaker 5>Talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1184
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 5>you were talking dollar witches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

1185
01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:56.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Cuban world,</v>

1186
01:01:56.001 --> 01:01:59.830
<v Speaker 5>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want my kid to go to Catholic school,</v>

1187
01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.810
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I play this fucking number today,</v>

1188
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:04.610
<v Speaker 5>this is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Save me.</v>

1189
01:02:04.611 --> 01:02:05.361
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1190
01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:06.194
<v Speaker 5>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're a comic you have that hope </v>

1191
01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.630
<v Speaker 5>tonight I'm going to go to the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just Sasha was going to be that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just made it.</v>

1193
01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.613
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's an ethnic hope that comes back </v>

1194
01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 5>from your country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to describe.</v>

1195
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 2>You understand that because your </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother was a fucking booky.</v>

1196
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:25.163
<v Speaker 2>But if you talked to her on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis about it and why she would play </v>

1197
01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 2>that particular number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my mom played five slash 17.</v>

1198

<v Speaker 2>hallucinogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had.</v>

1201
01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 2>If I go like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I go like this and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the guy that cooked was black Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a Vietnam vet and I was five and </v>

1233
01:04:31.711 --> 01:04:33.110
<v Speaker 2>he would give me 10 bucks to go get </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Blackberry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brandy black.</v>

1235
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Mike cooked Italian food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was so fucking good.</v>

1236
01:04:39.111 --> 01:04:42.060
<v Speaker 2>It was 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you hate a black we,</v>

1237
01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:43.683
<v Speaker 2>you waited his spaghetti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even Italians came to eat his spaghetti </v>

1238
01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:51.270
<v Speaker 2>on Wednesdays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could corn beef on Wednesdays.</v>

1239
01:04:51.271 --> 01:04:52.104
<v Speaker 2>He made Cuban food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have an office and every phone has </v>

1240
01:04:55.051 --> 01:04:58.110
<v Speaker 2>a little tape recorder with a wire </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to the phone.</v>

1241
01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:00.140
<v Speaker 2>So you can't call me and say you played </v>
<v Speaker 2>two eight.</v>

1242
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's recorded.</v>

1243
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.093
<v Speaker 2>Fucking busted your way to tape for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every hour the tapes come around the </v>

1244
01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:07.953
<v Speaker 2>same and those get destroyed the week </v>
<v Speaker 2>after or that night after everything </v>

1245
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:13.263
<v Speaker 2>settled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the CEO's offices in action when </v>

1246
01:05:16.381 --> 01:05:18.490
<v Speaker 2>you're a kid and I'm going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes</v>

1247
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 5>and they'd give me a 10 to go get a </v>
<v Speaker 5>three donald pack of cigarettes.</v>

1248
01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 5>I keep seven now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever see the money?</v>

1249
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.013
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The moral of the money that was </v>

1250
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:27.484
<v Speaker 5>gathered?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw how the money would be taken to a </v>

1251
01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.710
<v Speaker 5>separate location.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will be a separate location room now.</v>

1252
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:35.020
<v Speaker 5>There's also they move locations every </v>
<v Speaker 5>week.</v>

1253
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.453
<v Speaker 5>You also have to stay ahead of the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So every week you got a guy like Joe </v>

1254
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.713
<v Speaker 5>Rogan that just rents apartments woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So every week we moved locations so </v>

1255
01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 5>nobody ever gets comfortable with three </v>
<v Speaker 5>months at one place than what?</v>

1256
01:05:47.771 --> 01:05:49.290
<v Speaker 5>Three months in another place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then what?</v>

1257
01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.133
<v Speaker 5>Three months in the other place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because not only will you have to worry </v>

1258
01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:51.994
<v Speaker 5>about cops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to worry about Jamie getting a </v>

1259
01:05:53.531 --> 01:05:54.364
<v Speaker 5>little fucking cocky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie found out from Joe does that they </v>

<v Speaker 5>New York area.</v>

1276
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.213
<v Speaker 5>What they would do is they have people </v>
<v Speaker 5>whose responsibility it was to come </v>

1277
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:49.024
<v Speaker 5>around and collect the money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That money would go into a van and that </v>

1278
01:06:53.081 --> 01:06:53.914
<v Speaker 5>van would have a police escort as it </v>

<v Speaker 5>New Jersey police who picked it up and </v>

1280
01:07:03.641 --> 01:07:04.474
<v Speaker 5>escorted from there into the apartments </v>
<v Speaker 5>or the houses in union city where the </v>

1281
01:07:09.521 --> 01:07:10.520
<v Speaker 5>money was crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the cops got paid.</v>

1283
01:07:12.911 --> 01:07:15.220
<v Speaker 5>So how can I tell you this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the age of 10,</v>

1284
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.450
<v Speaker 5>I knew this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I could never tell.</v>

1285
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.650
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I had to keep it to myself.</v>

1286
01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.513
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of the kids wouldn't be able to </v>

1287
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:26.050
<v Speaker 5>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was talking about not the corner I see</v>

1288
01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.770
<v Speaker 5>in my world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't win.</v>

1289
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.480
<v Speaker 5>What were your Saturday?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We played handball all day.</v>

1290
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:33.500
<v Speaker 5>I had to go to a play with my uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the youngest.</v>

1291
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:37.510
<v Speaker 5>You worked for a sports betting place to</v>
<v Speaker 5>later on as I got older,</v>

1292
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:39.400
<v Speaker 5>but when I got out of high school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was such a loser.</v>

1293
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.430
<v Speaker 5>Then I went to 118th street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy's name was Chad,</v>

1294
01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.100
<v Speaker 5>Jose Torres and the son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went through them like a man.</v>

1295
01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.473
<v Speaker 5>They were around the block to this guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>named Raleigh and Miguel and they ran a </v>

1296
01:07:50.711 --> 01:07:53.200
<v Speaker 5>complete different operation from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cooperation.</v>

1297
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:56.530
<v Speaker 5>Raleigh still around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I had any balls left,</v>

1298
01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:57.364
<v Speaker 5>I go put a bullet and Riley's had </v>
<v Speaker 5>because Raleigh was tight with my </v>

1299
01:08:00.011 --> 01:08:00.844
<v Speaker 5>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My mother helped get Raleigh started on </v>

1300
01:08:02.201 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 5>118th street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When my mother died,</v>

1301
01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.680
<v Speaker 5>he got tight with my stepfather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When my stepfather died,</v>

1302
01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:11.430
<v Speaker 5>he took that money and gave it to my </v>
<v Speaker 5>stepfather.</v>

1303
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 5>Sister.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That money belonged to me.</v>

1304
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 5>So today I'm still pissed off</v>

1305
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.023
<v Speaker 1>at Raleigh because when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to Raleigh every fucking </v>

1306
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave me 50 bucks.</v>

1307
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Every time I went over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys lived their life.</v>

1308
01:08:23.801 --> 01:08:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Karma based life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whenever they see Joe Rogan come in,</v>

1309
01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>feel man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how many things I did with your</v>

1310
01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>father to come in as $100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Get your Dick sucked.</v>

1311
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:37.300
<v Speaker 1>My mother would drive me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how much money did you get to?</v>

1312
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.233
<v Speaker 1>200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could give me $100 of that because I </v>

1313
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>used to buy knives and fucking stars to </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw at people,</v>

1314
01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.410
<v Speaker 1>but that's there with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very generous Joe Rowe,</v>

1315
01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:49.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that when you come over to </v>

1316
01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.640
<v Speaker 1>my house with your daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1317
01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.840
<v Speaker 1>First thing is they do is put a 50 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's here.</v>

1318
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:59.330
<v Speaker 1>So now the girls know whenever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would come over uncle Joey's,</v>

1319
01:08:59.331 --> 01:09:00.164
<v Speaker 1>they get a 50.</v>

1320
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:01.753
<v Speaker 1>So even after you're not around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come over when they're 14 and </v>

1321
01:09:05.361 --> 01:09:07.490
<v Speaker 1>they going to go to Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll come over by uncle joe,</v>

1322
01:09:07.491 --> 01:09:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Uncle Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you girls,</v>

1323
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:10.243
<v Speaker 1>you girls got money is 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had people giving me money because </v>

1324
01:09:13.761 --> 01:09:15.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a base business.</v>

1325
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:17.203
<v Speaker 1>The more I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother would hit the number for </v>

1326
01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:20.510
<v Speaker 1>$10,000 to give away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1327
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the generosity part of </v>

1328
01:09:23.751 --> 01:09:25.760
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the community.</v>

1329
01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.500
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1330
01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:28.334
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about the communal </v>
<v Speaker 1>communal and I think that was even more </v>

1331
01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:32.414
<v Speaker 1>pronounced with the Cubans because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of Bollito and the cultural </v>

1332
01:09:35.691 --> 01:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>significance of belief going back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>

1333
01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:42.920
<v Speaker 1>That's something they brought with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the United States and that was just,</v>

1334
01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:45.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1335
01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:47.570
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't seen as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a criminal thing.</v>

1336
01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't seen as a violent criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1337
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens with Jose Miguel battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>is at a certain point in 1985,</v>

1338
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:55.543
<v Speaker 1>he moves from union city to Miami and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves the hierarchy of the organization </v>

1339
01:10:00.111 --> 01:10:03.350
<v Speaker 1>to Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the money is still being made in New</v>

1340
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.700
<v Speaker 1>York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The organization is as strong as ever in</v>

1341
01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:06.534
<v Speaker 1>the money's being made in the five </v>
<v Speaker 1>boroughs of New York and it's being </v>

1342
01:10:09.021 --> 01:10:12.200
<v Speaker 1>shipped down to Miami where this guy now</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives like a,</v>

1343
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.640
<v Speaker 1>a gentleman farmer on an estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He surrounds himself with mamay trees,</v>

1344
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>a mamay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it fruit from Cuba that he associates</v>

1345
01:10:21.591 --> 01:10:22.630
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Shaker here?</v>

1346
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:23.583
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1347
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did wonderful fruit.</v>

1348
01:10:25.701 --> 01:10:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great military.</v>

1349
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.943
<v Speaker 1>So he associated with his childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing he does is he </v>

1350
01:10:30.321 --> 01:10:31.154
<v Speaker 1>surrounds his estate down in Miami with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fruit from his childhood and he </v>

1351
01:10:36.681 --> 01:10:39.200
<v Speaker 1>lives down there now far removed from </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

1352
01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in New York,</v>

1353
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.193
<v Speaker 1>a war breaks out between the Italians </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Cubans over this thing called </v>

1354
01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:45.710
<v Speaker 1>the two block rule.</v>

1355
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:48.380
<v Speaker 1>When the Cubans and the Italians form </v>
<v Speaker 1>their alliance,</v>

1356
01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.750
<v Speaker 1>they established a rule that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>

1357
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:51.853
<v Speaker 1>nobody could open up a believer to spot </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer than two blocks to a preexisting </v>

1358
01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:58.370
<v Speaker 1>bullied to spot somebody violated that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>

1359
01:10:58.371 --> 01:11:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after investigating and who,</v>

1360
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:04.100
<v Speaker 1>who violated that rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that rule got violated and it turned</v>

1361
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:06.110
<v Speaker 1>into a nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a war.</v>

1362
01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:06.944
<v Speaker 1>And arson war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started firebombing each other </v>

1363
01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:11.930
<v Speaker 1>spots and a lot of innocent people got </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

1364
01:11:11.931 --> 01:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Man incinerated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a four year old girl got killed.</v>

1365
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became horrific.</v>

1366
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.813
<v Speaker 1>Lasted for about eight or nine months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something like 70 murders may </v>

1367
01:11:21.121 --> 01:11:26.121
<v Speaker 1>be 25 fire bombings at different spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got so ugly,</v>

1368
01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.413
<v Speaker 1>it brought down the heat of the feds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could ignore this corporation </v>

1369
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:32.244
<v Speaker 1>thing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it brought a lot of unwanted </v>

1370
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.530
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know who initially started it off.</v>

1371
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Who violated.</v>

1372
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1373
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.470
<v Speaker 1>He became a snitch and told the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1374
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:43.850
<v Speaker 1>The guy who violated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh nothing.</v>

1375
01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:44.693
<v Speaker 1>I violated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the guy who became the number one </v>

1376
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:50.250
<v Speaker 1>arsonist set up the whole campaign of </v>
<v Speaker 1>arson.</v>

1377
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.970
<v Speaker 1>He became a snitch and told the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1378
01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:53.813
<v Speaker 1>chapter and verse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically just one cocky person </v>

1379
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.950
<v Speaker 1>just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this to blow.</v>

1380
01:11:57.990 --> 01:12:02.640
<v Speaker 1>He was probably authorized by his bosses</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

1381
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go over and burn that spot.</v>

1382
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:05.064
<v Speaker 1>We'll show them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that happened and then the </v>

1383
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:08.880
<v Speaker 1>response was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1384
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:10.980
<v Speaker 1>we'll show them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go burn his spot.</v>

1385
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 1>But burning the spot came out of someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>violating the original deal.</v>

1386
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two blocks away.</v>

1387
01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:18.210
<v Speaker 1>That was the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first burning half.</v>

1388
01:12:18.211 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Do they know who the guy was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That started the first day to sit down.</v>

1389
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 1>They had a sit down about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how failed.</v>

1390
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:24.600
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

1391
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.130
<v Speaker 1>The Italians and the Cubans had a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down about it to discuss it,</v>

1392
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.760
<v Speaker 1>to try to resolve it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep it from exploding into war.</v>

1393
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:34.103
<v Speaker 1>At that sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't resolve anything and after </v>

1394
01:12:36.571 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 1>they came out of the restaurant where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sit down took place,</v>

1395
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:40.223
<v Speaker 1>a drive by shooting occurred and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cubans got shot at the restaurant </v>

1396
01:12:43.891 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 1>coming out of the sit down and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war was on.</v>

1397
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on like battle said,</v>

1398
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:49.674
<v Speaker 1>we're at war with the Italians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said with his people and </v>

1399
01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:54.030
<v Speaker 1>battle was ready for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1400
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:55.630
<v Speaker 1>He was good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

1401
01:12:55.631 --> 01:12:57.930
<v Speaker 1>he was ready for that war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seemed to want it.</v>

1402
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:59.303
<v Speaker 1>He seemed to cherish the idea that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to go to war with the </v>

1403
01:13:01.861 --> 01:13:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Italians and so they were ordering all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these horrific and you know how they did</v>

1404
01:13:06.151 --> 01:13:09.330
<v Speaker 1>the arsons they'd get these Mama Luke's </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fill up a,</v>

1405
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.760
<v Speaker 1>a pail with gasoline.</v>

1406
01:13:12.670 --> 01:13:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even a can,</v>

1407
01:13:13.951 --> 01:13:16.950
<v Speaker 1>not even a closed Canon Open Pale and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1408
01:13:16.951 --> 01:13:21.951
<v Speaker 1>they could spill and they took that pail</v>
<v Speaker 1>of gas and they'd walk into a Bodega,</v>

1409
01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.930
<v Speaker 1>bullied the spot and they dump it on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>floor and light it on fire.</v>

1410
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:28.620
<v Speaker 1>And whoever happened to be in there too </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad for them.</v>

1411
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And people would die a horrible death </v>
<v Speaker 1>that got incinerated.</v>

1412
01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I have some pictures in the book that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are almost too horrific.</v>

1413
01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:38.190
<v Speaker 1>I had others that were so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to use them in the book.</v>

1414
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.113
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put something in that book that </v>

1415
01:13:40.231 --> 01:13:41.064
<v Speaker 1>really blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said that in 1975 or 76 in the </v>

1416
01:13:45.141 --> 01:13:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Hudson county where I'm from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was 40 car bombings.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Will you have bail?</v>

1421
01:13:58.650 --> 01:13:59.780

1424
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>weapon of organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were.</v>

1425
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:13.293
<v Speaker 1>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bombing war in Cleveland </v>

1426
01:14:14.801 --> 01:14:16.840
<v Speaker 1>over this Irish gangster in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

1427
01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:18.660
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty common to.</v>

1428
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.533
<v Speaker 1>They made a bomb with the males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who had gotten the Sicilians </v>

1429
01:14:23.141 --> 01:14:25.870
<v Speaker 1>were good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did make a movie about Danny Green.</v>

1430
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1431
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Kill the kill the Irishmen.</v>

1433
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:31.203
<v Speaker 1>And now that we're doing it again while </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing the Irishman different </v>

1434
01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:35.110
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1435
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1436
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did anything surprise you when you were,</v>

1437
01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:40.893
<v Speaker 1>you were putting me in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're well versed in </v>

1438
01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:45.970
<v Speaker 1>organized crime and well versed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of things.</v>

1439
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1440
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:47.993
<v Speaker 1>the dominant feeling people will have </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're reading this book is the </v>

1441
01:14:50.801 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 1>dominant feeling I had when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>researching,</v>

1442
01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:54.700
<v Speaker 1>which was why don't I know this shit.</v>

1443
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really,</v>

1444
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.880
<v Speaker 1>this is not only a great story really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

1445
01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:01.714
<v Speaker 1>but it's really important history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this political connection to </v>

1446
01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:05.734
<v Speaker 1>anti-castro movement and the role that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the US government might have played in </v>

1447
01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:10.054
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that this criminal </v>

1448
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.393
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy organization was allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go on for 40 years because certain </v>

1449
01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:17.584
<v Speaker 1>elements in theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s government didn't want to go after </v>

1450
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:24.050
<v Speaker 1>them because they were afraid it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>open the lid on the Cuban relations with</v>

1451
01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:27.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anti-castro relations with the CIA,</v>

1452
01:15:27.311 --> 01:15:28.960
<v Speaker 1>the politics of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1453
01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:31.030
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not only interesting history.</v>

1454
01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:31.864
<v Speaker 1>It's important history to understand a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain social political relationship </v>

1455
01:15:37.691 --> 01:15:40.750
<v Speaker 1>between the US and Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bay of Pigs,</v>

1456
01:15:40.751 --> 01:15:41.584
<v Speaker 1>the residue of the revolution that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that shaped the cold war shaped </v>

1457
01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:48.700
<v Speaker 1>us politics over a period of about 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1458
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.950
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't I know this?</v>

1459
01:15:50.951 --> 01:15:51.880
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>

1460
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Speaker 1>This is like almost like a hidden </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

1461
01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean I knew what got reported in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers,</v>

1462
01:15:57.610 --> 01:15:59.400
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lift up the rug and you,</v>

1463
01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:03.220
<v Speaker 1>you look underneath the rug and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to get into the details of it.</v>

1464
01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:04.054
<v Speaker 1>It just makes me so aware that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're receiving as information on a </v>

1465
01:16:08.141 --> 01:16:08.974
<v Speaker 1>daily basis from the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media and everything is a </v>

1466
01:16:12.491 --> 01:16:13.324
<v Speaker 1>version of what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole other version of what's </v>

1467
01:16:16.631 --> 01:16:17.464
<v Speaker 1>happening that we don't see and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually only find out about it 30 years </v>

1468
01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:22.510
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years after the fact,</v>

1469
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's a good thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1470
01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds to me like this is A.</v>

1471
01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1472
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:31.630
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard a peep about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you brought this up to me,</v>

1473
01:16:31.631 --> 01:16:33.160
<v Speaker 1>joey and I was like,</v>

1476
01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.600
<v Speaker 1>This is not discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not.</v>

1477
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully this will change.</v>

1478
01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in it and I never talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because like I said,</v>

1479
01:16:45.971 --> 01:16:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I have a hundred stores we go for around</v>
<v Speaker 1>a buzzfeed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that I don't say it because</v>

1483
01:16:54.101 --> 01:16:55.420
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to believe me,</v>

1484
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.660
<v Speaker 1>and number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not my position.</v>

1485
01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I was raised as nothing me to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

1486
01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.493
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw that as a child and then what </v>

1487
01:17:04.181 --> 01:17:06.730
<v Speaker 1>made it worse for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was moving to North Bergen.</v>

1488
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Once I moved north Bergen,</v>

1489
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I saw what they were doing in union city</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a bigger way,</v>

1490
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 2>which is all political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw things that are make it tone drop.</v>

1491
01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.033
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't give a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and the one when I see people </v>

1492
01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:27.440
<v Speaker 2>talking about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go up to them and go,</v>

1493
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:31.670
<v Speaker 2>if you knew what you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't say a word because you have</v>

1494
01:17:31.671 --> 01:17:36.671
<v Speaker 2>no idea what real politics means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How it works if it works like that and a</v>

1495
01:17:37.971 --> 01:17:42.971
<v Speaker 2>micro system I can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a real.</v>

1496
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:45.720
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want to pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>join.</v>

1497
01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you a question because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I joined and I connected when I had more</v>

1498
01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.240
<v Speaker 2>or less written this already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1499
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.970
<v Speaker 2>if I had come to you way back at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of this,</v>

1500
01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:58.610
<v Speaker 2>out of the blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden this Guy Tj English,</v>

1501
01:17:58.611 --> 01:17:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know you because you knew the </v>
<v Speaker 2>westies.</v>

1502
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.820
<v Speaker 2>So you knew who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew I was legit.</v>

1503
01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.980
<v Speaker 2>If I had contacted you and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you talk to me about this history?</v>

1504
01:18:06.981 --> 01:18:11.981
<v Speaker 2>Would you have done it with everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would take us a week to debrief me.</v>

1505
01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.650
<v Speaker 2>So you would have been ready in will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have told you.</v>

1506
01:18:15.710 --> 01:18:16.543
<v Speaker 2>Now you see what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing I would have known because </v>

1507
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.510
<v Speaker 2>somebody has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1508
01:18:20.511 --> 01:18:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking story.</v>

1509
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:24.163
<v Speaker 2>He opened up the door for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a responsibility now that I have </v>

1510
01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:29.540
<v Speaker 2>another story that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this.</v>

1511
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.403
<v Speaker 2>Yes he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the nuts and bolts of how this </v>

1512
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.374
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you thought about in addition to </v>

1513
01:18:34.641 --> 01:18:35.474
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's going to be a number of </v>

1514
01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:40.640
<v Speaker 2>spin off books from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really a book that comes from.</v>

1515
01:18:40.641 --> 01:18:44.210
<v Speaker 2>This is going to tell their personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>story shot.</v>

1516
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I will end up dead.</v>

1517
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will end up dead.</v>

1518
01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Not because of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of what I'm exposed to.</v>

1519
01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.550
<v Speaker 2>We know who did it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a,</v>

1520
01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:53.660
<v Speaker 2>in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1521
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:54.613
<v Speaker 2>I grew up when I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power in that Hudson county was the </v>

1522
01:18:59.001 --> 01:18:59.834
<v Speaker 2>waterfront Digi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That picture in New York City that </v>

1523
01:19:02.451 --> 01:19:03.284
<v Speaker 2>people see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of people died for that </v>

1524
01:19:06.381 --> 01:19:07.214
<v Speaker 2>waterfront.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That waterfront was controlled by </v>

1525
01:19:10.911 --> 01:19:11.744
<v Speaker 2>wheelock and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everybody wanted a piece of it and </v>

1526
01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.250
<v Speaker 2>North Bergen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the pieces of it.</v>

1527
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:19.370
<v Speaker 2>So my eighth grade teacher was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weehawken man.</v>

1528
01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:21.200
<v Speaker 2>You ever have a teacher?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a man.</v>

1529
01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Why would a teacher be a mayor of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>town?</v>

1530
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.431
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

1531
01:19:25.431 --> 01:19:26.264
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's ever had a teacher tweet that was </v>

1532
01:19:29.151 --> 01:19:31.700
<v Speaker 2>the mayor of a town at the same time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1533
01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.040
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of my eighth grade,</v>

1534
01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:37.550
<v Speaker 2>did atf come in and pull them out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that real?</v>

1535
01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.540
<v Speaker 2>He did 11 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1536
01:19:40.541 --> 01:19:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was selling the waterfront.</v>

1537
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:48.470
<v Speaker 2>He all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they knew that there's a particular</v>

1538
01:19:48.471 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 2>family that I will not mentioned because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't even make it to the four.</v>

1539
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:53.534
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>

1540
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:57.090
<v Speaker 2>And they were buying that property up </v>
<v Speaker 2>change 60?</v>

1541
01:19:57.370 --> 01:19:58.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1542
01:19:58.150 --> 01:19:58.983
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will buying that property up in the </v>

1543
01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:02.420
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were posing as politicians.</v>

1544
01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.440
<v Speaker 2>They chop up $30 million a month now </v>
<v Speaker 2>between four and then it.</v>

1545
01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:08.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1546
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.353
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from all of the property they </v>

1547
01:20:10.351 --> 01:20:12.420
<v Speaker 2>own in Hudson county.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bought everything.</v>

1548
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Jersey City hoboken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they make their profit selling it?</v>

1549
01:20:16.261 --> 01:20:16.891
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1550
01:20:16.891 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 2>They made their profit renting it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>renting it.</v>

1551
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.890
<v Speaker 2>So the four of them before brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chubb $30 million.</v>

1552
01:20:22.891 --> 01:20:25.590
<v Speaker 2>They go their own ways every month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They chopper 30 million.</v>

1553
01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:26.873
<v Speaker 2>So I started from North Bergen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I tell you stories about columbine </v>

1554
01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 2>bows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zana,</v>

1555
01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:30.923
<v Speaker 2>he was a cop.</v>

1556
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:36.590
<v Speaker 2>He was a cop to that I got invited into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He opened up his home to me.</v>

1557
01:20:36.691 --> 01:20:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Then his son died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that was my age,</v>

1558
01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:40.464
<v Speaker 2>so I became a pseudo sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here I am running with the Cubans </v>

1559
01:20:43.231 --> 01:20:44.064
<v Speaker 2>during the week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about numbers and drugs </v>

1560
01:20:46.531 --> 01:20:48.660
<v Speaker 2>and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm growing up in a cop's house.</v>

1561
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:54.480
<v Speaker 2>That's also the driver for the mayor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would do whatever,</v>

1562
01:20:54.481 --> 01:20:58.420
<v Speaker 2>like I still owe him handcuffed dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and throw Beaton's on them and they call</v>

1563
01:20:58.421 --> 01:21:01.340
<v Speaker 2>them the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call them combine the torch Mazano,</v>

1564
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:04.170
<v Speaker 2>because his job was to burn your </v>
<v Speaker 2>building down.</v>

1565
01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:06.360
<v Speaker 2>The last one he burned down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids were like,</v>

1566
01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Mr that smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

1567
01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.040
<v Speaker 2>here's $10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who can ice cream?</v>

1568
01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll call the fire department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never called him.</v>

1569
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:16.730
<v Speaker 2>He faked a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have to talk to reporters.</v>

1570
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:20.880
<v Speaker 2>First thing you do is you fake a heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack because you don't have to talk to</v>

1571
01:21:20.881 --> 01:21:21.714
<v Speaker 2>reporters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gives you two days to get your </v>

1572
01:21:23.611 --> 01:21:28.410
<v Speaker 2>story straight with the attorney that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea what I know now.</v>

1573
01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.473
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing the question about whether he </v>

1574
01:21:31.401 --> 01:21:32.234
<v Speaker 1>would have been willing to talk is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people reached out to me early in </v>

1575
01:21:36.501 --> 01:21:37.790
<v Speaker 1>this book process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1576
01:21:37.791 --> 01:21:38.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1577
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.333
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie rights were options before I </v>

1578
01:21:41.241 --> 01:21:43.460
<v Speaker 1>even wrote the book based on the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposal.</v>

1579
01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:44.983
<v Speaker 1>And I got a lot of media attention and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started getting emails from nieces and </v>

1580
01:21:49.521 --> 01:21:54.170
<v Speaker 1>nephews have sons and daughters of key </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters in the story,</v>

1581
01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:59.650
<v Speaker 1>and these were people like joey who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept us personal family history,</v>

1582
01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.920
<v Speaker 1>bottle cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't talked to anybody about it,</v>

1583
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.963
<v Speaker 1>and now they saw I was doing this book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they and they needed to get it off </v>

1584
01:22:08.001 --> 01:22:10.160
<v Speaker 1>their chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They needed to talk about it.</v>

1585
01:22:10.161 --> 01:22:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I would go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met these two,</v>

1586
01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:15.620
<v Speaker 1>these two girls who were daughters of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys who became a snitch,</v>

1587
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:16.663
<v Speaker 1>testified against the corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The family went into the witness </v>

1588
01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:22.970
<v Speaker 1>protection program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These girls had never talked to anybody.</v>

1589
01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:25.220
<v Speaker 1>When I met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to meet with them in a bar.</v>

1590
01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.470
<v Speaker 1>They weren't even sure they were going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to me.</v>

1591
01:22:27.471 --> 01:22:31.040
<v Speaker 1>We were just meeting to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they were going to talk to me.</v>

1592
01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.233
<v Speaker 1>I got to meet them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talk nonstop for three hours and </v>

1593
01:22:34.431 --> 01:22:37.610
<v Speaker 1>once they thought they could trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

1594
01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:38.503
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't stop talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had all the stuff they needed to </v>

1595
01:22:41.751 --> 01:22:43.060
<v Speaker 1>get off their chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1596
01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to say God's God's the first raid.</v>

1597
01:22:48.041 --> 01:22:49.660
<v Speaker 2>I saw my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was five.</v>

1598
01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.613
<v Speaker 2>They sat me on the couch and read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother had already thrown the coke </v>

1599
01:22:53.381 --> 01:22:54.214
<v Speaker 2>off about the until the lady downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the landlord had already called her and </v>

1600
01:22:58.090 --> 01:22:59.830
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cops are on the way out the door.</v>

1601
01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.210
<v Speaker 2>We lived on the west side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists facing a new New Jersey,</v>

1602
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:05.403
<v Speaker 2>and the lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would pay her rent and tell a hold </v>

1603
01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.400
<v Speaker 2>this bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother through it,</v>

1604
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:10.780
<v Speaker 2>they came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat is down.</v>

1605
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:13.060
<v Speaker 2>They asked the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to Ada Street,</v>

1606
01:23:13.061 --> 01:23:14.530
<v Speaker 2>88th street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never got raided.</v>

1607
01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.700
<v Speaker 2>When I moved to North Bergen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get raided before I got ready to</v>

1608
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.653
<v Speaker 2>the phone would ring and become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that your mom had cleaned the </v>

1609
01:23:22.391 --> 01:23:23.224
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd wake my mom up to clean the house </v>

1610
01:23:25.451 --> 01:23:26.284
<v Speaker 2>and come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to see what's going to </v>

1611
01:23:27.401 --> 01:23:28.234
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1612
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:29.163
<v Speaker 2>Cops would come and arrest my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would walk the columbines obs with my </v>

1613
01:23:31.391 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 2>basketball right past the cops and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that easy.</v>

1614
01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.080
<v Speaker 2>It was that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1615
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you wish you ran into joey before you</v>
<v Speaker 2>started writing this?</v>

1616
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.710
<v Speaker 2>It would've been a different book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted.</v>

1617
01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:43.653
<v Speaker 2>Why I enjoyed this book so much is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because no matter how much history this </v>

1618
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:52.681
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker dropped on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he let you know Jose Battle was.</v>

1619
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:58.120
<v Speaker 2>He kept you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remind them who's Jose Battle was.</v>

1620
01:23:58.150 --> 01:23:58.983
<v Speaker 2>That's big for an author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never got away from Jose battle and </v>

1621
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:05.680
<v Speaker 2>when you read the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what type of person you are,</v>

1622
01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:09.950
<v Speaker 2>you kind of get mad at Jose battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about Jose battery</v>

1623
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.610
<v Speaker 2>life cause you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want that guy in your corner.</v>

1624
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:16.570
<v Speaker 2>If you knew Jose battle and you knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he got in the truck and say,</v>

1625
01:24:16.571 --> 01:24:17.404
<v Speaker 2>I'm going out there for my men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the guy I want with me all the </v>

1626
01:24:19.961 --> 01:24:20.794
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to hang out with this </v>

1627
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:23.230
<v Speaker 2>fucking idiot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets scattered.</v>

1628
01:24:23.231 --> 01:24:24.064
<v Speaker 2>If an ambulance goes by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy actually went out and saved </v>

1629
01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:27.673
<v Speaker 2>that guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he had that Cuban loyalty that Anti </v>

1630
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Castro Cubans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1631
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:36.250
<v Speaker 2>That's big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So growing up there was so many things I</v>

1632
01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:40.240
<v Speaker 2>wasn't allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't even allowed to talk about.</v>

1633
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how ruthless this guy.</v>

1634
01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:42.821
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>

1635
01:24:42.821 --> 01:24:43.320
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>

1636
01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.640
<v Speaker 2>let you answer the question though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you wish that you would run into joe?</v>

1637
01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes I do,</v>

1638
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:52.490
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that fears me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so much research to do in this</v>

1639
01:24:52.491 --> 01:24:53.960
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I would have met Joey,</v>

1640
01:24:53.961 --> 01:24:54.794
<v Speaker 1>I would have gone down a rabbit hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>with joey stories and that might've </v>

1641
01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.000
<v Speaker 1>taken me off this specific research I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing,</v>

1642
01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:06.200
<v Speaker 1>so I almost joey joey's thing is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate thing.</v>

1643
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:11.390
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a a sequel to or a sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a son.</v>

1644
01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:12.373
<v Speaker 1>The son of the corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a spinoff of it and there's a </v>

1645
01:25:15.351 --> 01:25:16.184
<v Speaker 1>lot of people probably who have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of it like joey does that they </v>

1646
01:25:19.641 --> 01:25:23.060
<v Speaker 1>could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

1647
01:25:23.061 --> 01:25:25.100
<v Speaker 1>But let me say about battle because Joey</v>
<v Speaker 1>St,</v>

1648
01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:26.023
<v Speaker 1>very interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How charismatic he was and how you </v>

1649
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:31.190
<v Speaker 1>partly liked him and admired him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was was the,</v>

1650
01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:33.050
<v Speaker 1>is the case of any good leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1651
01:25:33.051 --> 01:25:36.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want from a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's how ruthless this guy was.</v>

1652
01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:39.350
<v Speaker 1>He had a guy in his organization or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nesto Torres,</v>

1653
01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Ernesto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who he met in Spain.</v>

1654
01:25:42.201 --> 01:25:43.034
<v Speaker 1>Battle was on the run in Madrid for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brief period of time when he'd been </v>

1655
01:25:45.471 --> 01:25:48.710
<v Speaker 1>indicted on gambling charges and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were a bunch of Cubans living over there</v>

1656
01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.810
<v Speaker 1>and they all hung out together and he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He discovered this 19 year old kid named</v>

1657
01:25:53.811 --> 01:25:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Ernesto Torres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was sort of an orphan and one day he</v>

1658
01:25:58.341 --> 01:26:00.650
<v Speaker 1>tells the kid he's going to mentor the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

1659
01:26:00.651 --> 01:26:01.670
<v Speaker 1>One day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells the kid,</v>

1660
01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I've got a guy coming this afternoon to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the apartment.</v>

1661
01:26:04.641 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I want you to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He owes me $10,000.</v>

1662
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to scare the shit out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1663
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:10.664
<v Speaker 1>I want you to see what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you treat somebody who owes you </v>

1664
01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:14.624
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show them that they can't play around </v>

1665
01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:19.070
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's waiting for the guy to come over</v>

1666
01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:20.363
<v Speaker 1>battle and he's sitting in his apartment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's a pop pop from out in the </v>

1667
01:26:23.301 --> 01:26:23.840
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

1668
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 1>He goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes out.</v>

1669
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Earnest Eco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen year old is there with a gun in</v>

1670
01:26:28.731 --> 01:26:31.880
<v Speaker 1>his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's shot the guy in the backseat of the</v>

1671
01:26:31.881 --> 01:26:34.760
<v Speaker 1>cab arriving to meet with battling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing him.</v>

1672
01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:36.660
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1673
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Padrino Godfather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1674
01:26:38.091 --> 01:26:39.980
<v Speaker 1>you'll never have a problem with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy again.</v>

1675
01:26:39.981 --> 01:26:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I took care of it and battles looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it going,</v>

1676
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just cost me $10,000.</v>

1677
01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want the guy dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1678
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:50.360
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks at her and he thinks I can use.</v>

1679
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I can use this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can use this guy.</v>

1680
01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.660
<v Speaker 1>So earnest ego becomes what he calls his</v>
<v Speaker 1>protocol son.</v>

1681
01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:00.020
<v Speaker 1>And he grooms this guy to maybe be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next Godfather.</v>

1682
01:27:00.021 --> 01:27:03.350
<v Speaker 1>When they come back to New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come back to union city.</v>

1683
01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:05.610
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sends this Guy Ernest,</v>

1684
01:27:05.611 --> 01:27:09.620
<v Speaker 1>he go out there and no one else in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation can understand battles.</v>

1685
01:27:09.621 --> 01:27:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Affection for this guy they think are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tequilas thug.</v>

1686
01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.300
<v Speaker 1>He's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a street dog.</v>

1687
01:27:14.301 --> 01:27:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organization can use guys like that,</v>

1688
01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:19.010
<v Speaker 1>but you don't put him in positions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

1689
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Battle scene have a soft spot for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1690
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:26.830
<v Speaker 1>He makes earnest tico a banker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes the other bankers bank roll,</v>

1691
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:28.183
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put up $10,000 each so that earnest can </v>

1692
01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:32.240
<v Speaker 1>be a banker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like it.</v>

1693
01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Most of them don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they go along with a couple of them.</v>

1694
01:27:35.061 --> 01:27:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Don't go along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ernest ego doesn't have the brains to be</v>

1695
01:27:38.151 --> 01:27:40.850
<v Speaker 1>a banker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fails miserably as a banker.</v>

1696
01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:43.700
<v Speaker 1>He's humiliated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what he does,</v>

1697
01:27:43.701 --> 01:27:48.020
<v Speaker 1>he starts kidnapping bankers from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization and holding them for money,</v>

1698
01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.400
<v Speaker 1>very self destructive thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He turns against the organization.</v>

1699
01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:55.490
<v Speaker 1>He goes rogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is shoots a banker.</v>

<v Speaker 1>paddles,</v>

1701
01:27:57.510 --> 01:28:00.790

<v Speaker 1>The bankers come to Jose Miguel battle.</v>

1702
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:01.400
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1703

<v Speaker 1>That'll be in the man.</v>

1706
01:28:08.721 --> 01:28:10.400
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realizes that that's true.</v>

1707
01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:11.653
<v Speaker 1>It's his responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hires a few assassins to try to take </v>

1710
01:28:19.611 --> 01:28:20.444
<v Speaker 1>They can't get the job done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Battle decides he's got to do the thing </v>

1711
01:28:23.661 --> 01:28:25.700
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By this time,</v>

1712
01:28:25.701 --> 01:28:26.534
<v Speaker 1>Ernest Tico has fled to Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hiding out with his girlfriend in </v>

1713
01:28:29.001 --> 01:28:31.430
<v Speaker 1>OPA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Locka battle gets together,</v>

1714
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.353
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his brothers and another </v>

1715
01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:38.630
<v Speaker 1>assassin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chino Akuna and a day go down to.</v>

1716
01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.410
<v Speaker 1>They go down to Miami and in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the afternoon they burst in this guy,</v>

1717
01:28:42.411 --> 01:28:44.330
<v Speaker 1>they find out where he as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his apartment,</v>

1718
01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.433
<v Speaker 1>they engage in a wild shootout with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's Tico and they shoot him in the </v>

1719
01:28:48.711 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 1>closet of his bedroom at battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes in,</v>

1720
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:53.150
<v Speaker 1>grabs him by the hair and shoots him </v>
<v Speaker 1>right ripe.</v>

1721
01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:56.510
<v Speaker 1>It puts a bullet right between his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a boss.</v>

1722
01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:57.463
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from the horrible nature of the </v>

1723
01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:00.680
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a leader.</v>

1724
01:29:00.930 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a guy who</v>

1725
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.100
<v Speaker 5>takes matters into his own hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wants something done.</v>

1726
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:10.101
<v Speaker 5>He goes and does it himself and uses </v>
<v Speaker 5>that as an example for the organization.</v>

1727
01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.250
<v Speaker 5>He comes back to the bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bankers in New York.</v>

1728
01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.073
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to have a problem with </v>

1729
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:18.090
<v Speaker 5>with ernest eco anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

1730
01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:20.220
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He died like a lion.</v>

1731
01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:22.980
<v Speaker 5>He fought to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He empty.</v>

1732
01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:25.860
<v Speaker 5>He fought until he'd empty his gun and </v>
<v Speaker 5>shot him in the closet.</v>

1733
01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.670
<v Speaker 5>So he's telling all the other backers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still admire the kid.</v>

1734
01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:32.550
<v Speaker 5>He fought like a lion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I took care of it.</v>

1735
01:29:32.551 --> 01:29:34.650
<v Speaker 5>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know the other,</v>

1736
01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.513
<v Speaker 5>the other belief the bankers were in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're in awe of this guy because he had </v>

1737
01:29:38.461 --> 01:29:43.200
<v Speaker 5>a certain ability to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they didn't have this in the book.</v>

1738
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.981
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:29:43.981 --> 01:29:48.480
<v Speaker 5>There's pictures of it in the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was the logic to take this thug and</v>

1740
01:29:48.481 --> 01:29:49.950
<v Speaker 5>tournament to a banker in the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>place?</v>

1741
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:52.770
<v Speaker 5>He had a soft spot for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Battle was a sentimentalist.</v>

1742
01:29:52.771 --> 01:29:55.730
<v Speaker 5>He took in stray dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He drive around this.</v>

1743
01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:56.653
<v Speaker 5>He'd drive around and he'd see a dog on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the street and he'd open the door and </v>

1744
01:29:59.731 --> 01:30:01.230
<v Speaker 5>he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come if the dog come.</v>

1745
01:30:01.231 --> 01:30:05.310
<v Speaker 5>He took the dog in and in his home in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Miami as a state in Miami.</v>

1746
01:30:05.311 --> 01:30:07.760
<v Speaker 5>He had like 25 stray dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1747
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:08.723
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said Ernest Tico is like a stray </v>

1748
01:30:10.231 --> 01:30:11.064
<v Speaker 5>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a soft spot for the kid before I </v>

1749
01:30:13.111 --> 01:30:15.100
<v Speaker 5>piss real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't.</v>

1750
01:30:15.230 --> 01:30:19.760
<v Speaker 5>Cube with a dog is a big symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My toys was real big circle care.</v>

1751
01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.860
<v Speaker 5>When Michael Vick got convicted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of jails.</v>

1752
01:30:22.861 --> 01:30:23.694
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't be center because they had </v>
<v Speaker 5>an adequate population and they don't </v>

1753
01:30:27.271 --> 01:30:32.130
<v Speaker 5>play when it comes to dog because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>devotion is to St Laszlo Way.</v>

1754
01:30:32.131 --> 01:30:32.964
<v Speaker 5>St Lazarus who got these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ones with the crutches that got his </v>

1760
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:53.220
<v Speaker 5>That's what he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was very loyal and uh,</v>

1761
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:55.460
<v Speaker 5>until you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>until you turned onto the attorney.</v>

1762
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:58.190
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they almost canceled the sopranos.</v>

1763
01:30:58.210 --> 01:31:00.540
<v Speaker 5>The HBO got really pissed at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Sopranos.</v>

1764
01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.553
<v Speaker 5>Episode seven when he drives his </v>
<v Speaker 5>daughter to the school and he kills the </v>

1765
01:31:04.531 --> 01:31:09.531
<v Speaker 5>guy personally because hbo felt that </v>
<v Speaker 5>bosses should never do heads.</v>

1766
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.060
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did that over time.</v>

1767
01:31:12.090 --> 01:31:14.510
<v Speaker 5>Hbo Film,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hbo felt they were,</v>

1768
01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:16.970
<v Speaker 5>that they were that chase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck this Ross Greenberg.</v>

1769
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:22.310
<v Speaker 5>They will chase and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't think in real life a boss maybe</v>

1770
01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:26.610
<v Speaker 5>went and he picked up the guy by his </v>
<v Speaker 5>neck when he drove a whatever,</v>

1771
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:27.444
<v Speaker 5>willow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the college that the hbo threatened the </v>

1772
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:35.220
<v Speaker 5>Sopranos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the add that episode to cut that,</v>

1773
01:31:35.221 --> 01:31:38.850
<v Speaker 5>to make somebody else killed a guy that </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't the only guy.</v>

1774
01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.680
<v Speaker 5>Was that because they wanted Tony </v>
<v Speaker 5>Soprano.</v>

1775
01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:42.490
<v Speaker 5>They still wanted them to be some sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a hero.</v>

1776
01:31:42.491 --> 01:31:45.780
<v Speaker 5>They didn't understand that he wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep your hands clean.</v>

1777
01:31:45.810 --> 01:31:46.643
<v Speaker 5>Then the ridiculous because that was one</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the more appealing things about that </v>

1778

<v Speaker 1>$100,000 and this is in the seventies.</v>

1793
01:32:35.391 --> 01:32:37.090
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a million.</v>

1794
01:32:37.091 --> 01:32:37.924
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A earnest equals the one that takes on </v>

1795
01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:45.470
<v Speaker 1>ernest take on another assassin are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that take on that contract and they</v>

1796

<v Speaker 1>go out trying to get pilou.</v>

1797
01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:48.243
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something like nine attempts or </v>

1798
01:32:51.251 --> 01:32:52.084
<v Speaker 1>12 attempts on Palooz life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a shoot out in central park </v>

1799
01:32:55.601 --> 01:32:57.970
<v Speaker 1>with machine guns in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon.</v>

1800
01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:58.833
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys with machine guns shooting with </v>

1801
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:05.560
<v Speaker 1>mothers with baby carriages and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palooza got shot up so bad.</v>

1802
01:33:05.561 --> 01:33:06.394
<v Speaker 1>He loses his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He winds up having to have a prosthetic </v>

1803
01:33:08.621 --> 01:33:11.320
<v Speaker 1>leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still go after Pilou.</v>

1804
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:12.663
<v Speaker 1>One pilou goes to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hire a killer to stab him in the </v>

1805
01:33:15.431 --> 01:33:18.790
<v Speaker 1>prison yard twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two separate times.</v>

1806
01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:22.750
<v Speaker 1>And He survived that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He keeps surviving and he survived.</v>

1807
01:33:22.751 --> 01:33:24.610
<v Speaker 1>So many of these assassination attempts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1808
01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:26.560
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think he's not human.</v>

1809
01:33:26.770 --> 01:33:27.603
<v Speaker 1>They come to believe that he's got some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense santeria spirit who's protecting </v>

1810
01:33:30.581 --> 01:33:32.570
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you think someone has this,</v>

1811
01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I was still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was here for this.</v>

1812
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:38.350
<v Speaker 1>When you have someone you think has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santeria spirit protecting them,</v>

1813
01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you have to counter that with a center.</v>

1814
01:33:40.570 --> 01:33:41.403
<v Speaker 1>He a spirit of your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have what's called the </v>

1815
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Bombay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you were,</v>

1816
01:33:44.681 --> 01:33:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You create a,</v>

1817
01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:50.500
<v Speaker 1>a kind of Voodoo energy to kill this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1818
01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they continue to go after poodle.</v>

1819
01:33:53.051 --> 01:33:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Finally battle as he did with Ernest </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] says,</v>

1820
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take matters into my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

1821
01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be there on this one.</v>

1822
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:01.743
<v Speaker 1>They find out where Pilou is in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bronx and they go on one night and they </v>

1823
01:34:05.771 --> 01:34:08.000
<v Speaker 1>trap him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see cars come from all sides.</v>

1824
01:34:08.001 --> 01:34:09.940
<v Speaker 1>They trap him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets out of his car,</v>

1825
01:34:09.941 --> 01:34:13.270
<v Speaker 1>they shoot him in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shoot them full of 11 bullets.</v>

1826
01:34:13.271 --> 01:34:17.860
<v Speaker 1>He falls in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bleeding loaded with gunshots.</v>

1827
01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 1>The last thing he sees is Jose Miguel </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle standing over him,</v>

1828
01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:23.973
<v Speaker 1>laughing at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he goes unconscious in the </v>

1829
01:34:26.321 --> 01:34:27.640
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

1830
01:34:27.641 --> 01:34:28.451
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's dead.</v>

1831
01:34:28.451 --> 01:34:29.284
<v Speaker 1>They're almost ready to celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The following morning they find out now </v>

1832
01:34:32.630 --> 01:34:35.080
<v Speaker 1>polluted was rushed to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not dead.</v>

1833
01:34:35.410 --> 01:34:37.990
<v Speaker 1>He's recovering now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're beside themselves.</v>

1834
01:34:37.991 --> 01:34:39.900
<v Speaker 1>What corneal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've tried everything.</v>

1835
01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.510
<v Speaker 1>They've tried everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1836
01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.730
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1837
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:46.480
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hire an assassin.</v>

1838
01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Dress him up as a male nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes into the hospital,</v>

1839
01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:51.093
<v Speaker 1>shoots Pilou in his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his hospital bed right between the </v>

1840
01:34:54.251 --> 01:34:56.560
<v Speaker 1>eyes and it got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got the job done.</v>

1841
01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 1>He was talking when you were gone,</v>

1842
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:02.150
<v Speaker 2>about how if you felt like a guy had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Ria spirit protecting them,</v>

1843
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:06.060
<v Speaker 2>you had to have your own Santa Maria to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back to combat it.</v>

1844
01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Santa Ria became a scam after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1845
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:13.280
<v Speaker 2>like I was raised in Santa Maria from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the age of five.</v>

1846
01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I had little disturbances when my dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

1847
01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I was weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

1848
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:21.070
<v Speaker 2>They didn't put me into Santa Ria to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a witch.</v>

1849
01:35:21.071 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Doctor explained Santa Maria to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't know what,</v>

1850
01:35:23.001 --> 01:35:25.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a religion that originated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>

1851
01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.393
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the slaves brought it over to </v>

1852
01:35:27.861 --> 01:35:28.694
<v Speaker 2>Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hit it from the plantation owners </v>

1853
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.480
<v Speaker 2>through Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why there's a lot of cross.</v>

1854
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a mixture of African </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic Catholic religion.</v>

1855
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.943
<v Speaker 2>When I was five I was brought up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>148th street and this lady had a collie </v>

1856
01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.930
<v Speaker 2>dog and I loved the Cali.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love dogs and I was allergic to them,</v>

1857
01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.273
<v Speaker 2>so while I was playing with the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would talk to me and I fell in love </v>

1858
01:35:52.041 --> 01:35:52.874
<v Speaker 2>with this woman.</v>

1859
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I fell in love with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like my mother and then as I got</v>

1860
01:35:57.051 --> 01:35:58.460
<v Speaker 2>older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that they asked me,</v>

1861
01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:00.170
<v Speaker 2>do you want this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want that?</v>

1862
01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to get like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1863
01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Which is the first one you get at like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wildo Goon,</v>

1864
01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:07.813
<v Speaker 2>Yoel Romero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the first things you get and </v>

1865
01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:14.240
<v Speaker 2>you put them by your door and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantee you know your safety.</v>

1866
01:36:14.241 --> 01:36:15.074
<v Speaker 2>For me it was health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That big black woman who is my </v>

1867
01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:18.680
<v Speaker 2>godmother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1868
01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>And then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was six,</v>

1869
01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:22.993
<v Speaker 2>they finally said they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>initiate me and my mother because my </v>

1870
01:36:29.211 --> 01:36:31.640
<v Speaker 2>spirit took my father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1871
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 2>So they wanted my godmother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted me and my mother to be twins</v>

1872
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:36.883
<v Speaker 2>in the Santa Maria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I made st 148th street and Broadway </v>

1873
01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:41.653
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me it wasn't to be a killer or </v>

1874
01:36:43.371 --> 01:36:44.450
<v Speaker 2>would it be anything like that?</v>

1875
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't carry guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go in cars with strange people.</v>

1876
01:36:48.591 --> 01:36:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I can't do business with three people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say.</v>

1877
01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:55.550
<v Speaker 2>I hope Jamie fucking gets hit by a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not allowed to say all those things.</v>

1878
01:36:55.551 --> 01:36:56.384
<v Speaker 2>I don't use it the way in the late 17 </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do business with three people </v>

1879
01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:02.750
<v Speaker 2>because two of them will sidle up </v>
<v Speaker 2>against you.</v>

1880
01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:04.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same thing that happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me on my kidnapping.</v>

1881
01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I rob somebody with three people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't stay in everything.</v>

1882
01:37:08.370 --> 01:37:12.110
<v Speaker 2>I look at my life now look at my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a white powder,</v>

1883
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:16.130
<v Speaker 2>my st in my head is controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's why I always wearing a white</v>

<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a big cargo coming in from </v>

01:38:15.721 --> 01:38:19.890
<v Speaker 2>kid for dotty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of a story that he's in the book.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't know this growing up.</v>

1902
01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:23.543
<v Speaker 2>He went to court one time and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>godmother made a powder and before the </v>

1903
01:38:26.971 --> 01:38:27.804
<v Speaker 2>judge went to make a verdict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she splayed the power and the thing and </v>

1904
01:38:31.951 --> 01:38:35.700
<v Speaker 2>the judge fucking couldn't remember what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck he was about to say,</v>

1905
01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.600
<v Speaker 2>dismissed the case and she became a star</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>

1906
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Every fucking criminal wanting to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>her thousands of dollars.</v>

<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

1908
01:38:45.541 --> 01:38:46.374
<v Speaker 2>There's a movie they called years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a the devil's advocate with a </v>

1909
01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:51.933
<v Speaker 2>with Keanu reeves and Pachino and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one scene where he has to go </v>

1910
01:38:55.381 --> 01:38:57.690
<v Speaker 2>protect the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's a Santa Ria guy.</v>

1911
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:02.160
<v Speaker 2>New York is prosecuting him because he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing animals without a license and he</v>

1912
01:39:02.161 --> 01:39:03.030
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch this.</v>

1913
01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.190
<v Speaker 2>He takes a tongue and he puts the tongue</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1914
01:39:05.191 --> 01:39:08.040
<v Speaker 2>He blasts the tongue with like a thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he says.</v>

1915
01:39:08.041 --> 01:39:09.780
<v Speaker 2>He asked the guy what's the judge's </v>
<v Speaker 2>name?</v>

1916
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:11.423
<v Speaker 2>And the judge gave him his name and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>took the tongue and they roll it with </v>

1917
01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:15.900
<v Speaker 2>nails and then they put it away and they</v>

<v Speaker 2>lot of shit she didn't want me to say at</v>

1979
01:42:26.651 --> 01:42:31.651
<v Speaker 2>that time and when I got a Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>school I was introduced to it and one of</v>

1980
01:42:32.111 --> 01:42:35.590
<v Speaker 2>the things I got introduced in one night</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the end of union city.</v>

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:41.550
<v Speaker 2>The end of that political era where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was running smooth came to an</v>

1982
01:42:41.651 --> 01:42:43.150
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in 76.</v>

1983
01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:47.980
<v Speaker 2>That's when allegations started to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up because there was two cops that would</v>

1984
01:42:47.981 --> 01:42:50.290

<v Speaker 2>would have a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to my mother in Spanish.</v>

1987

<v Speaker 2>cops and that name is in the book,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a scheme that's radical.</v>

<v Speaker 2>kind of looked like a,</v>

2010
01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.280
<v Speaker 2>like Jim Morrison,</v>

<v Speaker 2>definitely you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're not violent or very controlled.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're a lot more controlled than I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more of A.</v>

2086
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:20.920
<v Speaker 2>I lean towards the jungle phase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2087
01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.260
<v Speaker 2>my main thing is a Jago now yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger by the law,</v>

2088
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:27.163
<v Speaker 2>he's the one that took a sword and wipe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it on his chest with red and they asked </v>

2089
01:48:31.321 --> 01:48:32.690
<v Speaker 2>them why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2090
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:34.310
<v Speaker 2>did he liked to kill him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2091
01:48:34.311 --> 01:48:38.660
<v Speaker 2>because blood makes change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something stupid.</v>

2092
01:48:38.661 --> 01:48:41.300
<v Speaker 2>He really has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't practice that.</v>

2093
01:48:41.450 --> 01:48:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother was very calm,</v>

2094
01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:45.850
<v Speaker 2>but one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one guy goes,</v>

2095
01:48:45.930 --> 01:48:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Caesar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad ass.</v>

2096
01:48:47.841 --> 01:48:50.510
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker hit mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't mention your name,</v>

2097
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:53.090
<v Speaker 2>didn't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't need to mention that.</v>

2098
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.823
<v Speaker 2>Once they tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already know what they're talking </v>

2099
01:48:56.391 --> 01:48:57.224
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already know what they're talking </v>

2100
01:48:58.911 --> 01:49:01.190
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I still go get readings.</v>

2101
01:49:01.191 --> 01:49:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Like when I go to Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next time I go to my godmother.</v>

2102
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:04.640
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the reason.</v>

2103
01:49:04.641 --> 01:49:05.920
<v Speaker 2>One thing I might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still</v>

2104
01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.990
<v Speaker 1>follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason I still follow.</v>

2105
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.270
<v Speaker 1>You were asking me why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I would still follow it.</v>

2106
01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's because once you get to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the idea that there are</v>

2107
01:49:14.711 --> 01:49:19.711
<v Speaker 1>certain spirits within you and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orishas represent different spirits,</v>

2108
01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:23.470
<v Speaker 1>once you understand that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you throw away.</v>

2109
01:49:23.471 --> 01:49:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't follow the religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

2110
01:49:25.541 --> 01:49:27.880
<v Speaker 1>you still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have belief in that.</v>

2111
01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.020
<v Speaker 1>He's still believe in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my Orisha is Elegua.</v>

2112
01:49:32.050 --> 01:49:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Elegua is the saint e's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A trickster.</v>

2113
01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:36.063
<v Speaker 1>Elegua is a trickster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays little tricks and also the saint </v>

2114
01:49:39.281 --> 01:49:40.114
<v Speaker 1>of passages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people put elegua above their door </v>

2115
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:43.623
<v Speaker 1>because you're passing from one room </v>
<v Speaker 1>into another room and so you identify </v>

2116
01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 1>that spirit</v>

2117
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.670
<v Speaker 2>and that becomes part of your identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can whistle in the house.</v>

2118
01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you can't whistle in the house?</v>

2119
01:49:55.090 --> 01:49:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't listen.</v>

2120
01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:58.720
<v Speaker 2>You can go in the house because he'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>

2121
01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:03.820
<v Speaker 2>So you can't fuck them whistling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't whistle.</v>

2122
01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2123
01:50:05.261 --> 01:50:07.210
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd sit at the table and do.</v>

2124
01:50:07.730 --> 01:50:08.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't wait.</v>

2125
01:50:08.381 --> 01:50:09.214
<v Speaker 2>So my mom was go touch that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>table is gonna wake your fucking head </v>

2126
01:50:13.730 --> 01:50:18.550
<v Speaker 2>because God lives on the table now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

2127
01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:19.773
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made st to me like the one when I </v>

2128
01:50:23.381 --> 01:50:26.830
<v Speaker 2>made St Louis in November and they ended</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the Bronx River,</v>

2129
01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:27.933
<v Speaker 2>so they had to break the ice and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were dark skinned Cubans and I'll never </v>

2130
01:50:30.941 --> 01:50:31.774
<v Speaker 2>forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They rip your clothes off and then they </v>

2131
01:50:32.751 --> 01:50:36.340
<v Speaker 2>take whatever you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hit you with the number of water,</v>

2132
01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:37.753
<v Speaker 2>so if you're st is five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get hit with five things with water </v>

2133
01:50:40.450 --> 01:50:41.283
<v Speaker 2>and they dry you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're freezing and when I saw them </v>

2134
01:50:43.421 --> 01:50:45.580
<v Speaker 2>ripping my mother's clothes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was about five.</v>

2135
01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

2136
01:50:46.541 --> 01:50:50.050

<v Speaker 2>Bronx Boulevard.</v>

2137
01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:53.290
<v Speaker 2>They had to chase me and bring me back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to do it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Twelve hours long sleep and then Sunday </v>

2140

<v Speaker 2>nickel and I was allowed to wear the hat</v>

<v Speaker 2>not allowing for a year.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2230
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:56.900
<v Speaker 2>you believe there's something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I till the age of 11,</v>

2231
01:55:58.170 --> 01:56:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I thought there were a bunch of Hocus </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocus motherfuckers,</v>

2232
01:56:01.590 --> 01:56:05.010
<v Speaker 2>but there was a lady on 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixth and central and I grew up with her</v>

2233
01:56:05.011 --> 01:56:05.844
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her husband was that big book in on an </v>

2234
01:56:07.351 --> 01:56:08.184
<v Speaker 2>Eighteenth Street and once a month she </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed the spirit and people would go </v>

2235
01:56:11.671 --> 01:56:12.504
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 people who were invited and I could </v>

2236
01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:18.180
<v Speaker 2>tell this cop was eating away at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>

2237
01:56:18.330 --> 01:56:20.520
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother didn't lay down for nobody.</v>

2238
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:22.590
<v Speaker 2>My mother was going to shoot that </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker herself.</v>

2239
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:25.140
<v Speaker 2>She'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she was that type of Cuban woman.</v>

2240
01:56:25.141 --> 01:56:28.500
<v Speaker 2>She didn't like being spoken to that way</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see it in their face.</v>

2241
01:56:28.501 --> 01:56:33.030
<v Speaker 2>It was eating him alive and one night we</v>
<v Speaker 2>went over to this way or these party.</v>

2242
01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:36.720
<v Speaker 2>The first time I saw the lady drink a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle of fire water,</v>

2243
01:56:36.721 --> 01:56:37.554
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hundred and 40 proof Agua dam </v>

2244
01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:41.190
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

2245
01:56:41.191 --> 01:56:43.350
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is bullshit.</v>

2246
01:56:43.351 --> 01:56:46.500
<v Speaker 2>This is she MCS that bottle out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>daytime.</v>

2247
01:56:47.010 --> 01:56:47.843
<v Speaker 2>So at night I would watch her bottles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had the label like they were </v>

2248
01:56:50.251 --> 01:56:54.440
<v Speaker 2>sealed because I had my mother had a bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I knew if they were sealed in a pro,</v>

2249
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:59.470
<v Speaker 2>just women would pass the spirit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then tell you what to do and what not to</v>

2250
01:56:59.581 --> 01:57:00.360
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2251
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:03.050
<v Speaker 2>On this particular night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she went up to my mother.</v>

2252
01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:04.530
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what's bothering you.</v>

2253
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.210
<v Speaker 2>And she took a white dish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took a white dish.</v>

2254
01:57:09.211 --> 01:57:13.770
<v Speaker 2>That was just the way she took a candle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she turned it over and she went like</v>

2255
01:57:13.771 --> 01:57:16.080
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this circular motion on the camera.</v>

2256
01:57:16.110 --> 01:57:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I was 10 or 11 Joe Rogan at that time </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I believe I don't believe in Dick.</v>

2257
01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I didn't believe in Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't believe in Jesus.</v>

2258
01:57:24.451 --> 01:57:26.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a story they tell you.</v>

2259
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.863
<v Speaker 2>She flipped over the dish and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle with a guy that looked like a </v>

2260
01:57:31.291 --> 01:57:33.330
<v Speaker 2>beer and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was bothering you.</v>

2261
01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:35.250
<v Speaker 2>And my mother goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2262
01:57:35.251 --> 01:57:37.980
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she broke the dishes.</v>

2263
01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:39.240
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days,</v>

2264
01:57:39.241 --> 01:57:40.530
<v Speaker 2>they will never bother you again.</v>

2265
01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Four days later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go look it up.</v>

2266
01:57:44.850 --> 01:57:45.683
<v Speaker 2>Nikki Gerardo was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shot them a thousand fucking times </v>

2267
01:57:48.781 --> 01:57:51.810
<v Speaker 2>at a place called Rapido taxi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a front.</v>

2268
01:57:51.811 --> 01:57:55.770
<v Speaker 2>There was a taxi thing that was a front </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a cocaine.</v>

2269

01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:01.500
<v Speaker 2>They never had a customer that caps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to make a collection.</v>

2271
01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:03.950
<v Speaker 2>They were waiting for the one you told </v>
<v Speaker 2>me about you,</v>

2272
01:58:03.970 --> 01:58:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Geraldo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said they got the witness wasn't no</v>

<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>

2274

<v Speaker 2>Because he went by.</v>

2275
01:58:10.891 --> 01:58:11.724
<v Speaker 2>It's like if and you have partners and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also that come around and start </v>

2276
01:58:14.731 --> 01:58:18.210
<v Speaker 2>collecting from jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how corrupt the system.</v>

2277
01:58:18.211 --> 01:58:20.490
<v Speaker 2>And in the papers they said he died to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear all that.</v>

2278
01:58:20.491 --> 01:58:23.460
<v Speaker 2>He was shot by a street criminal and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was given her heroes.</v>

2279
01:58:23.490 --> 01:58:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Perio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2280
01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:28.630
<v Speaker 2>And Joey says he was shot by other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2281
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:30.710
<v Speaker 2>they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always knew the city.</v>

2282
01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:31.563
<v Speaker 2>Was that dirty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear this when you were doing </v>

2283
01:58:32.791 --> 01:58:33.541
<v Speaker 2>your research?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2284
01:58:33.541 --> 01:58:34.374
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I told him that he told me and I </v>

2285
01:58:36.601 --> 01:58:39.630
<v Speaker 2>did some research on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>found out that the guy,</v>

2286
01:58:40.170 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I read the public account of</v>

2287
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.690
<v Speaker 1>what happened and it was quite different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than what,</v>

2288
01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:44.853
<v Speaker 1>how joey describes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the cops and Charlotte because </v>

2289
01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:48.993
<v Speaker 1>he's taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I was saying before </v>

2290
01:58:50.091 --> 01:58:50.924
<v Speaker 1>about the what the story we see on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface and then the real story </v>

2291
01:58:54.561 --> 01:58:55.540
<v Speaker 1>underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2292
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I know all those stores don't like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>after that,</v>

2293
01:58:58.641 --> 01:58:59.474
<v Speaker 1>the political system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in his book he has a section where </v>

2294
01:59:03.501 --> 01:59:04.334
<v Speaker 1>you actually see battle go to the police</v>
<v Speaker 1>station and to make payoffs like that's </v>

2295
01:59:11.571 --> 01:59:13.430
<v Speaker 1>how easy it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2296
01:59:13.431 --> 01:59:15.820
<v Speaker 1>battle got arrested in north Bergen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my hometown.</v>

2297
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So I called one of my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go do some research on it.</v>

2298
01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:20.630
<v Speaker 1>They said they never even put the cops </v>
<v Speaker 1>on him.</v>

2299
01:59:23.050 --> 01:59:24.670
<v Speaker 1>He owned the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He owned the town,</v>

2300
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:28.480
<v Speaker 1>the mayor and the police chief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you all you need to say they both</v>

2301
01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:31.990
<v Speaker 1>went to prison eventually for taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>money from the gambling.</v>

2302
01:59:32.050 --> 01:59:32.883
<v Speaker 1>From.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:35.950
<v Speaker 1>No Mayor Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you got a minute.</v>

2304
01:59:36.370 --> 01:59:41.050
<v Speaker 1>No Man has ever left Hudson county.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not through prison,</v>

2305
01:59:41.710 --> 01:59:42.880
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the male,</v>

2306
01:59:42.881 --> 01:59:45.790
<v Speaker 1>the fact Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died because it was 800 pounds.</v>

2307
01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Every other man ends up in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My.</v>

2308
01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:53.710
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Mary Union city is up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption charges as we speak.</v>

2309
01:59:53.711 --> 01:59:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years later I read that.</v>

2310
01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I read that recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never stopped Joe Rogan.</v>

2311
01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It's never ever stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why when people tell me stories,</v>

2312
02:00:04.091 --> 02:00:04.924
<v Speaker 1>I wipe my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also this is when you say organized </v>

2313
02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>crime is diminished while we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about organized crime,</v>

2314
02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still there.</v>

2315
02:00:11.890 --> 02:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It's deeply rooted in the system in </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain jurisdictions and it's not going</v>

2316
02:00:16.531 --> 02:00:17.364
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>

2317
02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy to me that you got so </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply entrenched reading the story that</v>

2318
02:00:21.791 --> 02:00:22.624
<v Speaker 1>you started getting into Santa Maria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually until I was married to a </v>

2319
02:00:26.291 --> 02:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have a center.</v>

2320
02:00:30.330 --> 02:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It's called my coma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's different about their.</v>

2321
02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>It's almost exactly the same and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all the same saints.</v>

2322
02:00:36.190 --> 02:00:37.023
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing because the slave trade came </v>

2323
02:00:38.591 --> 02:00:40.150
<v Speaker 1>through Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

2324
02:00:40.330 --> 02:00:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism mixing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2325
02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music is different with the Cubans.</v>

2326
02:00:45.941 --> 02:00:46.774
<v Speaker 1>It's a Roomba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this wonderful room by music that </v>

2327
02:00:49.001 --> 02:00:49.834
<v Speaker 1>you hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole bunch of great music </v>

2328
02:00:52.211 --> 02:00:53.044
<v Speaker 1>that grows up around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were married to a Brazilian </v>

2329
02:00:54.641 --> 02:00:55.474
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get divorced to keep the religion </v>

2330
02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>because that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2331
02:01:00.490 --> 02:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2332
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.273
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go to places like Cuba and </v>

2333
02:01:04.691 --> 02:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Brazil because I get so influenced and </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by it.</v>

2334
02:01:08.621 --> 02:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>It changes the direction my life really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Brazil for the first full day.</v>

2335
02:01:13.331 --> 02:01:14.164
<v Speaker 1>I was in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fell in love with the woman that I </v>

2336
02:01:16.871 --> 02:01:18.940
<v Speaker 1>married and lived with for the next 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2337
02:01:19.150 --> 02:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I go to Cuba,</v>

2338
02:01:21.970 --> 02:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous to me because I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>seduced by it.</v>

2339
02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm so intoxicated by Havana.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2379

02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>for extended periods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this book was almost like a sequel to</v>

2383
02:03:59.621 --> 02:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2384
02:03:59.830 --> 02:04:00.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a nice way to revisit that </v>

2385
02:04:01.991 --> 02:04:06.380
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pick up the thread of that story because</v>

2386
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>this one is sort of an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to the end and a Havana nocturne</v>

2387
02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>and you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then what happened?</v>

2388
02:04:12.431 --> 02:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>What happened after the mafia got chased</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of Cuba?</v>

2389
02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:17.550
<v Speaker 1>What was their response?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did they take it?</v>

2390
02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Cuban dancing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's the name of the watch?</v>

2392
02:04:26.231 --> 02:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>To see how everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 5>occasionally.</v>

2419

<v Speaker 5>See like he's grabbing it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just playing with it.</v>

2424
02:06:08.850 --> 02:06:11.670
<v Speaker 5>Flirtatious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is the culture there.</v>

2427
02:06:13.630 --> 02:06:14.463
<v Speaker 2>And Five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in a building in Fort Lee and </v>

2428
02:06:16.661 --> 02:06:21.661
<v Speaker 2>there was a Panamanian woman and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>told me that she went to Cuba twice as a</v>

2429
02:06:21.671 --> 02:06:24.940
<v Speaker 2>young girl and she wasn't surprised what</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going on in Cuba.</v>

2430
02:06:24.941 --> 02:06:27.880
<v Speaker 2>That was God's punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

2431
02:06:27.881 --> 02:06:32.881
<v Speaker 2>it was such a disgusting fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it was weird.</v>

2432
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Couple of days after I'm talking to Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2433
02:06:37.190 --> 02:06:38.023
<v Speaker 2>somebody on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a joke for my CSO special about </v>

2434
02:06:40.541 --> 02:06:43.110
<v Speaker 2>club 38.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The owner name was Willie Vandy,</v>

2435
02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:44.553
<v Speaker 2>and his claim to fame was that his </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather had the biggest dick in </v>

2436
02:06:46.931 --> 02:06:47.764
<v Speaker 2>Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up with two kids that her claim </v>

2437
02:06:49.821 --> 02:06:50.860
<v Speaker 2>to fame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them,</v>

2438
02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:55.360
<v Speaker 2>his dad was the best pool player in Cuba</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Americans will go down and he'd beat</v>

2439
02:06:55.361 --> 02:06:56.194
<v Speaker 2>the fuck out of him and pull you play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They played Chicago eight ball whenever </v>

2440
02:07:00.190 --> 02:07:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other.</v>

2441
02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:05.560
<v Speaker 2>His claim to fame was that his </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather was the guy in godfather two</v>

2442
02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:07.053
<v Speaker 2>who had the big Dick and they called him</v>
<v Speaker 2>superman and on Saturday nights at club </v>

2443
02:07:11.531 --> 02:07:14.920
<v Speaker 2>38 in union city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would on Saturdays,</v>

2444
02:07:14.921 --> 02:07:19.921
<v Speaker 2>he recreated and he had people come down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it'd be like a comedy show.</v>

2445
02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:21.093
<v Speaker 2>$10 ticket in 200 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would get some out chick tire up to </v>

2446
02:07:25.271 --> 02:07:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Cubans like that would play the congas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he come out and fuck the lady and</v>

2447
02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:35.050
<v Speaker 5>go crazy with the biggest dick in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world and my job fucker in public.</v>

2448
02:07:35.351 --> 02:07:36.530
<v Speaker 5>That was the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2449
02:07:36.970 --> 02:07:37.450
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

2450
02:07:37.450 --> 02:07:38.283
<v Speaker 5>That was a public fuck show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it went all the way back to Cuba to </v>

2451
02:07:41.531 --> 02:07:46.010
<v Speaker 5>like 55,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the name of the place was Shanghai,</v>

2452
02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:50.950
<v Speaker 5>the Shanghai Theater,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Godfather to Michael takes.</v>

2453
02:07:50.951 --> 02:07:52.930
<v Speaker 5>They take Michael there and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sudden he goes,</v>

2454
02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:55.990
<v Speaker 5>I would have never found this place if </v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't for Johnny Ola.</v>

2455
02:07:55.991 --> 02:07:59.320
<v Speaker 5>And that's when Michael finds out that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he betrayed them.</v>

2456
02:07:59.321 --> 02:08:01.570
<v Speaker 5>So they don't show the guys that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>been simpler.</v>

2457
02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:02.493
<v Speaker 5>If the guy with the big Dick was also </v>
<v Speaker 5>the greatest pool player because he </v>

2458
02:08:05.201 --> 02:08:06.330
<v Speaker 5>could just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2459
02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:10.690
<v Speaker 5>that would have been perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they did this article about two weeks</v>

2460
02:08:10.691 --> 02:08:11.524
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's on my facebook and it's called in </v>

2461
02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:13.684
<v Speaker 5>search of Superman Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the most disgusting article </v>

2462
02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:18.853
<v Speaker 5>rather than my life that these white </v>
<v Speaker 5>dudes went on a 50 year looking for </v>

2463

2467
02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:32.913
<v Speaker 5>just to see where it was and what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>story is that us as Americans will go </v>

2468
02:08:36.801 --> 02:08:37.634
<v Speaker 5>down to every week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was our first time to see this </v>

2469
02:08:40.511 --> 02:08:41.344
<v Speaker 5>big black Cuban dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck the shit out of some poor white </v>

2471
02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:48.400

<v Speaker 5>The place was sold out every night.</v>

2472
02:08:48.401 --> 02:08:49.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy was a gardener.</v>

2473
02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:52.600
<v Speaker 5>The article is sensational if you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>find it.</v>

2474
02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:58.020
<v Speaker 5>It's called in search of Superman and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they is it better than superman.</v>

2475
02:08:59.290 --> 02:09:03.100
<v Speaker 5>But when it came out the same week that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

2476
02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:05.020
<v Speaker 5>what are you fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They ain't no fake.</v>

2477
02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:07.210
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they call him superman.</v>

2478
02:09:07.211 --> 02:09:08.690
<v Speaker 5>Afraid of the know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw.</v>

2479
02:09:08.710 --> 02:09:13.120
<v Speaker 5>I saw a video of Superman when I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>researching Havana Nocturne.</v>

2480
02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:14.433
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I found out that Santo traffic content </v>

2481
02:09:17.501 --> 02:09:20.530
<v Speaker 5>had a lawyer named Samara Ghana since </v>
<v Speaker 5>deceased.</v>

2482
02:09:21.090 --> 02:09:21.923
<v Speaker 5>But Samara,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ghana used to take a lot of super eight </v>

2483
02:09:23.351 --> 02:09:26.260
<v Speaker 5>videos when he'd go down to Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His son,</v>

2484
02:09:26.290 --> 02:09:27.123
<v Speaker 5>who's currently a lawyer in Tampa told </v>
<v Speaker 5>me that he had super eight footage of </v>

2485
02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:34.780
<v Speaker 5>superman that his father had made in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fifties,</v>

2486
02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:38.890
<v Speaker 5>superman at a private sex show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking a girl.</v>

2487
02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:40.030
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2488
02:09:40.210 --> 02:09:41.710
<v Speaker 5>I got to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could I see that?</v>

2489
02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:42.603
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the only existing video </v>

2490
02:09:44.501 --> 02:09:47.080
<v Speaker 5>footage anywhere of Superman and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

2491
02:09:47.081 --> 02:09:48.730
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not going to give it up.</v>

2492
02:09:48.731 --> 02:09:51.520
<v Speaker 5>You've got to come to Tampa and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>show it for you.</v>

2493
02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:54.280
<v Speaker 5>So I go down there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll never forget.</v>

2494
02:09:54.281 --> 02:09:55.114
<v Speaker 5>He's a lawyer too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says you got to come at 6:00 after </v>

2495
02:09:56.801 --> 02:09:57.634
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>After the office closes so then we can </v>

2496
02:09:59.501 --> 02:10:03.730
<v Speaker 5>watch it and I get there and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cleaning lady is still there,</v>

2497
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:06.600
<v Speaker 5>so he brings me into the conference room</v>
<v Speaker 5>where he's going to show me the family.</v>

2498
02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:07.473
<v Speaker 5>We got to sit there and wait until the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cleaning lady's done because he didn't </v>

2499
02:10:09.971 --> 02:10:12.970
<v Speaker 5>want to put this film all the while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The cleaning ladies in the room,</v>

2500
02:10:13.570 --> 02:10:14.403
<v Speaker 5>so he puts it on the plate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stuff is completely empty and he shows </v>

2501
02:10:18.431 --> 02:10:19.264
<v Speaker 5>me this footage and his father had </v>
<v Speaker 5>scored it to like Wagner or beethoven </v>

2502
02:10:24.221 --> 02:10:26.980
<v Speaker 5>like triumph and classical music and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

2503
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.620
<v Speaker 5>It's at a private show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's in somebody's home.</v>

2504
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:30.843
<v Speaker 5>They had private sex salons in Havana </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you'd go to like some rich </v>

2505
02:10:33.171 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 5>person's house.</v>

2506
02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:37.400
<v Speaker 1>You'd pay some money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had cocktails,</v>

2507
02:10:37.550 --> 02:10:38.383
<v Speaker 1>and then someone had clap at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and you knew that was time for the </v>

2508
02:10:40.371 --> 02:10:45.260
<v Speaker 1>show and everyone would sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>superman would come out and he,</v>

2509
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:46.310
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucked this,</v>

2510
02:10:46.311 --> 02:10:49.670
<v Speaker 1>a Cuban woman who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was small,</v>

2511
02:10:49.671 --> 02:10:50.504
<v Speaker 1>he was begging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was small and he's banging her from </v>

2512
02:10:52.881 --> 02:10:53.714
<v Speaker 1>every conceivable angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the least sexy thing you've ever </v>

2513
02:10:57.321 --> 02:10:58.490
<v Speaker 1>seen in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2514
02:10:58.491 --> 02:10:59.324
<v Speaker 1>it looked like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like some kind of torture </v>

2515
02:11:02.130 --> 02:11:03.640
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2516
02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:06.110
<v Speaker 1>and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy had this footage,</v>

2517
02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:10.160
<v Speaker 1>which is probably worth a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big was the Dick.</v>

2518
02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:11.360
<v Speaker 1>The Dick was big.</v>

2519
02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:15.230
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2520
02:11:15.231 --> 02:11:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I say that because it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a,</v>

2521
02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:21.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure it was even the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick I've ever seen.</v>

2522
02:11:21.770 --> 02:11:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was bigger than my dad's.</v>

2523
02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Bigger than normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bigger than the guys today.</v>

2524
02:11:25.821 --> 02:11:30.470
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you go back and look at when Jim</v>

2525
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Brown was playing football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very impressive.</v>

2526
02:11:32.181 --> 02:11:34.250
<v Speaker 1>But was he Herschel Walker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2527
02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Like athletes have today's era or </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2528
02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:39.290
<v Speaker 1>And if you go back and look at John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holmes,</v>

2529
02:11:39.291 --> 02:11:40.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a big Dick,</v>

2530
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:43.070
<v Speaker 1>but was it Lexington steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2531
02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:43.933
<v Speaker 1>like these guys have bigger dicks now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the people on the board vets people </v>

2532
02:11:47.961 --> 02:11:48.794
<v Speaker 1>are growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that freaked me out of the </v>

2533
02:11:50.631 --> 02:11:55.631
<v Speaker 1>human species is advancing fancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then that about Santo that I enjoyed</v>

2534
02:11:56.811 --> 02:12:01.340
<v Speaker 1>from your first book event in October </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted to tell Joe to stories that</v>

2535
02:12:01.341 --> 02:12:06.341
<v Speaker 1>one time Kennedy went to cast a Cuba as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a senator and they were having some type</v>

2536
02:12:06.441 --> 02:12:10.680
<v Speaker 1>of meeting but fucking Kennedy can focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2537
02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:13.573
<v Speaker 1>And that they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with him in St </v>

2538
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Louis for Cathy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what's wrong.</v>

2539
02:12:17.210 --> 02:12:18.043
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they tapped him on the shoulder and </v>

2540
02:12:19.581 --> 02:12:20.414
<v Speaker 1>they bring them in a room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's embellishing this a little is </v>

2541
02:12:24.590 --> 02:12:25.423
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I remember I read and that </v>

2542
02:12:27.650 --> 02:12:28.483
<v Speaker 1>I guess Santo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sic them onto women candidates </v>

2543
02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:32.030
<v Speaker 1>while he set up a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They filmed it.</v>

2544
02:12:32.130 --> 02:12:34.250
<v Speaker 1>He said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't film it.</v>

2545
02:12:34.850 --> 02:12:36.770
<v Speaker 1>They wish they wish they had filmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2546
02:12:36.771 --> 02:12:37.604
<v Speaker 1>They said they set him up in a room with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a two way mirror and they watched it </v>

2547
02:12:40.731 --> 02:12:42.620
<v Speaker 1>happening and then one of them turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other and said,</v>

2548
02:12:42.621 --> 02:12:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should've filmed this.</v>

2549
02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.980
<v Speaker 1>This would make great blackmail </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

2550
02:12:46.010 --> 02:12:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2551
02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Santo is kind of a freak.</v>

2552
02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>JFK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freakiest the freaks,</v>

2553
02:12:53.501 --> 02:12:54.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2554
02:12:54.210 --> 02:12:55.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to keep in mind he wasn't </v>

2555
02:12:56.151 --> 02:12:57.920
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a young senator.</v>

2556
02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:58.903
<v Speaker 1>He used to get this senator from Florida</v>
<v Speaker 1>named George Smathers and the two of </v>

2557
02:13:02.811 --> 02:13:06.560
<v Speaker 1>them would go down to Havana and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was around 1955,</v>

2558
02:13:06.570 --> 02:13:09.740
<v Speaker 1>56 when the whole thing was in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>heyday.</v>

2559
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:12.350
<v Speaker 1>And that was a big part of a van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2560
02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:16.280
<v Speaker 1>politicians and businessmen with going </v>
<v Speaker 1>junkets to Havana,</v>

2561
02:13:16.281 --> 02:13:17.114
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2562
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:20.360

2563
02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:21.373
<v Speaker 1>go to Havana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd go to the Shanghai theater </v>

2564
02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:26.210
<v Speaker 1>and they have Tris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual Triste,</v>

2565
02:13:26.211 --> 02:13:28.580
<v Speaker 1>and they'd go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was out of sight,</v>

2566
02:13:28.581 --> 02:13:30.470
<v Speaker 1>out of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the original,</v>

2567

<v Speaker 5>with Santa traffic content in Meyer </v>
<v Speaker 5>Lansky and they loved it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't.</v>

2573
02:13:43.261 --> 02:13:45.300
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't do them any damage back </v>
<v Speaker 5>home.</v>

2574
02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:46.830
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2575
02:13:46.831 --> 02:13:47.664

<v Speaker 2>and whenever I did something like if I </v>

<v Speaker 2>a little girl,</v>

2596
02:14:46.670 --> 02:14:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Rock Katrina would come to Cuba and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would all go to the hotel.</v>

2597
02:14:49.181 --> 02:14:50.940
<v Speaker 2>You like when Michael Jackson goes to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We would be out there like waiting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see rock coaching.</v>

2600
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:58.583
<v Speaker 2>But the hotel guy would tell us he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>up there in a room with a man and I </v>

2601

<v Speaker 5>Did your mother know that the Marlon </v>
<v Speaker 5>Brando was fucking Richard Pryor?</v>

2607
02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:18.630

<v Speaker 2>I found out from this article,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Now it's diluted so much.</v>

2748
02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:53.640
<v Speaker 2>It's been diluted over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I met Juan and Leo,</v>

2749
02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:58.400
<v Speaker 2>they were two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ob was a Taco tico or Latin band,</v>

2750
02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:01.060
<v Speaker 2>not the cube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the Conga player,</v>

2751
02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:03.180
<v Speaker 2>the singer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was about quarterly.</v>

2752
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:05.600
<v Speaker 2>So if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

2753
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:08.870
<v Speaker 2>there was a code way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've very manly code.</v>

2754

<v Speaker 2>I come over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a gay man and he I call you out </v>

2755
02:22:11.841 --> 02:22:13.090
<v Speaker 2>of the room like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:15.320
<v Speaker 2>do me a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get that motherfucker out of the room.</v>

2757
02:22:15.321 --> 02:22:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Or if not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't talk to them.</v>

2758
02:22:17.751 --> 02:22:18.584
<v Speaker 2>You can approach them a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba experienced a lot of progressive </v>

2759
02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:23.650
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is it.</v>

2760
02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>If they changed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very progressive</v>

2761
02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:27.553
<v Speaker 5>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's caused this because they really </v>

2762
02:22:30.130 --> 02:22:34.710
<v Speaker 5>didn't progress changing thing from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2763
02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:37.560
<v Speaker 5>but their progress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they are so isolated.</v>

2764
02:22:37.890 --> 02:22:39.270
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2765
02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:40.430
<v Speaker 5>They don't have the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2766
02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:41.453
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think certain places and they're </v>

2767
02:22:42.131 --> 02:22:44.070
<v Speaker 5>getting it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think certain places.</v>

2768
02:22:44.071 --> 02:22:45.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can get it here and there.</v>

2769
02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:46.673
<v Speaker 5>It's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's frustrating when you go there </v>

2770
02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:49.493
<v Speaker 5>because he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's what's Nice is you go to Havana </v>

2771
02:22:51.571 --> 02:22:55.560
<v Speaker 5>and you kind of disengage from modern </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology.</v>

2772
02:22:55.561 --> 02:22:56.394
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you couldn't live there because </v>

2773
02:22:57.901 --> 02:23:02.490
<v Speaker 5>he can't really do business there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you just kind of disengaged from.</v>

2774
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:05.940
<v Speaker 5>And is it easy to travel there now as </v>
<v Speaker 5>far as flights in America?</v>

2775
02:23:06.210 --> 02:23:10.590
<v Speaker 5>Just legal like a motherfucker like </v>
<v Speaker 5>hilarious.</v>

2776
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:13.480
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you had a Cuban cigar,</v>

2777
02:23:13.481 --> 02:23:17.220
<v Speaker 5>I was like a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't tell anybody we got Cubans.</v>

2778
02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Well that's still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's still illegal.</v>

2779
02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:23.220
<v Speaker 5>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the embargo still exists.</v>

2780
02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:24.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you could have some cigars.</v>

2781
02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:26.520
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to have some Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigars.</v>

2782
02:23:26.521 --> 02:23:28.110
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ever see if you,</v>

2783
02:23:28.111 --> 02:23:29.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the amount of.</v>

2784
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:32.730
<v Speaker 5>I think you're allowed to have like 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't bring them back.</v>

2785
02:23:32.731 --> 02:23:33.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2786
02:23:33.340 --> 02:23:34.173
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't sell them here or if you can </v>

2787
02:23:35.911 --> 02:23:37.260
<v Speaker 5>sell them here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't sell a lot.</v>

2788
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:41.660
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm happy rose's book because a,</v>

2789
02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:44.010
<v Speaker 5>I knew the story was out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

2790
02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:45.750
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we haven't even touched.</v>

2791
02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:50.250
<v Speaker 5>Like I was raised by Omega seven guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he grew up with my father.</v>

2792
02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:51.893
<v Speaker 5>So I told Joey when I first met him and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was sort of almost done with this </v>

2793
02:23:56.131 --> 02:23:56.964
<v Speaker 5>book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2794
02:23:58.770 --> 02:24:00.180
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you read it,</v>

2795
02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:03.000
<v Speaker 5>you're going to need to sit down because</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a guy like him,</v>

2796
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:09.180
<v Speaker 5>he knew a lot and I knew he would come </v>
<v Speaker 5>across names that he knew,</v>

2797
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.823
<v Speaker 5>but there's no way you could have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>part of this and known the whole thing </v>

2798
02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:14.513
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

2799
02:24:14.610 --> 02:24:16.120
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>

2800
02:24:16.121 --> 02:24:18.030
<v Speaker 5>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you knew who he was.</v>

2801
02:24:18.031 --> 02:24:18.864
<v Speaker 5>You knew he was back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't know it was a professional </v>

2802
02:24:21.151 --> 02:24:24.180
<v Speaker 5>assassin for Omega seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew todd that you killed.</v>

2803
02:24:24.181 --> 02:24:26.250
<v Speaker 5>My mother warned me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My mother used to go,</v>

2804
02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:27.353
<v Speaker 5>when he picks you up at school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>please don't get in the car with them </v>

2805
02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:31.680
<v Speaker 5>because it's going to get shot one day </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't want to interrupt people.</v>

2806
02:24:31.681 --> 02:24:34.440
<v Speaker 5>New Battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they knew some things about him,</v>

2807
02:24:34.470 --> 02:24:36.840
<v Speaker 5>but they didn't know no one who was part</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

2808
02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:40.000
<v Speaker 5>They thought they knew the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no way you couldn't.</v>

2809
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:43.650
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It blew my fucking mind.</v>

2810
02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:44.723
<v Speaker 5>I went to a dance with my daughter and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>came home and the book was waiting for </v>

2811
02:24:46.831 --> 02:24:47.850
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2812
02:24:47.851 --> 02:24:48.684
<v Speaker 5>Amazon drops it off in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house and they had ripped it and there </v>

2813
02:24:51.541 --> 02:24:55.350
<v Speaker 5>was other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other moms with my wife and I don't like</v>

2814
02:24:55.351 --> 02:24:57.780
<v Speaker 5>to do put it in my office.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to open that.</v>

2815
02:24:57.930 --> 02:25:02.930
<v Speaker 5>I saw Dorothy and Mancini and my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>knee dropped like it had hit me.</v>

2816
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:07.650
<v Speaker 5>He kept texting me as you were reading </v>
<v Speaker 5>at 12:00 at night and I go,</v>

2817
02:25:07.651 --> 02:25:08.484
<v Speaker 5>you have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't know that this guy used to </v>

2818
02:25:11.971 --> 02:25:14.730
<v Speaker 5>go away every six months and his wife </v>
<v Speaker 5>was tight.</v>

2819
02:25:14.970 --> 02:25:18.110
<v Speaker 5>You know the story I told you about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My mom would play cards and then I would</v>

2820
02:25:18.111 --> 02:25:18.944
<v Speaker 5>put tidy whities honors dance for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>women of shots of Tequila and make me </v>

2821
02:25:22.051 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 5>dance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nina was in that</v>

2822
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:26.200
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nina is in that book.</v>

2823
02:25:26.201 --> 02:25:28.420
<v Speaker 2>When my mother died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave Nina my dog.</v>

2824
02:25:28.421 --> 02:25:29.254
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't take that dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I used to go to Nina's house on 51st </v>

2825
02:25:32.021 --> 02:25:35.530
<v Speaker 2>street and cry in the dog house like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my dog.</v>

2826
02:25:35.650 --> 02:25:36.483
<v Speaker 2>So soon as I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew he was onto something because </v>

2827
02:25:40.091 --> 02:25:44.230
<v Speaker 2>dorothy was my father's friend and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was type of guy that would come visit me</v>

2828
02:25:44.231 --> 02:25:49.231
<v Speaker 2>every week just because he was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>father's friend and give me 50 bucks and</v>

2829
02:25:49.241 --> 02:25:53.110
<v Speaker 2>take me to the city and get haircuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his claim to fame was in the seventh</v>

2830
02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:54.340
<v Speaker 2>grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother told him,</v>

2831
02:25:54.341 --> 02:25:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm going to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2832
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:58.330
<v Speaker 2>He's got some fucking girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won't even talk to me.</v>

2833
02:25:58.690 --> 02:25:59.523
<v Speaker 2>This guy came to my house and gave me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>capsule and right in front of me he </v>

2834
02:26:02.711 --> 02:26:04.570
<v Speaker 2>filled it up with coke and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you something.</v>

2835
02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Seventh grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventh grade,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the back of my nightstand,</v>

<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2844
02:26:27.150 --> 02:26:30.460

<v Speaker 2>But that guy,</v>

2850

<v Speaker 2>when I was in the seventh grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave me a capsule of wow and said put it</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like that's how that meant that he was</v>

2852
02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:58.113
<v Speaker 1>the text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember getting from you as you were </v>

2853
02:26:59.621 --> 02:27:01.930
<v Speaker 1>reading the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting every,</v>

2854
02:27:01.931 --> 02:27:02.764
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every 30 minutes or so I'd get a text </v>

<v Speaker 1>can't believe you have this name.</v>

2856
02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:08.253
<v Speaker 1>Finally the last one was the texts said </v>
<v Speaker 1>Naynay Cordero with an exclamation mark </v>

2857
02:27:12.761 --> 02:27:15.670

<v Speaker 1>you bad motherfucker.</v>

2858
02:27:16.770 --> 02:27:18.760
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't believe some of the names </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were in there.</v>

2859
02:27:18.761 --> 02:27:21.130
<v Speaker 1>And I know that he must have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>

2860
02:27:21.131 --> 02:27:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be tonight.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Amea Alito,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Miguelito.</v>

<v Speaker 2>People used to goof on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a pigeon toe and they would go on</v>

<v Speaker 2>but he had a Puerto Rican white,</v>

2869

<v Speaker 2>as Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2878

<v Speaker 2>Like there's no cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that today.</v>

2880
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about.</v>

2881

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2882
02:28:17.401 --> 02:28:17.781
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2883
02:28:17.781 --> 02:28:18.614
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was the seventies when still </v>

2884
02:28:20.131 --> 02:28:22.170
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2885
02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:25.670
<v Speaker 5>They robbed from fucking everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just went.</v>

2886
02:28:25.671 --> 02:28:26.504
<v Speaker 5>I went home last week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was problems with Doug Burgum </v>

2887
02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:30.290
<v Speaker 5>right when I was home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I stayed in edgewater,</v>

2888
02:28:30.291 --> 02:28:33.050
<v Speaker 5>so I didn't even go up there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the book came out,</v>

2889
02:28:33.051 --> 02:28:36.300
<v Speaker 5>I got a call from battles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Long time lawyer,</v>

2890
02:28:36.301 --> 02:28:38.300
<v Speaker 5>a guy named Jack Blumenfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wonderful Guy.</v>

2891
02:28:38.310 --> 02:28:40.190
<v Speaker 5>Interviewed him numerous times for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>book,</v>

2892
02:28:40.370 --> 02:28:41.203
<v Speaker 5>new battle as well as anybody a defended</v>
<v Speaker 5>him in a number of different cases over </v>

2893
02:28:45.951 --> 02:28:48.140
<v Speaker 5>the years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew a lot about him.</v>

2894
02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:50.810
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sent the book to him.</v>

2895
02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:53.510
<v Speaker 5>He called me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know him that well,</v>

2896
02:28:53.511 --> 02:28:54.344
<v Speaker 5>so he was a little stiff and first we </v>
<v Speaker 5>corrected some factual things in the </v>

2897
02:28:58.371 --> 02:29:00.860
<v Speaker 5>manuscript and then he got real quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2898
02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:02.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was very,</v>

2899
02:29:02.361 --> 02:29:05.420
<v Speaker 5>it was very emotional for me to read </v>
<v Speaker 5>this book.</v>

2900
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:06.283
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause just all kinds of things kept </v>

2901
02:29:08.691 --> 02:29:09.524
<v Speaker 5>flooding back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would use a name or you describe an </v>

2902
02:29:11.841 --> 02:29:14.810
<v Speaker 5>incident and all of a sudden it would </v>
<v Speaker 5>flood my memory.</v>

2903
02:29:14.810 --> 02:29:16.910
<v Speaker 5>Same thing that was happening to you </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you read it,</v>

2904
02:29:17.430 --> 02:29:19.430
<v Speaker 5>the little detail would go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

2905
02:29:19.431 --> 02:29:23.090
<v Speaker 5>it was almost like an outer body </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience and that's the power.</v>

2906
02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:24.520
<v Speaker 5>That's the power of literature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2907
02:29:25.010 --> 02:29:25.843
<v Speaker 5>That's the power of like losing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a book to where it engages your </v>

2908
02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:33.480
<v Speaker 5>memory and your imagination that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost reliving it as you're reading and</v>

2909
02:29:33.481 --> 02:29:36.140
<v Speaker 5>you talk about 39 slash 11 Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 5>Boulevard,</v>

2910
02:29:36.141 --> 02:29:40.190
<v Speaker 5>the home of Charlie's project,</v>
<v Speaker 5>only basketball games.</v>

2911
02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:41.233
<v Speaker 5>I went into those projects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to go there at seven in the </v>

2912
02:29:42.771 --> 02:29:46.430
<v Speaker 5>morning and shoot 300 jump shots because</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'd be nobody there.</v>

2913
02:29:47.210 --> 02:29:50.540
<v Speaker 5>So imagine you're reading a book and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>come across that address in.</v>

2914
02:29:50.541 --> 02:29:54.080
<v Speaker 5>It reminds you of what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was down the block,</v>

2915
02:29:54.140 --> 02:29:54.973
<v Speaker 5>up the block,</v>
<v Speaker 5>down the block was a bond named Bernice </v>

2916
02:29:56.690 --> 02:29:59.460
<v Speaker 5>in north Bergen for years or you have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

2917
02:29:59.460 --> 02:30:01.160
<v Speaker 5>You ran out of beer at five in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>morning.</v>

2918
02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:05.120
<v Speaker 5>You went to earnings and you're pounding</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the door and they would go,</v>

2919
02:30:05.121 --> 02:30:06.290
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want?</v>

2920

<v Speaker 5>Three,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I right,</v>

2923
02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:10.873
<v Speaker 5>you should have said so what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you getting emotional for you can </v>

2924
02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:14.473
<v Speaker 5>be testing already would sell you </v>
<v Speaker 5>business and there was the coldest beer </v>

2925
02:30:17.421 --> 02:30:18.254
<v Speaker 5>in town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was his reputation when we were in </v>

2926
02:30:20.901 --> 02:30:22.970
<v Speaker 5>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five in the morning early.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but I grew up in those projects.</v>

<v Speaker 5>to play basketball with him and Ernie </v>

2932
02:30:39.201 --> 02:30:42.220
<v Speaker 5>was probably a personal friend of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mayor's already.</v>

2933

<v Speaker 5>about who was running north Bergen at </v>

<v Speaker 5>I got a little short job.</v>

2945
02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:17.503
<v Speaker 5>I remember having a no show job in Irish</v>
<v Speaker 5>man when I was like in the seventh </v>

2946
