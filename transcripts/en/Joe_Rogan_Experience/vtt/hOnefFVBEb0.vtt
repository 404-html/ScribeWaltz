00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the yes.</v>

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>We live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Pause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold.</v>

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of a struggle.</v>

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're live.</v>

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>You're a wheeler walker jr fantasy.</v>

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

10
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.413
<v Speaker 2>maybe I will be.</v>

11
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>You will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never heard of him before?</v>

12
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I confess.</v>

13
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.350
<v Speaker 1>so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

15
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>

16
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 1>What is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

18
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess is the best way to get this</v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>What is it like being a person that grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the Westboro Baptist Church?</v>

20
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>For a person on the outside?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

21
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think of that I think of like</v>

22
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.820
<v Speaker 1>this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hateful,</v>

23
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.100
<v Speaker 1>angry environment filled with like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really mean people that say horrible</v>

24
00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:00.920
<v Speaker 1>things about gay people and all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other folks that I meet you and you're</v>

25
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:02.900
<v Speaker 1>super nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems so normal.</v>

26
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 2>That is the conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean a lot of the things,</v>

27
00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:08.590
<v Speaker 2>the words that you just used to describe</v>
<v Speaker 2>the church,</v>

28
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely not how I experienced</v>
<v Speaker 2>it growing up for the most part.</v>

29
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean my family outside of when they're</v>

30
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 2>out on the picket line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their immune incredibly kind and gentle</v>

31
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and compassionate.</v>

32
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think the biggest misconception</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the churches that they're</v>

33
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:30.631
<v Speaker 2>motivated by hatred and in their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the definition of loving what we</v>

34
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 2>really thought we were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we were doing was loving our</v>

35
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 2>neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first time that phrase appears in</v>

36
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 2>the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the context of when you see your</v>

37
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:41.290
<v Speaker 2>neighbor sending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to rebuke him,</v>

38
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 2>not just like watch him wander off on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way to hell.</v>

39
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 2>So that was how we saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thought we were warning people in and</v>

40
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 2>giving them the only hopeful message</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could save them from eternity in</v>

41
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

42
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Was there ever any dissent amongst the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that were in the church about</v>

43
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:59.270
<v Speaker 1>like how the message is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

44
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're holding up a sign that</v>
<v Speaker 1>says God hates fags,</v>

45
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.010
<v Speaker 1>a gay guy who was being buried at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>funeral and you guys were there</v>

47
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>protesting with those signs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who's ever anyone inside the</v>

48
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:12.920
<v Speaker 1>organization that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

49
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>this is not the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are suffering.</v>

50
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:17.084
<v Speaker 1>And morning,</v>

51
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

52
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once my grandfather,</v>

53
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

54
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 2>if he was the one who kind of developed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that strategy,</v>

55
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:26.300
<v Speaker 2>he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

56
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

57
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Speaker 2>the example is for funerals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody,</v>

58
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 2>if they're burying somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

59
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 2>so a soldier say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a gay person,</v>

60
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an example of the curses of God.</v>

61
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.250
<v Speaker 2>So God says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you obey me,</v>

62
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll bless you and if you disobeyed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all cursio.</v>

63
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 2>So why soldiers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So several times in the scriptures,</v>

64
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.770
<v Speaker 2>it's this connection between the sins of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nation and,</v>

65
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

66
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.560
<v Speaker 2>the punishments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>

67
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 2>in the book of judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says they chose new gods then was war</v>

68
00:02:58.071 --> 00:02:59.730
<v Speaker 2>in their gates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

69
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.900
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

70
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 2>in the books of the Kings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says they,</v>

71
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

72
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 2>there fell down many slain because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>war was of God.</v>

73
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 2>And then in the book of Hosea it says</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have deeply corrupted themselves.</v>

74
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Therefore I will remember their iniquity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I will visit their sentence,</v>

75
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 2>though they bring up their children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet will I buried them?</v>

76
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 2>There shall not be a man left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's these,</v>

77
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 2>these threatenings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these warnings from God that if you</v>

78
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 2>disobeyed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to curse you.</v>

79
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>So we would go to these soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these soldiers funerals to warn the</v>

80
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:30.780
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that if,</v>

81
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want to be likewise</v>

82
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 2>punished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to repent.</v>

83
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 2>You have to change your ways and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and obey God.</v>

84
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 2>No</v>

85
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>people that are also hardcore</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians,</v>

86
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also follow the word of God very</v>

87
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>closely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still would see like what you guys</v>

88
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>were doing at these funerals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding up these signs,</v>

89
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>protesting were a soldier who supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave his life for our freedom,</v>

90
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly they're over there fighting</v>

91
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>so that we can be safe here and that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys are out there with these signs,</v>

92
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>like there had to be a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have likeminded views in</v>

93
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Christianity but still were furious.</v>

94
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

95
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.440
<v Speaker 2>And from our perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we thought that they were substituting</v>

96
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:15.600
<v Speaker 2>their righteousness for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>righteousness of God.</v>

97
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.140
<v Speaker 2>So they were upset that we were out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there giving this message that that was</v>

98
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:21.810
<v Speaker 2>100 percent biblical and our from our</v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view,</v>

99
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.370
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God calls that compassion when he sends</v>

100
00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:29.940
<v Speaker 2>his servants with his message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we thought even though they call</v>

101
00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:33.390
<v Speaker 2>themselves Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're ignoring these vast swaths of</v>

102
00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:35.820
<v Speaker 2>the Bible that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that support what we were saying and how</v>

103
00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:40.710
<v Speaker 2>we were saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there was definitely a lot of,</v>

104
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of pushback from people on all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sides but,</v>

105
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.250
<v Speaker 2>and especially from other Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we just thought they're not really</v>

106
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Christian because they're not following</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

107
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.580
<v Speaker 2>We understand.</v>

108
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.940
<v Speaker 1>So you guys were pretty much solidified</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your opinion.</v>

109
00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It was a consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like everybody thought you were</v>

110
00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:56.624
<v Speaker 1>doing the right thing.</v>

111
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

112
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 2>so that when the soldier's funerals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when those protesting,</v>

113
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.110
<v Speaker 2>it was in June of 2005 that we started</v>
<v Speaker 2>protesting soldier's funerals.</v>

114
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 2>How's it brought up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my grandfather had been in since</v>

115
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 2>2005,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,</v>

116
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd been,</v>

117
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 2>you see these things on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

118
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the funeral funerals,</v>

119
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 2>like what was going on at the funerals</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

120
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 2>these aren't funerals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are patriotic pep rallies and</v>

121
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 2>they're saying all these things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless America.</v>

122
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Well God isn't blessing America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is cursing America,</v>

123
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 2>so we have to go and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and give a different message.</v>

124
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's how it came up initially.</v>

125
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

126
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 2>so I went to my first soldier's funeral</v>
<v Speaker 2>protest and then the following month in</v>

127
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 2>July of 2005 and before I went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

128
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time we would go to these things,</v>

129
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I was protesting from the time I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years old.</v>

130
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>So when you go out on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 2>to these protests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times there would be a media</v>

132
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have people asking questions.</v>

133
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't sure how I would answer if</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody asked me,</v>

134
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 2>why are you at this funeral?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

135
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sure how I would answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I felt very when I found that I</v>

136
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 2>was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I thought I need to,</v>

137
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to understand this.</v>

138
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 2>So I went to my mother and she brings</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth those verses that I just quoted to</v>

139
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And several others.</v>

140
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>We sat down as a family as we did every</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

141
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 2>to read the Bible and to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>world events and the church's</v>

143
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:24.060
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of these events in light</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their understanding of the scripture.</v>

144
00:06:24.061 --> 00:06:24.894
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.730
<v Speaker 2>she goes through and explains these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 2>very carefully.</v>

147
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 2>And because her answers came from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible,</v>

148
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my,</v>

149
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 2>my foundation was that the Bible is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>infallible word of God.</v>

150
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 2>And that it's true no matter what any</v>
<v Speaker 2>human thinks and that we have a duty to</v>

151
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 2>obey at 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter,</v>

152
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 2>no matter what I think or feel otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to bring my thoughts and opinions</v>

153
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 2>in line with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though I had a lot of</v>

154
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 2>trepidation at the beginning about going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to those funerals,</v>

155
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I very quickly acclimated to it,</v>

156
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you do when you're in an environment</v>

157
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:02.720
<v Speaker 2>like that where everything depends on</v>
<v Speaker 2>you falling into line.</v>

158
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it like when you first did it?</v>

159
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Like what was the reaction to other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people or you know,</v>

160
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 1>other people's reaction to you</v>

161
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.420
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that very first one,</v>

162
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:18.130
<v Speaker 2>it was in Omaha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nebraska and it was incredibly tense.</v>

163
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was a bunch of cops.</v>

164
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.600
<v Speaker 2>We always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time we would go to protest</v>

165
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:24.370
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would contact the police to make sure</v>

166
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:29.371
<v Speaker 2>that there would be a police presence</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people were tempted to end,</v>

167
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.860
<v Speaker 2>would come after us physically and try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to assault us.</v>

169
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.680
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has happened with some regularity.</v>

170
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.500
<v Speaker 2>So from the very earliest days of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>protesting,</v>

171
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:39.420
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

172
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom and her generation,</v>

173
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.610
<v Speaker 2>you had made this decision to who I</v>
<v Speaker 2>should say many of them are lawyers.</v>

174
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.380
<v Speaker 2>So they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.850
<v Speaker 2>write letters from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.120
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as attorney saying,</v>

177
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.520
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be protesting in your</v>

178
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:54.190
<v Speaker 2>city a peep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we do.</v>

179
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.190
<v Speaker 2>We hold signs on public sidewalks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not violent.</v>

180
00:07:57.191 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so explaining what a pro,</v>

181
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.950
<v Speaker 2>what are protests looked like and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then saying if you want to avoid,</v>

182
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

183
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.900
<v Speaker 2>these kinds of violence that often</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens a be there.</v>

184
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.740
<v Speaker 1>So this first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old were you in 2005?</v>

185
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I was 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were a kid,</v>

186
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a grown kid and you know,</v>

187
00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you're with your parents and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time you're protesting a veteran.</v>

188
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.410
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that experience like?</v>

189
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.680
<v Speaker 2>So I'm standing across this floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing across the street from the</v>

190
00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:30.000
<v Speaker 2>church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

191
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:31.170
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was very solid,</v>

192
00:08:31.171 --> 00:08:32.340
<v Speaker 2>very quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

193
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.100
<v Speaker 2>which is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was not normal really for protests.</v>

194
00:08:35.101 --> 00:08:38.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times we would be out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>singing and chanting and,</v>

195
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.340
<v Speaker 2>and making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big public display,</v>

196
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.560
<v Speaker 2>but this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

197
00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:46.080
<v Speaker 2>incredibly tense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody was really talking,</v>

198
00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:47.770
<v Speaker 2>nobody was really moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

199
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

200
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.630
<v Speaker 2>the family was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.600
<v Speaker 2>pulled up in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it was in a limousine across</v>

202
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:59.601
<v Speaker 2>the street and the family got out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked around and saw us and they know</v>

203
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 2>you guys were going to be there</v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand because we always would</v>

204
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 2>publicize that we would send out news</v>
<v Speaker 2>releases.</v>

205
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 2>So they were aware that we were going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be there.</v>

206
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there were a bunch of,</v>

207
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I think they were marines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

208
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.290
<v Speaker 2>like in dress blues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there and they,</v>

209
00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 2>they looked incredibly angry and upset.</v>

210
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.223
<v Speaker 2>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

211
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it felt like at any moment if something</v>

212
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 2>happened like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole situation could explode.</v>

213
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's with the cops having the cops</v>

214
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 2>standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was um,</v>

215
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

216
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

217
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really tense.</v>

218
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.560
<v Speaker 2>They weren't saying anything like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

219
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 2>none of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which like,</v>

220
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really unusual for protests like</v>

221
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

222
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.010
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times we would be exchanging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 2>we would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would of course would be yelling</v>

224
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 2>about Bible verses and the hatred of God</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

225
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would be talking about love and</v>

226
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 2>tolerance and how we're wrong and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian and,</v>

227
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 2>but at this one it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very quiet.</v>

228
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't always like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pretty quickly,</v>

229
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.640
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once we became acclimated to do those</v>

230
00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:00.740
<v Speaker 2>protests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

231
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 2>and also there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you heard of the Patriot guard</v>

232
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:04.644
<v Speaker 2>riders?</v>

233
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.790
<v Speaker 2>It was a group of motorcyclists who</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to,</v>

234
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:10.100
<v Speaker 2>and they formed like an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

235
00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 2>across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in every state there was a group of</v>

236
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:13.890
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a motorcyclist who,</v>

237
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 2>when they found out we were going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>protesting somewhere,</v>

238
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:17.450
<v Speaker 2>they would go and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

239
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 2>rev their engines so that our words and</v>
<v Speaker 2>songs and such wouldn't be heard by the</v>

240
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:22.910
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

241
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.410
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would hold American flags and</v>

242
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:27.400
<v Speaker 2>try to block,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's putting a buffer between us and the</v>

244
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:31.890
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

245
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.080
<v Speaker 2>so when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that started to happen,</v>

246
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 2>it became almost like a game sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in hindsight,</v>

247
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this makes me cringe and,</v>

248
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

249
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 2>but it became like this game of trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to show that we were going to get our</v>

250
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 2>message across no matter what any human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being wanted because we knew we were so</v>

251
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 2>sure that this was what God wanted.</v>

252
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What made you leave</v>

253
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started my very first sort of</v>

254
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:05.820
<v Speaker 2>conscious doubts came from conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter.</v>

255
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.010
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something good drug.</v>

256
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Dm through twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

257
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 2>lots of good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also met my husband there.</v>

258
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.093
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

259
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.740
<v Speaker 2>While I was still at the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of A.</v>

260
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that he would use that word</v>
<v Speaker 2>to describe himself.</v>

261
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I actually was just talking to Sam about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and I was like,</v>

262
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 2>when people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with the word.</v>

263
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Because when people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say atheist,</v>

264
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:31.560
<v Speaker 2>people think jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like so many people do.</v>

265
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 2>So many people think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

266
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely certain that there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>no god.</v>

267
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:38.040
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a word that I hesitate to use to</v>

268
00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:39.270
<v Speaker 2>describe myself too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

269
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.660
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not a believer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know to say I'm not a</v>

270
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:44.850
<v Speaker 2>believer because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love people,</v>

271
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:48.470
<v Speaker 2>I believe in people and that there is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much hope and,</v>

272
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.240
<v Speaker 2>and for people and that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

273
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so conversations you had on twitter did,</v>

274
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:55.710
<v Speaker 2>what do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

275
00:11:55.711 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 2>what doors did the open your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

276
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 2>So I got on twitter and it was like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>extension of the picket line.</v>

277
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So go out there with picket signs and</v>

278
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would come up to us and ask us</v>

279
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:07.740
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was this,</v>

280
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 2>it was a constant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a constant conversation.</v>

281
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.030
<v Speaker 2>And so I got on twitter to take that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.350
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Internet,</v>

283
00:12:15.351 --> 00:12:16.810
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reach more people.</v>

284
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the first things I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got on twitter was to attack this</v>

285
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Jewish man named David Abbott Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who ran a blog called Julius.</v>

286
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 2>He was listed as the second most</v>
<v Speaker 2>influential Jew on twitter on this</v>

287
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.660
<v Speaker 2>number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

288
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I actually can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Memorable and I'm part of my story.</v>

289
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I guess you can check it at the Jta is</v>
<v Speaker 2>list if you want to change it,</v>

290
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was listed as number two and uh,</v>

291
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:49.020
<v Speaker 2>so he responded initially with sarcasm</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

292
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hostility.</v>

293
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but pretty quickly he sort of changed</v>

294
00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 2>tactics and started instead of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>mocking me,</v>

295
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 2>although he still didn't do that some</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

296
00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was asking questions about our picket</v>

297
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 2>signs and I started asking him questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Jewish theology because I wanted</v>

298
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:07.030
<v Speaker 2>to better know how to counter it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:09.430
<v Speaker 2>to run the scriptures because I was sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were wrong.</v>

300
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Jews killed Jesus and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they reject him as the Messiah.</v>

301
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:15.390
<v Speaker 2>And so all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

302
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.280
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

303
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.870
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're having this back and forth and</v>

304
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 2>this goes on for about a year and during</v>
<v Speaker 2>that year I've actually met him twice.</v>

305
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:29.101
<v Speaker 2>I protested him twice once to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>functions or was he giving speeches?</v>

306
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 2>So in Long Beach actually at the Julius</v>
<v Speaker 2>Festival,</v>

307
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:35.750
<v Speaker 2>they had this Jewish cultural festival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>

308
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:36.730
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

309
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He.</v>

310
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was going to be there.</v>

311
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

312
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I went when I was protesting him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

313
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:48.520
<v Speaker 2>and he came out to the picket line and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

314
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 2>it was one of those like very rowdy</v>
<v Speaker 2>pickets.</v>

315
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.890
<v Speaker 2>There was a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a counter protestors and they were,</v>

316
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

317
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dresses like the Easter bunny and Jesus</v>

318
00:13:57.191 --> 00:13:59.410
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually got pretty violent.</v>

319
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 2>So I was actually super violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

320
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cops,</v>

321
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:04.240
<v Speaker 2>this I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we called the cops,</v>

322
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.930
<v Speaker 2>the cops were just standing there</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching people like actively assaulting</v>

323
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:08.800
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hitting us.</v>

324
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 2>And so we're like walking around trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

325
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not be hit because we're not going to</v>

326
00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:15.240
<v Speaker 2>hit back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't there,</v>

327
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.440
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the churches very against violence,</v>

328
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:21.580
<v Speaker 2>like they're not going to be violent to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people or defend themselves just to.</v>

329
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.050
<v Speaker 2>So I was actually really glad when David</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out because he became like a buffer</v>

330
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:29.650
<v Speaker 2>between me and the rest of the counter</v>
<v Speaker 2>protestors because everybody could tell</v>

331
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 2>that he was wearing his delicious shirt</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

332
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.243
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

333
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.660
<v Speaker 2>so the conversation continued there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then also at another protest a six or</v>

334
00:14:37.661 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 2>seven months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

335
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

336
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 2>it was not long after that second</v>
<v Speaker 2>protest,</v>

337
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.100
<v Speaker 2>we're talking again and he was asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about one of Our signs that said death</v>

338
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Speaker 2>penalty for fags and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

339
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm reiterating why the church believes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it has in the book of Leviticus,</v>

340
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 2>God calls for the death penalty for gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>gays.</v>

341
00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 2>And then enrollment swollen in the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>testament.</v>

342
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reiterated so they commit such</v>

343
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:05.120
<v Speaker 2>things are worthy of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

344
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm telling David these things</v>

345
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:11.440
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

346
00:15:11.441 --> 00:15:12.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but didn't Jesus say,</v>

347
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 2>let he who is without sin cast the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>stone?</v>

348
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.600
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we always said to that,</v>

349
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.900
<v Speaker 2>which was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not casting stones were preaching</v>

350
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

351
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're advocating that the</v>

352
00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 2>government cast stones.</v>

353
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.470
<v Speaker 2>And I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

354
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.580
<v Speaker 2>this is all through twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

355
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I see this message and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of gasped.</v>

356
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never connected that Jesus there.</v>

357
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about the death penalty</v>

358
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 2>specifically about the death penalty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were advocating it and so I wasn't</v>

359
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:46.850
<v Speaker 2>sure how to respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he David kept kept going.</v>

360
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what about this member of your</v>

361
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:52.100
<v Speaker 2>church who had a child out of wedlock?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

362
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 2>what about it like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is another point.</v>

363
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.810
<v Speaker 2>You know people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was common knowledge.</v>

364
00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:58.990
<v Speaker 2>People knew about this and what though</v>
<v Speaker 2>this interface,</v>

365
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.450
<v Speaker 2>and we would say the standard of God</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't sinlessness.</v>

366
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 2>It's repentance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she doesn't deserve that punishment</v>

367
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:08.210
<v Speaker 2>because she repented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She stopped,</v>

368
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.630
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't having premarital sex anymore</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she knows that it's wrong.</v>

369
00:16:11.631 --> 00:16:13.730
<v Speaker 2>And she changed her mind and she changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>her conduct,</v>

370
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 2>which is what repentance is.</v>

371
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

372
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.230
<v Speaker 2>but she would have been killed if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>had instituted the death penalty for</v>

373
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 2>that sin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the first time again that I</v>

374
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 2>connected that if you kill somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as they sin,</v>

375
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.880
<v Speaker 2>they you lose the opportunity to repent</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be forgiven.</v>

376
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.920
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just sort of staring at my phone</v>

377
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:37.963
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

378
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.781
<v Speaker 2>in Topeka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kansas,</v>

379
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:42.980
<v Speaker 2>he's in Jerusalem and I really quickly</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended the conversation,</v>

380
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember quite how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just sort of this like I</v>

381
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:48.350
<v Speaker 2>hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to handle this because</v>

382
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.540
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the church is full of lawyers.</v>

383
00:16:50.541 --> 00:16:54.260
<v Speaker 2>They're very intelligent and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments and their theology for the</v>

384
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 2>most part is very well constructed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>super consistent.</v>

385
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.290
<v Speaker 2>And so for there to be this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:01.700
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hypocrisy,</v>

387
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:05.990
<v Speaker 2>this contradiction I didn't like my</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain was I felt like it was exploding.</v>

388
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 2>So I went to a couple of people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>church,</v>

389
00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 2>including my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

390
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 2>and the response was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel free to stop me at any time,</v>

391
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:13.880
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm filled.</v>

392
00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.340
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

393
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.490
<v Speaker 2>so she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she reiterated the same verses that I</v>

394
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 2>had told David that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that supported our position,</v>

395
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.470
<v Speaker 2>but she didn't address the</v>
<v Speaker 2>contradiction.</v>

396
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And when I seem to unsatisfied with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

397
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 2>she said I was getting wrapped around an</v>
<v Speaker 2>axle and a just sort of,</v>

398
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push it aside.</v>

399
00:17:32.631 --> 00:17:37.631
<v Speaker 2>And the response was so just to shut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut me down and then to move onto the</v>

400
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 2>next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

401
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a very human thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

402
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:41.870
<v Speaker 2>When somebody puts something in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>face that,</v>

403
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 2>that is this contradiction that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not ready to deal with or that you</v>

404
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:45.910
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

405
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.890
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot,</v>

406
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 2>you kind of sort of push it aside and</v>
<v Speaker 2>try not to.</v>

407
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.280
<v Speaker 2>So the way that I dealt with it was to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop holding the sign because I knew</v>

408
00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.420
<v Speaker 2>that if somebody asked me about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

409
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't defend it because I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't believe it.</v>

410
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>But there was nothing else I could do at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>

411
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the importance of that conversation,</v>

412
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:11.610
<v Speaker 2>this is obviously just one small</v>
<v Speaker 2>contradiction and one small</v>

413
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 2>inconsistency and a vast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 2>we still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still believed that everybody outside</v>

415
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 2>the church was basically isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely wrong and,</v>

416
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 2>and evil and slash or delusional and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the church was basically right,</v>

417
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 2>except this one point.</v>

418
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody ever feel that it was bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use slurs like to use some sort of</v>

419
00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:34.780
<v Speaker 1>insulting term for gay people instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying God hates gay people.</v>

420
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.530
<v Speaker 2>So at the very beginning they did use</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word gaze.</v>

421
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.050
<v Speaker 2>It was a big change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

422
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 2>So my grandfather would say that gay is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a misnomer.</v>

423
00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.570
<v Speaker 2>These people aren't happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're committing suicide and they're,</v>

424
00:18:46.571 --> 00:18:49.570
<v Speaker 2>and they're evil and abominable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have no peace.</v>

425
00:18:49.571 --> 00:18:51.130
<v Speaker 2>God has taken their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their piece.</v>

426
00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.080
<v Speaker 2>They're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So gay is a misnomer.</v>

427
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.430
<v Speaker 2>And so the word the word fag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say like Amos,</v>

428
00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:58.720
<v Speaker 2>in the book of Amos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

429
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's translated firebrand there.</v>

430
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.290
<v Speaker 2>So my grandfather would say the word fag</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an elegant metafarm.</v>

431
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

432
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 2>gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

433
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.140
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of fags are a bundle of sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

434
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used for kindling.</v>

435
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Speaker 2>So gays are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

436
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:19.030
<v Speaker 2>they burned in their lust one toward</v>
<v Speaker 2>another and they fuel the fires of hell</v>

437
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:23.110
<v Speaker 2>in the fires of God's wrath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an elegant metaphor.</v>

438
00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.220
<v Speaker 2>GRANDPA gramps would say,</v>

439
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know the original metaphor was</v>

440
00:19:26.171 --> 00:19:28.510
<v Speaker 1>really supposed to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean from the Bible?</v>

441
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word faggot.</v>

442
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually means a bundle of woods,</v>

443
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:37.120
<v Speaker 1>a bundle of wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would use that expression to</v>

444
00:19:37.121 --> 00:19:41.620
<v Speaker 1>describe a woman because a bundle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wood is burdensome,</v>

445
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.830
<v Speaker 1>like carrying around a bundle of wood is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very burdensome.</v>

446
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.340
<v Speaker 1>So when they would call a woman a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faggot,</v>

447
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.130
<v Speaker 1>there were saying that she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>burdensome so when they would call a man</v>

448
00:19:52.131 --> 00:19:55.300
<v Speaker 1>of Faggot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say that he is burdensome</v>

449
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.850
<v Speaker 1>like a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bundle of wood,</v>

450
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.650
<v Speaker 1>like a non manly man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't get work done along those</v>

451
00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:05.890
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it became used by people</v>

452
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 1>erroneous Lee saying that it was about</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning them and that they would burn</v>

453
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.280
<v Speaker 1>gay people because they would burn</v>
<v Speaker 1>faggots of wood.</v>

454
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.090
<v Speaker 1>But that's not really the case.</v>

455
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Just sounds cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

456
00:20:18.611 --> 00:20:19.700
<v Speaker 2>I actually had never heard that.</v>

457
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

458
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.740
<v Speaker 1>If you go see if he could find that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Google that,</v>

459
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original term faggot meant burdened</v>

460
00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.060
<v Speaker 1>bundle of wood and burdened some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bundle of what caused me to think</v>

461
00:20:31.061 --> 00:20:34.390
<v Speaker 1>about like carrying a bundle of wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you didn't have a truck.</v>

462
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge pain in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what the source of it</v>

463
00:20:37.481 --> 00:20:38.314
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

464
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

465
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:39.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no.</v>

466
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I had no</v>

467
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:45.730
<v Speaker 1>people use it wrong and the real problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the people that use it wrong or like</v>

468
00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 1>gay activists and they try to say how</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible that word is because it was</v>

469
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.370
<v Speaker 1>used to represent how gay people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>burned,</v>

470
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 1>but there's never been like a time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>history where like,</v>

471
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole series of gay people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were like burnt,</v>

472
00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like they drowned witches and</v>

473
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:04.120
<v Speaker 1>things were done like real specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's never been like a thing.</v>

474
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:08.690
<v Speaker 1>What do we got here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word faggot has been used in English</v>

475
00:21:08.691 --> 00:21:11.710
<v Speaker 1>since the late 16th century is abusive</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn for women,</v>

476
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:16.711
<v Speaker 1>particularly old women are referenced to</v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexual sexuality may derive from</v>

477
00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:18.480
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

478
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.430
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to be so weird the way</v>

479
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.910
<v Speaker 1>you got it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

480
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.321
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

481
00:21:23.321 --> 00:21:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I can really get a Ba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ba blah.</v>

482
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.900
<v Speaker 1>So there it is an alternative</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that the word connected</v>

483
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.930
<v Speaker 1>with the practice of fagging in British</v>
<v Speaker 1>private schools in which younger boys</v>

484
00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:39.280
<v Speaker 1>performed potentially sexual duties for</v>
<v Speaker 1>older boys.</v>

485
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Although the word faggot was never used</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this context</v>

486
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.020
<v Speaker 1>thrown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown around,</v>

487
00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.970
<v Speaker 1>but the big one means the bundle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wood,</v>

488
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 1>the bundle of sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that,</v>

489
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you got something awkward to be</v>

490
00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:55.010
<v Speaker 1>carried is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

491
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.850
<v Speaker 1>exactly burdensome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where it comes from.</v>

492
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.880
<v Speaker 1>A really didn't have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning people,</v>

493
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.420
<v Speaker 1>but like they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll repeat it like to make a big</v>

494
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:06.310
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big dramatic point,</v>

495
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.360
<v Speaker 3>but it's know melodramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would think I would know this given</v>

496
00:22:11.361 --> 00:22:14.660
<v Speaker 3>our respective histories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I literally had never heard this in</v>

497
00:22:14.661 --> 00:22:15.494
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

498
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Accordant distinction for why people use</v>
<v Speaker 1>that term because it's really just that</v>

499
00:22:20.401 --> 00:22:25.170
<v Speaker 1>they're annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really just,</v>

500
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just think of some non manly man</v>

501
00:22:28.021 --> 00:22:30.750
<v Speaker 1>who can't get things done and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably crying all the time.</v>

502
00:22:30.751 --> 00:22:31.584
<v Speaker 1>These burdensome from</v>

503
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.320
<v Speaker 3>my experience of gay people since we</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

504
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.830
<v Speaker 3>obviously much more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

505
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.550
<v Speaker 3>maybe reflective of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A has not been.</v>

506
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.960
<v Speaker 3>What has it been like an impossibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful.</v>

507
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Don't overcompensate because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting out of this bad environment.</v>

508
00:22:46.711 --> 00:22:48.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll take you down to Santa Monica</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boulevard,</v>

509
00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:52.350
<v Speaker 3>the of the guest spots on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see dudes would cut off shorts</v>

510
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.040
<v Speaker 3>and you'll change your tune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing?</v>

511
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:56.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

512
00:22:56.761 --> 00:23:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to like to paint</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody with the one brush now either</v>

513
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.940
<v Speaker 3>been amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you start being attracted to</v>

514
00:23:02.941 --> 00:23:04.680
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something happens.</v>

515
00:23:04.681 --> 00:23:06.920
<v Speaker 3>They become different than every other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

516
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other world.</v>

517
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.353
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

518
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.740
<v Speaker 3>right after we left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at first I thought we have to hide</v>

519
00:23:13.741 --> 00:23:16.110
<v Speaker 3>from the past forever and my sister and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say left together.</v>

520
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how old were you guys?</v>

521
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.220
<v Speaker 3>So I was 26.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was almost 27.</v>

522
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Did you have a long conversation before</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it?</v>

523
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Many memories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About four months before between when I</v>

524
00:23:25.441 --> 00:23:28.910
<v Speaker 3>first talked to her about leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the first initial conversation</v>

525
00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:33.911
<v Speaker 3>and how did you gather up the courage to</v>
<v Speaker 3>even sort of breach the subject?</v>

526
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really terrifying and awful</v>

527
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.651
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

528
00:23:37.651 --> 00:23:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I remember from the time I was very</v>
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>

529
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this passage in deuteronomy that</v>

530
00:23:41.161 --> 00:23:42.720
<v Speaker 3>my mom would quote and it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

531
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.270
<v Speaker 3>if somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

532
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.360
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your friend</v>

533
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.490
<v Speaker 2>did somebody close to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

534
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.310
<v Speaker 2>your relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody comes up to you and says,</v>

535
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.420
<v Speaker 2>let us go and serve other gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like somebody secretly says to you those</v>

536
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to stone them and you the one</v>

537
00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:59.650
<v Speaker 2>that they came to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be the first one to.</v>

538
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.980
<v Speaker 2>And my family's not stoning people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

539
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 2>but they do though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's centered in the Bible.</v>

540
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:04.910
<v Speaker 2>And someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

541
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:08.480
<v Speaker 2>we got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to serve this golden cow.</v>

542
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.780
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also have an in the new testament,</v>

543
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:14.810
<v Speaker 2>it talks about rendering unto Caesar the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are Caesar's and to God's</v>

544
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:18.800
<v Speaker 2>the things that are got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we also have to obey the law of man.</v>

545
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.960
<v Speaker 2>We have to obey the law of sin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't.</v>

546
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:25.820
<v Speaker 2>So we're not supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just so loved man supersedes the law</v>

547
00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Speaker 2>of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to be obedient to the</v>

548
00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:28.934
<v Speaker 2>laws of men.</v>

549
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.530
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there this kind of a complicated,</v>

550
00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bit of theology where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of undid a lot of the mosaic code</v>

551
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:40.790
<v Speaker 2>that we didn't actually have to follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

552
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 2>But honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

553
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like the death penalty for</v>

554
00:24:44.911 --> 00:24:47.270
<v Speaker 2>a fag thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if they still believe that that</v>

555
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:50.600
<v Speaker 2>punishment is applicable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then we should be trying to</v>

556
00:24:50.601 --> 00:24:53.750
<v Speaker 2>convince the government lobbying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government to like with those signs.</v>

557
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 2>So I'm so that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was my sister.</v>

558
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:00.290
<v Speaker 2>If I went to her and said these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>to her,</v>

559
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 2>she could easily have turned around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>told my parents not as a,</v>

560
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a culture of tattle tales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not out of bad intention,</v>

561
00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:13.370
<v Speaker 2>but because they believe that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to help you.</v>

562
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.980
<v Speaker 2>They don't want you to go down a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

563
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.490
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know when I,</v>

564
00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:20.324
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

565
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I first thought of leaving on June was</v>
<v Speaker 2>July fourth and I was with my sister at</v>

566
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:27.740
<v Speaker 2>the time and when it first occurred to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me that I might,</v>

567
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.710
<v Speaker 2>that I might have to leave the church or</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the church might be wrong.</v>

568
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had to leave like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>second because if it even occurred to me</v>

569
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:37.460
<v Speaker 2>that meant I didn't belong there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that God was going to punish me and that</v>

570
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.350
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like immediately so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilt and like I was a betrayer.</v>

571
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Was all your social life connected still</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the church?</v>

572
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was this where had you already known</v>

573
00:25:48.801 --> 00:25:50.990
<v Speaker 2>your husband by then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

574
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was definitely part of it.</v>

575
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it wasn't like that.</v>

576
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

577
00:25:57.321 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was just another person on twitter</v>

578
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:00.764
<v Speaker 2>at first.</v>

579
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

580
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.920
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like friendly conversation and</v>

581
00:26:04.921 --> 00:26:05.900
<v Speaker 2>this went over to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

582
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.090
<v Speaker 2>for the course of several months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

583
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

584
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 2>eight or eight months or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven or eight months.</v>

585
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.520
<v Speaker 2>And then it was never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was never anything about feelings</v>

586
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:18.380
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships are,</v>

587
00:26:18.381 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff is totally for ventures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

588
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.130
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like not even like,</v>

589
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.390
<v Speaker 2>not even anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nothing.</v>

590
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just that my mind didn't work</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way and there is,</v>

591
00:26:29.241 --> 00:26:33.890
<v Speaker 2>there can be no relationship like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>with outsiders but outsiders,</v>

592
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.980
<v Speaker 2>outsiders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

593
00:26:36.981 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually thought I was never going to</v>

594
00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:41.270
<v Speaker 2>get married because most of the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the church,</v>

595
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.590
<v Speaker 2>about 80 percent or so of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the church,</v>

596
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 2>there's only 80 people or so anyway</v>
<v Speaker 2>where my immediate and extended family.</v>

597
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.750
<v Speaker 2>So I thought there's no way that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

598
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not going to get married.</v>

599
00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 2>That it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

600
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like an like an easy thing at</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

601
00:26:56.971 --> 00:27:00.120
<v Speaker 2>but it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just the facts on the ground,</v>

602
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I could actually ground where you</v>

603
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:05.200
<v Speaker 2>had to date someone inside the church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was only 80 people in the church.</v>

604
00:27:05.201 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 2>They're all your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't date your family.</v>

605
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

606
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I should say there were a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people my age and they came,</v>

607
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.350
<v Speaker 2>they had just joined the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

608
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

609
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.150
<v Speaker 2>But I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

610
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I had no interest in any of them and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was pickens</v>

611
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.140
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

612
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:25.770
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

613
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:26.940
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

614
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 2>so I actually had a dream about meeting</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

615
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Also my husband at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know,</v>

616
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.100
<v Speaker 2>he was totally anonymous on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's just his words.</v>

617
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what he looked like.</v>

618
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:45.500
<v Speaker 2>his name or where he lived or anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>about him except except these words.</v>

620
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was,</v>

621
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.820
<v Speaker 2>he was just curious and kind and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of.</v>

622
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.200
<v Speaker 2>And He loved people and so he would sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of always be pushing,</v>

623
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.990
<v Speaker 2>pushing the conversation back to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm giving,</v>

624
00:28:00.991 --> 00:28:04.740
<v Speaker 2>it looks like I've told you all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>verses about protesting funerals and why</v>

625
00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:07.860
<v Speaker 2>we have to go and do this and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>importance of it and why we have to</v>

626
00:28:07.861 --> 00:28:11.280
<v Speaker 2>thank God for these tragedies because</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is sovereign and he's in control.</v>

627
00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:14.690
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the scripturally,</v>

628
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:19.710
<v Speaker 2>like the justifying all these things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kept pushing it back to because he's</v>

629
00:28:20.641 --> 00:28:25.641
<v Speaker 2>not super well versed in the Bible so he</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know how to like I see that the</v>

630
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Bible says these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what about the family?</v>

631
00:28:28.441 --> 00:28:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I just cannot imagine going and</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing these things to people and so this</v>

632
00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 2>is all happening like on as I'm.</v>

633
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.970
<v Speaker 2>So I'm also still having conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter with so many other people.</v>

634
00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:42.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's like twitter became this like</v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy machine for me.</v>

635
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Like so it's not just like on a picket</v>
<v Speaker 2>line where people are butting heads and</v>

636
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.330
<v Speaker 2>arguing and debating and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yelling and it,</v>

637
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.780
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

638
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having these can be kind of aggressive</v>

639
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm also seeing like photos of their</v>

640
00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:58.880
<v Speaker 2>cats and them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

641
00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.850
<v Speaker 2>exchanging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

642
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.240
<v Speaker 2>joking with our friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm seeing a side of people and</v>

643
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:07.980
<v Speaker 2>sort of being immersed in this community</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that I had never been before.</v>

644
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.430
<v Speaker 2>And so it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm trying to say like when</v>

645
00:29:11.431 --> 00:29:13.770
<v Speaker 2>you say why don't you leave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it took,</v>

646
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Speaker 2>it was so much sort of happening around</v>
<v Speaker 2>this time.</v>

647
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.770
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time this pile up of things,</v>

648
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:24.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

649
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.910
<v Speaker 2>and I'm processing it as I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>through this,</v>

650
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm also talking to my sister and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was the only and other people in</v>

651
00:29:32.581 --> 00:29:34.200
<v Speaker 2>the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was the only person,</v>

652
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.070
<v Speaker 2>if I ever had a doubt or a question or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

653
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I thought we're doing something wrong</v>

654
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:41.320
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was the only person who would say,</v>

655
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

656
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.640
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense that I should</v>
<v Speaker 2>say my sister is,</v>

657
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative and artistic and had a,</v>

658
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.820
<v Speaker 2>like a little bit of a reputation for</v>
<v Speaker 2>being kind of rebellious.</v>

659
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Not as like submissive as my me and our</v>
<v Speaker 2>other sister.</v>

660
00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was just this dynamic of,</v>

661
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

662
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:05.410
<v Speaker 2>between the two of us were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was the only person I could fully</v>

663
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 2>articulate my thoughts and feelings to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

664
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.380
<v Speaker 2>and so when I first thought of leaving</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I turned around and I thought I</v>

665
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:15.070
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

666
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.230
<v Speaker 2>we were painting at a friend's house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>painting the walls and I,</v>

667
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I turned around to set my paintbrush</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

668
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I thought it had to go and leave that</v>
<v Speaker 2>second and I turned around and saw my</v>

669
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:27.670
<v Speaker 2>sister and I thought I can't leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>without talking to her.</v>

670
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 2>So the next day I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

671
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 2>she came home from work over the lunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and we would always like go up to</v>

672
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:38.791
<v Speaker 2>my room and we were talking about all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these doubts we were having and I was</v>

673
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:44.371
<v Speaker 2>crying and I put my head in her lap and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I couldn't even art,</v>

674
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 2>like articulating the idea of leaving</v>
<v Speaker 2>was too much like it,</v>

675
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.510
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrifying.</v>

676
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just seemed like impossible.</v>

677
00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:53.320
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

678
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.740
<v Speaker 2>what if we weren't here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

679
00:30:56.741 --> 00:30:58.990
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

680
00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:02.590
<v Speaker 2>what if we were somewhere else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that starts this conversation</v>

681
00:31:02.591 --> 00:31:03.520
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:31:03.521 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I cannot let go of all the things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that the church was doing wrong,</v>

683
00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:12.400
<v Speaker 2>that are where our theology was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we were applying it wrong,</v>

684
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.223
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that,</v>

685
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.110
<v Speaker 2>that was destructive and unscriptural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

686
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.390
<v Speaker 2>and she kept pushing the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to we're never going to see our</v>

687
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:24.850
<v Speaker 2>family again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to lose everyone and</v>

688
00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:27.370
<v Speaker 2>everything that's ever been important to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

689
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.970
<v Speaker 2>There is no hope outside this church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the things that we had learned about</v>

690
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 2>outsiders that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were evil and they could never</v>

691
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:37.720
<v Speaker 2>truly love each other or care about care</v>
<v Speaker 2>about one another.</v>

692
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.510
<v Speaker 2>They're really just enabling one another</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the path to hell.</v>

693
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so this,</v>

694
00:31:43.141 --> 00:31:44.740
<v Speaker 2>this back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

695
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 2>it goes on for about four months before</v>
<v Speaker 2>we finally actually left and,</v>

696
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:53.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was as bad or worse and I could have</v>

697
00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:56.410
<v Speaker 2>imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to get back to the,</v>

698
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get to that bad or worse,</v>

699
00:31:59.201 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 2>you could have ever imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I should show you left.</v>

700
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.000
<v Speaker 2>How did you leave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

701
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.400
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking to my parents and,</v>

702
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was another,</v>

703
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 2>another issue had come up and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

704
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a battle that we weren't going to</v>

705
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:16.910
<v Speaker 2>fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W W we can,</v>

706
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I should say in those four months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept trying to articulate these doubts</v>

707
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.910
<v Speaker 2>in a way that the church would accept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like trying to convince them not being</v>

708
00:32:24.911 --> 00:32:27.670
<v Speaker 2>as open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as time went on I became more and</v>

709
00:32:27.671 --> 00:32:32.280
<v Speaker 2>more open about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these questions and doubts and I</v>

710
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

711
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't fight it anymore.</v>

712
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.360
<v Speaker 2>I just looked at grace and I said we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go.</v>

713
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 2>And because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I should say also we had already</v>

714
00:32:40.101 --> 00:32:44.420
<v Speaker 2>been packing like we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had started packing her things about</v>

715
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:48.890
<v Speaker 2>a little over a month before that and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>had started like taking boxes to our</v>

716
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:50.690
<v Speaker 2>friend's house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

717
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 2>and with the understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually our,</v>

718
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 2>he was our high school English teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

719
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.990
<v Speaker 2>that we had kept up with on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

720
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we basically,</v>

721
00:33:01.051 --> 00:33:01.940
<v Speaker 2>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

722
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 2>if something changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the church changes and these things</v>

723
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:08.740
<v Speaker 2>get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll,</v>

724
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll take a lot of stuff back and just</v>

725
00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:13.730
<v Speaker 2>pretend like none of this ever happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was just,</v>

726
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding and compassionate and</v>

727
00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 2>really supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

728
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.390
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had done all this stuff already,</v>

729
00:33:20.391 --> 00:33:23.060
<v Speaker 2>but we actually had to go and pack the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of our things.</v>

730
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 2>So we walk out of our parents' bedroom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and went and started packing and,</v>

731
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people started coming,</v>

732
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 2>my brother and some of the elders and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>aunt,</v>

733
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.501
<v Speaker 2>my cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

734
00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:35.870
<v Speaker 2>people I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were very close,</v>

735
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.930
<v Speaker 2>like our whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my whole life revolved around the</v>

736
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:42.290
<v Speaker 2>church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to look these people in the face</v>

737
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:43.610
<v Speaker 2>and say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

738
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

739
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:45.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US,</v>

740
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:46.620
<v Speaker 2>them mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

741
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.880
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bonds that are created in</v>

742
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 2>environments like that are incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>

743
00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.460
<v Speaker 2>At least they were in our church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

744
00:33:55.461 --> 00:33:57.520
<v Speaker 2>most of these people are also my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

745
00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.960
<v Speaker 2>so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was awful.</v>

746
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm crying and packing and trying to</v>

747
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:08.570
<v Speaker 2>explain to them why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why leaving and I can hardly talk,</v>

748
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

749
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.060
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so overwhelmed,</v>

750
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:16.040
<v Speaker 2>but I'm literally had to go back the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next day with a u haul to get the rest</v>

751
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:16.910
<v Speaker 2>of our stuff more.</v>

752
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Our parents helped us pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

753
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.440
<v Speaker 2>it's not one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

754
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:24.360
<v Speaker 2>like there are some groups like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they don't want you to leave.</v>

755
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:25.700
<v Speaker 2>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll try to stop you from leaving.</v>

756
00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:26.534
<v Speaker 2>Like I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

757
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.170
<v Speaker 2>scientology that miscavige I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canberra's Ron.</v>

758
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about like fists,</v>

759
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.600
<v Speaker 2>like actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

760
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.010
<v Speaker 2>obstacles to you leaving like</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>

761
00:34:37.011 --> 00:34:39.110
<v Speaker 2>like they're not gonna you can't get out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the gate,</v>

762
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.220
<v Speaker 2>like nothing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

763
00:34:41.221 --> 00:34:42.560
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always would say this is a</v>

764
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 2>volunteer army and if you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be here then you don't belong here.</v>

765
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

766
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.330
<v Speaker 2>it's the threat of losing everything and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone</v>

767
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.030
<v Speaker 2>being ostracized by and just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>expelled into this world that you</v>

768
00:34:56.090 --> 00:35:00.740
<v Speaker 2>believe and have always believed is as</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil and without hope and doomed.</v>

769
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.970
<v Speaker 2>So how did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you get all your stuff packed?</v>

770
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.650
<v Speaker 2>People coming in there saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

771
00:35:06.651 --> 00:35:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

772
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.390
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to convince us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once they understand that we're not</v>

773
00:35:11.391 --> 00:35:12.920
<v Speaker 2>being convinced that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

774
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:13.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

775
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 2>they walked away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that night our dad dropped us</v>

776
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:19.120
<v Speaker 2>off at a hotel and then Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

777
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

778
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.450
<v Speaker 2>it's so immediate that you become this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become other.</v>

779
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.330
<v Speaker 2>You become an outsider at like in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next morning when he went back,</v>

780
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I rang the doorbell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rang the doorbell and I lived in that</v>

781
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:33.560
<v Speaker 2>house from the day I was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

782
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Felt like you had to ring the doorbell</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not my world.</v>

783
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

784
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris was like,</v>

785
00:35:39.661 --> 00:35:40.120
<v Speaker 1>why don't you think</v>

786
00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.190
<v Speaker 2>the doorbell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

787
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.340
<v Speaker 2>there's no other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing else like it.</v>

788
00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.960
<v Speaker 2>This is not our home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not.</v>

789
00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:50.140
<v Speaker 2>So we go and we're packing all of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

790
00:35:50.141 --> 00:35:52.180
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was awful just to.</v>

791
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I had been in those four months I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been so terrified of.</v>

792
00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Because I know knowing what was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just imagine you're going to lose</v>

793
00:36:00.941 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 2>everyone in your life that you're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to like,</v>

794
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.920
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to like how your</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents met and fell in love or like</v>

795
00:36:08.921 --> 00:36:13.870
<v Speaker 2>your grandparents and family recipes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>photos and memories and what did the</v>

796
00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:16.180
<v Speaker 2>House list?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like taking photos and voice</v>

797
00:36:16.181 --> 00:36:18.760
<v Speaker 2>recordings and just all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in every.</v>

798
00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.230
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

799
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.350
<v Speaker 2>it's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just um,</v>

800
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.580
<v Speaker 1>but did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there also like a feeling of relief?</v>

801
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Was there also a feeling of like we</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually did it.</v>

802
00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually happening.</v>

803
00:36:32.111 --> 00:36:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get away from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this isn't real.</v>

804
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I know this isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you understand that?</v>

805
00:36:36.491 --> 00:36:37.324
<v Speaker 1>It was a cult.</v>

806
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.410
<v Speaker 2>So I was really against and I still</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't attend not to use that word.</v>

807
00:36:41.411 --> 00:36:41.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

808
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:44.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a fine shorthand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess for some it there are aspects of</v>

809
00:36:44.471 --> 00:36:46.090
<v Speaker 2>the church that are not cultish for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

810
00:36:46.091 --> 00:36:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

811
00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.520
<v Speaker 2>like what I just kept saying like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

812
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:50.410
<v Speaker 2>they're not trying to get your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not trying to,</v>

813
00:36:50.411 --> 00:36:52.570
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not some charismatic leader trying to</v>

814
00:36:52.571 --> 00:36:54.700
<v Speaker 2>have sex with everybody's wives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>children or whatever.</v>

815
00:36:54.701 --> 00:36:57.730
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are definitely aspects that</v>

816
00:36:57.731 --> 00:36:59.560
<v Speaker 2>are cultish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you can't,</v>

817
00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.080
<v Speaker 2>there is no such thing as agreeing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree.</v>

818
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

819
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:08.030
<v Speaker 2>the penalty for disagreeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

820
00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.430
<v Speaker 2>is so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

821
00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.730
<v Speaker 2>so there are things like that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are definitely quote like,</v>

822
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.450
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was definitely,</v>

823
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I was not in that in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not okay with using that term for</v>

824
00:37:20.291 --> 00:37:21.124
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

825
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.380
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

826
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.100
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took a lot of time</v>

827
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.890
<v Speaker 1>and well it's a derogatory term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it represents is an ideology</v>

828
00:37:27.891 --> 00:37:30.950
<v Speaker 1>that a group subscribes to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't necessarily have to have all</v>

829
00:37:30.951 --> 00:37:34.310
<v Speaker 1>the negative ramifications of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology for the fit into the category</v>

830
00:37:34.311 --> 00:37:35.300
<v Speaker 1>of a call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

831
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

832
00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.110
<v Speaker 2>and I totally understand that now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why like,</v>

833
00:37:39.111 --> 00:37:40.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody says it,</v>

834
00:37:40.281 --> 00:37:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will say there are things that aren't</v>

835
00:37:43.211 --> 00:37:43.611
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

836
00:37:43.611 --> 00:37:46.340
<v Speaker 2>and explain what I think is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm also,</v>

837
00:37:46.341 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it every single time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I understand that it's the,</v>

838
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:54.360
<v Speaker 1>so you get all your stuff after you ring</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doorbell,</v>

839
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.200
<v Speaker 1>you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how do you like enter into the</v>

840
00:37:58.201 --> 00:38:00.570
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a job back then or did you</v>

841
00:38:00.571 --> 00:38:02.910
<v Speaker 1>have a job with the church?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the job of the church working for the</v>

842
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 1>law firm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's home job,</v>

843
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.983
<v Speaker 1>family</v>

844
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.940
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

845
00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.510
<v Speaker 2>just everything all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

846
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.760
<v Speaker 2>and then also of course you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a world that I had just spent my</v>

847
00:38:13.761 --> 00:38:15.050
<v Speaker 2>entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

848
00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:18.920
<v Speaker 2>protesting and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy when I look back now at,</v>

849
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.410
<v Speaker 2>at videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I couldn't do for a long time,</v>

850
00:38:21.411 --> 00:38:25.160
<v Speaker 2>but there's tons of videos and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews and documentaries that,</v>

851
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I'm,</v>

852
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm answering all these questions and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

853
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

854
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Were you there when Luther came to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the documentary?</v>

855
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Did you talk to him while he was there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both Times.</v>

856
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:36.230
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

857
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:40.270
<v Speaker 2>was the first time it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was really super nice.</v>

858
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

859
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:44.140
<v Speaker 2>he came and can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were like making egg rolls together</v>

860
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 2>and like going bowling and jumping on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trampoline and,</v>

861
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would come to pickathon and it was</v>

862
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 2>really funny because like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he came for three weeks but three</v>

863
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:55.630
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a month,</v>

864
00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.910
<v Speaker 2>like one month he came for a week in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next month,</v>

865
00:38:57.911 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 2>came for another week and then came</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

866
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 2>So the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't know anything about him or</v>

867
00:39:02.651 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 2>who he was really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I knew it was one of the BBC</v>

868
00:39:04.331 --> 00:39:05.600
<v Speaker 2>obviously in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

869
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.800
<v Speaker 2>but I hadn't seen any of his stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then before he came the next time,</v>

870
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to be studying for a test</v>

871
00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:14.710
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in college and uh,</v>

872
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I was procrastinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I look on Youtube and find this</v>

873
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:20.230
<v Speaker 2>documentary that he did do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know the one though?</v>

874
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm white supremacy than Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis and the Nazis.</v>

875
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.440
<v Speaker 2>So I watched that entire documentary and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

876
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.110
<v Speaker 2>ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know what his angle is,</v>

877
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

878
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:32.770
<v Speaker 2>these poor kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were raised in this and they don't</v>

879
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 2>know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the time I was kind of indignant</v>

880
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.560
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a thinking person,</v>

881
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I at all my life growing up,</v>

882
00:39:41.591 --> 00:39:44.710
<v Speaker 2>like it wasn't ever just like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>explained about the soldier's funerals,</v>

883
00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:49.000
<v Speaker 2>like I never just just went along with</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like I wanted to understand</v>

884
00:39:49.001 --> 00:39:52.000
<v Speaker 2>why I needed to understand that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>scriptural and from the Bible and so if</v>

885
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.750
<v Speaker 2>you could show me that then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I am a curious person.</v>

886
00:39:55.751 --> 00:39:59.230
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just had never obviously</v>

887
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:03.580
<v Speaker 2>questioned like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most foundational premises of our</v>

888
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:05.920
<v Speaker 2>belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the Bible is the infallible</v>

889
00:40:05.921 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 2>word of God and Westboro Baptist Church</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the only ones who have,</v>

890
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 2>who can understand it correctly.</v>

891
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just never,</v>

892
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I never really got got past that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was in the Bible and it made sense</v>

893
00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:19.480
<v Speaker 2>to me then it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

894
00:40:19.481 --> 00:40:23.210
<v Speaker 2>so I was kind of indignant when I saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Lloyd was trying to do.</v>

895
00:40:23.211 --> 00:40:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just poor children and,</v>

896
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.160
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

897
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.500
<v Speaker 2>and I hadn't told my family and so then</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

898
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew about it,</v>

899
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

900
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was doing and I remember telling</v>

901
00:40:34.991 --> 00:40:37.300
<v Speaker 2>him something about how he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was insidious,</v>

902
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:40.240
<v Speaker 2>what he was doing because he was not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being honest.</v>

903
00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 2>He was being really friendly but not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being honest about what he really</v>

904
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 2>thought about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

905
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.080
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

906
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.330
<v Speaker 2>he said actually he actually addressed</v>
<v Speaker 2>it specifically in the second</v>

907
00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:53.200
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

908
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.470
<v Speaker 2>you've been saying this but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never pretended to agree with</v>

909
00:40:56.471 --> 00:40:57.304
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

910
00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I've been pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty honest about it and I'm an</v>

911
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:01.630
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>

912
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is right.</v>

913
00:41:03.041 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe the Bible is the word of</v>
<v Speaker 2>God than at a.</v>

914
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I,</v>

915
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:09.280
<v Speaker 2>of course then he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was exactly right.</v>

916
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

917
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I definitely couldn't see it at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

918
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you leave,</v>

919
00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.400
<v Speaker 2>you get out and then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you get a job?</v>

920
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 2>So I thought immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

921
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 2>my degree is in finance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went through business school,</v>

922
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:28.230
<v Speaker 2>all these people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.180
<v Speaker 2>start saving for retirement immediately</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it so,</v>

924
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.220
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe that the doom of the world</v>

925
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 2>was eminent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I never really did that.</v>

926
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.570
<v Speaker 1>So end of days type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

927
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were thinking that because of all</v>

928
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 1>the sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day there's going to be a reckoning</v>

929
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 1>and all the Christians are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>vanish.</v>

930
00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Destruction is eminent.</v>

931
00:41:47.931 --> 00:41:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Was one of our sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys ever watched that movie?</v>

932
00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Was terrible too terrible movies with</v>

<v Speaker 1>You should watch them said they were</v>

936
00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:03.370
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but they're so good.</v>

938
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.680
<v Speaker 1>They're so bad that they become like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

939
00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever meet Kirk Cameron?</v>

940
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to meet that dude.</v>

941
00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Mm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

942
00:42:15.751 --> 00:42:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really funny.</v>

943
00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you listened to Sam's Sam Harris'</v>

944
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.363
<v Speaker 2>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

945
00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:22.500
<v Speaker 2>So this episode with Lawrence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

946
00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.840
<v Speaker 2>He said something like Lawrence Wright</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

947
00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:25.640
<v Speaker 2>said something like that.</v>

948
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Got Through of going clear the book on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientology.</v>

949
00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

950
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.630
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

951
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.080
<v Speaker 2>he talks about Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the narcissism of small differences and</v>

952
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

953
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we other Christians,</v>

954
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 2>like where some of our biggest targets</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

955
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.830
<v Speaker 2>it would be like the smallest things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for instance,</v>

956
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:46.550
<v Speaker 2>there was like one church that we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of like very little</v>

957
00:42:46.551 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 2>affiliation with in the early days of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the picketing.</v>

958
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.340
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there are women started to cut</v>

959
00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 2>their hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are not allowed to cut their hair.</v>

960
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Cut your hair at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't allowed to cut her hair at</v>

961
00:42:58.251 --> 00:42:58.550
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

962
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:59.750
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

963
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.880
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of a Bible.</v>

964
00:43:01.881 --> 00:43:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Verse versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

965
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.410
<v Speaker 2>that's first corinthians 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14.</v>

966
00:43:06.411 --> 00:43:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually it says I'm a woman's hair is</v>

967
00:43:08.421 --> 00:43:09.260
<v Speaker 2>her glory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

968
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:12.170
<v Speaker 2>don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't nature itself teach you that.</v>

969
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:14.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a shame for a man to have long</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>

970
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.270
<v Speaker 2>but a woman's hair is her glory and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>given to her for a covering.</v>

971
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 2>So it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it says a long hair.</v>

972
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my grandmother interpreted that to</v>

973
00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:25.910
<v Speaker 2>mean uncut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

974
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:26.650
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

975
00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I did not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't believe in interpretation at</v>

976
00:43:28.611 --> 00:43:31.220
<v Speaker 2>the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the fact that he was adding</v>

977
00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 2>something into the Bible that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>there before because obviously you can</v>

978
00:43:34.581 --> 00:43:36.920
<v Speaker 2>have long hair without install,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut in.</v>

979
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:40.130
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like if long hair is good than</v>

980
00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:41.060
<v Speaker 2>uncut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better so.</v>

981
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.320
<v Speaker 1>And he had his rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

982
00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.890
<v Speaker 1>what about clothes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you reconcile the fact that</v>

983
00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:49.720
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to wear two</v>
<v Speaker 1>different types of cloth</v>

984
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.490
<v Speaker 2>so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

985
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the church sees this as a distinction</v>

986
00:43:54.871 --> 00:43:57.510
<v Speaker 2>between the ceremonial law of Moses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral law,</v>

987
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.080
<v Speaker 2>ceremonial laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mixed fabrics and keeping kosher</v>

988
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.520
<v Speaker 2>penalty by death of mixed fabrics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually can't remember,</v>

989
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.930
<v Speaker 2>but we just simply preposterous like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

990
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.190
<v Speaker 2>We didn't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

991
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Because we thought these passages in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>new testament said you don't have to</v>

992
00:44:12.661 --> 00:44:16.090
<v Speaker 2>follow those ceremonial laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we didn't worry about it.</v>

993
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 1>But did you guys spend any time</v>
<v Speaker 1>researching the actual history of the</v>

994
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:21.710
<v Speaker 1>New Testament?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how it was constructed?</v>

995
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:23.920
<v Speaker 2>So not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean some.</v>

996
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not really because in our minds a</v>

997
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.290
<v Speaker 2>god is sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

998
00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>So the church believes predestination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so God controls</v>

999
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 3>everything and everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So God controlled the construction of</v>

1000
00:44:34.891 --> 00:44:36.720
<v Speaker 3>the new testament as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>

1001
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Even though it was done by men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was God's will to have it the.</v>

1002
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.590
<v Speaker 3>So it was all God's word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

1003
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How convenient.</v>

1004
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.460
<v Speaker 3>You just don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to ask those questions,</v>

1005
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.640
<v Speaker 3>but what about the fact that it was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Constantine wasn't even a Christian</v>

1006
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 3>until his death bed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that because God didn't want it to be</v>

1007
00:44:56.491 --> 00:44:57.810
<v Speaker 3>that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1008
00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.520
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's irrelevant.</v>

1009
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a nice sweet loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could just say that it's God's</v>

1010
00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:04.500
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God knew the entire time.</v>

1011
00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a bunch of men wrote it.</v>

1012
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they did,</v>

1013
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.600
<v Speaker 3>because God let them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the question is which version?</v>

1014
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Which is another question I sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>instinctively avoided.</v>

1015
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like atheists would ask this</v>
<v Speaker 3>question like why the King James version</v>

1016
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.800
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1017
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 3>you can't really answer it because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>grant said so,</v>

1018
00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:23.670
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not to say that my grandfather</v>

1019
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:28.350
<v Speaker 3>was the pastor pastor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pastor for the founded the Westboro</v>

1020
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Baptist church.</v>

1021
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think everybody kind of knows.</v>

1022
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:35.470
<v Speaker 3>So when I say grandpa was Grandpa Fred</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phelps.</v>

1023
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:36.753
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1024
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

1025
00:45:38.491 --> 00:45:43.491
<v Speaker 3>just wanted to close that loop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just like,</v>

1026
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:46.230
<v Speaker 3>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the thought process behind</v>

1027
00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:47.700
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just accepting that kind of stuff?</v>

1028
00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Like did your grandfather ever bring up</v>
<v Speaker 3>the even older versions of the Bible</v>

1029
00:45:51.781 --> 00:45:55.140
<v Speaker 3>that they were finding like what was his</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts on like the Dead Sea Scrolls</v>

1030
00:45:55.141 --> 00:45:57.540
<v Speaker 3>and things along those lines just didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>address.</v>

1031
00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.980
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because again,</v>

1032
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 3>it's all God's word anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's God's will.</v>

1033
00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:05.050
<v Speaker 3>It's God's word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>

1034
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:10.230
<v Speaker 3>It's so fascinating when someone's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>rigid with their belief system,</v>

1035
00:46:10.231 --> 00:46:11.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is it,</v>

1036
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:13.770
<v Speaker 3>and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as long as you believe that it's all</v>

1037
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:14.760
<v Speaker 3>God's will is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1038
00:46:14.761 --> 00:46:16.200
<v Speaker 3>well it's God's will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously,</v>

1039
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.970
<v Speaker 3>put the New Testament was written by</v>
<v Speaker 3>Constantine,</v>

1040
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of bishops and others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God's will and God,</v>

1041
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:25.020
<v Speaker 3>let them do it and not just let them do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1042
00:46:25.021 --> 00:46:26.410
<v Speaker 3>but caused him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>caused them,</v>

1043
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 3>forced it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made it happen.</v>

1044
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 3>He knows what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely every,</v>

1045
00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:35.271
<v Speaker 3>every word of our conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God allow all the sodomy and all the</v>

1046
00:46:35.551 --> 00:46:37.410
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does God allow that?</v>

1047
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.020
<v Speaker 3>So this is why I'm not a Christian</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1048
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.280
<v Speaker 3>You're confused and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the?</v>

1049
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's this passage in Romans nine.</v>

1050
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1051
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not the only reason I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1052
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:50.700
<v Speaker 3>but I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have real trouble with this.</v>

1053
00:46:50.701 --> 00:46:54.150
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still hard for me to say I think</v>

1054
00:46:54.151 --> 00:46:55.890
<v Speaker 3>this is evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think this is evil.</v>

1055
00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 3>There's this passage in enrollments nine</v>
<v Speaker 3>that talks about it gives us an analogy</v>

1056
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 3>of God as potter and humans as clay in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his hands,</v>

1057
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.660
<v Speaker 3>and he uses the example of Jacob and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Esau who in the Bible,</v>

1058
00:47:09.661 --> 00:47:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Jacob and Esau were twins and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1059
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:15.030
<v Speaker 3>they were yet in the womb before either</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them had done good or evil.</v>

1060
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:20.120
<v Speaker 3>God loved Jacob and hated Esau and it so</v>
<v Speaker 3>it paints this picture of God.</v>

1061
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:23.280
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if God willing to show his wrath</v>

1062
00:47:23.281 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 3>and make his power known,</v>
<v Speaker 3>endured with much long suffering,</v>

1063
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:28.950
<v Speaker 3>the vessels of wrath made for</v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction,</v>

1064
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 3>so it says,</v>

1065
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.220
<v Speaker 2>God created some people as vessels of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mercy,</v>

1066
00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 2>people that he loves and others as</v>
<v Speaker 2>vessels of wrath made for destruction,</v>

1067
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 2>so made for the express purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying them,</v>

1068
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.800
<v Speaker 2>torturing them in hell for eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and then so he paul,</v>

1069
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 2>who's writing he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he paints this picture,</v>

1070
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 2>God making you do all of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do and then blessing some and</v>

1071
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:56.620
<v Speaker 2>cursing others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

1072
00:47:56.621 --> 00:47:57.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

1073
00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask Me then why does God yet find fault</v>

1074
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.790
<v Speaker 2>for who is resisted as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1075
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.760
<v Speaker 2>So you guys making you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is he punishing you for it?</v>

1076
00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If God's Megan do a horrible thing and</v>

1077
00:48:08.491 --> 00:48:09.540
<v Speaker 1>you resist as well,</v>

1078
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:12.950
<v Speaker 2>you can't resist as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he makes you do it and then he</v>

1079
00:48:12.951 --> 00:48:16.580
<v Speaker 2>punishes you for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is you don't get to ask</v>

1080
00:48:16.581 --> 00:48:19.520
<v Speaker 2>that question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says nay,</v>

1081
00:48:19.521 --> 00:48:23.150
<v Speaker 2>but o man who are either applies against</v>
<v Speaker 2>God shall the thing formed,</v>

1082
00:48:23.151 --> 00:48:25.460
<v Speaker 2>say to him that formed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why Hast Thou made me this?</v>

1083
00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Can you just don't get to ask that</v>
<v Speaker 2>question?</v>

1084
00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:31.010
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say this is I've asked for.</v>

1085
00:48:31.011 --> 00:48:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I spent a long time talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians,</v>

1086
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:35.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1087
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:38.060
<v Speaker 2>people have mostly Christians because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously it's new testament,</v>

1088
00:48:38.061 --> 00:48:38.990
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1089
00:48:38.991 --> 00:48:42.620
<v Speaker 2>but also talking to Jewish people about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old testament and found so many of</v>

1090
00:48:42.621 --> 00:48:47.540
<v Speaker 2>the like interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many of our beliefs are not,</v>

1091
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.920
<v Speaker 2>they're not fully supported by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the Bible and that there are so many</v>

1092
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:54.410
<v Speaker 2>different ways of interpreting so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our,</v>

1093
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.350
<v Speaker 2>the more destructive of our beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one,</v>

1094
00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I have not found any explanation for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that passage.</v>

1095
00:49:00.321 --> 00:49:04.040
<v Speaker 2>That's anything that makes any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's consistent with the text and,</v>

1096
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.700
<v Speaker 2>and not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

1097
00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I couldn't ask that question</v>

1098
00:49:09.951 --> 00:49:12.050
<v Speaker 2>for so long when I was at the church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1099
00:49:12.051 --> 00:49:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have to accept this.</v>

1100
00:49:13.611 --> 00:49:18.611
<v Speaker 2>This is the truth and nothing that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel or think matters against it.</v>

1101
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I,</v>

1102
00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't not think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you cannot ask the questions.</v>

1103
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be so strict.</v>

1104
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 1>It's also strange when you read the</v>
<v Speaker 1>passages in the Bible,</v>

1105
00:49:32.861 --> 00:49:37.270
<v Speaker 1>in their vowel and thigh and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1106
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:40.990
<v Speaker 1>like what a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're reading something in a style</v>

1107
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.380
<v Speaker 1>of communicating and thinking that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even use anymore.</v>

1108
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Like how strange is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how like if you had a conversation</v>

1109
00:49:48.071 --> 00:49:52.120
<v Speaker 1>with a rational person and they started</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and thou and thy,</v>

1110
00:49:52.121 --> 00:49:53.950
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>

1111
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 1>why are you using those words?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on here?</v>

1112
00:49:56.381 --> 00:49:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Are you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like are you a crazy person?</v>

1113
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.750
<v Speaker 1>But as long as you're quoting some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient stuff,</v>

1114
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1115
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:06.100
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of highlights how bizarre</v>

1116
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 1>scripture really is and how bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideological imperatives,</v>

1117
00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:15.100
<v Speaker 1>these ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pathways that are just completely</v>

1118
00:50:15.101 --> 00:50:17.440
<v Speaker 1>rigid and carbon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to follow them,</v>

1119
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but then you're listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't,</v>

1120
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.050
<v Speaker 1>nobody even talks like this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is such a strange.</v>

1121
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:25.990
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't even talk like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when they wrote it,</v>

1122
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.540
<v Speaker 1>because you're with something that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in ancient Hebrew and then it was</v>

1123
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:34.130
<v Speaker 1>translated to Latin is translated into</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek and by the time it gets to English</v>

1124
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.121
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1125
00:50:35.121 --> 00:50:39.470
<v Speaker 1>what a terrible game of telephone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that the grape vine.</v>

1126
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>

1127
00:50:41.111 --> 00:50:43.960
<v Speaker 2>these are the questions that I never</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I could ask her that again,</v>

1128
00:50:43.961 --> 00:50:46.220
<v Speaker 2>that it didn't matter because if God or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1129
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.120
<v Speaker 2>for ordained all of it and then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't irrelevant.</v>

1130
00:50:49.121 --> 00:50:53.140
<v Speaker 2>But there's also A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like there is so in this,</v>

1131
00:50:53.141 --> 00:50:55.570
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to Sam Harris about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>this morning.</v>

1132
00:50:55.571 --> 00:50:58.240
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many things in the Bible that</v>

1133
00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I find so much good there also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unlike the language is something</v>

1134
00:51:02.591 --> 00:51:03.311
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1135
00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds so weird to people but</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a lot of people,</v>

1136
00:51:06.011 --> 00:51:07.510
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the King James,</v>

1137
00:51:07.511 --> 00:51:08.550
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up like,</v>

1138
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.100
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1139
00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.860
<v Speaker 2>my mother was reading this to us every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every night.</v>

1140
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.370
<v Speaker 2>And so these words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a passage.</v>

1141
00:51:15.371 --> 00:51:18.280
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that like talking to God,</v>

1142
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:23.310
<v Speaker 2>I found by words and I did eat them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were unto me the joy and rejoicing</v>

1143
00:51:23.531 --> 00:51:24.100
<v Speaker 2>of my heart.</v>

1144
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was this thing where I loved it.</v>

1145
00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:29.650
<v Speaker 2>I loved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved these ideas.</v>

1146
00:51:29.651 --> 00:51:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I thought I thought it was the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was like the definition</v>

1147
00:51:34.031 --> 00:51:36.310
<v Speaker 2>of goodness because God did it and God</v>
<v Speaker 2>said it.</v>

1148
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.110
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even now,</v>

1149
00:51:38.111 --> 00:51:40.600
<v Speaker 2>like there's this one passage that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really love.</v>

1150
00:51:40.601 --> 00:51:41.434
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1151
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.920
<v Speaker 2>by long forbearing as a prince persuaded</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a soft tongue break at the bone that</v>

1152
00:51:47.681 --> 00:51:48.514
<v Speaker 2>lasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>

1153
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.580
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a soft tongue break at the bone</v>

1154
00:51:51.581 --> 00:51:52.450
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that phrase.</v>

1155
00:51:52.451 --> 00:51:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I love the imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the like,</v>

1156
00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:58.240
<v Speaker 2>cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this Ted talk a few months ago</v>

1157
00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.280
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1158
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:01.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1159
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:05.050
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of about this like modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>political discourse,</v>

1160
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.180
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tribalism,</v>

1161
00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.320
<v Speaker 2>this is becoming this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1162
00:52:08.321 --> 00:52:12.140
<v Speaker 2>these calcified positions and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and failures of empathy and,</v>

1163
00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:14.043
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1164
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:17.690
<v Speaker 2>like people think that because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1165
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.490
<v Speaker 2>they're so sure that they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that their position is the right</v>

1166
00:52:21.491 --> 00:52:24.430
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're willing to talk to the other</v>

1167
00:52:24.431 --> 00:52:27.160
<v Speaker 2>side in ways that they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1168
00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:29.680
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way that I did at the church.</v>

1169
00:52:29.681 --> 00:52:31.210
<v Speaker 2>It's the way that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1170
00:52:31.211 --> 00:52:33.160
<v Speaker 2>that dismissive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>condescending,</v>

1171
00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:36.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a hostile,</v>

1172
00:52:36.011 --> 00:52:36.844
<v Speaker 2>aggressive.</v>

1173
00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:41.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not it.</v>

1174
00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.500
<v Speaker 2>When people don't respond to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they respond.</v>

1175
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:47.470
<v Speaker 2>It's whole complimentary behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1176
00:52:47.471 --> 00:52:49.420
<v Speaker 2>So when somebody approaches you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way,</v>

1177
00:52:49.421 --> 00:52:52.480
<v Speaker 2>you tend to respond in kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody comes to you in kindness</v>

1178
00:52:52.481 --> 00:52:54.640
<v Speaker 2>and compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tend to respond,</v>

1179
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:55.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1180
00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:58.900
<v Speaker 2>in that way also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you are angry and aggressive</v>

1181
00:52:58.901 --> 00:53:01.060
<v Speaker 2>and hostile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it just elicits the same reaction.</v>

1182
00:53:01.061 --> 00:53:04.270
<v Speaker 2>People get defensive and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1183
00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.170
<v Speaker 2>that verse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that verse.</v>

1184
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful verse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1185
00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:12.881
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously some wisdom from what</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people were writing down and</v>

1186
00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.600
<v Speaker 1>trying to translate what that wisdom</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1187
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:19.940
<v Speaker 1>There was some really fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastures to me.</v>

1188
00:53:19.941 --> 00:53:24.110
<v Speaker 1>It's always been most fascinating as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>time capsule,</v>

1189
00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:25.850
<v Speaker 1>like when read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1190
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:26.311
<v Speaker 1>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1191
00:53:26.311 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 1>regardless of who translated this</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard,</v>

1192
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:34.310
<v Speaker 1>this is still a thousand year old book</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the very least in terms of,</v>

1193
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 2000 years old.</v>

1194
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Like that alone is really amazing when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're reading the thoughts and the</v>

1195
00:53:42.061 --> 00:53:47.061
<v Speaker 1>ideas of how someone was perceiving the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world 2000 years ago or roughly,</v>

1196
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to it where you are.</v>

1197
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:56.090
<v Speaker 1>It also solidifies in my mind how</v>
<v Speaker 1>briefly human beings have been conscious</v>

1198
00:53:57.391 --> 00:54:02.391
<v Speaker 1>of their time here on earth 2000 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago is not very long.</v>

1199
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like an incredibly long time</v>

1200
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:08.640
<v Speaker 1>for a personal one of those to be 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of the age of the,</v>

1201
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the human race itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think they just backdated again,</v>

1202
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:18.140
<v Speaker 1>they found a new discovery where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed back the oldest known human being</v>

1203
00:54:18.661 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 1>by over a thousand dollars 100,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

1204
00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:24.510
<v Speaker 1>some new discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new bones.</v>

1205
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they know modern human beings</v>

1206
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:30.480
<v Speaker 1>have been around for at least 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1207
00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:32.280
<v Speaker 1>It's probably going to go back even</v>
<v Speaker 1>further than that.</v>

1208
00:54:32.281 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1209
00:54:33.601 --> 00:54:34.434
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1210
00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:36.020
<v Speaker 2>but that's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was gonna say,</v>

1211
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I actually think I'm Rob Wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oldest Homo sapiens species discovered</v>

1212
00:54:40.701 --> 00:54:41.534
<v Speaker 2>in Morocco.</v>

1213
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>

1214
00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:47.891
<v Speaker 1>Time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1215
00:54:47.891 --> 00:54:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At 100,000 years to the history of</v>

1216
00:54:51.741 --> 00:54:55.130
<v Speaker 1>modern human fossils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bones are from early anatomically</v>

1217
00:54:55.131 --> 00:54:56.870
<v Speaker 1>modern humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own species,</v>

1218
00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:01.820
<v Speaker 1>homo sapiens with a mixture of modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>and primitive traits and international</v>

1219
00:55:01.821 --> 00:55:04.670
<v Speaker 1>team of anthropologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paleontologists and evolutionary</v>

1220
00:55:04.671 --> 00:55:09.650
<v Speaker 1>scientists report a pair of papers</v>
<v Speaker 1>published on Wednesday and the Journal</v>

1221
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Medicine Journal Nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1222
00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.740
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the,</v>

1223
00:55:12.741 --> 00:55:15.350
<v Speaker 1>what was evolution talk like back at</v>
<v Speaker 1>home?</v>

1224
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't believe it to how old?</v>

1225
00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.210
<v Speaker 2>What about dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1226
00:55:19.211 --> 00:55:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Young Earth creationism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the elders said something like,</v>

1227
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.830
<v Speaker 2>God brought baby dinos on the arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1228
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make it.</v>

1229
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they drown.</v>

1230
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>

1231
00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.820
<v Speaker 2>it was not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>

1232
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:39.500
<v Speaker 2>anytime there was any conflict or</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparent conflicts between the Bible</v>

1233
00:55:39.671 --> 00:55:40.680
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1234
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.370
<v Speaker 2>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical evidence,</v>

1235
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:45.440
<v Speaker 2>we just believe the Bible like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's worse.</v>

1236
00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Bible.</v>

1237
00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you're saying about like</v>

1238
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:50.890
<v Speaker 2>ancient wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was this,</v>

1239
00:55:50.891 --> 00:55:51.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my husband,</v>

1240
00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:54.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got super into Paleo a few years ago</v>

1241
00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.450
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he read John [inaudible] book,</v>

1242
00:55:58.451 --> 00:56:02.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Paleo manifesto and he made me read</v>

1243
00:56:02.381 --> 00:56:06.190
<v Speaker 2>one chapter of it and it was called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moses the microbiologist and Robb Wolf.</v>

1244
00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rob Wolf mentioned it on your podcast,</v>

1245
00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:10.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever that was a few weeks ago or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1246
00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so fascinating to like when you</v>

1247
00:56:14.621 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 2>read Leviticus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like without the context of,</v>

1248
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and then they were living in,</v>

1249
00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it,</v>

1250
00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:23.080
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it just seemed.</v>

1251
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I remember whenever we read be reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>this at home,</v>

1252
00:56:25.481 --> 00:56:26.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a family,</v>

1253
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 2>like there was just so much of it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem like incredibly tedious and like,</v>

1254
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 2>what are we supposed to be getting out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this?</v>

1255
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't even understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I read this chapter and it was so,</v>

1256
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:38.950
<v Speaker 2>like incredible talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish,</v>

1257
00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:43.990
<v Speaker 2>the rules about washing your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course the simplest and most</v>

1258
00:56:43.991 --> 00:56:48.991
<v Speaker 2>effective form of a hygiene and prevent</v>
<v Speaker 2>preventing pathogens and infectious</v>

1259
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:50.620
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1260
00:56:50.621 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 2>so like super fascinating like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of those laws make sense like</v>

1261
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:58.060
<v Speaker 2>what you were allowed to eat and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't allowed to eat because um,</v>

1262
00:56:58.090 --> 00:56:59.080
<v Speaker 2>because of um,</v>

1263
00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.890
<v Speaker 1>not eating pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all sorts of parasites,</v>

1264
00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:04.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then not eating like cats because</v>

1265
00:57:04.281 --> 00:57:06.600
<v Speaker 2>cats eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rodents will also carry anyway,</v>

1266
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:09.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's like it's super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much detail in there and it</v>

1267
00:57:09.501 --> 00:57:11.480
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly fascinating.</v>

1268
00:57:11.481 --> 00:57:14.660
<v Speaker 2>So like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think about just the history of</v>

1269
00:57:14.661 --> 00:57:18.860
<v Speaker 2>humanity and how this book has shaped</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's lives for so long,</v>

1270
00:57:18.861 --> 00:57:19.694
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1271
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:21.050
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1272
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:23.210
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really fascinating.</v>

1273
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is an amazing piece of historical</v>

1274
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 1>literature and it's amazing that so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have,</v>

1275
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:33.100
<v Speaker 1>not to use the term but use it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>gospel.</v>

1276
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the right term,</v>

1277
00:57:34.481 --> 00:57:36.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Pat,</v>

1278
00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I always feel strange whenever I read</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1279
00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:40.140
<v Speaker 1>whenever I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel strange.</v>

1280
00:57:40.141 --> 00:57:45.141
<v Speaker 1>So thinking about all the momentum and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the history that has been altered by</v>

1281
00:57:47.231 --> 00:57:51.500
<v Speaker 1>these words and by the application of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these words and your own history when</v>

1282
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:56.550
<v Speaker 1>your own life was essentially guided by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the application of the interpretation of</v>

1283
00:57:57.881 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 1>these words that were thousands of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

1284
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is bizarre.</v>

1285
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:07.150
<v Speaker 1>But then what's even more bizarre to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that twitter's would snapshot of it</v>

1286
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:12.510
<v Speaker 1>is that interacting with people through</v>
<v Speaker 1>online was this open forum exchange of</v>

1287
00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:16.130
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially in twitter where it says</v>

1288
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:17.620
<v Speaker 1>140 character limit.</v>

1289
00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1290
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:22.700
<v Speaker 2>It really bugs me that twitter gets such</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad rap</v>

1291
00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.200
<v Speaker 1>because it has saved your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have a teacher.</v>

1292
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:27.530
<v Speaker 1>This is twitter saved my life.</v>

1293
00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1294
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I think I might actually do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

1295
00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I went to twitter actually a year ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going next week to um,</v>

1296
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:36.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't drain their trust and safety</v>
<v Speaker 2>council.</v>

1297
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1298
00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:41.580
<v Speaker 1>That's always sounds so orwellian to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I found out some of the people that</v>

1299
00:58:41.581 --> 00:58:46.020
<v Speaker 1>are on it and they're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of bs,</v>

1300
00:58:46.021 --> 00:58:48.630
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior nonsense going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that</v>

1301
00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:52.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely not on the censorship or</v>

1302
00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:55.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to like stop people like shadow</v>

1303
00:58:55.221 --> 00:58:59.220
<v Speaker 2>banning people and I just don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough about all of that stuff,</v>

1304
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:02.990
<v Speaker 2>but obviously like I'm definitely on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of,</v>

1305
00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:04.760
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I want people to be able to</v>

1306
00:59:04.761 --> 00:59:06.560
<v Speaker 2>control their experiences on twitter of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>

1307
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:09.600
<v Speaker 2>So I mean you should be able to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1308
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:12.530
<v Speaker 2>definitely be able to block people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet people and all that stuff.</v>

1309
00:59:12.531 --> 00:59:13.790
<v Speaker 2>That's all well and good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1310
00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:14.540
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1311
00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:17.690
<v Speaker 2>so you should control your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been like trying to stop people from.</v>

1312
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously somebody when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's criminal,</v>

1313
00:59:20.631 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 2>when people threatening and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence and threats of violence,</v>

1314
00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that of course should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

1315
00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:27.420
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be allowed on the platform,</v>

1316
00:59:27.421 --> 00:59:29.100
<v Speaker 1>but I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And harassment,</v>

1317
00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:33.590
<v Speaker 1>if you're harassing people or trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get people to harass people like</v>

1318
00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.090
<v Speaker 1>soliciting harassment to others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1319
00:59:36.091 --> 00:59:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

1320
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Go after Megan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't believe in the gods word</v>

1321
00:59:39.691 --> 00:59:40.860
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go get her.</v>

1322
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Like those kinds of Oregon using the</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform for any sort of a fucked up way</v>

1323
00:59:44.491 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1324
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1325
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 2>but I'm obviously much more on the side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the importance of the marketplace of</v>

1326
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:52.940
<v Speaker 2>ideas and being able to do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1327
00:59:52.941 --> 00:59:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Because people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people,</v>

1328
00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:56.720
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We come to these,</v>

1329
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.850
<v Speaker 2>we come to bat ideas in so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

1330
00:59:58.851 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we argue ourselves there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we're influenced by other</v>

1331
01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:04.190
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way out of it isn't to pretend</v>

1332
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.620
<v Speaker 2>or try to push it out of the public</v>
<v Speaker 2>sphere.</v>

1333
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.770
<v Speaker 2>It's to engage it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to shed light on it and to publicly</v>

1334
01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 2>argue against it so that other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who might be tempted or starting to go</v>

1335
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:15.530
<v Speaker 2>down that path will understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1336
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.830
<v Speaker 2>we need to have people who can</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate and defend good principles</v>

1337
01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:23.120
<v Speaker 2>and to argue against bad ones so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good ones will rise to the top.</v>

1338
01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's everything.</v>

1339
01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>That's human discourse in general and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the main problems with</v>

1340
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>really rigid ideologies that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>room for that and then you just like,</v>

1341
01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 1>it's God's word and this is it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have to trust it.</v>

1342
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And there's baby dinosaurs on the Ark</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just kind of go,</v>

1343
01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:40.220
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

1344
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.083
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1345
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's Mormon and she was</v>

1346
01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:48.941
<v Speaker 1>Mormon for a long time and then she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just sort of drifted away.</v>

1347
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>They decided it was kind of silly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they read into the church and they</v>

1348
01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>started like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did this get started?</v>

1349
01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And they just decided maybe we should</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend some time away.</v>

1350
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>And so they eventually left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that she said that</v>

1351
01:01:02.691 --> 01:01:04.220
<v Speaker 1>was really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

1352
01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really susceptible to like,</v>

1353
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>like someone who's a bullshit artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like she's like,</v>

1354
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm easily influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like too much.</v>

1355
01:01:15.021 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>So she's like growing up in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental environment is</v>

1356
01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where you don't question anything</v>

1357
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>and you just go along with the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

1358
01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it leaves me really vulnerable to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>being influenced.</v>

1359
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:28.761
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1360
01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>that is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1361
01:01:30.171 --> 01:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm really gullible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1362
01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like her,</v>

1363
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>her structure of how she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her questioning muscles were like wobbly</v>

1364
01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>and we can atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't have any pep to them.</v>

1365
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the word I use also about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decision making because if somebody</v>

1366
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:47.150
<v Speaker 2>else was always making the decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you never have to,</v>

1367
01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.640
<v Speaker 2>like the is already there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to figure it out for</v>

1368
01:01:49.641 --> 01:01:51.740
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on both of those friends,</v>

1369
01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:55.850
<v Speaker 2>like when after my sister and I left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was this sort of like more or less</v>

1370
01:01:55.851 --> 01:01:57.290
<v Speaker 2>constant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1371
01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:00.500
<v Speaker 2>processing and asking these questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I would have these.</v>

1372
01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.990
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1373
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:04.910
<v Speaker 2>like back to gay people after we left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1374
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1375
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I got this guy wrote an open letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he'd been somebody that I sparred</v>

1376
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:11.000
<v Speaker 2>with on twitter quite a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1377
01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:13.370
<v Speaker 2>and threaten to pick it but never</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually did.</v>

1378
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:18.620
<v Speaker 2>He wrote an open letter after a in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>sister and I published this statement</v>

1379
01:02:18.621 --> 01:02:20.970
<v Speaker 2>essentially just the short explanation</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

1380
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:24.690
<v Speaker 2>we had left and that we regretted</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting people.</v>

1381
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:25.650
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1382
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:28.950
<v Speaker 2>we were trying to find a better way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>live basically just because we'd been so</v>

1383
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:32.310
<v Speaker 2>public at the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like we had to,</v>

1384
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:33.283
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like.</v>

1385
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>And also it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1386
01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:37.920
<v Speaker 2>so we did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote this open letter and response</v>

1387
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 2>and invited us to church over at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood United Methodist Church.</v>

1388
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.020
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

1389
01:02:44.021 --> 01:02:47.660
<v Speaker 2>he was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is gay and Church Goer.</v>

1390
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1391
01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 2>And how's he working out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reconcile.</v>

1392
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Go stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>

1393
01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:54.360
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

1394
01:02:54.361 --> 01:02:56.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know earlier,</v>

1395
01:02:56.371 --> 01:02:59.040
<v Speaker 2>like just the accepting like whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find in the Bible,</v>

1396
01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:02.310
<v Speaker 2>so you therefore you have to accept it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just go along with it no matter what</v>

1397
01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>evidence or whatever seems to contradict</v>
<v Speaker 2>it or whatever.</v>

1398
01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna say like I encountered</v>
<v Speaker 2>people for the first time,</v>

1399
01:03:09.151 --> 01:03:10.270
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1400
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:12.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually not sure how he reconciles.</v>

1401
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it has to do with the love of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus and,</v>

1402
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.030
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grace and you know,</v>

1403
01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.550
<v Speaker 2>just that's the Old Testament and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1404
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly New Testament refers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does homosexual.</v>

1405
01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I honestly don't really know a la La,</v>

1406
01:03:28.351 --> 01:03:29.184
<v Speaker 2>La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not listening.</v>

1407
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I was going to say.</v>

1408
01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember encountering for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time Christians who were willing</v>

1409
01:03:35.071 --> 01:03:35.831
<v Speaker 2>to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1410
01:03:35.831 --> 01:03:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I know the Bible says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that applied at a different</v>

1411
01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:40.950
<v Speaker 2>time or I just don't believe that.</v>

1412
01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know more than one that has a,</v>

1413
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:48.300
<v Speaker 1>an old testament bible quote tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1414
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to read the whole book man.</v>

1415
01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1416
01:03:54.310 --> 01:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm really into what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1417
01:03:55.481 --> 01:03:57.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even listening,</v>

1418
01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:00.780
<v Speaker 2>but like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

1419
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.810
<v Speaker 2>it's honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1420
01:04:01.811 --> 01:04:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to say like,</v>

1421
01:04:03.851 --> 01:04:04.650
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1422
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is good and to,</v>

1423
01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.910
<v Speaker 2>but to have the wherewithal to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1424
01:04:09.911 --> 01:04:12.070
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is good and this is wrong.</v>

1425
01:04:12.071 --> 01:04:13.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a Bible verse actually that</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1426
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evil and love the good.</v>

1427
01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:18.580
<v Speaker 2>And I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1428
01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.760
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1429
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:21.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not never,</v>

1430
01:04:21.221 --> 01:04:22.780
<v Speaker 2>it's never about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it's about people.</v>

1431
01:04:22.781 --> 01:04:25.330
<v Speaker 2>It's about ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think there are a lot of bad</v>

1432
01:04:25.331 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1433
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:28.710
<v Speaker 2>and so I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well anyways,</v>

1434
01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.390
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot about ideas and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that get defined by bad</v>

1435
01:04:32.391 --> 01:04:34.880
<v Speaker 1>ideas and I think in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that way,</v>

1436
01:04:34.881 --> 01:04:39.290
<v Speaker 1>the Bible is a lot like people in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take a really good person who</v>

1437
01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:41.660
<v Speaker 1>does something stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does something wrong,</v>

1438
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't mean they're a bad pr.</v>

1439
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:47.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are this time you ran this red light</v>

1440
01:04:47.661 --> 01:04:51.080
<v Speaker 1>and hit that car or you are this time</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you,</v>

1441
01:04:51.110 --> 01:04:52.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you did that you shouldn't have</v>

1442
01:04:52.701 --> 01:04:55.220
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you may have done impulsively or</v>

1443
01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.370
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily define you.</v>

1444
01:04:58.371 --> 01:05:02.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a moment in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we love to find moments like that</v>

1445
01:05:02.241 --> 01:05:03.320
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's you,</v>

1446
01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.600
<v Speaker 1>tiger woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is you.</v>

1447
01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:08.270
<v Speaker 1>You are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like you now.</v>

1448
01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no matter what you do in the</v>

1449
01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:13.610
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be defined by this moment that</v>

1450
01:05:13.611 --> 01:05:16.670
<v Speaker 1>you got drunk and drove a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1451
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:17.503
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1452
01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

1453
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>so frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know now like,</v>

1454
01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1455
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>the tendency now on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you read Jon Ronson's book?</v>

1456
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

1457
01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I hear do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:28.890
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've been publicly shamed like</v>

1459
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tendency that too.</v>

1460
01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my family like this,</v>

1461
01:05:33.201 --> 01:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1462
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>it was incredibly judgmental like even</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the church and became even more</v>

1463
01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>so towards the end of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1464
01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>before my sister and I left where like</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

1465
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.730
<v Speaker 1>this is the way that my sister and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started talking about it after we left,</v>

1466
01:05:46.731 --> 01:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like everything that looks bad is</v>

1467
01:05:48.701 --> 01:05:50.620
<v Speaker 1>bad and everything that looks good is</v>
<v Speaker 1>also bad.</v>

1468
01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you once you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>

1469
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:56.860
<v Speaker 1>if you identify a person as some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>troublemaker or you know,</v>

1470
01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:59.560
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just read into the worst</v>

1471
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:03.970
<v Speaker 1>intentions and motives when it's just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely that it's,</v>

1472
01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.330
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that like to generalize the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst.</v>

1473
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1474
01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting under your jaw.</v>

1475
01:06:09.171 --> 01:06:10.960
<v Speaker 1>And so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

1476
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

1477
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I kind of talked a little bit soft to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

1478
01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.960
<v Speaker 2>but you just don't want to generalize</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst about people and and make it</v>

1479
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:22.310
<v Speaker 2>make that their entire identity</v>

1480
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:26.250
<v Speaker 1>and there's a tendency to do that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are also there.</v>

1481
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:29.650
<v Speaker 1>There are terrified of scrutiny coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>their way.</v>

1482
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:33.520
<v Speaker 1>So what they do is they cast it all out</v>
<v Speaker 1>on others instead of looking internally,</v>

1483
01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>sort of looking at their own actions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue,</v>

1484
01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:40.180
<v Speaker 1>they looked at find a fault in a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that is their main focus and</v>

1485
01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you see people doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is why tabloid journalism is so</v>

1486
01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:45.070
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to the supermarket and you know,</v>

1487
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.920
<v Speaker 1>you know Matt Lauer's doing cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh look at that.</v>

1488
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:49.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's like right there in front of</v>

1489
01:06:49.511 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 1>you whether or not it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

1490
01:06:50.981 --> 01:06:53.500
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see how he got caught.</v>

1491
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.350
<v Speaker 1>What did he do wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this person is doing,</v>

1492
01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:58.720
<v Speaker 1>drugs or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever anybody's doing,</v>

1493
01:06:58.721 --> 01:07:02.460
<v Speaker 1>she's leaving him for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a lesbian and this,</v>

1494
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.790
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff that we love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone is someone did something</v>

1495
01:07:06.791 --> 01:07:08.440
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everybody's watching it.</v>

1496
01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:13.360
<v Speaker 1>We love it because we all know that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy shit that we've done that if</v>

1497
01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:16.000
<v Speaker 1>somebody found it and then everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>started talking about,</v>

1498
01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:19.300
<v Speaker 1>you'd be horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you see someone getting caught</v>

1499
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:22.780
<v Speaker 1>publicly shamed and then this giant pile</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1500
01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>it's very attractive to us in some weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>way and almost cathartic and almost a</v>

1501
01:07:27.401 --> 01:07:29.770
<v Speaker 1>relief that it's not us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1502
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:31.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's so dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1503
01:07:31.691 --> 01:07:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Because it is when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you make it,</v>

1504
01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:38.800
<v Speaker 2>when the penalty for speaking up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly miss stepping in these various</v>

1505
01:07:38.801 --> 01:07:42.640
<v Speaker 2>lists and I don't the whole idea of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>microaggressions,</v>

1506
01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:47.530
<v Speaker 2>like I feel like fundamentally like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>this like,</v>

1507
01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:50.680
<v Speaker 2>and I understand like I'm not saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think it's really important.</v>

1508
01:07:50.681 --> 01:07:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Like I said this so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how we talk to people,</v>

1509
01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:58.030
<v Speaker 2>like it matters how you talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we're always looking for,</v>

1510
01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.490
<v Speaker 2>for offense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to find it.</v>

1511
01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:04.060
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so the problem is when people say</v>

1512
01:08:04.061 --> 01:08:08.200
<v Speaker 2>something maybe not quite an exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right way or they like the way that we</v>

1513
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.320
<v Speaker 2>punish people when we make the penalties</v>
<v Speaker 2>so high,</v>

1514
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:12.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1515
01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:16.670
<v Speaker 2>So just to go back to John's John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronson's book that Justine Sacco,</v>

1516
01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.860
<v Speaker 3>she tasteless joke on twitter to her 170</v>
<v Speaker 3>followers or whatever,</v>

1517
01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 3>and then it blows up and her entire life</v>
<v Speaker 3>is over.</v>

1518
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:27.110
<v Speaker 3>People don't know the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you remember the joke?</v>

1519
01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1520
01:08:29.190 --> 01:08:31.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hope I don't get aids.</v>

1521
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm white.</v>

1522
01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1523
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:38.300
<v Speaker 3>And that turned her life inside out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1524
01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.480
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying like,</v>

1525
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:45.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that there has to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>more to get biblical grace.</v>

1526
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this,</v>

1527
01:08:47.301 --> 01:08:48.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this writer that I love</v>

1528
01:08:48.801 --> 01:08:50.600
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she says that,</v>

1529
01:08:50.601 --> 01:08:52.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the language of public discourse has</v>

1530
01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 3>lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1531
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.430
<v Speaker 3>the house she put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's public discourse has lost the</v>

1532
01:08:58.431 --> 01:09:02.930
<v Speaker 3>language of generosity like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that I think that's really,</v>

1533
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.030
<v Speaker 3>it's really terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like so when you make the cost of</v>

1534
01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:08.660
<v Speaker 3>misspeaking or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or have have maybe not saying things in</v>

1535
01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 3>exactly the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we make that cost so high.</v>

1536
01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:15.200
<v Speaker 3>What it does is it pushes out moderates</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what you end up with people on both,</v>

1537
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:17.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two ends of these extremes and they are</v>

1538
01:09:17.721 --> 01:09:21.020
<v Speaker 3>the only ones talking and then it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just again reinforces this,</v>

1539
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:21.900
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1540
01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:25.250
<v Speaker 3>calcification and us them and tribalism</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1541
01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.300
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1542
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.190
<v Speaker 3>it's dangerous.</v>

1543
01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I think you're 100 percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think there's something that's</v>

1544
01:09:30.641 --> 01:09:34.420
<v Speaker 1>going on where when you see someone do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something really stupid like Kathy</v>

1545
01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Griffin holding up ahead of Donald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>

1546
01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I think we realized that in our worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>day with our worst thought process,</v>

1547
01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:46.360
<v Speaker 1>worse circumstances that could easily be</v>
<v Speaker 1>us in the worst.</v>

1548
01:09:46.361 --> 01:09:50.350
<v Speaker 1>If you grew up in a fucked up way or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some imbalance in your personal</v>

1549
01:09:50.351 --> 01:09:54.040
<v Speaker 1>life or maybe have some chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>imbalance or you're depressed or,</v>

1550
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:58.300
<v Speaker 1>and then you make a poor judgement call</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you get reinforced by other people</v>

1551
01:09:58.301 --> 01:10:00.430
<v Speaker 1>around you that are fools as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing you know,</v>

1552
01:10:00.431 --> 01:10:05.431
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something dumb and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why we like watching people</v>

1553
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:09.430
<v Speaker 1>balance do handstands on the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings because we know that we've</v>

1554
01:10:09.431 --> 01:10:11.320
<v Speaker 1>taken risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know we've done something stupid.</v>

1555
01:10:11.321 --> 01:10:16.321
<v Speaker 1>You can identify those aspects of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and the other folks and when</v>

1556
01:10:16.331 --> 01:10:18.010
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

1557
01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:21.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of relief that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not you and there's a certain</v>

1558
01:10:21.071 --> 01:10:24.400
<v Speaker 1>amount of fascination of how will this</v>
<v Speaker 1>play out and a certainly how is this</v>

1559
01:10:24.401 --> 01:10:27.400
<v Speaker 1>person going to recover from this to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff is very,</v>

1560
01:10:27.401 --> 01:10:32.260
<v Speaker 1>very intoxicating to us as these tribal</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals that lived together and</v>

1561
01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:37.261
<v Speaker 1>understand how valuable it is to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the love and support of your peers and</v>

1562
01:10:39.701 --> 01:10:42.040
<v Speaker 1>then that hate is so dangerous.</v>

1563
01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.850
<v Speaker 1>The ostracizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ostracizing of the person from the</v>

1564
01:10:45.851 --> 01:10:49.060
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alienation of them from the social</v>

1565
01:10:49.061 --> 01:10:50.290
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1566
01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge that they have,</v>

1567
01:10:52.151 --> 01:10:54.730
<v Speaker 1>that people are talking about them all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time in an evil way.</v>

1568
01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's on American genius,</v>

1569
01:10:57.531 --> 01:11:01.360
<v Speaker 1>is going to burn in hell and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is going to be just eating away at</v>

1570
01:11:01.361 --> 01:11:04.420
<v Speaker 1>our and we know it and it's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why we like to concentrate on</v>

1571
01:11:04.421 --> 01:11:08.890
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of weird sort</v>

1572
01:11:08.891 --> 01:11:13.891
<v Speaker 1>of voyeurism that's involved in any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of a public misstep that people</v>

1573
01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:19.491
<v Speaker 1>have and then the pylon by in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just very,</v>

1574
01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:22.950
<v Speaker 1>very unhappy with their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when someone else does something</v>

1575
01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:27.240
<v Speaker 1>screwed up that they can take away some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the focus of their own missteps and</v>

1576
01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 1>focus it on this person and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and throw rocks.</v>

1577
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:34.410
<v Speaker 3>And there's also just the sense of have</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean righteousness,</v>

1578
01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The self righteousness,</v>

1579
01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:36.731
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1580
01:11:36.731 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is why there's a UGC.</v>

1581
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Silvermans new netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen it yet.</v>

1582
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she gets to a point and she's talking</v>

1583
01:11:45.691 --> 01:11:49.480
<v Speaker 3>about like going out to a picket at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Westboro picket and wow.</v>

1584
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.010
<v Speaker 3>And I actually had seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she talked about this on Bill Maher a</v>

1585
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.390
<v Speaker 3>few years ago too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just remember like,</v>

1586
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:56.310
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew her as this,</v>

1587
01:11:56.311 --> 01:11:59.430
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I of course know her anything specific</v>

1588
01:11:59.431 --> 01:12:00.630
<v Speaker 3>except for her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her comedy.</v>

1589
01:12:00.631 --> 01:12:03.870
<v Speaker 3>She seemed kind of just kind of loud and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little.</v>

1590
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd say things that would always make</v>

1591
01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:06.241
<v Speaker 3>me cringe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1592
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:08.160
<v Speaker 3>just very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like very blunt,</v>

1593
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:10.250
<v Speaker 1>you listened to her comedy while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the church.</v>

1594
01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little like,</v>

1595
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're,</v>

1596
01:12:13.331 --> 01:12:15.190
<v Speaker 3>they're really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're constantly,</v>

1597
01:12:15.191 --> 01:12:16.870
<v Speaker 3>they call themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the watchers,</v>

1598
01:12:16.871 --> 01:12:19.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they are looking around the landscape</v>

1599
01:12:19.121 --> 01:12:21.550
<v Speaker 3>and seeing like how the word of God</v>
<v Speaker 3>applies to all these people.</v>

1600
01:12:21.551 --> 01:12:24.850
<v Speaker 3>They have to in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to comment on what's going on.</v>

1601
01:12:24.851 --> 01:12:27.160
<v Speaker 3>They have to know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what people are saying and,</v>

1602
01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.850
<v Speaker 3>and the trends and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1603
01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.890
<v Speaker 3>and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1604
01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.200
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

1605
01:12:32.201 --> 01:12:33.790
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I saw her on del Mar,</v>

1606
01:12:33.791 --> 01:12:36.940
<v Speaker 3>I expected her to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1607
01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:40.310
<v Speaker 3>like hostile and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whatever about the church when we</v>

1608
01:12:40.311 --> 01:12:41.970
<v Speaker 3>started talking about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1609
01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:44.500
<v Speaker 3>what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what she said was,</v>

1610
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:45.550
<v Speaker 3>at least on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the special,</v>

1611
01:12:45.551 --> 01:12:49.570
<v Speaker 3>the way she put it was I am them like</v>
<v Speaker 3>she went out and was talking to members</v>

1612
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:54.520
<v Speaker 3>of my family and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said we have to see them as human.</v>

1613
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.690
<v Speaker 3>And she was kind to them on the picket</v>

1618
01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.680
<v Speaker 3>when she makes this joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1619
01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:10.150
<v Speaker 3>we have to see them as human and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they'll start to see us as human.</v>

1620
01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.660
<v Speaker 3>And the way she put it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the Netflix special was that I am.</v>

1621
01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Then I am the product of my experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so are they.</v>

1622
01:13:17.171 --> 01:13:21.000
<v Speaker 3>And the only way you can change those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things as to add to the,</v>

1623
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:24.700
<v Speaker 3>those experiences like to introduce like</v>
<v Speaker 3>David did on twitter with me and my</v>

1624
01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:27.520
<v Speaker 3>husband.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like introduce these ideas in ways that,</v>

1625
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.970
<v Speaker 3>that people can actually hear them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>be moved by them.</v>

1626
01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love to categorize people into these</v>

1627
01:13:33.981 --> 01:13:37.910
<v Speaker 1>rigid boxes that are unchangeable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are this person.</v>

1628
01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:40.790
<v Speaker 1>You will always be this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are my enemy and you think this and</v>

1629
01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:44.420
<v Speaker 1>you think that and you're a dirty</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal and you're a disgusting</v>

1630
01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have these weird ideological</v>

1631
01:13:48.051 --> 01:13:51.500
<v Speaker 1>boxes that we love to shove people into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect example of that.</v>

1632
01:13:51.501 --> 01:13:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were little kids and they grew</v>

1633
01:13:53.571 --> 01:13:55.340
<v Speaker 1>up in that church and they're seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

1634
01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:58.880
<v Speaker 1>do we really believe that they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the wherewithal and the</v>

1635
01:13:58.881 --> 01:14:03.080
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the full spectrum of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human behavior to say that this is wrong</v>

1636
01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:06.590
<v Speaker 1>and that we shouldn't be protesting at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gay person's funeral and we</v>

1637
01:14:06.591 --> 01:14:10.250
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be holding up these signs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say God hates fags because God hates</v>

1638
01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.340
<v Speaker 1>fags or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1639
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>are you right</v>

1640
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.010
<v Speaker 3>grandpa?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who would have the mind?</v>

1641
01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:20.580
<v Speaker 3>What's incredibly brave is that you deep</v>
<v Speaker 3>into your twenties have this revelation</v>

1642
01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:29.500
<v Speaker 3>and then have the courage to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I want to get back to that.</v>

1643
01:14:29.501 --> 01:14:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Like what was your job like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did,</v>

1644
01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:35.590
<v Speaker 3>what was the first job you got a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't get a job immediately.</v>

1645
01:14:35.591 --> 01:14:38.770
<v Speaker 3>I thought I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I have to be responsible.</v>

1646
01:14:38.771 --> 01:14:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Like of course I'm with my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we had some money saved,</v>

1647
01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:43.570
<v Speaker 3>just we lived at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have a lot of expenses,</v>

1648
01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:46.510
<v Speaker 3>like we used our money to travel across</v>
<v Speaker 3>the country picketing,</v>

1649
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:49.120
<v Speaker 3>but we still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we still had some money awareness.</v>

1650
01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 3>We have to get out there and piss people</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

1651
01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't always.</v>

1652
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.920
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I thought like it was always</v>

1653
01:14:56.921 --> 01:14:57.291
<v Speaker 3>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1654
01:14:57.291 --> 01:14:58.420
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going on this picket shape?</v>

1655
01:14:58.421 --> 01:14:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to Los Angeles.</v>

1656
01:15:00.150 --> 01:15:03.520
<v Speaker 3>It was just like a part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys used to picket scientology</v>

1657
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Elidel and we're doing it in clearwater</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to super boring.</v>

1658
01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Like there was nobody out there.</v>

1659
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:13.520
<v Speaker 3>You got to rank the pickets by like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1660
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:18.460
<v Speaker 3>George W dot Bush's second inauguration</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like insane and there's like</v>

1661
01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 3>scientology post nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of them are really rough to hold up</v>

1662
01:15:23.261 --> 01:15:24.094
<v Speaker 3>those signs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1663
01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Especially we had a sign that said thank</v>
<v Speaker 3>God for nine slash 11.</v>

1664
01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like we were stationed at the</v>

1665
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:34.390
<v Speaker 3>intersection of these three streets and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were blocked off for the parade.</v>

1666
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:38.110
<v Speaker 3>So like he finishes his inauguration</v>
<v Speaker 3>speech and this huge crowd of people,</v>

1667
01:15:38.111 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 3>like hundreds of that whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many thousands of people like flood</v>

1668
01:15:41.741 --> 01:15:43.780
<v Speaker 3>down this thing and then they're stuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>

1669
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.020
<v Speaker 3>in this intersection waiting to go right</v>
<v Speaker 3>past us on the sidewalk.</v>

1670
01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:50.710
<v Speaker 3>And so there was this a new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're seeing this like thank God for</v>

1671
01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11 and it was right after the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tsunami to a.</v>

1672
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:57.280
<v Speaker 3>So my mom had a son was holding the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God for the tsunamis or whatever</v>

1673
01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.460
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people are just enraged by the time</v>

1674
01:16:00.461 --> 01:16:02.830
<v Speaker 3>they actually got to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like we're standing like right at the</v>

1675
01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:05.140
<v Speaker 3>edge of these barricades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like so on the other side is the parade</v>

1676
01:16:05.141 --> 01:16:06.790
<v Speaker 3>route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like,</v>

1677
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:08.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were like jumping,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1684
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:23.530
<v Speaker 3>so like one of my cousins actually like</v>

1685
01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:26.170
<v Speaker 3>member and then it was like standing on</v>

1688
01:16:29.441 --> 01:16:30.040
<v Speaker 3>They're not worth it.</v>

1689
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.790
<v Speaker 3>They're not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with my cousin who was just because</v>

01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:38.620
<v Speaker 3>people and like the cops saying you guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't worth it.</v>

1692
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:39.520
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1693
01:16:39.521 --> 01:16:41.430
<v Speaker 3>pretending he was one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1694
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.850
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1698
01:16:49.211 --> 01:16:51.430
<v Speaker 3>back like what did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I will,</v>

1699
01:16:51.431 --> 01:16:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm holding my sons and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've talked myself into this</v>

1700
01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:56.680
<v Speaker 3>barricade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like there's nothing else he can do.</v>

1701
01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.450
<v Speaker 3>So He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was like,</v>

1702
01:16:58.470 --> 01:17:00.610
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should also say there were cops just</v>

1703
01:17:00.611 --> 01:17:02.210
<v Speaker 3>on the other side of the barricade just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1704
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:04.160
<v Speaker 3>like every five feet there was a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was.</v>

1705
01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:08.410
<v Speaker 3>So there was like maybe 14,000 cops in</v>
<v Speaker 3>DC that exercise first integration after</v>

1706
01:17:08.411 --> 01:17:09.740
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

1707
01:17:09.741 --> 01:17:10.590
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1708
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean the cops were mostly just</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing there like I look over and the</v>

1709
01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:16.570
<v Speaker 3>guy gets off and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1710
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.040
<v Speaker 3>my brother is standing next to me who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven or eight,</v>

1711
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 3>eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have been like early twenties</v>

1712
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:22.760
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1713
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:26.840
<v Speaker 3>this I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he jumped over the barricade</v>

1714
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:30.880
<v Speaker 3>because the way people were coming after</v>
<v Speaker 3>us and this cop like pulls out a,</v>

1715
01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:31.853
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1716
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:34.930
<v Speaker 3>club to and making us get back over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bar,</v>

1717
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:37.550
<v Speaker 3>like jump back over on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with these people who were,</v>

1718
01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.350
<v Speaker 3>and not really doing anything but it,</v>

1719
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:44.430
<v Speaker 1>it would you expect the cops to risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives even though you're obviously</v>

1720
01:17:44.431 --> 01:17:48.180
<v Speaker 1>provoking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're obviously putting yourself</v>

1721
01:17:48.181 --> 01:17:52.680
<v Speaker 1>in a situation where you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>something incredibly insulting and just</v>

1722
01:17:52.681 --> 01:17:56.580
<v Speaker 1>devastating to all these people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost friends or loved ones on nine slash</v>

1723
01:17:56.581 --> 01:18:00.330
<v Speaker 1>11 or in the tsunami or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or have family members that are gay.</v>

1724
01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you guys really expect the cops are</v>

1725
01:18:02.551 --> 01:18:05.580
<v Speaker 1>going to take the beating for you or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops are going to get involved?</v>

1726
01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.950
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that he was like,</v>

1727
01:18:07.951 --> 01:18:08.900
<v Speaker 1>it's their job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1728
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:11.370
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would never do what you did then.</v>

1729
01:18:11.371 --> 01:18:11.851
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1730
01:18:11.851 --> 01:18:13.820
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if someone passed some sort of a</v>

1731
01:18:13.821 --> 01:18:15.840
<v Speaker 1>loss and listen to you guys know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in for.</v>

1732
01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.930
<v Speaker 1>We have no desire to help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be no police presence.</v>

1733
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Would you still protest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1734
01:18:20.221 --> 01:18:22.410
<v Speaker 1>we did that and that some cops did</v>
<v Speaker 1>respond that way.</v>

1735
01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:25.020
<v Speaker 1>There'll be no police presence</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

1736
01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And some where was that at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't remember it.</v>

1737
01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.290
<v Speaker 1>But it happened more than once a month.</v>

1738
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:30.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1739
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:33.650
<v Speaker 3>And like sometimes the cops would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd say we're going to come to protest</v>

1740
01:18:33.651 --> 01:18:34.220
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1741
01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.630
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would say,</v>

1742
01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:37.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can come,</v>

1743
01:18:37.281 --> 01:18:41.000
<v Speaker 3>but you can't hold that sign or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't tell you step on the flag or</v>

1744
01:18:41.001 --> 01:18:42.230
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they'll tell us in advance.</v>

1745
01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they wait until we got this</v>
<v Speaker 3>step on the flag.</v>

1746
01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we desecrating the flag was a big,</v>

1747
01:18:47.171 --> 01:18:48.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw it as an idol and you know,</v>

1748
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:51.050
<v Speaker 3>the American flags and I don't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom got arrested.</v>

1749
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:53.840
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in Nebraska and um,</v>

1750
01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my little brother that were protesting a</v>

1751
01:18:56.971 --> 01:18:59.660
<v Speaker 3>soldier's funeral and we were like far</v>
<v Speaker 3>away from the church,</v>

1752
01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.680
<v Speaker 3>but there was a group of people on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other side of the street and they were</v>

1753
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:06.080
<v Speaker 3>all holding American flags all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1754
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:08.060
<v Speaker 3>from the road all the way up this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1755
01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:10.160
<v Speaker 3>the long entry to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the church.</v>

1756
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.720
<v Speaker 3>So we were quite far away and my brother</v>
<v Speaker 3>was nine years old at the time and he</v>

1757
01:19:14.721 --> 01:19:16.190
<v Speaker 3>did what he always did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a,</v>

1758
01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:17.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put down,</v>

1759
01:19:17.690 --> 01:19:20.360
<v Speaker 3>lay the American flag on the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand on top of it and hold a picket</v>

1760
01:19:20.361 --> 01:19:23.210
<v Speaker 3>sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And within like a couple of minutes,</v>

1761
01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:26.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nine cops showed up and started</v>

1762
01:19:26.631 --> 01:19:31.250
<v Speaker 3>talking about arresting my mother for</v>
<v Speaker 3>flag mutilation and contributing to the</v>

1763
01:19:31.251 --> 01:19:33.740
<v Speaker 3>delinquency of a minor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1764
01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.430
<v Speaker 3>so before they do the arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1765
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.110
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom and my uncle were both there and</v>

1766
01:19:39.111 --> 01:19:44.111
<v Speaker 3>they are both lawyers and my uncle's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Johnson versus Texas Supreme</v>

1767
01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Court said in that case that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1768
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:48.670
<v Speaker 3>you can even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can utilize,</v>

1769
01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:50.990
<v Speaker 3>not only can you mutilate a flag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can even burn it.</v>

1770
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:53.450
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's perfectly lawful.</v>

1771
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:56.870
<v Speaker 3>And one of the cops was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not in Texas,</v>

1772
01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:57.830
<v Speaker 3>we're in Nebraska.</v>

1773
01:19:58.790 --> 01:20:00.680
<v Speaker 3>So like this is obviously a supreme</v>
<v Speaker 3>court case.</v>

1774
01:20:00.681 --> 01:20:02.660
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said Supreme Court has</v>

1775
01:20:02.661 --> 01:20:05.360
<v Speaker 3>jurisdiction all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>

1776
01:20:05.361 --> 01:20:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the,</v>

1777
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:10.170
<v Speaker 3>the way that sometimes the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did,</v>

1778
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they were really good cops who</v>
<v Speaker 3>did their job more super professional</v>

1779
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:18.480
<v Speaker 3>and didn't let their beliefs about our</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious beliefs or their,</v>

1780
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.420
<v Speaker 3>what they thought about our message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in the way of them doing their job.</v>

1781
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:23.970
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they were threatened to</v>

1782
01:20:23.971 --> 01:20:24.820
<v Speaker 3>arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1783
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:26.310
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our parents,</v>

1784
01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 3>if they brought children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would take their children away from</v>

1785
01:20:28.981 --> 01:20:30.330
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1786
01:20:30.331 --> 01:20:31.620
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1787
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:35.370
<v Speaker 3>but we absolutely expected them to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>their job like that.</v>

1788
01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:39.230
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the supreme court.</v>

1789
01:20:39.490 --> 01:20:40.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1790
01:20:40.681 --> 01:20:43.590
<v Speaker 3>I know you're not justifying it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's</v>

1791
01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:45.880
<v Speaker 1>from the point of view of something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1792
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:47.820
<v Speaker 1>someone like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1793
01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I would say don't bring any cops there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1794
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.740
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start that kind of shit at a</v>

1795
01:20:53.741 --> 01:20:56.890
<v Speaker 1>funeral or for a soldier and a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people come by and beat your ass,</v>

1796
01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.370
<v Speaker 1>well then don't do that again because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pissing people off and you're</v>

1797
01:21:00.371 --> 01:21:02.230
<v Speaker 1>hurting their feelings and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with someone who's already</v>

1798
01:21:02.231 --> 01:21:05.520
<v Speaker 1>emotionally scarred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those cops need to be out there stopping</v>

1799
01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:09.190
<v Speaker 1>robberies and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking and entering into people's</v>

1800
01:21:09.191 --> 01:21:12.970
<v Speaker 1>houses and car jackings and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to be doing.</v>

1801
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:16.930
<v Speaker 1>They're not supposed to be like helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>out people who are intentionally</v>

1802
01:21:16.931 --> 01:21:20.590
<v Speaker 1>provoking and emotionally disturbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1803
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

1804
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:24.330
<v Speaker 3>so obviously from the treasury</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

1805
01:21:24.331 --> 01:21:27.690
<v Speaker 3>it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a sincerely held religious beliefs</v>

1806
01:21:27.691 --> 01:21:31.740
<v Speaker 3>and the first amendment like what good</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the first amendment like this?</v>

1807
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.633
<v Speaker 3>Obviously this,</v>

1808
01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:35.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a first amendment issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the car because the.</v>

1809
01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:39.220
<v Speaker 1>No one in an official position is saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot speak</v>

1810
01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.770
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So compare that to like the campus,</v>

1811
01:21:41.771 --> 01:21:43.400
<v Speaker 3>what's going on on these campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right where,</v>

1812
01:21:44.050 --> 01:21:45.670
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that the cops shouldn't be</v>

1813
01:21:45.671 --> 01:21:48.250
<v Speaker 3>there to protect those people there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're provoking people and making them</v>

1814
01:21:48.251 --> 01:21:49.020
<v Speaker 3>angry.</v>

1815
01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different sort of a scenario.</v>

1816
01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the cops should definitely be</v>

1817
01:21:54.361 --> 01:21:57.210
<v Speaker 1>there to prevent violence on campus for</v>
<v Speaker 1>several reasons.</v>

1818
01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.390
<v Speaker 1>One reason because I think you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with very young,</v>

1819
01:22:00.391 --> 01:22:05.391
<v Speaker 1>very impressionable people who make very</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor choices and feel justified because</v>

1820
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:09.300
<v Speaker 1>they're around a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>also have likeminded ideas,</v>

1821
01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 1>a lot of peer pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of diffusion of responsibility</v>

1822
01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:18.441
<v Speaker 1>that comes from these massive groups of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are acting and the mob</v>

1823
01:22:18.841 --> 01:22:21.180
<v Speaker 1>mentality that comes along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very,</v>

1824
01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.040
<v Speaker 1>very important to protect them from</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and it's a hot button issue.</v>

1825
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I think protesting at a soldier's</v>
<v Speaker 1>funeral is just gross.</v>

1826
01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:32.820
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you do.</v>

1827
01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I know you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1828
01:22:33.931 --> 01:22:37.230
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying I don't think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops have a responsibility to save you</v>

1829
01:22:37.231 --> 01:22:38.130
<v Speaker 1>from being gross.</v>

1830
01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1831
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1832
01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:42.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously this was a supreme</v>
<v Speaker 3>court case.</v>

1833
01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:44.020
<v Speaker 3>It became a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that,</v>

1834
01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:47.620
<v Speaker 3>that this was a case where we were sued</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the church?</v>

1835
01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember that.</v>

1836
01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:50.230
<v Speaker 1>And how did that play out?</v>

1837
01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.353
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1838
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:52.800
<v Speaker 3>it went the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1839
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:56.070
<v Speaker 3>they want a 10 point $9 million dollar</v>
<v Speaker 3>verdict against us at the trial court</v>

1840
01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:59.520
<v Speaker 3>and then it was reversed at the appeals</v>
<v Speaker 3>court and the Supreme Court said eight</v>

1841
01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:01.950
<v Speaker 3>to one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have the constitutional right for</v>

1842
01:23:01.951 --> 01:23:04.440
<v Speaker 3>them to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is their religious beliefs.</v>

1843
01:23:04.441 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 3>They have a right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially because,</v>

1844
01:23:06.341 --> 01:23:10.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes I will say like I</v>
<v Speaker 3>described to you that very first picket</v>

1845
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.140
<v Speaker 3>soldier's funeral picket that I went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was very close quarters,</v>

1846
01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were right up on top of them,</v>

1847
01:23:16.151 --> 01:23:18.370
<v Speaker 3>like if we had chosen to sing or when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1848
01:23:18.371 --> 01:23:18.900
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1849
01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:22.450
<v Speaker 3>they would have heard us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a lot of instances we were way</v>

1850
01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:23.470
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far away.</v>

1851
01:23:23.471 --> 01:23:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Like in that in the instance that went</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the supreme court,</v>

1852
01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:27.040
<v Speaker 3>they were more than a thousand feet</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1853
01:23:27.041 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 3>There was like a hill that the family</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't see church members,</v>

1854
01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:31.684
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

1855
01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:37.090
<v Speaker 3>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean they have a right to do it</v>

1856
01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.260
<v Speaker 3>will the church and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a right to do it,</v>

1857
01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:48.010
<v Speaker 3>say horrible things about someone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>just died or someone who lost a son or a</v>

1858
01:23:48.011 --> 01:23:49.690
<v Speaker 3>daughter and war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1859
01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I think obviously I don't think it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible that they do do it and that was</v>

1860
01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 3>actually one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know before my sister and I left,</v>

1861
01:23:55.541 --> 01:23:59.530
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't going to hold a sign that I</v>

1862
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:02.610
<v Speaker 3>didn't believe was true and I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go to any more funerals.</v>

1863
01:24:02.611 --> 01:24:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Protests were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But do you think that the police should.</v>

1864
01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're operating on tax dollars and</v>

1865
01:24:08.201 --> 01:24:10.340
<v Speaker 3>it's a limited amount of resource.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1866
01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.800
<v Speaker 3>we're taxpayers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1867
01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean sure you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you think the resources should go</v>

1868
01:24:14.981 --> 01:24:16.100
<v Speaker 3>to get out of the house?</v>

1869
01:24:16.170 --> 01:24:16.781
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1870
01:24:16.781 --> 01:24:17.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1871
01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:21.310
<v Speaker 3>But do you think that really the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cops,</v>

1872
01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:24.940
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An intelligent and adequate and fair use</v>

1873
01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:28.540
<v Speaker 3>of resources to go and protect a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of troublemakers.</v>

1874
01:24:29.710 --> 01:24:31.660
<v Speaker 3>So it depends on what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you,</v>

1875
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.010
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel about the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>amendment?</v>

1876
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Like at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1877
01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:35.860
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the principle of the thing rather</v>

1878
01:24:35.861 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 3>than the applications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is just one application,</v>

1879
01:24:38.411 --> 01:24:41.950
<v Speaker 3>like so who's to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole idea.</v>

1880
01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:42.550
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so who,</v>

1881
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:46.540
<v Speaker 3>what we have not interested our</v>
<v Speaker 3>government to decide what opinions are</v>

1882
01:24:46.541 --> 01:24:48.520
<v Speaker 3>acceptable and what aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they don't,</v>

1883
01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:51.580
<v Speaker 3>they don't get to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seems like you're organizing</v>

1884
01:24:51.581 --> 01:24:53.800
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're organizing this sort of</v>

1885
01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:59.250
<v Speaker 3>antagonistic display where you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hurt dangerous time,</v>

1886
01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:01.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think you should hire your own</v>

1887
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:04.180
<v Speaker 3>security?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why should the police have to be</v>

1888
01:25:04.181 --> 01:25:05.110
<v Speaker 3>there to secure you?</v>

1889
01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this,</v>

1890
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:10.570
<v Speaker 3>it's the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are supposed to protect like the</v>

1891
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.440
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1892
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.870
<v Speaker 3>what good are first amendment rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1893
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.730
<v Speaker 3>To be able to say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't protect popular speech,</v>

1894
01:25:18.731 --> 01:25:20.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because public speeches need protection.</v>

1895
01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Unpopular speech needs protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just again,</v>

1896
01:25:24.191 --> 01:25:26.770
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the police are really there to enforce</v>

1897
01:25:26.771 --> 01:25:30.030
<v Speaker 3>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to punch somebody</v>

1898
01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:34.330
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>

1899
01:25:34.331 --> 01:25:36.160
<v Speaker 3>like go back to the campus thing for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

1900
01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:39.160
<v Speaker 3>You have these people who have announced</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go protest this person.</v>

1901
01:25:39.161 --> 01:25:42.370
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to let them speak even</v>
<v Speaker 3>though they've been granted permission</v>

1902
01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:43.120
<v Speaker 3>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1903
01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.670
<v Speaker 3>everybody like they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should be able to speak,</v>

1904
01:25:45.671 --> 01:25:47.440
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to let them speak</v>

1905
01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:50.910
<v Speaker 3>because we don't like their message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if the cops know that that's gonna</v>

1906
01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.710
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1907
01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:52.740
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens?</v>

1908
01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to let them shut it</v>

1909
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:55.980
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1910
01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying I think that's wrong.</v>

1911
01:25:57.761 --> 01:26:00.270
<v Speaker 3>I think they should be able,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should go and like,</v>

1912
01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.170
<v Speaker 3>so this is what big Vito is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's called,</v>

1913
01:26:03.171 --> 01:26:04.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in,</v>

1914
01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:08.120
<v Speaker 3>in like the cops can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well obviously this is still back to</v>

1915
01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:09.620
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1916
01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 3>If the cops say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you can't speak because you're</v>

1917
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:16.450
<v Speaker 3>likely to cause a riot or people to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1918
01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.020
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of disturbance.</v>

1919
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Like they're not allowed to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on like if it's just,</v>

1920
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:26.570
<v Speaker 3>this is religious opinion and we weren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying we want you to hurt us,</v>

1921
01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.400
<v Speaker 3>we're not trying to provoke you to hurt</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1922
01:26:28.401 --> 01:26:32.180
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to deliver this message</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we think is the truth of God.</v>

1923
01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't.</v>

1924
01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:36.830
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between like</v>
<v Speaker 3>deliberately provoking and inciting</v>

1925
01:26:36.831 --> 01:26:39.470
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like deliberately inciting violence and</v>

1926
01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 3>what we were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

1927
01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:44.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to proclaim this message that we</v>

1928
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:45.410
<v Speaker 3>thought was the truth.</v>

1929
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Our goal wasn't violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we didn't want violence.</v>

1930
01:26:48.171 --> 01:26:52.070
<v Speaker 3>That's why we contacted the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We weren't going to attack them and,</v>

1931
01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:55.160
<v Speaker 3>and we didn't want to be attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just want it to be able to exercise</v>

1932
01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:59.060
<v Speaker 3>our rights without fear of without fear</v>
<v Speaker 3>of violence.</v>

1933
01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:03.110
<v Speaker 3>That's the principles of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our democracy.</v>

1934
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:06.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll see what you're saying.</v>

1935
01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.080
<v Speaker 3>And I think that gets a little weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're talking about people giving</v>

1936
01:27:11.451 --> 01:27:15.620
<v Speaker 3>speeches on campus and then having other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people shut down those speeches because</v>

1937
01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:19.280
<v Speaker 3>I think that the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>protesting have as much.</v>

1938
01:27:19.281 --> 01:27:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if it's in their school,</v>

1939
01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:26.980
<v Speaker 3>they have as much right to voice their</v>
<v Speaker 3>concern for this message as the person</v>

1940
01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:30.530
<v Speaker 3>does distribute that message and if the</v>
<v Speaker 3>police come along and say we're going to</v>

1941
01:27:30.531 --> 01:27:32.510
<v Speaker 3>shut down the distribution of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>message,</v>

1942
01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.730
<v Speaker 3>most of the time they do it when things</v>
<v Speaker 3>are out of hand.</v>

1943
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:38.150
<v Speaker 3>So an excellent tool for someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to silence people is to make sure</v>

1944
01:27:38.151 --> 01:27:41.360
<v Speaker 3>that things get out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean is why so that having the cops</v>

1945
01:27:41.361 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 3>present like and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and letting both sides have their voices</v>

1946
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:47.600
<v Speaker 3>without the ability to resort to</v>
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

1947
01:27:47.601 --> 01:27:50.120
<v Speaker 3>So this is the whole idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we would in these letters that</v>

1948
01:27:50.121 --> 01:27:53.120
<v Speaker 3>would go out to the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the idea of having a buffer</v>

1949
01:27:53.121 --> 01:27:55.070
<v Speaker 3>zone like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1950
01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:56.720
<v Speaker 3>we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to proclaim our message.</v>

1951
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:59.900
<v Speaker 3>We want you to be out there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we loved and I honestly,</v>

1952
01:27:59.901 --> 01:28:02.660
<v Speaker 3>we loved doing counter protestors were</v>
<v Speaker 3>there because it just brought more</v>

1953
01:28:02.661 --> 01:28:05.060
<v Speaker 3>attention to our message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>

1954
01:28:05.061 --> 01:28:07.760
<v Speaker 3>but I just think that you shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it's not you anymore,</v>

1955
01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:11.360
<v Speaker 3>but I just do not think that anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially from an offensive group like</v>

1956
01:28:11.361 --> 01:28:13.130
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd be able to allocate resources that</v>

1957
01:28:13.131 --> 01:28:15.110
<v Speaker 3>are public use will police.</v>

1958
01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we obviously we would make the</v>

1959
01:28:17.031 --> 01:28:19.700
<v Speaker 3>decision on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't make the decision to,</v>

1960
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:21.620
<v Speaker 3>for them to like they decide like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1961
01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:25.580
<v Speaker 3>well is this likely going to like so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can either be proactive and set the</v>

1962
01:28:25.581 --> 01:28:28.250
<v Speaker 3>buffer zone or be reactive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're calling the cops because</v>

1963
01:28:28.251 --> 01:28:31.760
<v Speaker 3>we're getting punched or whatever and</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] like they're going to go out</v>

1964
01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.540
<v Speaker 3>no matter what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1965
01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.800
<v Speaker 3>when even when they would say we're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to protect you were,</v>

1966
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:39.500
<v Speaker 3>we would go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there were obviously,</v>

1967
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:41.250
<v Speaker 3>there were rare situations where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1968
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.231
<v Speaker 3>so for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1969
01:28:42.231 --> 01:28:45.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Gabby giffords was shot in Arizona,</v>

1970
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.820
<v Speaker 3>we had a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an FBI agent actually end a guy from</v>

1971
01:28:49.821 --> 01:28:51.620
<v Speaker 3>the local police department come and say</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1972
01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:53.070
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because there,</v>

1973
01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:56.840
<v Speaker 3>there's a nine year old girl who had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been killed in the church that they were</v>

1974
01:28:56.841 --> 01:28:58.670
<v Speaker 3>going to protest her funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

1975
01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:02.670
<v Speaker 3>And so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we can protect you like</v>

1976
01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:03.850
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too volatile.</v>

1977
01:29:03.851 --> 01:29:04.684
<v Speaker 3>It's too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1978
01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.530
<v Speaker 3>and so in that case we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually didn't go.</v>

1979
01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:12.230
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a chicken shit response</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually as I was going to say,</v>

1980
01:29:12.231 --> 01:29:12.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1981
01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:13.370
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1982
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was there during this conversation</v>

1983
01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:18.210
<v Speaker 3>and my hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom was explaining that we weren't</v>

1984
01:29:18.211 --> 01:29:19.060
<v Speaker 3>gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1985
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.990
<v Speaker 3>it actually had more to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>logistics.</v>

1986
01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Like we couldn't get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like plane tickets</v>

1987
01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.160
<v Speaker 1>then whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we just couldn't get there.</v>

1988
01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:27.150
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1989
01:29:27.610 --> 01:29:28.740
<v Speaker 1>like that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I hear you,</v>

1990
01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.680
<v Speaker 1>but like so reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating to talk to you</v>

1991
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:34.470
<v Speaker 1>because you're such an intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable person.</v>

1992
01:29:34.471 --> 01:29:39.471
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible for me to imagine</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I see like the little bit of</v>

1993
01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:45.410
<v Speaker 1>resistance to the idea of this being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>first amendment issue and the police</v>

1994
01:29:45.931 --> 01:29:48.240
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you kind of go back to the church.</v>

1995
01:29:48.241 --> 01:29:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I could see it boil up inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1996
01:29:51.361 --> 01:29:52.194
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>

1997
01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.660
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about this a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of I and just the whole,</v>

1998
01:29:54.661 --> 01:29:56.970
<v Speaker 3>the importance of discourse in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>marketplace of ideas.</v>

1999
01:29:56.971 --> 01:29:59.640
<v Speaker 3>This is one like I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2000
01:29:59.641 --> 01:30:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2001
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:03.360
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's so important and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's important,</v>

2002
01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:06.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because obviously my own personal</v>

2003
01:30:06.031 --> 01:30:09.150
<v Speaker 3>experience makes me such a believer in</v>

2004
01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.560
<v Speaker 1>are you've on a journey through free</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

2005
01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.400
<v Speaker 1>but most people will never experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech so you don't even agree with</v>

2006
01:30:15.401 --> 01:30:16.420
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2007
01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is even more crazy.</v>

2008
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:22.170
<v Speaker 1>So let's get back to your first job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

2009
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:24.360
<v Speaker 1>What was the first job?</v>

2010
01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.830
<v Speaker 3>I worked at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2011
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:29.710
<v Speaker 3>very briefly like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I should say my sister and I,</v>

2012
01:30:29.711 --> 01:30:32.830
<v Speaker 3>we were in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a couple months before I actually</v>

2013
01:30:32.831 --> 01:30:33.780
<v Speaker 3>got a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2014
01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:39.120
<v Speaker 3>we spent the first month with a cousin</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mine who had left the church a few</v>

2015
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.300
<v Speaker 3>years earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She lived really close.</v>

2016
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.940
<v Speaker 1>She had left her as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2017
01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.270
<v Speaker 1>So you guys knew some people had made it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2018
01:30:44.271 --> 01:30:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2019
01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:46.790
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many.</v>

2020
01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:48.890
<v Speaker 3>My sister calls them Mindfox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2021
01:30:48.891 --> 01:30:52.520
<v Speaker 3>So like the thing about people who leave</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they are demonized more than</v>

2022
01:30:52.521 --> 01:30:55.820
<v Speaker 3>anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even more than gays or Jews or any other</v>

2023
01:30:55.821 --> 01:30:58.160
<v Speaker 3>outsider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's x members who get the worst,</v>

2024
01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:01.370
<v Speaker 3>you hear the worst things about them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they knew the truth and they</v>

2025
01:31:01.371 --> 01:31:02.990
<v Speaker 3>rejected it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2026
01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.950
<v Speaker 3>So I was what came when I thought of</v>
<v Speaker 3>leading,</v>

2027
01:31:06.951 --> 01:31:10.400
<v Speaker 3>like the last thing on my mind was that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go to an ex member.</v>

2028
01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:13.390
<v Speaker 3>I thought you can't trust them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people like,</v>

2029
01:31:13.391 --> 01:31:14.340
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this,</v>

2030
01:31:14.341 --> 01:31:15.174
<v Speaker 3>this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2031
01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:18.620
<v Speaker 3>intensely negative instinctive reactions</v>
<v Speaker 3>to those things.</v>

2032
01:31:18.621 --> 01:31:22.340
<v Speaker 3>But obviously I overcame it and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>reached out to her a few weeks before we</v>

2033
01:31:22.341 --> 01:31:25.190
<v Speaker 3>left and she was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like within.</v>

2034
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:27.830
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't talked to her in three and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>half years and had said all kinds of</v>

2035
01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.970
<v Speaker 3>terrible things about her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2036
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.850
<v Speaker 3>after she left.</v>

2037
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:32.683
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2038
01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:38.030
<v Speaker 3>but she was wonderful and she said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within like 30 seconds of like when I,</v>

2039
01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.370
<v Speaker 3>when she understood that I was planning</v>
<v Speaker 3>to leave,</v>

2040
01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:41.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to come live with me.</v>

2041
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:46.370
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing and so kind.</v>

2042
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:50.210
<v Speaker 3>And so where I lived with her for about</v>
<v Speaker 3>a month,</v>

2043
01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:51.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sister was still in school,</v>

2044
01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:54.130
<v Speaker 3>so she was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were traveling back to Kansas to</v>

2045
01:31:54.131 --> 01:31:54.821
<v Speaker 3>Topeka.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2046
01:31:54.821 --> 01:31:56.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's half an hour from my cousin's</v>

2047
01:31:56.571 --> 01:31:59.500
<v Speaker 3>house and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four days a week while was still in</v>

2048
01:31:59.501 --> 01:32:02.950
<v Speaker 3>school and so we were constantly running</v>
<v Speaker 3>into our family and driving by the</v>

2049
01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:07.390
<v Speaker 3>pickets because they pick it everyday in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Topeka several times a day and a like at</v>

2050
01:32:07.391 --> 01:32:10.900
<v Speaker 3>the grocery store and on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was just,</v>

2051
01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:13.810
<v Speaker 3>we needed to get away so we ended up</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to deadwood,</v>

2052
01:32:13.811 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 3>South Dakota.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2053
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:17.390

<v Speaker 3>and a,</v>

2054
01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.300
<v Speaker 3>it just seemed like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice quiet place.</v>

2055
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.820
<v Speaker 3>So how many people went with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's you,</v>

01:33:04.701 --> 01:33:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see photos like they post photos,</v>

2074
01:33:06.801 --> 01:33:09.590
<v Speaker 3>like I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching my little brother grow up on</v>

2075
01:33:10.130 --> 01:33:13.820
<v Speaker 3>their photos on twitter and see what my</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents wanted.</v>

2076
01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.280
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2077
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:17.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad.</v>

2078
01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:19.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad to be living now and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2079
01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:22.310
<v Speaker 3>before social media where I can actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>see these things and,</v>

2080
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:26.480
<v Speaker 3>and know what they're up to and a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit about how they're going to reach</v>

2081
01:33:26.481 --> 01:33:27.860
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

2082
01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:29.570
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2083
01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.670
<v Speaker 3>I do on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2084
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:33.990
<v Speaker 3>there's this great about twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2085
01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.280
<v Speaker 3>sometimes like I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they blocked me on my main account.</v>

2086
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of them to mom blocked you.</v>

2087
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:43.660
<v Speaker 3>She actually created,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2088
01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.770
<v Speaker 3>she got kicked off of twitter at one</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] point,</v>

2089
01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:50.540
<v Speaker 3>so she had to create a new account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she didn't block me under new account</v>

2090
01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:52.120
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2091
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:55.240
<v Speaker 3>but blocked you in her own account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2092
01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:33:57.610 --> 01:33:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2094
01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Your mom blogs you on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

2095
01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.140
<v Speaker 3>when you look and you see that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>blocked.</v>

2096
01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.500
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that lump in your throat like,</v>

2097
01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:14.320
<v Speaker 3>just want you to imagine like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it's so hard to think</v>

2098
01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:17.400
<v Speaker 3>back to like I was incredibly close with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom and I,</v>

2099
01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:18.490
<v Speaker 3>I love her and I miss her.</v>

2100
01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:22.660
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to make coffee for her every</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning and like you go on walks</v>

2101
01:34:22.661 --> 01:34:26.050
<v Speaker 3>together and we spoke to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2102
01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:31.540
<v Speaker 3>well actually I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw her to pick it a little over a</v>

2103
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.020
<v Speaker 3>year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't,</v>

2104
01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.000
<v Speaker 3>she didn't say anything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't even talk to,</v>

2105
01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:34.834
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2106
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:37.360
<v Speaker 3>she couldn't like baby that came from</v>
<v Speaker 3>her body.</v>

2107
01:34:37.570 --> 01:34:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Loved you and raise you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can like,</v>

2108
01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.750
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2109
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:45.860
<v Speaker 3>it's so like when I think about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was at the church,</v>

2110
01:34:45.861 --> 01:34:47.600
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the hardest things to</v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate.</v>

2111
01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:51.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean to the feeling of like when</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody leaves,</v>

2112
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:56.480
<v Speaker 3>like there is no interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some people would ask like,</v>

2113
01:34:56.481 --> 01:34:58.880
<v Speaker 3>well what if you saw her at such a</v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

2114
01:34:58.881 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever at the grocery store,</v>

2115
01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:01.101
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

2116
01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:02.930
<v Speaker 3>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would ask me this while I was still</v>

2117
01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:07.931
<v Speaker 3>at the church and it's so it's like a I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I can compare it to is</v>

2118
01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.890
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like dividing by zero.</v>

2119
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Like the situation does not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's nothing there.</v>

2120
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.520
<v Speaker 3>The idea of trying to talk to her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is impossible.</v>

2121
01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2122
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:24.000
<v Speaker 3>and that's the Colt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2123
01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.960
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the Jehovah's Witnesses.</v>

2124
01:35:26.961 --> 01:35:28.520
<v Speaker 3>They call it a dis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fellowshipping,</v>

2125
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:31.580
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all have an excommunication ecology</v>

2126
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:32.690
<v Speaker 3>houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all have it.</v>

2127
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:37.550
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the ways they control people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fear of alienation and becoming like</v>

2128
01:35:37.551 --> 01:35:38.151
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2129
01:35:38.151 --> 01:35:41.300
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they'll talk to gay people,</v>

2130
01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:43.760
<v Speaker 3>they'll talk to people with rainbow</v>
<v Speaker 3>shirts arm,</v>

2131
01:35:43.761 --> 01:35:46.640
<v Speaker 3>they'll talk to ex soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll talk to those people,</v>

2132
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:48.450
<v Speaker 3>they won't talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2133
01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:53.060
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is one of your mana acid.</v>

2134
01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:56.070
<v Speaker 3>When</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

2135
01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:01.420
<v Speaker 3>One of the great things about twitter</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Internet in general is that it's</v>

2136
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:04.100
<v Speaker 3>a thing where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like obviously like my little</v>

2137
01:36:04.101 --> 01:36:06.170
<v Speaker 3>brothers for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they are,</v>

2138
01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:08.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hearing all this bad stuff about,</v>

2139
01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sister and me,</v>

2140
01:36:09.301 --> 01:36:10.270
<v Speaker 3>anybody who leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2141
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:11.540
<v Speaker 3>they'll hear bad things about us.</v>

2142
01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:14.210
<v Speaker 3>But the good thing about the internet is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can go on,</v>

2143
01:36:14.211 --> 01:36:16.460
<v Speaker 3>they can go to my twitter account and</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what I'm actually saying.</v>

2144
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:20.290
<v Speaker 3>So I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go through these phases where like I,</v>

2145
01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2146
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:23.720
<v Speaker 3>I will tweet and then I get like I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>

2147
01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:25.160
<v Speaker 3>I just like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2148
01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:28.310
<v Speaker 3>the fear of judgment I guess from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>family and I just,</v>

2149
01:36:28.311 --> 01:36:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I just choose to focus on other things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not post things on twitter but like</v>

2150
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.400
<v Speaker 3>I follow them on this other account that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I created.</v>

2151
01:36:34.401 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2152
01:36:35.451 --> 01:36:40.110
<v Speaker 3>And it's just WBC accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I see things that they say and</v>

2153
01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:44.180
<v Speaker 3>like doctrines that I now believe are</v>
<v Speaker 3>unscriptural and so like I will tweet</v>

2154
01:36:44.181 --> 01:36:45.120
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2155
01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:49.490
<v Speaker 3>versus like this contradicts you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like and try to like basically doing</v>

2156
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:53.540
<v Speaker 3>what I was doing for them now against</v>
<v Speaker 3>them like just in this,</v>

2157
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:54.883
<v Speaker 3>in these instances.</v>

2158
01:36:55.070 --> 01:37:00.070
<v Speaker 3>And so there is some engagement a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit with my family on twitter because</v>

2159
01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.920
<v Speaker 3>especially because of any like anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I do publicly,</v>

2160
01:37:03.921 --> 01:37:05.950
<v Speaker 3>so maybe something about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2161
01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:10.010
<v Speaker 3>but like when my ted talk came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a couple of articles and like</v>

2162
01:37:10.011 --> 01:37:12.520
<v Speaker 3>people were tweeting it a lot and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2163
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:15.920
<v Speaker 3>so my uncle and my aunt both were</v>
<v Speaker 3>tweeting,</v>

2164
01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:19.840
<v Speaker 3>tweeting me and tweeting about me and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2165
01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:22.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're having this party I guess like</v>

2166
01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 3>just going back and forth about these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these Bible verses and debating.</v>

2167
01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:28.850
<v Speaker 3>And so all of that stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2168
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:30.291
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2169
01:37:30.291 --> 01:37:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I hope at some point hopefully we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

2170
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:35.570
<v Speaker 3>we'll have some effect and in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>it already has.</v>

2171
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:39.050
<v Speaker 3>So like the day that I left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a we're going to get to that</v>

2172
01:37:39.051 --> 01:37:44.051
<v Speaker 3>job sometimes worry about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day that I left my,</v>

2173
01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:49.010
<v Speaker 3>one of my cousins came into my bedroom</v>
<v Speaker 3>while I was crying and packing.</v>

2174
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:51.050
<v Speaker 3>And I was asking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just very calmly,</v>

2175
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:51.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my best.</v>

2176
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:54.080
<v Speaker 3>My best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a year older than me,</v>

2177
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 3>is a year older than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's asked me why we're leaving and</v>

2178
01:37:58.111 --> 01:38:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm describing a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the two I described</v>

2179
01:38:01.110 --> 01:38:03.320
<v Speaker 3>specifically two signs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2180
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:07.100
<v Speaker 3>one of them was the death penalty for</v>
<v Speaker 3>fags and another one was fags can't</v>

2181
01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.130
<v Speaker 3>repent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2182
01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:13.860
<v Speaker 3>she sent me a message the next morning</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was describing versus that I</v>

2183
01:38:13.861 --> 01:38:14.430
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2184
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:16.470
<v Speaker 3>contradicted those two signs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2185
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.480
<v Speaker 3>the following morning she sent me a</v>
<v Speaker 3>message,</v>

2186
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:20.100
<v Speaker 3>a text message super early in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>

2187
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:23.440
<v Speaker 3>just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just chewing me out basically like that,</v>

2188
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:27.330
<v Speaker 3>that I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that leviticus and Romans one like the</v>

2189
01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.310
<v Speaker 3>death penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no,</v>

2190
01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.810
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no argument.</v>

2191
01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

2192
01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.540
<v Speaker 3>So what's your really your problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2193
01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:38.160
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then for a while after I left,</v>

2194
01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:40.710
<v Speaker 3>like those signs were like everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she's holding,</v>

2195
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:43.830
<v Speaker 3>my cousin changes her profile picture on</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter to her holding those two signs,</v>

2196
01:38:43.831 --> 01:38:47.670
<v Speaker 3>like screaming into the camera and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the elders like making a snow</v>

2197
01:38:47.671 --> 01:38:48.900
<v Speaker 3>angel with those two signs.</v>

2198
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.730
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're just like doubling down on</v>

2199
01:38:50.731 --> 01:38:51.564
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2200
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:53.880
<v Speaker 3>And so this goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like during this time,</v>

2201
01:38:53.881 --> 01:38:57.300
<v Speaker 3>like I'm talking about it in like giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few interviews,</v>

2202
01:38:57.301 --> 01:38:59.610
<v Speaker 3>like talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like on twitter a little bit.</v>

2203
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:03.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm like reiterating the verses that</v>
<v Speaker 3>contradict them.</v>

2204
01:39:04.050 --> 01:39:07.170
<v Speaker 3>And then like after more than two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I wake up one morning and I</v>

2205
01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:07.740
<v Speaker 3>checked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2206
01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:12.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm checking their twitters and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a blog post and they said,</v>

2207
01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that fags can't repent sign.</v>

2208
01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.680
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2209
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:19.560
<v Speaker 3>it's like open the blog post and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the first time ever they had</v>

2210
01:39:19.561 --> 01:39:23.880
<v Speaker 3>publicly disavowed assign and using the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same Bible verses that I had been.</v>

2211
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:28.590
<v Speaker 3>And I know that's just like a very small</v>
<v Speaker 3>point in the grand scheme of things.</v>

2212
01:39:28.591 --> 01:39:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reason that's critical</v>

2213
01:39:31.111 --> 01:39:33.470
<v Speaker 3>reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

2214
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.920
<v Speaker 3>so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the goal,</v>

2215
01:39:34.921 --> 01:39:35.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2216
01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.850
<v Speaker 3>So like to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing this is what I do know the story</v>

2217
01:39:38.851 --> 01:39:40.170
<v Speaker 3>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2218
01:39:40.410 --> 01:39:42.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was after my,</v>

2219
01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.700
<v Speaker 3>my brother left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't really know,</v>

2220
01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:47.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody who's left since then.</v>

2221
01:39:47.311 --> 01:39:48.090
<v Speaker 3>I also have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to,</v>

2222
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:50.400
<v Speaker 3>to actually have my cousins have left</v>
<v Speaker 3>since then also.</v>

2223
01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:54.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but none of them have any understanding</v>

2224
01:39:54.091 --> 01:39:55.220
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2225
01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:59.370
<v Speaker 3>of what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know,</v>

2226
01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:00.263
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2227
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:02.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to take credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should also say like,</v>

2228
01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:03.173
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

2229
01:40:03.450 --> 01:40:06.730
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just changes.</v>

2230
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Possible gets into their head that what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>

2231
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:13.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not in any way the teachings of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ.</v>

2232
01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like the thing is like some,</v>

2233
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:19.320
<v Speaker 3>some of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it is.</v>

2234
01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like there's the huge bag stuff will</v>

2235
01:40:22.371 --> 01:40:24.210
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's so crazy because like this is</v>

2236
01:40:24.211 --> 01:40:26.400
<v Speaker 3>something that I didn't realize until</v>
<v Speaker 3>after we left also.</v>

2237
01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.080
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2238
01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:30.210
<v Speaker 3>we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember I told you about love thy</v>

2239
01:40:30.211 --> 01:40:32.400
<v Speaker 3>neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have a site in love.</v>

2240
01:40:32.401 --> 01:40:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Thy Neighbor equals rebuke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2241
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Because that's in leviticus 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it describes,</v>

2242
01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:40.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loves warning your neighbor when you see</v>

2243
01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:42.390
<v Speaker 3>them sending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they don't have an opportunity to</v>

2244
01:40:42.391 --> 01:40:45.130
<v Speaker 3>repent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the one time.</v>

2245
01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:47.070
<v Speaker 3>So in the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2246
01:40:47.370 --> 01:40:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Jesus is talking with this guy and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy says like,</v>

2247
01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.630
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I inherit eternal life?</v>

2248
01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:52.840
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2249
01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.580
<v Speaker 3>Jesus is what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does the scripture say?</v>

2250
01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:56.440
<v Speaker 3>And he says to love God and to love your</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbor.</v>

2251
01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:58.510
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

2252
01:40:58.590 --> 01:41:00.220
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and who is my neighbor?</v>

2253
01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:02.530
<v Speaker 3>And Jesus tells a story of the Good</v>
<v Speaker 3>Samaritan.</v>

2254
01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:05.530
<v Speaker 3>So it's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the story?</v>

2255
01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's it go?</v>

2256
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:09.783
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2257
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:14.910
<v Speaker 3>so this man says this man falls among</v>
<v Speaker 3>thieves and they beat him and leave him</v>

2258
01:41:16.210 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 3>half dead.</v>

2259
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.340
<v Speaker 3>The beat him until he's half dead or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2260
01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.260
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steal his clothes and,</v>

2261
01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:23.130
<v Speaker 3>and leave them there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it says a,</v>

2262
01:41:23.150 --> 01:41:28.090
<v Speaker 3>a priest goes and sees the man and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>crosses the street and walk by on the</v>

2263
01:41:28.091 --> 01:41:29.620
<v Speaker 3>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Levi,</v>

2264
01:41:29.690 --> 01:41:31.840
<v Speaker 3>who's also like dealing with the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>of God,</v>

2265
01:41:31.841 --> 01:41:32.674
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2266
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:34.630
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does this same thing,</v>

2267
01:41:34.631 --> 01:41:36.610
<v Speaker 3>crosses and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and goes on,</v>

2268
01:41:36.650 --> 01:41:37.870
<v Speaker 3>goes on his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't help them.</v>

2269
01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:43.230
<v Speaker 3>And then the Samaritan stops and binds</v>
<v Speaker 3>up his wounds and puts them on his own.</v>

2270
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:46.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's puts them on his own beast and</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking them to an end and gives the</v>

2271
01:41:46.991 --> 01:41:50.440
<v Speaker 3>innkeeper money to take care of him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>says anything that you spend more than</v>

2272
01:41:50.441 --> 01:41:51.550
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>

2273
01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I'll pay you back when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I come again.</v>

2274
01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:56.320
<v Speaker 3>So he's like actually practically taken</v>
<v Speaker 3>care of him.</v>

2275
01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:59.380
<v Speaker 3>So Jesus says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and who do you think?</v>

2276
01:41:59.690 --> 01:42:01.960
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of these was neighbor to the man</v>

2277
01:42:01.961 --> 01:42:06.010
<v Speaker 3>who fell among thieves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said he who has mercy on him.</v>

2278
01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:10.450
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying is we reduced loving our</v>

2279
01:42:10.451 --> 01:42:12.910
<v Speaker 3>neighbor to preaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to picketing,</v>

2280
01:42:12.911 --> 01:42:15.820
<v Speaker 3>to putting words on signs and going out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and publishing them.</v>

2281
01:42:15.821 --> 01:42:17.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what we thought loving our</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbor was.</v>

2282
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:21.250
<v Speaker 3>But the one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the example that Jesus gives is not</v>

2283
01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.620
<v Speaker 3>preaching like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't go.</v>

2284
01:42:23.621 --> 01:42:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Like the Samaritan didn't go and say</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2285
01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:27.430
<v Speaker 3>this happened to you because you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>senator.</v>

2286
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.880
<v Speaker 3>Repent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went and helped them.</v>

2287
01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:33.760
<v Speaker 3>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where was that on our picket signs were</v>

2288
01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:36.100
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why didn't.</v>

2289
01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly like why,</v>

2290
01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:42.490
<v Speaker 3>why didn't we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why didn't we make that an issue for</v>

2291
01:42:42.491 --> 01:42:45.820
<v Speaker 3>ourselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a primary part of our theology.</v>

2292
01:42:45.821 --> 01:42:48.160
<v Speaker 3>And why didn't we encourage others to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it too.</v>

2293
01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:50.500
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that again,</v>

2294
01:42:50.501 --> 01:42:53.140
<v Speaker 3>this is something that I didn't realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>until after I did it was I was talking</v>

2295
01:42:53.141 --> 01:42:56.020
<v Speaker 3>to a couple of Christian friends of mine</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

2296
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:56.740
<v Speaker 3>who pointed that out.</v>

2297
01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:58.600
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot believe I missed that.</v>

2298
01:42:58.601 --> 01:43:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Like all those years like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what's crazy is like the,</v>

2299
01:43:01.781 --> 01:43:03.070
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the story,</v>

2300
01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:06.610
<v Speaker 3>the priest and the Levi to the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are like dealing with the things of</v>

2301
01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:07.240
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2302
01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:10.030
<v Speaker 3>So they're presumably preaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not enough.</v>

2303
01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:12.730
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the fulfillment of that.</v>

2304
01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:14.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

2305
01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:18.460
<v Speaker 3>there's like so many of these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I just couldn't see when I was at</v>

2306
01:43:18.461 --> 01:43:20.000
<v Speaker 3>the church because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2307
01:43:20.050 --> 01:43:22.510
<v Speaker 3>you're in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of an echo chamber.</v>

2308
01:43:22.511 --> 01:43:25.270
<v Speaker 3>Like clearly we had access to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside world and we're having these</v>

2309
01:43:25.271 --> 01:43:27.880
<v Speaker 3>discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that discussion is</v>

2310
01:43:27.881 --> 01:43:31.810
<v Speaker 3>that in a lot of cases people just</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't understand what our theology</v>

2311
01:43:31.811 --> 01:43:34.330
<v Speaker 3>actually was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How we actually thought,</v>

2312
01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:35.500
<v Speaker 3>which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2313
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:37.570
<v Speaker 3>David Habit Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making this,</v>

2314
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:38.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>judicious,</v>

2315
01:43:38.890 --> 01:43:42.520
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that this was an ongoing</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation that he really got into the</v>

2316
01:43:42.521 --> 01:43:46.240
<v Speaker 3>nuances of our theology and could really</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand where I was coming from to be</v>

2317
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:48.880
<v Speaker 3>able to make the point in a way that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>could understand.</v>

2318
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:50.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2319
01:43:50.890 --> 01:43:53.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of in a position to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my family now.</v>

2320
01:43:53.091 --> 01:43:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of us who leaves and who</v>

2321
01:43:54.771 --> 01:43:56.420
<v Speaker 3>understands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2322
01:43:56.421 --> 01:43:58.210
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can try to push back in a way that's a</v>

2323
01:43:58.211 --> 01:44:01.960
<v Speaker 3>lot more effective than people who just</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand where they're,</v>

2324
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:04.010
<v Speaker 3>where they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get this job.</v>

2325
01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to deadwood.</v>

2326
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:09.290
<v Speaker 3>My sister and I got a dead one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2327
01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.590
<v Speaker 3>we were only going to be there for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>month and then we're going to go back</v>

2328
01:44:12.591 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 3>and grace was going to go to school and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I was going to get a job.</v>

2329
01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I was in deadwood for a couple</v>

2330
01:44:17.871 --> 01:44:19.000
<v Speaker 3>of weeks and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

2331
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:24.030
<v Speaker 3>I the idea of going back to Kansas and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like being back in the shadow of the</v>

2332
01:44:24.171 --> 01:44:28.220
<v Speaker 3>church and seeing our family all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and like seeing them and not like</v>

2333
01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:30.470
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's constantly being face to face with</v>

2334
01:44:30.471 --> 01:44:35.471
<v Speaker 3>rejection and the people that we love</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most and like the idea of going back</v>

2335
01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:37.210
<v Speaker 3>to that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

2336
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:39.590
<v Speaker 3>my cousin was wonderful and I love her</v>
<v Speaker 3>dearly,</v>

2337
01:44:39.610 --> 01:44:41.150
<v Speaker 3>like I just couldn't go back there.</v>

2338
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:43.720
<v Speaker 3>So like the day before we're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave deadwood,</v>

2339
01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:48.820
<v Speaker 3>a grace decided to try out for a play</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and uh,</v>

2340
01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:52.040
<v Speaker 3>an agreed to stay with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he changed like all of her classes to</v>

2341
01:44:52.041 --> 01:44:53.960
<v Speaker 3>be online and anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're in,</v>

2342
01:44:53.961 --> 01:44:57.860
<v Speaker 3>we're staying with Jehovah's Witnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we didn't know that when we booked</v>

2343
01:44:57.861 --> 01:44:58.700
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an airbnb.</v>

2344
01:44:58.730 --> 01:45:01.010
<v Speaker 3>My first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our first airbnb is a beautiful old</v>

2345
01:45:01.011 --> 01:45:03.060
<v Speaker 3>house in the black hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2346
01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

2347
01:45:04.671 --> 01:45:07.090
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought at first when they realized</v>

2348
01:45:07.610 --> 01:45:09.680
<v Speaker 3>what was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like who we were,</v>

2349
01:45:09.681 --> 01:45:11.780
<v Speaker 3>we started having these conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we find out they're Jehovah's</v>

2350
01:45:11.781 --> 01:45:15.140
<v Speaker 3>Witnesses and they thought at first that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might be disfellowshipped witnesses</v>

2351
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:17.970
<v Speaker 3>before they realized that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were at the church anyway,</v>

2352
01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:20.540
<v Speaker 3>so it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is insane conversations about,</v>

2353
01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:21.573
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2354
01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.700
<v Speaker 3>doctrine and theology and interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2355
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:26.750
<v Speaker 3>and it was just so mind blowing to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there were other ways of</v>

2356
01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:29.660
<v Speaker 3>understanding these texts that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent with the text,</v>

2357
01:45:29.661 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 3>but totally different than we</v>
<v Speaker 3>understood.</v>

2358
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the husband,</v>

2359
01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Dustin is co,</v>
<v Speaker 3>owns a marketing company in deadwood,</v>

2360
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:42.230
<v Speaker 3>so I took a job there part time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is your process or what's the</v>

2361
01:45:42.231 --> 01:45:46.050
<v Speaker 3>journey from leaving the church going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>deadwood,</v>

2362
01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.540
<v Speaker 3>the men becoming sort of a self</v>
<v Speaker 3>proclaimed atheist.</v>

2363
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you completely remove yourself</v>

2364
01:45:55.641 --> 01:45:59.060
<v Speaker 3>from the shackles of audiology or did</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2365
01:45:59.061 --> 01:46:00.890
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2366
01:46:00.891 --> 01:46:02.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely,</v>

2367
01:46:02.181 --> 01:46:03.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to do.</v>

2368
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:04.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's possible.</v>

2369
01:46:04.671 --> 01:46:07.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a switch flips and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2370
01:46:07.311 --> 01:46:10.340
<v Speaker 3>everything that you knew is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're obviously very rational.</v>

2371
01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:12.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like each,</v>

2372
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:15.740
<v Speaker 3>each time we'd be presented with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation that,</v>

2373
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:19.100
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like gay people or Jewish people or</v>

2374
01:46:19.101 --> 01:46:23.780
<v Speaker 3>these like Jehovah's Witnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was obviously I had the instinctive</v>

2375
01:46:23.781 --> 01:46:26.650
<v Speaker 3>responses to their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2376
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:29.450
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but each time I would feel,</v>

2377
01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:31.050
<v Speaker 3>feel something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would,</v>

2378
01:46:31.570 --> 01:46:33.960
<v Speaker 3>I would just ask myself these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2379
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:37.310
<v Speaker 3>what am I feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I feeling it?</v>

2380
01:46:37.311 --> 01:46:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Is this just instinctive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the evidence like?</v>

2381
01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Does what makes sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's sort of like having to,</v>

2382
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:43.800
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2383
01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:45.930
<v Speaker 3>to try to reconstruct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2384
01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.810
<v Speaker 3>like actually look at the evidence</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2385
01:46:47.811 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>like starting from scratch basically a</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lot</v>

2386
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.300
<v Speaker 2>of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2387
01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.360
<v Speaker 2>so each time we're presented with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations like,</v>

2388
01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:56.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because obviously like there's all</v>

2389
01:46:56.851 --> 01:46:58.320
<v Speaker 2>these like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>

2390
01:46:58.321 --> 01:47:02.670
<v Speaker 2>gay people like that actually didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>take that long to change.</v>

2391
01:47:03.410 --> 01:47:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

2392
01:47:04.690 --> 01:47:08.010
<v Speaker 2>I had met a lot of gay people like while</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at the church and,</v>

2393
01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:11.040
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after we left and you know,</v>

2394
01:47:11.041 --> 01:47:12.870
<v Speaker 2>we're talking to them and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2395
01:47:12.871 --> 01:47:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was doing the right thing</v>

2396
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:16.650
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2397
01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:19.770
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't,</v>

2398
01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I didn't intend to hurt to hurt you or</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say hurtful things about you.</v>

2399
01:47:24.421 --> 01:47:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought I thought it was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and now I don't know what the</v>

2400
01:47:26.791 --> 01:47:28.440
<v Speaker 2>truth is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2401
01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2402
01:47:30.690 --> 01:47:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2403
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:36.660
<v Speaker 2>and like people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they responded to that.</v>

2404
01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean like they were really</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding and empathetic in a way</v>

2405
01:47:40.291 --> 01:47:42.750
<v Speaker 2>that I never imagined people would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2406
01:47:42.751 --> 01:47:45.130
<v Speaker 2>given how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've seen like a,</v>

2407
01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:48.600
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard for me to still to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and watch some of those videos</v>

2408
01:47:48.601 --> 01:47:50.700
<v Speaker 2>because it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2409
01:47:50.701 --> 01:47:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly where I was coming from</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time.</v>

2410
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:58.860
<v Speaker 2>But it's so like the arrogance and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>condescension and the certainty that we</v>

2411
01:47:58.861 --> 01:48:00.120
<v Speaker 2>were right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>

2412
01:48:00.121 --> 01:48:02.970
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing like all the reasons why I don't</v>

2413
01:48:02.971 --> 01:48:04.500
<v Speaker 2>believe those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very strange,</v>

2414
01:48:04.501 --> 01:48:05.430
<v Speaker 2>strange dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

2415
01:48:05.431 --> 01:48:10.320
<v Speaker 2>so like the fact that people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding in spite of that long</v>

2416
01:48:10.321 --> 01:48:13.200
<v Speaker 2>history of all those things that I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>said and done at the church,</v>

2417
01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:15.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2418
01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:16.600
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was overwhelming and,</v>

2419
01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:18.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wonderful.</v>

2420
01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

2421
01:48:20.281 --> 01:48:22.830
<v Speaker 2>so like being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was basically my sister and I were</v>

2422
01:48:22.831 --> 01:48:24.810
<v Speaker 2>basically putting ourselves over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

2423
01:48:24.810 --> 01:48:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

2424
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:30.360
<v Speaker 2>hadn't been in deadwood for very long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I got a message from David,</v>

2425
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:32.630
<v Speaker 2>it was on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my birthday and I,</v>

2426
01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I told him that we had left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2427
01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2428
01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:39.300
<v Speaker 2>he saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped tweeting,</v>

2429
01:48:39.410 --> 01:48:40.530
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew something was up.</v>

2430
01:48:40.531 --> 01:48:42.540
<v Speaker 2>But I had stopped tweeting several</v>
<v Speaker 2>months earlier.</v>

2431
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:43.823
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2432
01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:46.890
<v Speaker 2>so he invited us to come to the Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 2>festival,</v>

2433
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:49.830
<v Speaker 2>which was a few weeks later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like end of February or something,</v>

2434
01:48:49.831 --> 01:48:51.590
<v Speaker 2>beginning of March.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2435
01:48:52.370 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 2>I had protested the delicious festival</v>
<v Speaker 2>like three years earlier and all these</v>

2436
01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:59.010
<v Speaker 2>negative associations and feelings about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish people,</v>

2437
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:01.860
<v Speaker 2>but realizing I don't know anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Jewish people,</v>

2438
01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:05.070
<v Speaker 2>like we've been protesting the synagogue</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Topeka,</v>

2439
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:07.480
<v Speaker 2>like all my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't,</v>

2440
01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2441
01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:09.640
<v Speaker 2>other than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2442
01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:13.170
<v Speaker 2>just generally Jews killed Jesus and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reject him as the savior.</v>

2443
01:49:13.171 --> 01:49:15.270
<v Speaker 2>So therefore they're without hope.</v>

2444
01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:18.540
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't know really much about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish theology.</v>

2445
01:49:18.541 --> 01:49:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anything about Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2446
01:49:19.981 --> 01:49:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd never really spent time with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2447
01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:23.750
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I wanted to go to the festival,</v>

2448
01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:24.850
<v Speaker 2>my sister and I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2449
01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:26.880
<v Speaker 2>because we wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2450
01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:29.520
<v Speaker 2>we wanted to meet Jewish people and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this whole,</v>

2451
01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:32.160
<v Speaker 2>it's this examining process like what do</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe in,</v>

2452
01:49:32.161 --> 01:49:33.680
<v Speaker 2>why and what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2453
01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:38.550
<v Speaker 2>and we got so much like light and sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of wisdom from other people like</v>

2454
01:49:38.551 --> 01:49:41.580
<v Speaker 2>learning what they believed and why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2455
01:49:41.610 --> 01:49:43.680
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then David said,</v>

2456
01:49:43.681 --> 01:49:45.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to,</v>

2457
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to speak at the festival.</v>

2458
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:50.630
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2459
01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:51.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2460
01:49:51.881 --> 01:49:53.190
<v Speaker 3>this is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

2461
01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:55.780
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot imagine facing these people</v>

2462
01:49:55.781 --> 01:49:58.270
<v Speaker 3>that I've spent so many years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I just,</v>

2463
01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:02.110
<v Speaker 3>it just seemed impossible and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified me to be coming face to face</v>

2464
01:50:02.111 --> 01:50:03.510
<v Speaker 3>with people and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had,</v>

2465
01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:05.770
<v Speaker 3>hadn't even been out of the church the</v>
<v Speaker 3>three months yet.</v>

2466
01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:07.660
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really scary.</v>

2467
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:10.210
<v Speaker 3>But my sister was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going,</v>

2468
01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:11.110
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2469
01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:15.670
<v Speaker 3>she knew that we needed to have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of,</v>

2470
01:50:15.671 --> 01:50:20.671
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of learning about Jewish people and if</v>

2471
01:50:20.681 --> 01:50:22.510
<v Speaker 3>the cost was we have to talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

2472
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.730
<v Speaker 3>And she still also said later she knew I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would do most of the talking.</v>

2473
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.620
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2474
01:50:26.650 --> 01:50:29.830
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so we went and we spoke there and</v>

2475
01:50:29.831 --> 01:50:30.664
<v Speaker 3>then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2476
01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:32.770
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we're gonna like we need to figure</v>

2477
01:50:32.771 --> 01:50:34.030
<v Speaker 3>out like grace.</v>

2478
01:50:34.050 --> 01:50:37.840
<v Speaker 3>And I kept saying we want to do good</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2479
01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:41.860
<v Speaker 3>That had been the motivating principle</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our life was to do good and now we</v>

2480
01:50:41.861 --> 01:50:43.390
<v Speaker 3>realize we did so much damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2481
01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:45.800
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>

2482
01:50:45.801 --> 01:50:49.540
<v Speaker 3>so we were trying to find a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we didn't know what to do.</v>

2483
01:50:49.541 --> 01:50:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you move forward from there?</v>

2484
01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:52.770
<v Speaker 3>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just,</v>

2485
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 3>we didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2486
01:50:54.490 --> 01:50:56.890
<v Speaker 3>so we were kind of drifting that whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>first year.</v>

2487
01:50:56.891 --> 01:50:57.750
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we basically,</v>

2488
01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:01.340
<v Speaker 3>I think a month was the longest we spent</v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere we were um,</v>

2489
01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:04.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to visit x members of the church</v>

2490
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:08.620
<v Speaker 3>who were across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad's family who we never knew</v>

2491
01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:10.750
<v Speaker 3>growing up because they were never part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the church.</v>

2492
01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:11.850
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>

2493
01:51:11.850 --> 01:51:14.500
<v Speaker 3>we had seen them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they would come visit for a few</v>

2494
01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:17.830
<v Speaker 3>hours sometimes or maybe a couple of to</v>
<v Speaker 3>visit even though there for a while.</v>

2495
01:51:17.890 --> 01:51:20.020
<v Speaker 3>But then my several years before we</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

2496
01:51:20.021 --> 01:51:22.630
<v Speaker 3>they cut off all contact with his family</v>
<v Speaker 3>there also.</v>

2497
01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:26.680
<v Speaker 3>It had been very limited already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then spoken to your dad either.</v>

2498
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:29.680
<v Speaker 3>So he spoke to his family?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2499
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:31.800
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his parents and his brother.</v>

2500
01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:35.560
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grandmother.</v>

2501
01:51:35.561 --> 01:51:36.860
<v Speaker 3>I called her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2502
01:51:37.570 --> 01:51:39.430
<v Speaker 3>about a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little over a month after we left,</v>

2503
01:51:39.431 --> 01:51:44.170
<v Speaker 3>one of my first nights in deadwood and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>told her we have left and she just</v>

2504
01:51:44.171 --> 01:51:47.470
<v Speaker 3>immediately started crying and she said</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been waiting for this for 30</v>

2505
01:51:47.471 --> 01:51:49.630
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she had my older brother had one of</v>

2506
01:51:49.631 --> 01:51:53.050
<v Speaker 3>my older brothers had left since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since my dad had joined the church,</v>

2507
01:51:53.051 --> 01:51:54.320
<v Speaker 3>is what she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2508
01:51:54.370 --> 01:51:58.780
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad's parents are so there's,</v>

2509
01:51:58.930 --> 01:52:02.140
<v Speaker 3>they're amazing people like his dad is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was career air force.</v>

2510
01:52:02.141 --> 01:52:03.970
<v Speaker 3>He retired from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the air force.</v>

2511
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>

2512
01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:09.850
<v Speaker 3>they're wonderful people and all we</v>
<v Speaker 3>could see of them was,</v>

2513
01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're divorced and remarried there.</v>

2514
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:14.290
<v Speaker 3>They're going to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a bad influence.</v>

2515
01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:17.360
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it what's,</v>

2516
01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:19.720
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane to me now to think like my</v>

2517
01:52:19.721 --> 01:52:24.721
<v Speaker 3>grandmother has been without her son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her son for decades and how painful that</v>

2518
01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.180
<v Speaker 3>must be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've only been,</v>

2519
01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:30.040
<v Speaker 3>it's been four and a half years since I</v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

2520
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:33.370
<v Speaker 3>And what am I going to be doing in 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>

2521
01:52:33.371 --> 01:52:34.120
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2523
01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:37.720
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy journey that you've been on</v>

2524
01:52:37.721 --> 01:52:41.080
<v Speaker 3>for just four and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really insane</v>

2525
01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:43.443
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2526
01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 3>When did it</v>

2527
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.770
<v Speaker 1>solidify in your head that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to like,</v>

2528
01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:52.640
<v Speaker 1>identify or like speak out as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonbeliever</v>

2529
01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:57.160
<v Speaker 3>this morning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>

2530
01:52:57.190 --> 01:52:59.500
<v Speaker 3>so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was actually talking to the same about</v>

2531
01:52:59.501 --> 01:53:01.150
<v Speaker 3>this a few months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2532
01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:02.560
<v Speaker 3>because like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2533
01:53:03.310 --> 01:53:06.690
<v Speaker 3>there's part of me that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I said when a lot of a lot</v>

2534
01:53:06.691 --> 01:53:10.040
<v Speaker 3>of people here jerk when they hear</v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist and uh,</v>

2535
01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:12.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't use that word for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist,</v>

2536
01:53:12.551 --> 01:53:16.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's because it entails like it</v>

2537
01:53:16.370 --> 01:53:19.750
<v Speaker 3>seems to bring in this idea that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>so certain your certain,</v>

2538
01:53:19.751 --> 01:53:21.730
<v Speaker 3>there's no god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mock people who are religious,</v>

2539
01:53:21.731 --> 01:53:23.700
<v Speaker 3>you don't like them and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2540
01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:25.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel that like,</v>

2541
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:30.070
<v Speaker 3>and I also feel like I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm open to evidence,</v>

2542
01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:32.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I haven't like decided there is no</v>

2543
01:53:32.531 --> 01:53:33.550
<v Speaker 3>god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I just,</v>

2544
01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:37.750
<v Speaker 3>I just don't see the evidence and so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't believe.</v>

2545
01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:40.960
<v Speaker 3>And if there is evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I want to know,</v>

2546
01:53:40.961 --> 01:53:41.720
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2547
01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:44.230
<v Speaker 3>I talked to religious people all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and I think about theology a lot.</v>

2548
01:53:44.231 --> 01:53:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't not like</v>

2549
01:53:45.690 --> 01:53:47.130
<v Speaker 1>it also becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2550
01:53:47.131 --> 01:53:51.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a group mentality involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheism and there's a.</v>

2551
01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:55.620
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why I was reluctant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to identify as an atheist is that so</v>

2552
01:53:55.621 --> 01:53:58.230
<v Speaker 1>many people were asking me to identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an atheist.</v>

2553
01:53:58.231 --> 01:53:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you give a shit?</v>

2554
01:53:59.550 --> 01:54:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want me to come out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you I'm not religious,</v>

2555
01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:05.760
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially</v>

2556
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:12.270
<v Speaker 1>especially the idea that there cannot be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a god or there cannot be any sort of a</v>

2557
01:54:13.561 --> 01:54:17.190
<v Speaker 1>higher power and that after you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just ends.</v>

2558
01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:18.860
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>

2559
01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:19.611
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2560
01:54:19.611 --> 01:54:23.000
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a knowing for certain that</v>

2561
01:54:23.001 --> 01:54:25.400
<v Speaker 3>there is no god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

2562
01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:28.000
<v Speaker 1>There's so little we know about human</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2563
01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Forget about the idea of possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterlife or the possibility of what</v>

2564
01:54:32.201 --> 01:54:35.500
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possibility of what this concept that we</v>

2565
01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:37.080
<v Speaker 1>call soul is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

2566
01:54:37.081 --> 01:54:40.330
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or forget about psychedelic experiences</v>

2567
01:54:40.331 --> 01:54:42.520
<v Speaker 1>and what do they represent and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2568
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:46.240
<v Speaker 1>what do they represent when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from what essentially is human</v>

2569
01:54:46.241 --> 01:54:50.680
<v Speaker 1>neurochemistry and there's the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>potent ones are chemicals that exist in</v>

2570
01:54:50.681 --> 01:54:52.660
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're indogenous and the human body</v>

2571
01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:57.220
<v Speaker 1>and what have those experiences and how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they so akin to religious</v>

2572
01:54:57.221 --> 01:55:00.580
<v Speaker 1>experiences and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do people even believe now,</v>

2573
01:55:00.581 --> 01:55:05.581
<v Speaker 1>especially these scholars in Jerusalem</v>
<v Speaker 1>have connected the burning Bush of Moses</v>

2574
01:55:06.370 --> 01:55:09.790
<v Speaker 1>with the Acacia Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a Bush that's rich and</v>

2575
01:55:09.791 --> 01:55:13.510
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic chemicals and they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's entirely possible that Moses</v>

2576
01:55:13.511 --> 01:55:18.370
<v Speaker 1>had a psychedelic experience in which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back with all the laws that human</v>

2577
01:55:18.371 --> 01:55:23.250
<v Speaker 1>beings are supposed to be lifting as</v>
<v Speaker 1>proclaimed by the great spirit of the</v>

2578
01:55:23.251 --> 01:55:24.930
<v Speaker 1>universe or whatever the hell he</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered.</v>

2579
01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Like who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2580
01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this idea that people love to say,</v>

2581
01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:30.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is dead.</v>

2582
01:55:30.931 --> 01:55:34.050
<v Speaker 1>There is no god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just as silly as saying</v>

2583
01:55:34.051 --> 01:55:34.884
<v Speaker 1>there is one.</v>

2584
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2585
01:55:35.710 --> 01:55:38.930
<v Speaker 3>and this is why like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the whole process since we left,</v>

2586
01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:41.420
<v Speaker 3>like it wasn't a like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2587
01:55:41.421 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the idea of choosing belief system,</v>

2588
01:55:44.011 --> 01:55:47.310
<v Speaker 3>like I would like learn all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Jehovah's Witnesses and like,</v>

2589
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:48.091
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2590
01:55:48.091 --> 01:55:49.810
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's mostly internally consistent.</v>

2591
01:55:49.811 --> 01:55:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Like I think there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never was tempted to join them or</v>

2592
01:55:53.191 --> 01:55:54.480
<v Speaker 3>whatever it actually say they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

2593
01:55:54.930 --> 01:55:56.610
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not witnesses anymore.</v>

2594
01:55:56.730 --> 01:55:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>

2595
01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:00.480
<v Speaker 3>since they left a little over a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of years ago,</v>

2596
01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:06.840
<v Speaker 3>do you think that you guys leaving and</v>
<v Speaker 3>having these intimate conversations with</v>

2597
01:56:06.841 --> 01:56:08.910
<v Speaker 3>them in their home might have had</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to do with the.</v>

2598
01:56:09.170 --> 01:56:10.980
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're still really good friends with</v>

2599
01:56:10.981 --> 01:56:12.720
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some of my best friends.</v>

2600
01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2601
01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:15.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that it was that direct of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing.</v>

2602
01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Part of the whole journey.</v>

2603
01:56:18.150 --> 01:56:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think so.</v>

2604
01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:23.370
<v Speaker 3>We would have these long conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually I was the craziest thing</v>

2605
01:56:23.371 --> 01:56:27.060
<v Speaker 3>when I found out that they had left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was,</v>

2606
01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.960
<v Speaker 3>it was dustin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Laura,</v>

2607
01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:31.730
<v Speaker 3>her name is Laura.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was her birthday and uh,</v>

2608
01:56:32.010 --> 01:56:33.780
<v Speaker 3>they don't drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't celebrate birthdays.</v>

2609
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Like I was talking on the phone and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know it was her birthday.</v>

2610
01:56:37.411 --> 01:56:40.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like we were talking on the phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>for over an hour and I was like telling</v>

2611
01:56:40.171 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 3>her about all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things that I'd been thinking</v>

2612
01:56:42.211 --> 01:56:44.670
<v Speaker 3>about and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then at the end of the conversation</v>

2613
01:56:44.671 --> 01:56:45.840
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

2614
01:56:45.841 --> 01:56:50.280
<v Speaker 3>well it's my birthday today and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrating it.</v>

2615
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:55.680
<v Speaker 3>And I just was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say anything for a couple of</v>

2616
01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.020
<v Speaker 3>seconds like I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I obviously like knowing what</v>

2617
01:56:58.021 --> 01:56:59.130
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was different.</v>

2618
01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.560
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't as like as much for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2619
01:57:01.561 --> 01:57:02.970
<v Speaker 3>like it wasn't the same level of.</v>

2620
01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:06.400
<v Speaker 3>But like I know the disorientation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the loss and the like,</v>

2621
01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:07.440
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's complicated.</v>

2622
01:57:07.441 --> 01:57:08.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't want to just be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2623
01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.590
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad you're out of this.</v>

2624
01:57:10.591 --> 01:57:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Because they think they believe some</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are really kind of nuts.</v>

2625
01:57:13.450 --> 01:57:15.680
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so I was just like very cautious.</v>

2626
01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.700
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know what happened but just</v>

2627
01:57:17.701 --> 01:57:18.590
<v Speaker 3>know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2628
01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:21.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always loved and cared about them</v>

2629
01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:22.980
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2630
01:57:22.981 --> 01:57:25.380
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was so eager to have these</v>

2631
01:57:25.381 --> 01:57:27.600
<v Speaker 3>converts to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand what had happened with him</v>

2632
01:57:27.630 --> 01:57:30.330
<v Speaker 3>and it's kind of just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just following the,</v>

2633
01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:34.290
<v Speaker 3>like how much internal inconsistency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you were saying earlier about</v>

2634
01:57:34.291 --> 01:57:36.150
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea about the Bible being the</v>

2635
01:57:36.151 --> 01:57:37.200
<v Speaker 3>infallible word of God and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2636
01:57:37.201 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 3>that's a neat trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you can argue around</v>

2637
01:57:39.481 --> 01:57:40.770
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why.</v>

2638
01:57:40.770 --> 01:57:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Like it's I think internal inconsistency</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the doctrines themselves.</v>

2639
01:57:45.810 --> 01:57:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Like that's seems to be a really</v>
<v Speaker 3>important way to get,</v>

2640
01:57:50.130 --> 01:57:52.170
<v Speaker 3>to get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get through that.</v>

2641
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to argue a seed of doubt.</v>

2642
01:57:54.330 --> 01:57:56.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's it.</v>

2643
01:57:56.130 --> 01:57:58.380
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's finding the inconsistency in these</v>

2644
01:57:58.381 --> 01:58:01.770
<v Speaker 3>two beliefs that allows you to maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>question the bigger things,</v>

2645
01:58:01.771 --> 01:58:05.290
<v Speaker 3>the bigger principles and anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just I think it's,</v>

2646
01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:07.320
<v Speaker 3>it's important to ask the questions no</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter what you believe.</v>

2647
01:58:07.321 --> 01:58:10.350
<v Speaker 3>It's important to question and to always</v>
<v Speaker 3>be looking and examining for new</v>

2648
01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:11.520
<v Speaker 3>evidence because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2649
01:58:11.570 --> 01:58:14.460
<v Speaker 3>you talked about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like confirmation bias and cognitive</v>

2650
01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:19.461
<v Speaker 3>dissonance like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things that keep us locked into</v>

2651
01:58:20.101 --> 01:58:23.640
<v Speaker 3>these belief systems and impervious to</v>
<v Speaker 3>change or we're not even in previous but</v>

2652
01:58:23.641 --> 01:58:28.530
<v Speaker 3>like resistant to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to be like open and so this is,</v>

2653
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still try to do this and this is why,</v>

2654
01:58:30.871 --> 01:58:31.770
<v Speaker 3>like I do.</v>

2655
01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever want to look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab your mom?</v>

2656
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:37.340
<v Speaker 3>You got to listen to me for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

2657
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:39.960
<v Speaker 3>let's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

2658
01:58:39.961 --> 01:58:40.920
<v Speaker 3>if she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to,</v>

2659
01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:42.850
<v Speaker 3>to her if she would listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

2660
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:44.640
<v Speaker 3>she just won't even look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2661
01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:46.600
<v Speaker 3>you'd be knocked on the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rang your doorbell.</v>

2662
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2663
01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:49.520
<v Speaker 3>that's happened a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not me,</v>

2664
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:52.150
<v Speaker 3>my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like they close the curtain the</v>

2665
01:58:52.151 --> 01:58:53.970
<v Speaker 3>window and turn off the lights inside</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2666
01:58:53.971 --> 01:58:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Have that happened once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2667
01:58:57.340 --> 01:58:57.771
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2668
01:58:57.771 --> 01:58:58.750
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they won't.</v>

2669
01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.440
<v Speaker 3>And this is why it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She might hear this.</v>

2670
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:04.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would listen to this.</v>

2671
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:06.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's possible.</v>

2672
01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:07.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2673
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I think somebody at the church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll listen to it for sure.</v>

2674
01:59:09.970 --> 01:59:11.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is the thing like when people</v>

2675
01:59:11.531 --> 01:59:14.080
<v Speaker 3>leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everything that we say most,</v>

2676
01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:16.480
<v Speaker 3>any of us who leave that we say and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly,</v>

2677
01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:18.400
<v Speaker 3>the church pays very close attention to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2678
01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was at the church I did the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

2679
01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:25.060
<v Speaker 3>And partly it's a like needing to know</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what they're saying so that you can</v>

2680
01:59:25.061 --> 01:59:28.710
<v Speaker 3>have a good explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should counter it effectively or yeah,</v>

2681
01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:32.320
<v Speaker 3>points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2682
01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:37.500
<v Speaker 3>but so this is why another reason why it</v>
<v Speaker 3>became evident that I couldn't hide</v>

2683
01:59:37.841 --> 01:59:41.170
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I hiding following the rules,</v>

2684
01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:43.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretending like none of this happened</v>

2685
01:59:43.311 --> 01:59:45.670
<v Speaker 3>and not causing any waves for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>church.</v>

2686
01:59:46.150 --> 01:59:49.120
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't change anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the only thing that helps is,</v>

2687
01:59:49.450 --> 01:59:50.880
<v Speaker 3>is talking about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2688
01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:53.290
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because here's the other thing,</v>

2689
01:59:53.291 --> 01:59:56.450
<v Speaker 3>like even if I like privately in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in letters like,</v>

2690
01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:59.440
<v Speaker 3>or things that I sent to my parents or</v>
<v Speaker 3>other church members,</v>

2691
01:59:59.710 --> 02:00:02.230
<v Speaker 3>like they're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably not going to share</v>

2692
02:00:02.231 --> 02:00:03.580
<v Speaker 3>those with my siblings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they do,</v>

2693
02:00:03.581 --> 02:00:06.070
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be with a whole bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2694
02:00:06.071 --> 02:00:07.690
<v Speaker 3>words against me at the same time.</v>

2695
02:00:07.690 --> 02:00:08.180
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2696
02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:12.260
<v Speaker 3>it's only by talking publicly can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2697
02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:16.180
<v Speaker 3>that's how they can actually see who you</v>
<v Speaker 3>really are and what you really think and</v>

2698
02:00:16.181 --> 02:00:21.070
<v Speaker 3>what you've really gone through without</v>
<v Speaker 3>the filter of look at what these tours</v>

2699
02:00:21.071 --> 02:00:22.690
<v Speaker 3>are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

2700
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2701
02:00:24.701 --> 02:00:26.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think your kids are,</v>

2702
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:28.630
<v Speaker 3>your brothers and sisters are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear this?</v>

2703
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:34.350
<v Speaker 3>I think some of them definitely might</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely my hope that they'll</v>

2704
02:00:34.901 --> 02:00:38.680
<v Speaker 3>eventually bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

2705
02:00:38.710 --> 02:00:42.100
<v Speaker 3>I hope that they not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not because of any.</v>

2706
02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I hope they can hear the reasoning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

2707
02:00:46.450 --> 02:00:49.390
<v Speaker 3>see the consequences of what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing for other people.</v>

2708
02:00:49.391 --> 02:00:52.600
<v Speaker 3>And that a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean is unscriptural.</v>

2709
02:00:52.601 --> 02:00:55.030
<v Speaker 3>And so even even by their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding,</v>

2710
02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:56.550
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2711
02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:00.940
<v Speaker 3>there are things that contradict them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that they change their minds.</v>

2712
02:01:00.941 --> 02:01:05.941
<v Speaker 3>And at the very least I hope that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>church continues to moderate to not be.</v>

2713
02:01:06.491 --> 02:01:09.280
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of their new signs are things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2714
02:01:09.281 --> 02:01:13.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one of the big things for me was</v>

2715
02:01:13.061 --> 02:01:14.470
<v Speaker 3>imprecatory prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2716
02:01:14.471 --> 02:01:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Which is this idea of this word</v>
<v Speaker 3>imprecatory to like record tour.</v>

2717
02:01:18.990 --> 02:01:22.180
<v Speaker 3>So it's like the word praying for curses</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your enemies.</v>

2718
02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2719
02:01:23.921 --> 02:01:26.440
<v Speaker 3>So we did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You a curse against your enemies.</v>

2720
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm often,</v>

2721
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:28.691
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2722
02:01:28.691 --> 02:01:31.600
<v Speaker 3>That seems incredibly non Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2723
02:01:31.690 --> 02:01:34.240
<v Speaker 3>But there's a like David King,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David.</v>

2724
02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:38.350
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

2725
02:01:38.770 --> 02:01:39.591
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing.</v>

2726
02:01:39.591 --> 02:01:40.311
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2727
02:01:40.311 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took that as an example for us.</v>

2728
02:01:41.991 --> 02:01:45.500
<v Speaker 3>So he prayed for his enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their children to be fatherless and</v>

2729
02:01:45.501 --> 02:01:49.220
<v Speaker 3>for their wives to be widows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's praying for God to do all</v>

2730
02:01:49.221 --> 02:01:52.910
<v Speaker 3>these bad things to the Romans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was praying against the Romans.</v>

2731
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:56.400
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it David the Philistines</v>

2732
02:01:58.340 --> 02:01:59.810
<v Speaker 3>and saw I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2733
02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:02.750
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we took that as an example.</v>

2734
02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So after we left,</v>

2735
02:02:05.781 --> 02:02:10.781
<v Speaker 3>I sent a is I contacted my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was my dad and uh,</v>

2736
02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:15.650
<v Speaker 3>talked about this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like David also had a lot of wives,</v>

2737
02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:19.790
<v Speaker 3>but we don't take his example as that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men should have many whys.</v>

2738
02:02:19.791 --> 02:02:23.510
<v Speaker 3>And what about that and why it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it contradicts what Jesus and</v>

2739
02:02:23.511 --> 02:02:26.810
<v Speaker 3>the Apostle Paul said about marriage</v>
<v Speaker 3>being one man,</v>

2740
02:02:26.811 --> 02:02:27.860
<v Speaker 3>one woman for life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2741
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:30.060
<v Speaker 3>So Jesus knew way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2742
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:33.290
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Jesus and Paul both also said they</v>

2743
02:02:33.291 --> 02:02:36.080
<v Speaker 3>talked about loving your enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bless them,</v>

2744
02:02:36.081 --> 02:02:39.980
<v Speaker 3>that curse you and pray for them that</v>
<v Speaker 3>despitefully use you and persecute you.</v>

2745
02:02:40.130 --> 02:02:43.220
<v Speaker 3>So you're supposed to be praying for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>good of your enemies.</v>

2746
02:02:43.221 --> 02:02:44.054
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2747
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:45.780
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2748
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:50.570
<v Speaker 3>it's a contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so anyway,</v>

2749
02:02:50.571 --> 02:02:53.780
<v Speaker 3>it's another like a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's been a bunch of sermons</v>

2750
02:02:53.781 --> 02:02:56.710
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now my grandfather passed away almost</v>

2751
02:02:56.810 --> 02:03:00.990
<v Speaker 3>three years ago and so now there's eight</v>
<v Speaker 3>elders and they're the eight pastors in</v>

2752
02:03:00.991 --> 02:03:02.030
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad is one of them.</v>

2753
02:03:02.031 --> 02:03:05.960
<v Speaker 3>So there's been a series of sermons on</v>
<v Speaker 3>imprecatory prayer since then.</v>

2754
02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:09.770
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it seems so confused</v>

2755
02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:13.880
<v Speaker 3>because like on the one hand there still</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of justifying it,</v>

2756
02:03:13.881 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 3>but also it just seems like you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to reconcile things that aren't</v>

2757
02:03:16.671 --> 02:03:17.504
<v Speaker 3>reconcilable.</v>

2758
02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:19.280
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2759
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:21.910
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2760
02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:23.270
<v Speaker 3>so they stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say,</v>

2761
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:27.710
<v Speaker 3>there used to be a flyer that went out</v>
<v Speaker 3>every Friday and that used to say like,</v>

2762
02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:32.860
<v Speaker 3>thank God for 15 dead soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we pray for $15,000 more and so it would</v>

2763
02:03:33.021 --> 02:03:35.870
<v Speaker 3>list all the soldiers who had died that</v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

2764
02:03:36.110 --> 02:03:37.920
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within a,</v>

2765
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:40.170
<v Speaker 3>like after like eight months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2766
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:42.370
<v Speaker 3>my dad gave a sermon about imprecatory</v>
<v Speaker 3>prayer,</v>

2767
02:03:42.371 --> 02:03:44.610
<v Speaker 3>like at the time when I first said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2768
02:03:44.670 --> 02:03:47.000
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he put out a video news,</v>

2769
02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:50.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining like why imprecatory prayer</v>

2770
02:03:50.241 --> 02:03:52.310
<v Speaker 3>is the thing and it's supported by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible.</v>

2771
02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Eight months passed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gives a sermon about loving your</v>

2772
02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:58.930
<v Speaker 3>enemies within a couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that flyer was changed.</v>

2773
02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Now it doesn't say that we pray for</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,000 more.</v>

2774
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen the first part is the</v>

2775
02:04:04.811 --> 02:04:06.010
<v Speaker 3>first part still thank God.</v>

2776
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:09.080
<v Speaker 3>So they say because God is sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to thank him for everything.</v>

2777
02:04:09.081 --> 02:04:14.030
<v Speaker 3>So the fact that these for $15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the second part where I'm just trying</v>

2778
02:04:14.031 --> 02:04:18.230
<v Speaker 3>to say is like there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has been some moderation and a lot</v>

2779
02:04:18.231 --> 02:04:23.231
<v Speaker 3>of the new signs or things like be</v>
<v Speaker 3>reconciled to God and Christ our hope,</v>

2780
02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:25.200
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

2781
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:27.680
<v Speaker 3>that are not God hates fags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those are.</v>

2782
02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:30.290
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's improvement at the very</v>

2783
02:04:30.291 --> 02:04:32.150
<v Speaker 3>least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though there are still obviously</v>

2784
02:04:32.151 --> 02:04:34.550
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these harsh things as well.</v>

2785
02:04:35.630 --> 02:04:38.850
<v Speaker 3>So there's some adjustment and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>

2786
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:40.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2787
02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:42.390
<v Speaker 1>So you don't talk to your dad anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>

2788
02:04:42.391 --> 02:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows</v>

2789
02:04:46.050 --> 02:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2790
02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that you think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do other than continuing to</v>

2791
02:04:54.901 --> 02:04:59.901
<v Speaker 1>speak and continuing to do what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that's going to reach them?</v>

2792
02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:03.710
<v Speaker 3>So I mean I am almost finished writing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

2793
02:05:03.740 --> 02:05:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm nearing the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a book to them?</v>

2794
02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:10.280
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is both for them and also for,</v>

2795
02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:13.370
<v Speaker 3>for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's part of the,</v>

2796
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:16.760
<v Speaker 3>kind of what I was getting at was this</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you writing a book like letters to</v>

2797
02:05:16.761 --> 02:05:18.440
<v Speaker 3>my mom and dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not,</v>

2798
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:21.410
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not written quite that way a lot as</v>

2799
02:05:21.411 --> 02:05:23.510
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually did consider doing it that</v>

2800
02:05:23.511 --> 02:05:25.670
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but eventually ended up,</v>

2801
02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:28.240
<v Speaker 3>like right now it's based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2802
02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:31.640
<v Speaker 3>each chapter is based on a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of brings us like the stars</v>

2803
02:05:31.641 --> 02:05:35.540
<v Speaker 3>with my mother and then my grandfather</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sort of like coming into this</v>

2804
02:05:35.541 --> 02:05:38.600
<v Speaker 3>ideology and then the process of all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2805
02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:42.140
<v Speaker 3>like the mental machinations of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of leaving and like how my mind changed</v>

2806
02:05:42.141 --> 02:05:44.480
<v Speaker 3>over time and then what's happened since</v>
<v Speaker 3>we left.</v>

2807
02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hope that by,</v>

2808
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:47.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from my family,</v>

2809
02:05:47.901 --> 02:05:50.540
<v Speaker 3>I hope that by articulating these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2810
02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:54.170
<v Speaker 3>in a way it's like obviously we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting here and even if we talk for</v>

2811
02:05:54.171 --> 02:05:58.160
<v Speaker 3>like however many hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's only so much that it's not</v>

2812
02:05:58.161 --> 02:06:02.840
<v Speaker 3>the same as having it written in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hopefully very clear and,</v>

2813
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:05.300
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2814
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:09.800
<v Speaker 3>and just honest to the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in as much detail and clarity with</v>

2815
02:06:09.801 --> 02:06:12.680
<v Speaker 3>as much clarity as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that that's,</v>

2816
02:06:13.010 --> 02:06:17.480
<v Speaker 3>I hope that that will be effective in at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least showing them that there's a</v>

2817
02:06:17.481 --> 02:06:19.370
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are other ways of,</v>

2818
02:06:19.850 --> 02:06:23.690
<v Speaker 3>of understanding these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I do hope that,</v>

2819
02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:26.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I also hope,</v>

2820
02:06:26.090 --> 02:06:28.290
<v Speaker 3>like in my ted talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2821
02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

2822
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel really,</v>

2823
02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:38.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm like hesitant about like trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>teach anybody anything at this point,</v>

2824
02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:40.280
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2825
02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:43.100
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I spent my whole life telling</v>

2826
02:06:43.101 --> 02:06:45.560
<v Speaker 3>other people how to live and now it'd be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2827
02:06:46.130 --> 02:06:48.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys know I got this,</v>

2828
02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.540
<v Speaker 3>now I got this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2829
02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:53.570
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just the idea of like,</v>

2830
02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:58.220
<v Speaker 3>insinuating even in any way that I have</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to tell people about anything.</v>

2831
02:06:58.221 --> 02:06:59.054
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2832
02:06:59.090 --> 02:07:01.190
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't like that idea at all.</v>

2833
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:04.460
<v Speaker 3>And the only reason I did the Jon Ronson</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually as the one who reached out to</v>

2834
02:07:04.461 --> 02:07:05.740
<v Speaker 3>me about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about doing it because he,</v>

2835
02:07:05.770 --> 02:07:08.330
<v Speaker 3>it was a thing that he was curating an</v>
<v Speaker 3>event that he was curating,</v>

2836
02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:10.420
<v Speaker 3>curating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2837
02:07:11.070 --> 02:07:13.170
<v Speaker 3>and so I wrote the first draft of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk and,</v>

2838
02:07:13.190 --> 02:07:16.130
<v Speaker 3>and the curators came back afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2839
02:07:16.131 --> 02:07:19.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like this is how can we avoid the</v>

2840
02:07:19.851 --> 02:07:23.990
<v Speaker 3>mistakes that you made?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like I went back and like took</v>

2841
02:07:23.991 --> 02:07:27.460
<v Speaker 3>examples from David and my husband in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that people on twitter engage</v>

2842
02:07:27.461 --> 02:07:28.340
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That actually helped,</v>

2843
02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:33.740
<v Speaker 3>helped change things but so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not explicit in that way in the</v>

2844
02:07:33.741 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I hope that just</v>

2845
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.980
<v Speaker 2>by talking about this and telling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories like I when I read accounts of</v>

2846
02:07:41.681 --> 02:07:43.450
<v Speaker 2>people who have gone through similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations,</v>

2847
02:07:44.250 --> 02:07:47.320
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so helpful to me like to realize</v>

2848
02:07:47.321 --> 02:07:49.210
<v Speaker 2>like my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yes,</v>

2849
02:07:49.211 --> 02:07:51.150
<v Speaker 2>they man up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their activities are,</v>

2850
02:07:51.210 --> 02:07:54.100
<v Speaker 2>are kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're extreme and they manifest</v>

2851
02:07:54.101 --> 02:07:56.410
<v Speaker 2>themselves in very strange ways to most</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2852
02:07:56.710 --> 02:07:59.410
<v Speaker 2>But they're very common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very human flaws.</v>

2853
02:07:59.710 --> 02:08:01.480
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything that,</v>

2854
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:06.040
<v Speaker 2>if I talk about this in a way that helps</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people see it in their own lives</v>

2855
02:08:06.041 --> 02:08:08.650
<v Speaker 2>or that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will resonate with people who have gone</v>

2856
02:08:08.651 --> 02:08:11.610
<v Speaker 2>through similar things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2857
02:08:11.670 --> 02:08:12.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2858
02:08:12.230 --> 02:08:13.180
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do that.</v>

2859
02:08:13.181 --> 02:08:18.181
<v Speaker 2>I want to do as much good with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences as I can because just</v>

2860
02:08:18.551 --> 02:08:20.450
<v Speaker 2>because that's how my parents raised me</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

2861
02:08:21.150 --> 02:08:23.580
<v Speaker 1>But their argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it'd be,</v>

2862
02:08:23.610 --> 02:08:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were so right and so convinced when</v>

2863
02:08:28.141 --> 02:08:32.100
<v Speaker 1>you were with the church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're so right and so convinced.</v>

2864
02:08:32.101 --> 02:08:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Now that you're outside of the church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know you're right now?</v>

2865
02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:37.510
<v Speaker 2>The latter is not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same at all.</v>

2866
02:08:37.511 --> 02:08:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not walk through the world with a</v>

2867
02:08:40.121 --> 02:08:43.710
<v Speaker 2>sense of what that sense of certainty</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2868
02:08:43.770 --> 02:08:46.390
<v Speaker 2>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my position and righteousness of my</v>

2869
02:08:46.391 --> 02:08:49.950
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am asking questions and I'm,</v>

2870
02:08:50.130 --> 02:08:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to explain what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why I believe differently now than I</v>

2871
02:08:54.461 --> 02:08:57.130
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still asking the questions that like</v>

2872
02:08:57.131 --> 02:08:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2873
02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:00.340
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2874
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:02.530
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a fundamentally different way</v>

2875
02:09:02.531 --> 02:09:03.740
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of engaging.</v>

2876
02:09:03.741 --> 02:09:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2877
02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:05.640
<v Speaker 1>The world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know what you mean.</v>

2878
02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:08.760
<v Speaker 1>But if I was on their side and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to pick holes in your statement,</v>

2879
02:09:08.761 --> 02:09:10.770
<v Speaker 1>which is what they seem to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2880
02:09:10.771 --> 02:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>If they're listening to the things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2881
02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:16.170
<v Speaker 1>they're listening to the things you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can counter them with some sort</v>

2882
02:09:16.171 --> 02:09:19.440
<v Speaker 1>of a bible quote or some sort of a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate opinion.</v>

2883
02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was listening,</v>

2884
02:09:21.210 --> 02:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I would say you were so convinced when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you with us.</v>

2885
02:09:23.701 --> 02:09:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Now you're so convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now you don't even have God.</v>

2886
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.900
<v Speaker 1>How could you be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2887
02:09:28.110 --> 02:09:30.180
<v Speaker 1>So the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're diluted the Satan,</v>

2888
02:09:30.181 --> 02:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>the serpent scales are covering your</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

2889
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:35.670
<v Speaker 1>So this a shall I thought this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

2890
02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:36.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one of</v>

2891
02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:39.980
<v Speaker 2>paradoxes that I realized before I left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this verse,</v>

2892
02:09:39.981 --> 02:09:42.400
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one that my mom make was good</v>

2893
02:09:42.401 --> 02:09:45.910
<v Speaker 2>quote all the time growing up and with</v>
<v Speaker 2>such urgency,</v>

2894
02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:48.720
<v Speaker 2>like she needed us to understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2895
02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:53.560
<v Speaker 2>and the versus the heart is deceitful</v>
<v Speaker 2>above all things and desperately wicked</v>

2896
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:55.240
<v Speaker 2>who can know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2897
02:09:55.630 --> 02:09:58.630
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought the heart was good.</v>

2898
02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Homeless with the heart is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2899
02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I thought I fell hard is people being</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet.</v>

2900
02:10:04.090 --> 02:10:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

2901
02:10:04.850 --> 02:10:08.150
<v Speaker 2>human heart is inherently and according</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the churches inherently deceitful.</v>

2902
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2903
02:10:09.620 --> 02:10:14.150
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is they also talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heart as being like,</v>

2904
02:10:14.151 --> 02:10:18.890
<v Speaker 2>that's how we know that the Bible is</v>
<v Speaker 2>true because God puts an unction on our</v>

2905
02:10:18.891 --> 02:10:21.020
<v Speaker 2>hearts are deceitful heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2906
02:10:21.021 --> 02:10:23.600
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're at the end of the day,</v>

2907
02:10:24.170 --> 02:10:27.800
<v Speaker 2>it's always our own hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's our hearts that say,</v>

2908
02:10:27.801 --> 02:10:29.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to follow the Bible no</v>

2909
02:10:29.811 --> 02:10:32.240
<v Speaker 2>matter no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or in other words,</v>

2910
02:10:32.241 --> 02:10:34.310
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each one of us is always</v>

2911
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:37.370
<v Speaker 3>making a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that for them,</v>

2912
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:39.530
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think that outsourcing it and</v>

2913
02:10:39.531 --> 02:10:40.311
<v Speaker 3>saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

2914
02:10:40.311 --> 02:10:41.360
<v Speaker 3>it's the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2915
02:10:41.361 --> 02:10:42.111
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the,</v>

2916
02:10:42.111 --> 02:10:46.220
<v Speaker 3>it's your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to articulate that's on Sam's.</v>

2917
02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris was show a couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

2918
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:49.970
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's that I read it actually in his</v>

2919
02:10:49.971 --> 02:10:51.110
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's what helps me.</v>

2920
02:10:51.111 --> 02:10:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your own moral impulses that are</v>

2921
02:10:54.231 --> 02:10:57.620
<v Speaker 3>authenticating the truth of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2922
02:10:57.740 --> 02:11:00.530
<v Speaker 3>So at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still you.</v>

2923
02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:05.120
<v Speaker 3>It's still your judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your judgment of your own deceitful</v>

2924
02:11:05.121 --> 02:11:07.100
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

2925
02:11:07.101 --> 02:11:10.070
<v Speaker 3>from their perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess what I'm saying now is like,</v>

2926
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:11.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>

2927
02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.030
<v Speaker 3>when I talked to my family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm addressing them,</v>

2928
02:11:14.031 --> 02:11:15.800
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's with these questions like,</v>

2929
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:20.810
<v Speaker 3>I know how you understand these verses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about these things that</v>

2930
02:11:20.811 --> 02:11:23.960
<v Speaker 3>contradict them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you're wrong,</v>

2931
02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:28.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying I can't see how you're right</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of these versus how do you do</v>

2932
02:11:28.491 --> 02:11:28.780
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

2933
02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about versus the contradict other</v>

2934
02:11:32.211 --> 02:11:35.700
<v Speaker 3>verses in the Bible that the church</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't believe in that,</v>

2935
02:11:35.730 --> 02:11:37.580
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that those contradictions exist.</v>

2936
02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:40.700
<v Speaker 3>Talk about those contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are pretty clear.</v>

2937
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:42.980
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they say?</v>

2938
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the Lord works in mysterious ways,</v>

2939
02:11:48.420 --> 02:11:48.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2940
02:11:48.930 --> 02:11:50.470
<v Speaker 3>there's always that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

2941
02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:54.260
<v Speaker 3>if you think there's like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like back to the like free will and</v>

2942
02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:57.920
<v Speaker 3>predestination thing that God designed</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people to go to hell and then</v>

2943
02:11:57.921 --> 02:12:00.280
<v Speaker 3>holding them responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this.</v>

2944
02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.370
<v Speaker 3>This is a contradiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2945
02:12:01.371 --> 02:12:04.850
<v Speaker 3>This the idea that you are responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2946
02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Your man's responsibility and God's</v>
<v Speaker 3>sovereignty,</v>

2947
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:11.060
<v Speaker 3>they don't go together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's an awesome quote.</v>

2948
02:12:11.061 --> 02:12:16.061
<v Speaker 3>Can you say that quota go man's a man's</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and God's sovereignty.</v>

2949
02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 3>They do not go together with the quote</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Bible.</v>

2950
02:12:20.031 --> 02:12:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

2951
02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:22.570
<v Speaker 3>I phrased,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2952
02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:26.150
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the navy o man who art thou</v>

2953
02:12:26.151 --> 02:12:27.360
<v Speaker 3>that reply against God.</v>

2954
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:29.263
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2955
02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Shall the thing formed say to him that</v>
<v Speaker 3>formed it.</v>

2956
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Why Hast Thou made me this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2957
02:12:35.530 --> 02:12:36.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

2958
02:12:36.710 --> 02:12:39.260
<v Speaker 3>those ideas are inherently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're inconsistent,</v>

2959
02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:40.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their contradictions.</v>

2960
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:44.060
<v Speaker 3>And so gramps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember one day in church,</v>

2961
02:12:44.061 --> 02:12:45.650
<v Speaker 3>he lives gramps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gramps.</v>

2962
02:12:45.651 --> 02:12:48.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like such a cute name is great</v>

2963
02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:53.500
<v Speaker 3>evil dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could be so grandpa Tony and,</v>

2964
02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:56.330
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so funny because like again,</v>

2965
02:12:56.331 --> 02:12:58.220
<v Speaker 3>be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2967
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Very sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would sing the song from the forties</v>

2968

<v Speaker 3>and call us my great big beautiful doll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a huge call us and love bug.</v>

2969

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2970
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:12.770
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't get to see him before he died</v>

2971
02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:16.910
<v Speaker 3>because you left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think I can talk about that.</v>

2972
02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:20.960
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not unless you're me to start crying.</v>

2973
02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:23.230
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2974
02:13:23.231 --> 02:13:24.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2975
02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:25.273
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

2976
02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:26.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2977
02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:30.470
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was that deep for all the stuff you</v>

2978
02:13:30.471 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 3>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you</v>

2979
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.890
<v Speaker 1>can't talk to your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk to your mom,</v>

2980
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but something about your grandpa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's special.</v>

2981
02:13:39.740 --> 02:13:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you later.</v>

2982
02:13:42.190 --> 02:13:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2983
02:13:43.690 --> 02:13:48.690
<v Speaker 1>so in the eyes of most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the booming voice of hate for</v>

2984
02:13:49.711 --> 02:13:51.690
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I totally understand.</v>

2985
02:13:51.691 --> 02:13:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It is not so fascinating though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could see someone in an</v>

2986
02:13:54.601 --> 02:13:57.420
<v Speaker 1>intimate way you'd love them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their family.</v>

2987
02:13:57.421 --> 02:14:01.470
<v Speaker 1>You get to see all the positive aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and yet do you get to see this</v>

2988
02:14:01.530 --> 02:14:06.530
<v Speaker 1>venom that he spews out to all the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that also represents you guys</v>

2989
02:14:07.051 --> 02:14:10.860
<v Speaker 1>and your family and your ideology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your behind this powerful leader.</v>

2990
02:14:10.861 --> 02:14:12.510
<v Speaker 1>He's the founder of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2991
02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:15.570
<v Speaker 1>So essentially he's the man who created</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very bar.</v>

2992
02:14:15.571 --> 02:14:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Is that imprison your family right now?</v>

2993
02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.170
<v Speaker 2>I know and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

2994
02:14:19.230 --> 02:14:20.880
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the things you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

2995
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:24.450
<v Speaker 2>after I left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thinking about like how did we get</v>

2996
02:14:24.451 --> 02:14:25.480
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll,</v>

2997
02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:27.720
<v Speaker 2>how did we end up in this place?</v>

2998
02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:32.610
<v Speaker 1>It's an understanding of psychology or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of the problem with any sort of</v>

2999
02:14:32.611 --> 02:14:35.460
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid ideologies that are backed up by a</v>

3000
02:14:35.461 --> 02:14:39.690
<v Speaker 1>deity is that there can be no</v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning and as soon as there can be</v>

3001
02:14:39.691 --> 02:14:42.630
<v Speaker 1>no questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about human language.</v>

3002
02:14:42.810 --> 02:14:46.440
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about something that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously from the words of human</v>

3003
02:14:46.441 --> 02:14:48.540
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wrote those words down,</v>

3004
02:14:48.541 --> 02:14:51.510
<v Speaker 1>they put them somewhere and now you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing this ideology.</v>

3005
02:14:51.511 --> 02:14:56.511
<v Speaker 1>Anyone with even a basic understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how easily influenced people are and</v>

3006
02:14:56.581 --> 02:15:01.170
<v Speaker 1>about our alpha male chimpanzee history</v>
<v Speaker 1>or lower primate history.</v>

3007
02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:05.610
<v Speaker 1>We know that we're incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to influence and incredibly</v>

3008
02:15:05.611 --> 02:15:09.990
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to the whims of the group</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset and that this was imperative for</v>

3009
02:15:09.991 --> 02:15:12.990
<v Speaker 1>survival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These tribal instincts that we have</v>

3010
02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:18.180
<v Speaker 1>imperative for survival and the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we made it to 2017 and that these</v>

3011
02:15:18.721 --> 02:15:23.721
<v Speaker 1>play against us in the forms of ideology</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these very rigidly reinforced</v>

3012
02:15:24.331 --> 02:15:28.830
<v Speaker 1>behavior patterns mean that is what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when the problem,</v>

3013
02:15:28.831 --> 02:15:33.831
<v Speaker 1>because atheism versus people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>deists or people who are Christian or</v>

3014
02:15:34.561 --> 02:15:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Muslim or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with that.</v>

3015
02:15:37.111 --> 02:15:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just about mind and about humans</v>

3016
02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:41.813
<v Speaker 1>and about our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

3017
02:15:42.210 --> 02:15:45.390
<v Speaker 1>our inherent tendency to give in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

3018
02:15:45.630 --> 02:15:50.130
<v Speaker 1>these predetermined patterns of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give us comfort in these patterns</v>

3019
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:53.640
<v Speaker 2>that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is so much comfort in certainty.</v>

3020
02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

3021
02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:56.730
<v Speaker 2>it can be really frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these,</v>

3022
02:15:56.731 --> 02:15:59.190
<v Speaker 2>sometimes all the rules and the like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

3023
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:03.300
<v Speaker 2>very rigid but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after when I left,</v>

3024
02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:06.810
<v Speaker 2>the uncertainty was just this enormous</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

3025
02:16:06.811 --> 02:16:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Like I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you normally wait on?</v>

3026
02:16:10.411 --> 02:16:12.570
<v Speaker 2>You just all of a sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3027
02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:14.430
<v Speaker 2>because like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well one,</v>

3028
02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:16.800
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that makes doing</v>

3029
02:16:16.801 --> 02:16:20.130
<v Speaker 2>things like this hard or like speaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly at all now that it's not like</v>

3030
02:16:20.131 --> 02:16:23.100
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with God on my side or whatever is</v>

3031
02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:25.530
<v Speaker 2>the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like now I'm standing on my own two</v>

3032
02:16:25.531 --> 02:16:26.161
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

3033
02:16:26.161 --> 02:16:28.590
<v Speaker 2>it's my own ideas and like who the hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I?</v>

3034
02:16:28.830 --> 02:16:29.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that</v>

3035
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.610
<v Speaker 3>sense of like self doubt and uncertainty</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3036
02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:36.670
<v Speaker 3>and like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3037
02:16:36.671 --> 02:16:37.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3038
02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:39.400
<v Speaker 3>it can be crippling sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3039
02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:42.640
<v Speaker 3>but you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to keep going and keep asking</v>

3040
02:16:42.641 --> 02:16:43.061
<v Speaker 3>the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3041
02:16:43.061 --> 02:16:44.170
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

3042
02:16:44.171 --> 02:16:46.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole another reason I don't</v>

3043
02:16:46.991 --> 02:16:51.790
<v Speaker 3>like to call myself an atheist or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to call myself anything actually,</v>

3044
02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

3045
02:16:53.321 --> 02:16:55.270
<v Speaker 3>I cannot stop talking about Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3046
02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:56.680
<v Speaker 3>but he had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3047
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:59.200
<v Speaker 3>this video or he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we shouldn't call ourselves</v>

3048
02:16:59.201 --> 02:17:01.960
<v Speaker 3>atheists or secularists or humanists</v>
<v Speaker 3>written to college.</v>

3049
02:17:01.961 --> 02:17:06.840
<v Speaker 3>So was anything we should just be good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decent people living in the world and,</v>

3050
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:09.040
<v Speaker 3>and challenging bad ideas wherever we</v>
<v Speaker 3>find them.</v>

3051
02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:12.840
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we want an identity like sugar,</v>

3052
02:17:12.841 --> 02:17:15.850
<v Speaker 3>crave identity and belonging in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

3053
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:18.490
<v Speaker 3>the ingroup like what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about grants,</v>

3054
02:17:18.491 --> 02:17:21.160
<v Speaker 3>like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much goodness I got to see in him</v>

3055
02:17:21.161 --> 02:17:23.170
<v Speaker 3>that like people on the outside never</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw.</v>

3056
02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:24.550
<v Speaker 3>It's because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3057
02:17:24.551 --> 02:17:26.970
<v Speaker 3>the Ingroup outgroup mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the bar,</v>

3058
02:17:27.010 --> 02:17:28.540
<v Speaker 3>like I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bonds that are forged there.</v>

3059
02:17:28.541 --> 02:17:31.150
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so enticing,</v>

3060
02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:33.460
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it comes at a,</v>

3061
02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:37.510
<v Speaker 3>at a huge cost and I didn't see that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cost for a long time,</v>

3062
02:17:37.570 --> 02:17:40.930
<v Speaker 3>so now this is another reason I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't like those labels.</v>

3063
02:17:40.931 --> 02:17:45.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just about trying to find the best</v>

3064
02:17:45.131 --> 02:17:48.640
<v Speaker 3>way we can to live in the world and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much good as we can.</v>

3065
02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I think there are bumps in the road and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of culture.</v>

3066
02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they are or think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't figured out how dangerous they</v>

3067
02:17:55.621 --> 02:17:59.760
<v Speaker 1>are and that we fall prey to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also the reason why we got</v>

3068
02:17:59.761 --> 02:18:02.700
<v Speaker 1>here in the first place because we did</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out these ways to bond together</v>

3069
02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:05.850
<v Speaker 1>and we did figure out these ways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with each other in this very</v>

3070
02:18:05.851 --> 02:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very personal way and if it wasn't for</v>

3071
02:18:08.701 --> 02:18:11.730
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows if we would have ever made it</v>

3072
02:18:11.731 --> 02:18:13.110
<v Speaker 1>this far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

3073
02:18:13.111 --> 02:18:17.430
<v Speaker 1>but they've also also been able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been able to rationalize</v>

3074
02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:21.360
<v Speaker 1>horrific acts through the use of this us</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus them.</v>

3075
02:18:21.450 --> 02:18:22.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3076
02:18:22.321 --> 02:18:27.321
<v Speaker 1>our group versus the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange aspect of what I</v>

3077
02:18:27.601 --> 02:18:32.601
<v Speaker 1>believe is the adolescent nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human social and cultural evolution,</v>

3078
02:18:33.301 --> 02:18:34.590
<v Speaker 1>which is where we're at right now.</v>

3079
02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:37.200
<v Speaker 1>We've come so far we think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really we haven't.</v>

3080
02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:40.560
<v Speaker 1>We haven't really been around that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're talking about this in</v>

3081
02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:43.530
<v Speaker 1>this modern human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found 300,000 years ago,</v>

3082
02:18:43.770 --> 02:18:44.603
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a blip,</v>

3083
02:18:44.790 --> 02:18:47.280
<v Speaker 1>blip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a blink of an eye in terms of</v>

3084
02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>the history of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind the history of the universe.</v>

3085
02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:54.720
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it's very dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone tells you they know it's</v>

3086
02:18:54.721 --> 02:18:56.490
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous because you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

3087
02:18:56.491 --> 02:18:57.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they know,</v>

3088
02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll just listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we've been doing forever</v>

3089
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think people are recognizing more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more now that that is,</v>

3090
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>that's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous and it's an impediment to</v>

3091
02:19:10.411 --> 02:19:12.630
<v Speaker 1>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal progress,</v>

3092
02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:17.460
<v Speaker 1>progress as a community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have just as insane instinct to join</v>

3093
02:19:17.461 --> 02:19:20.520
<v Speaker 1>teams to the point where people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they identify with certain patches,</v>

3094
02:19:20.521 --> 02:19:21.900
<v Speaker 1>a dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Texan,</v>

3095
02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:22.741
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3096
02:19:22.741 --> 02:19:24.720
<v Speaker 1>you're a Texan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is all okay,</v>

3097
02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:25.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3098
02:19:25.591 --> 02:19:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3099
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:29.030
<v Speaker 1>from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that while I get you,</v>

3100
02:19:29.031 --> 02:19:32.060
<v Speaker 1>now I understand you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in this nice little category.</v>

3101
02:19:32.450 --> 02:19:35.420
<v Speaker 1>You get to operate on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>predetermined patterns.</v>

3102
02:19:35.421 --> 02:19:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Now you know you've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to have your own</v>

3103
02:19:37.971 --> 02:19:41.300
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just adopt a conglomeration of</v>

3104
02:19:41.301 --> 02:19:45.080
<v Speaker 1>beliefs that fit whatever category you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into with your left wing</v>

3105
02:19:45.081 --> 02:19:47.510
<v Speaker 1>progressive or a right wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>

3106
02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:50.840
<v Speaker 1>So we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really weird.</v>

3107
02:19:51.090 --> 02:19:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Really Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monkey were so strange and we're also</v>

3108
02:19:55.491 --> 02:19:56.750
<v Speaker 1>aware how weird we are.</v>

3109
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:58.490
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was going to say like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the,</v>

3110
02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:02.090
<v Speaker 3>that's where I feel so much and why I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel so much hope,</v>

3111
02:20:02.091 --> 02:20:05.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like the more awareness we have,</v>

3112
02:20:05.350 --> 02:20:09.440
<v Speaker 3>the better we can go about trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of shore those things up.</v>

3113
02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see the pitfalls and then try to</v>

3114
02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:13.520
<v Speaker 3>find ways around them,</v>

3115
02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but it takes people like you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly courageous,</v>

3116
02:20:16.681 --> 02:20:19.820
<v Speaker 1>that breakout of the pattern and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3117
02:20:20.250 --> 02:20:24.780
<v Speaker 1>and just paddle out into the waters of</v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort because that's what people</v>

3118
02:20:24.781 --> 02:20:28.200
<v Speaker 1>have a really hard time doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have a really hard time changing.</v>

3119
02:20:28.530 --> 02:20:30.330
<v Speaker 1>They have a really hard time taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>chances.</v>

3120
02:20:30.331 --> 02:20:34.710
<v Speaker 1>They were really hard time doing new</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and you did all of it at once in</v>

3121
02:20:34.711 --> 02:20:38.250
<v Speaker 1>one big burst and you separated from</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tribe.</v>

3122
02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:41.250
<v Speaker 1>It was so important to you that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated from your tribe.</v>

3123
02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:43.050
<v Speaker 1>That's so hard.</v>

3124
02:20:43.310 --> 02:20:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3125
02:20:44.781 --> 02:20:46.770
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's.</v>

3126
02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:48.770
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3127
02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:52.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to David after I left</v>

3128
02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:57.640
<v Speaker 3>before the delicious festival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're sitting in the home of this rabbi</v>

3129
02:20:57.650 --> 02:21:00.350
<v Speaker 3>that I had protested earlier and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3130
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:03.020
<v Speaker 3>your rabbi as a horror was decided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My sister held and like,</v>

3131
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:05.030
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like living with this rabbi.</v>

3132
02:21:05.031 --> 02:21:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

3133
02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:07.230
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm staying right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3134
02:21:07.231 --> 02:21:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're staying with a rabbi,</v>

3135
02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:12.050
<v Speaker 3>rabbi and his wife and their four kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is a rabbi,</v>

3136
02:21:12.051 --> 02:21:16.700
<v Speaker 3>a whore that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you pay them and they make you feel</v>

3137
02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:18.110
<v Speaker 3>good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they tell you what you want to</v>

3138
02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:19.070
<v Speaker 3>hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

3139
02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:20.980
<v Speaker 1>it makes him a whore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>

3140
02:21:20.981 --> 02:21:23.930
<v Speaker 1>is a comedian a whore too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must be a whore.</v>

3141
02:21:23.970 --> 02:21:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

3142
02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're committing whoredom</v>

3143
02:21:28.530 --> 02:21:31.150
<v Speaker 1>prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But David said,</v>

3144
02:21:31.151 --> 02:21:32.690
<v Speaker 1>we'll give him massages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whores.</v>

3145
02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're making you feel good and you</v>

3146
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:44.300
<v Speaker 3>pay them to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3147
02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:47.660
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so chiropractors would be horse.</v>

3148
02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Is that how it works?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess</v>

3149
02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:53.200
<v Speaker 3>David was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3150
02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:57.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like you are your parents children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm just like sitting there bawling</v>

3151
02:21:57.950 --> 02:22:01.760
<v Speaker 3>and because I felt like such a betrayer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is again right after we left.</v>

3152
02:22:01.761 --> 02:22:03.320
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

3153
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:04.430
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

3154
02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:05.661
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3155
02:22:05.661 --> 02:22:08.390
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones who taught you to stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>up for what you believe in no matter</v>

3156
02:22:08.391 --> 02:22:10.520
<v Speaker 3>what it costs you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>

3157
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:12.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that idea,</v>

3158
02:22:12.921 --> 02:22:17.780
<v Speaker 3>like that there's still so much from</v>
<v Speaker 3>home that I have held onto and that,</v>

3159
02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:21.590
<v Speaker 3>that still guides me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that I obviously had to,</v>

3160
02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:24.320
<v Speaker 3>it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that I now think are</v>

3161
02:22:24.321 --> 02:22:27.660
<v Speaker 3>destructive and hurtful and just not</v>
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>

3162
02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:29.520
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not consistent with reality.</v>

3163
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

3164
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:32.960
<v Speaker 3>that gave me a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3165
02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:34.830
<v Speaker 3>a lot of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3166
02:22:36.390 --> 02:22:37.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3167
02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you definitely seek comfort and ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom and quotes.</v>

3168
02:22:41.170 --> 02:22:42.003
<v Speaker 3>Who Me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3169
02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:44.150
<v Speaker 3>well it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like here's the thing,</v>

3170
02:22:44.151 --> 02:22:46.400
<v Speaker 3>like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I remember I was,</v>

3171
02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:50.810
<v Speaker 3>there's a New Yorker article that came</v>
<v Speaker 3>out at the end of 2015 and so I was</v>

3172
02:22:50.811 --> 02:22:52.820
<v Speaker 3>doing interviews with the writer Adrian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chen,</v>

3173
02:22:53.010 --> 02:22:55.100
<v Speaker 3>who's amazing and he's an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>writer.</v>

3174
02:22:55.130 --> 02:22:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Just just generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that just that article,</v>

3175
02:22:56.751 --> 02:22:59.470
<v Speaker 3>but like as we're having these</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations like,</v>

3176
02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:02.330
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we spent three days together in</v>

3177
02:23:02.331 --> 02:23:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Kansas talking about maybe six hours at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a time and then on on the phone like</v>

3178
02:23:06.921 --> 02:23:08.930
<v Speaker 3>three and four hour conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>regularly.</v>

3179
02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:13.370
<v Speaker 3>Like it was so much like trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>really get across all of these all of</v>

3180
02:23:13.371 --> 02:23:16.880
<v Speaker 3>this time to really understand exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>how my mind changed all the details in</v>

3181
02:23:16.881 --> 02:23:17.714
<v Speaker 3>the church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

3182
02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:20.990
<v Speaker 3>like and at one point like we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3183
02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:23.690
<v Speaker 3>and he asked me a question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about the soldier's funeral I</v>

3184
02:23:23.691 --> 02:23:24.260
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

3185
02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:27.970
<v Speaker 3>And I just immediately started like</v>
<v Speaker 3>coding all these verses and like.</v>

3186
02:23:27.971 --> 02:23:31.370
<v Speaker 3>And it's like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just went into this mode.</v>

3187
02:23:31.430 --> 02:23:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Like I can tell this is just like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like switching into this like,</v>

3188
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.210
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it had been at the church.</v>

3189
02:23:35.390 --> 02:23:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even though I think that I don't</v>

3190
02:23:38.121 --> 02:23:39.950
<v Speaker 3>believe the Bible is the infallible word</v>
<v Speaker 3>of God,</v>

3191
02:23:40.310 --> 02:23:44.610
<v Speaker 3>but like I spent so much time like</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading it and learning it and</v>

3192
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:47.270
<v Speaker 3>memorizing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chapters at a time with my family and</v>

3193
02:23:47.271 --> 02:23:48.104
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

3194
02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:50.480
<v Speaker 3>it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always like.</v>

3195
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:52.880
<v Speaker 3>And they're like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is so much good in it.</v>

3196
02:23:52.881 --> 02:23:54.790
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

3197
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:56.320
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying is that,</v>

3198
02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:56.801
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3199
02:23:56.801 --> 02:23:59.870
<v Speaker 3>it's comforting when you said it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds so foreign to hear the King</v>

3200
02:23:59.871 --> 02:24:01.250
<v Speaker 3>James,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like to me it was just.</v>

3201
02:24:01.310 --> 02:24:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's comforting.</v>

3202
02:24:02.930 --> 02:24:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3203
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:06.160
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's familiar and it's.</v>

3204
02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:07.580
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a part,</v>

3205
02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:10.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of my home and my upbringing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>

3206
02:24:11.210 --> 02:24:12.043
<v Speaker 3>that I can keep</v>

3207
02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:17.330
<v Speaker 1>as a person outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at it when someone starts</v>

3208
02:24:17.450 --> 02:24:22.450
<v Speaker 1>spouting out biblical phrases and terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and using these parables and using these</v>

3209
02:24:24.891 --> 02:24:29.891
<v Speaker 1>stories and passages in the Bible to</v>
<v Speaker 1>justify things and then equating like</v>

3210
02:24:30.261 --> 02:24:33.440
<v Speaker 1>certain aspects of modern thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior to those things.</v>

3211
02:24:33.770 --> 02:24:37.550
<v Speaker 1>To me it's almost like I'm looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics that I don't totally</v>

3212
02:24:37.551 --> 02:24:38.870
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3213
02:24:38.871 --> 02:24:40.040
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're putting,</v>

3214
02:24:40.090 --> 02:24:44.510
<v Speaker 1>you're plugging this equation in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve a desired result and this result</v>

3215
02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:46.290
<v Speaker 1>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

3216
02:24:46.330 --> 02:24:49.190
<v Speaker 1>a peace of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peace of mind is what you're looking to</v>

3217
02:24:49.191 --> 02:24:53.150
<v Speaker 1>attain and you're looking to attain</v>
<v Speaker 1>justification for your lifestyle and</v>

3218
02:24:53.151 --> 02:24:56.000
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can do so with this quote,</v>

3219
02:24:56.180 --> 02:24:58.190
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3220
02:24:58.191 --> 02:25:00.650
<v Speaker 1>you're plugging in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical physics.</v>

3221
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird stretch of what I'm saying.</v>

3222
02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:05.300
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is just like the feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

3223
02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:07.190
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3224
02:25:07.191 --> 02:25:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't lie.</v>

3225
02:25:07.870 --> 02:25:09.530
<v Speaker 1>This will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you use this.</v>

3226
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then is that okay and makes this.</v>

3227
02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:17.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's all these little tools in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to operate the mind on a more harmonious</v>

3228
02:25:18.621 --> 02:25:22.010
<v Speaker 1>frequency for your own personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction and your,</v>

3229
02:25:22.011 --> 02:25:27.011
<v Speaker 1>your feeling of happiness and peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can feel comfort in the fact</v>

3230
02:25:27.611 --> 02:25:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that you have quoted the Bible verses</v>
<v Speaker 1>that explain your behavior correctly.</v>

3231
02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:34.930
<v Speaker 1>You have made the noises in the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

3232
02:25:35.050 --> 02:25:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whether or not those noises make</v>

3233
02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:39.850
<v Speaker 1>sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when in doubt,</v>

3234
02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:45.060
<v Speaker 1>you throw in like some weird principle</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that God has a plan for everything,</v>

3235
02:25:46.031 --> 02:25:49.910
<v Speaker 1>so fuck you doubts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just stick that right in there and</v>

3236
02:25:49.911 --> 02:25:50.744
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay good.</v>

3237
02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:55.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's like dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well where's all the mass dark matter</v>

3238
02:25:55.980 --> 02:25:56.830
<v Speaker 1>where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3239
02:25:56.850 --> 02:25:58.110
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying though?</v>

3240
02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:01.310
<v Speaker 1>He gets like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an odd sort of a thing because it's</v>

3241
02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:02.333
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3242
02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:05.470
<v Speaker 3>just the uncertainty and the lack of</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge,</v>

3243
02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:07.420
<v Speaker 3>like you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something I don't understand.</v>

3244
02:26:07.690 --> 02:26:08.920
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll have to understand it because</v>

3245
02:26:08.921 --> 02:26:10.090
<v Speaker 3>somebody else understands it.</v>

3246
02:26:10.170 --> 02:26:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using tools.</v>

3247
02:26:12.210 --> 02:26:16.380
<v Speaker 1>It's also like you're using these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these phrases and these tools and these</v>

3248
02:26:16.381 --> 02:26:21.381
<v Speaker 1>passages to achieve desired results</v>
<v Speaker 1>internally as well as externally.</v>

3249
02:26:23.161 --> 02:26:23.540
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3250
02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:27.540
<v Speaker 1>you're using them to comfort yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also using them to,</v>

3251
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:29.640
<v Speaker 1>to prove your point against these</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

3252
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:34.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big part of what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this whole tribalism cult like</v>

3253
02:26:34.261 --> 02:26:37.950
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's justifying your own patterns of</v>

3254
02:26:37.951 --> 02:26:41.670
<v Speaker 1>thinking by demonizing and marginalizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

3255
02:26:41.810 --> 02:26:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Patterns of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3256
02:26:43.401 --> 02:26:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is something that I,</v>

3257
02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I missed this for a long time too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

3258
02:26:47.061 --> 02:26:49.370
<v Speaker 3>so my grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I think I said earlier,</v>

3259
02:26:49.371 --> 02:26:52.000
<v Speaker 3>maybe the Christians were some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest targets at the church and I</v>

3260
02:26:52.001 --> 02:26:54.330
<v Speaker 3>spent so much time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3261
02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:56.330
<v Speaker 3>like the minor differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3262
02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:58.640
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean even like major differences,</v>

3263
02:26:58.641 --> 02:27:00.240
<v Speaker 3>like the hatred of God and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3264
02:27:00.770 --> 02:27:02.750
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people going to hell for eternity and,</v>

3265
02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:04.490
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and why and all these things like,</v>

3266
02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:09.940
<v Speaker 3>like we spent so much time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grams would instead of saying we are the</v>

3267
02:27:10.551 --> 02:27:11.930
<v Speaker 3>only ones who have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3268
02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Westboro Baptist church is the only true</v>
<v Speaker 3>church in the entire world and I'm 100</v>

3269
02:27:16.011 --> 02:27:18.710
<v Speaker 3>percent certain of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a different strategy.</v>

3270
02:27:18.711 --> 02:27:21.590
<v Speaker 3>It was attacking every other version of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

3271
02:27:21.591 --> 02:27:25.910
<v Speaker 3>every other understanding of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3272
02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:28.970
<v Speaker 3>and it's like by default it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know exactly why all these</v>

3273
02:27:28.971 --> 02:27:31.940
<v Speaker 3>people are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Methodists and Catholics and whatever.</v>

3274
02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can articulate chapter in verse</v>

3275
02:27:35.181 --> 02:27:37.790
<v Speaker 3>why they're all wrong and therefore the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end,</v>

3276
02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:41.810
<v Speaker 3>like it becomes clear like we are right</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we are the only ones who are right</v>

3277
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:44.210
<v Speaker 3>and everybody else is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just this.</v>

3278
02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:47.510
<v Speaker 3>It's so frustrating.</v>

3279
02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:52.160
<v Speaker 3>So frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3280
02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:54.830
<v Speaker 3>I hate to use the word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just,</v>

3281
02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:59.690
<v Speaker 3>it lacks enlightenment because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with conflict and it's dealing</v>

3282
02:27:59.691 --> 02:28:00.620
<v Speaker 3>with finger pointing.</v>

3283
02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:06.110
<v Speaker 1>It's dealing with insults like just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the term fags God hates fags is using</v>

3284
02:28:06.111 --> 02:28:08.180
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that in itself.</v>

3285
02:28:08.210 --> 02:28:12.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a giant red flag showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the errors of your thinking in order to</v>

3286
02:28:12.831 --> 02:28:17.620
<v Speaker 1>even sit down and draw this poster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do like this is,</v>

3287
02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:21.680
<v Speaker 1>this is not God's approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there is a god the Bible,</v>

3288
02:28:21.681 --> 02:28:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean if there is a god that's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge of this whole thing and he's</v>

3289
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:27.130
<v Speaker 1>filled with love and he has a plan for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us all.</v>

3290
02:28:27.430 --> 02:28:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you get super emotional when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this stuff that you see?</v>

3291
02:28:30.981 --> 02:28:32.250
<v Speaker 1>You're all worked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

3292
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:33.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3293
02:28:33.141 --> 02:28:34.910
<v Speaker 1>don't apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important.</v>

3294
02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:35.601
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3295
02:28:35.601 --> 02:28:39.410
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how well you keep it</v>
<v Speaker 1>together without contact with your mom</v>

3296
02:28:39.411 --> 02:28:43.850
<v Speaker 1>and your dad and your brothers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sisters and it's been four years.</v>

3297
02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:45.380
<v Speaker 1>How long enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3298
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:46.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3299
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:49.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I totally lost my train of thought</v>

3300
02:28:49.411 --> 02:28:50.244
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3301
02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:52.500
<v Speaker 3>You said something.</v>

3302
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about just that,</v>

3303
02:28:54.990 --> 02:28:56.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the insults and this.</v>

3304
02:28:57.490 --> 02:28:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like the way,</v>

3305
02:28:59.100 --> 02:29:04.100
<v Speaker 3>like I always say people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the method that's the problem.</v>

3306
02:29:04.441 --> 02:29:06.840
<v Speaker 3>It's the message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter how we say the</v>

3307
02:29:06.841 --> 02:29:08.910
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are still going to hate it.</v>

3308
02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:09.960
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you say,</v>

3309
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God created,</v>

3310
02:29:10.711 --> 02:29:15.060
<v Speaker 3>most people go to hell and we're were</v>
<v Speaker 3>among the only ones going to heaven and</v>

3311
02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:15.960
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suckers,</v>

3312
02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:18.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people hate that message,</v>

3313
02:29:18.001 --> 02:29:21.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People hate the idea that you have to</v>

3314
02:29:21.750 --> 02:29:25.530
<v Speaker 3>like follow this set of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't just live the way you</v>

3315
02:29:25.531 --> 02:29:28.470
<v Speaker 3>want to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to obey these ideas as we</v>

3316
02:29:28.471 --> 02:29:30.240
<v Speaker 3>understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3317
02:29:30.330 --> 02:29:32.220
<v Speaker 3>people don't like that message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want you telling them what to</v>

3318
02:29:32.221 --> 02:29:34.080
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that we would always make that</v>

3319
02:29:34.081 --> 02:29:35.520
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>

3320
02:29:35.521 --> 02:29:36.570
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>

3321
02:29:36.571 --> 02:29:38.130
<v Speaker 3>when I was thinking about leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

3322
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:41.100
<v Speaker 3>of course it matters how you talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3323
02:29:41.130 --> 02:29:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Of course it does and even the Bible</v>
<v Speaker 3>talks about it.</v>

3324
02:29:44.311 --> 02:29:45.390
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3325
02:29:45.391 --> 02:29:48.380
<v Speaker 3>in the New Testament Paul talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3326
02:29:48.390 --> 02:29:52.320
<v Speaker 3>to the Jews I became as a Jew and to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greeks as a Greek and do you know,</v>

3327
02:29:52.321 --> 02:29:56.880
<v Speaker 3>to the weak I became as weak because if</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is like you understand your</v>

3328
02:29:56.881 --> 02:30:00.480
<v Speaker 3>audience and who you're talking to and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually trying to reach them,</v>

3329
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:03.350
<v Speaker 3>you're not just self righteously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3330
02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:06.660
<v Speaker 3>proclaiming this thing and saying get on</v>
<v Speaker 3>board or you're doomed.</v>

3331
02:30:06.690 --> 02:30:07.523
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3332
02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:10.030
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no we had and we,</v>

3333
02:30:10.050 --> 02:30:12.510
<v Speaker 3>we sometimes could have those arguments</v>
<v Speaker 3>one on one.</v>

3334
02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:14.820
<v Speaker 3>But like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we go out to these protests were</v>

3335
02:30:14.821 --> 02:30:18.600
<v Speaker 3>saying these things and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>provocative and inflammatory and we knew</v>

3336
02:30:18.601 --> 02:30:23.601
<v Speaker 3>it and we just did it anyway because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it was justified as long as it</v>

3337
02:30:23.731 --> 02:30:24.300
<v Speaker 3>was true.</v>

3338
02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:27.750
<v Speaker 3>And it didn't matter how we set it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we set it or to whom we said it</v>

3339
02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:29.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a grieving widow or a,</v>

3340
02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:32.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a child whose father had just died or</v>

3341
02:30:32.671 --> 02:30:34.590
<v Speaker 3>parents whose children had just died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3342
02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:36.660
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane to me now.</v>

3343
02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:40.190
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard time like so,</v>

3344
02:30:40.270 --> 02:30:41.940
<v Speaker 3>so much of my history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my past,</v>

3345
02:30:41.941 --> 02:30:44.130
<v Speaker 3>like I know why I believed what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>believed.</v>

3346
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:47.070
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes that when I see these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these contradictions,</v>

3347
02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:50.430
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was I thinking when we were reading</v>

3348
02:30:50.431 --> 02:30:52.350
<v Speaker 3>these verses?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

3349
02:30:52.380 --> 02:30:54.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of what they could be</v>

3350
02:30:54.121 --> 02:30:57.840
<v Speaker 3>thinking now except that it's just that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive dissonance that just,</v>

3351
02:30:57.870 --> 02:31:00.240
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just going past it and was like,</v>

3352
02:31:00.241 --> 02:31:01.051
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds good.</v>

3353
02:31:01.051 --> 02:31:03.030
<v Speaker 3>But like not seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3354
02:31:03.031 --> 02:31:04.440
<v Speaker 3>there's another verse that talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3355
02:31:04.590 --> 02:31:05.101
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deceived,</v>

3356
02:31:05.101 --> 02:31:06.160
<v Speaker 3>hardest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned them Messiah.</v>

3357
02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:09.390
<v Speaker 3>So he can't even say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there not a lie in my right hand?</v>

3358
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3359
02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:12.660
<v Speaker 3>that's the feeling that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

3360
02:31:12.661 --> 02:31:14.850
<v Speaker 3>back to the quoting her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

3361
02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:15.960
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3362
02:31:16.530 --> 02:31:17.640
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3363
02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:22.260
<v Speaker 3>this is why I think you're uniquely</v>
<v Speaker 3>qualified to sort of translate those.</v>

3364
02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:23.513
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3365
02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:24.510
<v Speaker 3>and that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3366
02:31:24.511 --> 02:31:25.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3367
02:31:25.330 --> 02:31:26.800
<v Speaker 3>that's why I keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3368
02:31:26.810 --> 02:31:29.130
<v Speaker 3>I want to keep asking the questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just about,</v>

3369
02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:31.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think my family feels they feel</v>

3370
02:31:31.981 --> 02:31:34.590
<v Speaker 3>attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure when I talk about this and why</v>

3371
02:31:34.591 --> 02:31:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I send these messages on twitter</v>

3372
02:31:37.970 --> 02:31:40.830
<v Speaker 3>and I remember what that felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3373
02:31:40.831 --> 02:31:44.490
<v Speaker 3>hearing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that I had loved speak against</v>

3374
02:31:44.491 --> 02:31:46.950
<v Speaker 3>these doctrines and values that I held</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3375
02:31:47.010 --> 02:31:48.190
<v Speaker 3>so dear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3376
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:51.820
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not because I'm trying to hurt them</v>

3377
02:31:51.821 --> 02:31:54.570
<v Speaker 3>more or embarrass them or humiliate</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3378
02:31:54.571 --> 02:31:56.790
<v Speaker 3>It's because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to help them see.</v>

3379
02:31:57.850 --> 02:32:00.750
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm wrong about something then I want</v>

3380
02:32:00.751 --> 02:32:01.950
<v Speaker 3>to know that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>

3381
02:32:01.951 --> 02:32:04.920
<v Speaker 3>it's always this like openness to change</v>
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>

3382
02:32:05.730 --> 02:32:07.740
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3383
02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:08.633
<v Speaker 3>finding a better way.</v>

3384
02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:12.520
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you did that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly brave is not just leave,</v>

3385
02:32:12.970 --> 02:32:16.960
<v Speaker 1>but when you change your thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

3386
02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:20.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to admit that you fucked up big</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3387
02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I have to admit that your entire life</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been essentially about propagating a</v>

3388
02:32:25.001 --> 02:32:25.660
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>

3389
02:32:25.660 --> 02:32:27.600
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

3390
02:32:28.350 --> 02:32:33.350
<v Speaker 3>I had to say no weird Al Yankovic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a song that I'm listening to.</v>

3391
02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:40.200
<v Speaker 3>Everything you know is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Up Up is down,</v>

3392
02:32:40.201 --> 02:32:44.470
<v Speaker 3>black is wide and short as long as I</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember like in this process of like,</v>

3393
02:32:44.490 --> 02:32:45.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we left,</v>

3394
02:32:45.361 --> 02:32:47.890
<v Speaker 3>like remembering that and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot,</v>

3395
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I just thought of a weird Al Song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3396
02:32:49.831 --> 02:32:54.831
<v Speaker 3>that's totally what it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just coming to terms with like how,</v>

3397
02:32:55.260 --> 02:32:57.490
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how wrong and how,</v>

3398
02:32:57.500 --> 02:33:02.430
<v Speaker 3>how could this have been for my entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>life and how can I possibly face this</v>

3399
02:33:02.431 --> 02:33:05.820
<v Speaker 3>like in my own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let alone to all of these people.</v>

3400
02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:08.970
<v Speaker 3>I did it in front of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in front of the whole world,</v>

3401
02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:11.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody who had seen like all the</v>

3402
02:33:11.221 --> 02:33:13.710
<v Speaker 3>documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the times that I had so publicly</v>

3403
02:33:13.711 --> 02:33:16.890
<v Speaker 3>defended all these ideas and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing like,</v>

3404
02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:19.610
<v Speaker 3>how can I possibly faced that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3405
02:33:19.700 --> 02:33:22.120
<v Speaker 1>If you were ever running for office as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that you go out,</v>

3406
02:33:22.210 --> 02:33:26.090
<v Speaker 1>look at Phelps in 2003 and the horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing she was.</v>

3407
02:33:27.310 --> 02:33:28.440
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3408
02:33:28.490 --> 02:33:29.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3409
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:30.383
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

3410
02:33:30.830 --> 02:33:33.170
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ability to say that you,</v>

3411
02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:37.670
<v Speaker 1>you don't agree with what you used to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you are a different person now is so</v>

3412
02:33:37.671 --> 02:33:41.000
<v Speaker 1>important for people to hear is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important things I think you're</v>

3413
02:33:41.001 --> 02:33:44.930
<v Speaker 1>saying because people feel so imprisoned</v>
<v Speaker 1>by their past.</v>

3414
02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:50.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge problem with human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you repeat sort of the same</v>

3415
02:33:50.691 --> 02:33:53.810
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior because even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wrong,</v>

3416
02:33:53.811 --> 02:33:57.260
<v Speaker 1>there's comfort and there's comfort in</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to those cigarettes.</v>

3417
02:33:57.500 --> 02:33:59.420
<v Speaker 1>There's comfort in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in binge eating.</v>

3418
02:33:59.421 --> 02:34:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's comfort in gambling because I</v>

3419
02:34:01.731 --> 02:34:04.340
<v Speaker 1>know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this crazy rush of trying to find</v>

3420
02:34:04.341 --> 02:34:05.630
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going for it.</v>

3421
02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of weirdness in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in human behavior patterns and what</v>

3422
02:34:11.301 --> 02:34:16.301
<v Speaker 1>you've done is not just have real</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual courage to just actually</v>

3423
02:34:18.221 --> 02:34:22.780
<v Speaker 1>challenge your own personal thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes and ideas and look deep into</v>

3424
02:34:22.781 --> 02:34:25.600
<v Speaker 1>these scriptures that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>following your whole life and find these</v>

3425
02:34:25.601 --> 02:34:27.490
<v Speaker 1>contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explore these contradictions,</v>

3426
02:34:27.730 --> 02:34:31.720
<v Speaker 1>contradictions and try to debate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also just to just to come out and</v>

3427
02:34:31.721 --> 02:34:35.380
<v Speaker 1>say like I was making just big mistakes.</v>

3428
02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of things but,</v>

3429
02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:41.590
<v Speaker 2>but two things just for people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

3430
02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Like I messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3431
02:34:43.690 --> 02:34:48.520
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we have to be able to.</v>

3432
02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:52.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to be able to an honestly like</v>

3433
02:34:52.690 --> 02:34:55.960
<v Speaker 2>this is another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so much freedom in that.</v>

3434
02:34:55.961 --> 02:34:58.120
<v Speaker 2>In both of those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said earlier,</v>

3435
02:34:58.121 --> 02:35:00.340
<v Speaker 2>like certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much comfort and certainty.</v>

3436
02:35:00.341 --> 02:35:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to doubt,</v>

3437
02:35:03.641 --> 02:35:06.910
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just go on your way and know</v>

3438
02:35:06.911 --> 02:35:09.610
<v Speaker 2>that what you're doing is exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

3439
02:35:09.611 --> 02:35:11.020
<v Speaker 2>there's so much comfort there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3440
02:35:11.350 --> 02:35:14.440
<v Speaker 2>but in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a false certainty.</v>

3441
02:35:14.441 --> 02:35:16.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a false comfort because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3442
02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:19.390
<v Speaker 2>you're going along if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not examining,</v>

3443
02:35:19.391 --> 02:35:23.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're not taking in new evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not like saying,</v>

3444
02:35:23.051 --> 02:35:25.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I don't have to have all the</v>

3445
02:35:25.751 --> 02:35:27.790
<v Speaker 2>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just say like,</v>

3446
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where I'm at now.</v>

3447
02:35:30.130 --> 02:35:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I'm gonna like find something,</v>

3448
02:35:32.910 --> 02:35:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find something else that</v>

3449
02:35:34.361 --> 02:35:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got wrong now and I'm going to keep</v>

3450
02:35:36.431 --> 02:35:38.620
<v Speaker 2>trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep trying to get better.</v>

3451
02:35:38.621 --> 02:35:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't want to become this</v>
<v Speaker 2>static,</v>

3452
02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:42.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be able to,</v>

3453
02:35:42.190 --> 02:35:46.330
<v Speaker 2>to grow and learn and understand and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>better and as many ways as you can.</v>

3454
02:35:46.530 --> 02:35:50.620
<v Speaker 1>You're wrestling constantly with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and volatile factor.</v>

3455
02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:52.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3456
02:35:52.690 --> 02:35:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And that is what people try to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>that soccer as much as they can.</v>

3457
02:35:56.021 --> 02:35:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want that.</v>

3458
02:35:57.540 --> 02:35:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just like learning to be comfortable</v>

3459
02:35:59.521 --> 02:36:02.190
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I exist here and I exist in this</v>

3460
02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:06.120
<v Speaker 2>uncertain space because it's honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3461
02:36:06.210 --> 02:36:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can keep trying to understand and,</v>

3462
02:36:09.761 --> 02:36:11.050
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

3463
02:36:11.330 --> 02:36:14.210
<v Speaker 1>that's why one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weakest things you could ever see in</v>

3464
02:36:14.211 --> 02:36:19.211
<v Speaker 1>a person is a person talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something in a way where like you ask</v>

3465
02:36:20.661 --> 02:36:24.560
<v Speaker 1>them a question about something and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really know and they try to</v>

3466
02:36:24.561 --> 02:36:26.870
<v Speaker 1>pretend they do start to pontificate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3467
02:36:26.871 --> 02:36:28.730
<v Speaker 1>What you see it instead of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3468
02:36:28.731 --> 02:36:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>

3469
02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Instead or instead of being like open to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of anything being</v>

3470
02:36:36.531 --> 02:36:38.240
<v Speaker 1>outside of the realm of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

3471
02:36:38.270 --> 02:36:41.270
<v Speaker 1>they double down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double down on their ignorance or they</v>

3472
02:36:41.271 --> 02:36:44.630
<v Speaker 1>avoided at all costs and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally see like the little,</v>

3473
02:36:44.810 --> 02:36:46.670
<v Speaker 1>the ban in the machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ego.</v>

3474
02:36:46.671 --> 02:36:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Just yanking on the gears frantically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see it.</v>

3475
02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:53.240
<v Speaker 1>We all recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the more fascinating things</v>

3476
02:36:53.241 --> 02:36:57.800
<v Speaker 1>to me about religion in general is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there we have this incredible desire to</v>

3477
02:36:57.801 --> 02:37:00.050
<v Speaker 1>become a part of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody does.</v>

3478
02:37:00.051 --> 02:37:05.051
<v Speaker 1>We find comfort in these groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also can see the gears spinning</v>

3479
02:37:05.690 --> 02:37:10.340
<v Speaker 1>when someone does agree with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>or someone does say something that</v>

3480
02:37:10.341 --> 02:37:13.300
<v Speaker 1>resonates or or so when someone says</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's contradictory,</v>

3481
02:37:13.310 --> 02:37:17.120
<v Speaker 1>we see the gear spinning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we that this is all some sort of a weird</v>

3482
02:37:17.121 --> 02:37:19.630
<v Speaker 1>cognitive dance that we're doing to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make,</v>

3483
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:25.150
<v Speaker 1>make sense out of this temporary</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence on a planet hurling through</v>

3484
02:37:25.581 --> 02:37:26.414
<v Speaker 1>infinity</v>

3485
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:27.383
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

3486
02:37:28.180 --> 02:37:29.300
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3487
02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:32.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's human and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the human of today,</v>

3488
02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:35.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the human where we find ourselves</v>

3489
02:37:35.290 --> 02:37:40.120
<v Speaker 1>existing in communicating that clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>is on some sort of path,</v>

3490
02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:45.600
<v Speaker 1>some sort of weird path of progress and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of innovation and of understanding that</v>

3491
02:37:48.671 --> 02:37:51.310
<v Speaker 1>we're in the middle of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in the middle of the storm of</v>

3492
02:37:51.311 --> 02:37:56.170
<v Speaker 1>understanding and it's happening like</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly in your own life and you're</v>

3493
02:37:56.171 --> 02:37:57.880
<v Speaker 1>living in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in front of the whole world.</v>

3494
02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:00.553
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3495
02:38:03.150 --> 02:38:03.983
<v Speaker 3>And on that note,</v>

3496
02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:08.640
<v Speaker 1>that's good way to wrap it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did already two hours and 45 minutes,</v>

3497
02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:09.710
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3498
02:38:09.750 --> 02:38:10.690
<v Speaker 1>just flew by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3499
02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:17.030
<v Speaker 1>You're a brave person and I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important what you're doing.</v>

3500
02:38:17.420 --> 02:38:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Massive really is super hard to do I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3501
02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that twitter is what started</v>

3502
02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:26.930
<v Speaker 3>twitter so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3503
02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:29.550
<v Speaker 3>I can not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you were saying earlier about like,</v>

3504
02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:32.550
<v Speaker 3>oh there's only 140 characters like Joe</v>
<v Speaker 3>just twitter,</v>

3505
02:38:32.580 --> 02:38:35.460
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's so crazy like twitter,</v>

3506
02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:37.680
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that it's only 140</v>
<v Speaker 3>characters,</v>

3507
02:38:37.681 --> 02:38:42.570
<v Speaker 3>like nothing taught me how to be more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm very verbose pr I talk a lot</v>

3508
02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:45.720
<v Speaker 3>but like in writing and then I do the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing in writing but like on</v>

3509
02:38:45.721 --> 02:38:48.420
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it taught me to like distill my</v>

3510
02:38:48.421 --> 02:38:52.470
<v Speaker 3>ideas and become concise and it stopped</v>
<v Speaker 3>me from using.</v>

3511
02:38:52.471 --> 02:38:55.200
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways that I stopped like</v>

3512
02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:57.870
<v Speaker 3>insulting people instinctively because</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we did,</v>

3513
02:38:57.871 --> 02:39:00.930
<v Speaker 3>we did it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we would write these elaborate</v>

3514
02:39:00.931 --> 02:39:03.720
<v Speaker 3>insults like responding to emails and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff because like obviously an email</v>

3515
02:39:03.721 --> 02:39:05.730
<v Speaker 3>you can write as much as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like on twitter,</v>

3516
02:39:05.930 --> 02:39:08.760
<v Speaker 3>like so it's two things like one on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end and 40 characters.</v>

3517
02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:10.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like throwing a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you idiot.</v>

3518
02:39:10.380 --> 02:39:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Like there's an just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no space for it,</v>

3519
02:39:13.890 --> 02:39:17.910
<v Speaker 3>but also like when I did do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's this immediate feedback</v>

3520
02:39:17.911 --> 02:39:22.380
<v Speaker 3>loop that you get so like you can watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conversation derail in real time and</v>

3521
02:39:22.381 --> 02:39:23.071
<v Speaker 3>then realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3522
02:39:23.071 --> 02:39:24.960
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just need to not like because it just</v>

3523
02:39:25.050 --> 02:39:28.050
<v Speaker 3>instead of addressing the arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like then you're saying like,</v>

3524
02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:28.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3525
02:39:28.850 --> 02:39:31.230
<v Speaker 3>like you don't know me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they rusty know they'll answer and like</v>

3526
02:39:31.231 --> 02:39:31.930
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3527
02:39:31.930 --> 02:39:34.890
<v Speaker 3>it stops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stops the conversation like you want</v>

3528
02:39:34.891 --> 02:39:38.280
<v Speaker 3>it to be about the points are there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I learned so much about</v>

3529
02:39:38.281 --> 02:39:41.160
<v Speaker 3>communication from twitter and I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>love it so much.</v>

3530
02:39:41.161 --> 02:39:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it depends on how we use it.</v>

3531
02:39:43.630 --> 02:39:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I use it a lot and I learned a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things on it.</v>

3532
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm constantly being sent</v>
<v Speaker 1>articles and that's where I found out</v>

3533
02:39:50.111 --> 02:39:54.910
<v Speaker 1>about the 300,000 year old human and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean every day someone sends me</v>

3534
02:39:54.911 --> 02:39:56.860
<v Speaker 1>something and I retweet it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just it's,</v>

3535
02:39:57.230 --> 02:39:58.470
<v Speaker 1>we got connected.</v>
