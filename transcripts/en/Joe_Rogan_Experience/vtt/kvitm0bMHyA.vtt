1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.110
<v Speaker 2>and we live these gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're live supporting the latest round </v>

3
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.110
<v Speaker 2>earth Shell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just coming out with it.</v>

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Round Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll tee shirts.</v>

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Both Jamie and I get $3 per month from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the federal government to tell you that </v>

6
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 2>the world is round and Mick West is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big part of it all.</v>

7
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:30.831
<v Speaker 2>He is one of the main shills that tells </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody that he knows that he has a </v>

8
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:35.571
<v Speaker 2>whole website dedicated to arguing </v>
<v Speaker 2>against people that think the world is </v>

9
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:35.571
<v Speaker 2>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 2>The differences that don't get paid for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 2>And stop lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're getting 3:50</v>

12
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 2>per month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 2>I wish I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to pay for my web hosting </v>

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 2>and it's a command in my pocket and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody pays me anything.</v>

15
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mick West is serious.</v>

16
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 2>He's not joking around with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

17
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 2>what this is to be one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre trends.</v>

18
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>And Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you said at first that you </v>

19
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.591
<v Speaker 2>thought it was originally a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You thought that they were fucking </v>

20
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:03.591
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

21
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I still think some people are for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

22
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like it started out with like</v>

23
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 2>four Chan or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you read it,</v>

24
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 2>these crazy kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these wacky kids,</v>

25
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.921
<v Speaker 2>they decided to start trolling saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the earth is round or the earth is </v>

26
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:18.921
<v Speaker 2>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it.</v>

27
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of it is just people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

29
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 2>they actually believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

30
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of extra people actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it.</v>

31
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 2>And then there's people who see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this people out there who believe it and</v>

32
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 2>then they start like kind of egging </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people on.</v>

33
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it becomes really,</v>

34
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 2>really hard to tell where the dividing </v>
<v Speaker 2>line is,</v>

35
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 2>who's actually trawling and who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a genuine,</v>

36
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 2>true believer.</v>

37
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 2>There are absolutely a lot of true </v>
<v Speaker 2>believers,</v>

38
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a lot of people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>like little green frogs in their avatar </v>

39
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 2>that think it's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

40
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

41
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 2>that type of person that's kind of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopted it.</v>

42
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

43
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

44
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talking a shit posting the other.</v>

45
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

46
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's just something that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is if you want to just annoy people,</v>

47
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 2>buy shit posting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll just post a bunch of flood earth </v>

48
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 2>memes because the so infuriating to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>average person.</v>

49
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 2>But I just kind of a what the heck is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this person is posting and uh,</v>

50
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit poster enjoys that type of </v>

51
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching a video with this guy was</v>

52
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 2>ranting on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's not theory that we need to</v>

53
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 2>stop accepting that the flat earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>

54
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 2>but that it's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to start accepting the fact that</v>

55
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:35.391
<v Speaker 2>it's a effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was hilarious when we find this </v>

56
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 2>because I saved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a,</v>

57
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I think his name was like Vegan warrior </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

58
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Which is always a yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Egan Warrior.</v>

59
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 2>He's a realist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says it's no long.</v>

60
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 2>He's not only a flat earth or he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>realist.</v>

61
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've come across.</v>

62
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I think this is actually a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>small number of people who were really </v>

63
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 2>active in promoting the flood of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

64
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's in the world is that they</v>

65
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 3>keep claiming that all the photos of </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth are fake,</v>

66
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have a single photo of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking ice wall that's supposed to</v>

67
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 3>be around Antarctica and they keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying erroneous Lee,</v>

68
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 3>that you're not allowed to fly over </v>
<v Speaker 3>Antarctica.</v>

69
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes you are.</v>

70
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Speaker 3>They keep saying that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>photographs of earth from space that </v>

71
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 3>they're all composites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

72
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do they keep saying that?</v>

73
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 3>They keep saying that there's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>saddle is a bunch of satellites,</v>

74
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:32.971
<v Speaker 3>but there's one from Japan that takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>high resolution photos of the earth </v>

75
00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 3>every 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The full earth from 22,000</v>

76
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 3>miles away.</v>

77
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the Japanese hemaware.</v>

78
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.340
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's also like a,</v>

79
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 4>as a US satellite that was just launched</v>
<v Speaker 4>last year that goes 16 satellite,</v>

80
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 4>which is basically the same resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull this sucker right up to your face.</v>

81
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 4>And the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russians have a satellite,</v>

82
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.240
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's got their own satellite </v>

83
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.240
<v Speaker 4>because he's basically the way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>satellites.</v>

84
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.240
<v Speaker 4>So they put him like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

85
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.240
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

86
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.080
<v Speaker 4>the equator so they can see their own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

87
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 4>their own country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Russia has one,</v>

88
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 4>you can mostly see India,</v>
<v Speaker 4>China has one,</v>

89
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 4>it's not as good as the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Russian one is there like a,</v>

90
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same resolution,</v>

91
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 4>121 megapixels as the size of the image </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I do.</v>

92
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like a 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>pixels by 11,000</v>

93
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 4>pixels view of the earth and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>zoom in and you can,</v>

94
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:21.211
<v Speaker 4>you can see cities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see contrary cells and you can </v>

95
00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 4>actually use these images from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>satellites to actually match up with the</v>

96
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 4>views of clouds and controls from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

97
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 4>So you can actually check to see if </v>
<v Speaker 4>these images are actually correct,</v>

98
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.400
<v Speaker 4>at least for where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

99
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 4>Then you could like finding friends and </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere else and ask them like,</v>

100
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.330
<v Speaker 4>do you have this type of cloud overhead </v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can actually verify whether </v>

101
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.330
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

102
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 4>these images are actually real on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I brought it up to my friend Eddie </v>

103
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 4>and he said it's all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said all the photos of fake,</v>

104
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 4>they look fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

105
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 4>but how would you know what a real photo</v>
<v Speaker 4>of earth from 22,000</v>

106
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 4>miles looked like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't look exactly like earth.</v>

107
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 4>And I think when you get to that stage </v>
<v Speaker 4>of deep belief,</v>

108
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 4>you kind of have to believe that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>fake.</v>

109
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 4>There's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real challenge.</v>

110
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you actually break through </v>
<v Speaker 4>that for somebody?</v>

111
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.130
<v Speaker 4>How can you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

112
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.690
<v Speaker 4>convince them that something isn't fake </v>
<v Speaker 4>if they just automatically assume it's </v>

113
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.690
<v Speaker 4>fake.</v>

114
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 4>And I think has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has the person actually looked in detail</v>

115
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:20.731
<v Speaker 4>at these images,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people know and how they looked at </v>

116
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:20.731
<v Speaker 4>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

117
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 4>you get one every 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went every 15 minutes and do a,</v>

118
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:28.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single images is 121 megapixel </v>

119
00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:31.051
<v Speaker 4>image and the old matches up exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>with what the weather is around the </v>

120
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 4>world and it matches up with all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other side images.</v>

121
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 4>One from the Russians were on from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chinese run from the Japanese.</v>

122
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all match up.</v>

123
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 4>And I really don't think that the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who say,</v>

124
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 4>ah spake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've really actually looked.</v>

125
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.760
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're absolutely right there.</v>

126
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 4>They definitely haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nor nor do they have any desire to.</v>

127
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 4>It's a belief issue and it's almost like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a religious issue.</v>

128
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 4>It's a really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's completely infected.</v>

129
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 4>The world of professional pool players,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really professional pool player,</v>

130
00:05:56.751 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 4>a professional pool players.</v>

131
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy named cj Wiley's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a top pool player who's 100 percent </v>

132
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 4>convinced the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's another guy named Max everly's.</v>

133
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 4>A buddy of mine out of his mind thinks </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world is flat.</v>

134
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that's related to their like</v>
<v Speaker 4>obsession with the table being flat.</v>

135
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

136
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to make sure that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>temple's level,</v>

137
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 4>but then they got this little round </v>
<v Speaker 4>balls on the table as well,</v>

138
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 4>so that's confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

139
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:23.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got a little solar system going on </v>

140
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:25.781
<v Speaker 4>with your pool balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's confusing is they're smart guys </v>

141
00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:25.781
<v Speaker 4>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talked to them.</v>

142
00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:26.760
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a reasonable intelligent guy.</v>

143
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 4>Are they really believing that his blood</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent,</v>

144
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 4>they're not shit posting jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This unusual people,</v>

145
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.660
<v Speaker 4>they go down a youtube rabbit hole and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of the problem is once you </v>

146
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 4>believe something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

147
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.000
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to unbelievers.</v>

148
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.260
<v Speaker 4>It is and there's so much out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

149
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.340
<v Speaker 4>If you tell people to do some research </v>
<v Speaker 4>or the end up doing is just looking at </v>

150
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.550
<v Speaker 4>more videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the confirm what they.</v>

151
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 4>They believe that they prefer the ones </v>
<v Speaker 4>that come from it of course,</v>

152
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.170
<v Speaker 4>but it's just amazing to me that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>would decide that all of these photos </v>

153
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 4>were fake so that they don't believe the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world is round,</v>

154
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.670
<v Speaker 4>but yet they don't have a single photo </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this fucking flat earth.</v>

155
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 4>Not One one photo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

156
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 4>every planet you see is round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>

157
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.940
<v Speaker 4>You could follow them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could look at them with with if you </v>

158
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.421
<v Speaker 4>have a reasonable telescope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could see the difference as the </v>

159
00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 4>change and spin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can tell that they're round.</v>

160
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of flood earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have the same camera that I've got,</v>

161
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 4>which is a Nikon p 900 flat earthers </v>
<v Speaker 4>have an excellent camera.</v>

162
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 4>They have A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought one with me.</v>

163
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 4>They have like Nikon has a deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>flat earth society.</v>

164
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 4>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this camera?</v>

165
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like an slr or anything.</v>

166
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.630
<v Speaker 4>It's just like a $600 camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

167
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 4>but it's got this really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really long a zoom lens on it,</v>

168
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.350
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a 200 millimeter zoom lens so </v>

169
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.551
<v Speaker 4>you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can zoom in on the move and you can </v>

170
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 4>zoom in on the stars and planets and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can use this camera.</v>

171
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:57.071
<v Speaker 4>I've used it a few times to actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>take pictures of Jupiter and have a </v>

172
00:07:57.071 --> 00:08:00.821
<v Speaker 4>Venus Mars and you can actually just </v>
<v Speaker 4>make out the roundness of the planet and</v>

173
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:06.371
<v Speaker 4>the actual shadow of the sun use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll see Venus as being like the move </v>

174
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 4>and being like an arch and you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 4>jupiter and you see the bands of Jupiter</v>

175
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 4>and you can do that with this camera.</v>

176
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.780
<v Speaker 4>And this is a camera that a lot of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>have because they're obsessed with </v>

177
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 4>zooming in on things that are on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>horizon,</v>

178
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.460
<v Speaker 4>like ships going beyond the horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if they just start,</v>

179
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 4>take the same camera that they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>pointed upwards,</v>

180
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:26.540
<v Speaker 4>they would actually see things in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the sea,</v>

181
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 4>the solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically the rudy come be explained any</v>

182
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 4>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One great thing is the moons of Jupiter.</v>

183
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.620
<v Speaker 4>If you look up a Jupiter really closely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even with some binoculars,</v>

184
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 4>you can see it's got these four little </v>
<v Speaker 4>moons that are orbiting it.</v>

185
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Then it looks like to just follow the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lights in the line with with Jupiter and</v>

186
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 4>they actually move around in a regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern and they move around.</v>

187
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 4>They've got all bits of like some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them are thinking like 80 hours or </v>

188
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they move around really fast.</v>

189
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.911
<v Speaker 4>Like everyday is a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern of these little dots around </v>

190
00:08:57.911 --> 00:08:57.911
<v Speaker 4>Jupiter.</v>

191
00:08:57.911 --> 00:08:57.911
<v Speaker 4>And you can actually see that with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>camera.</v>

192
00:08:57.911 --> 00:09:02.621
<v Speaker 4>I've taken photos of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>posted them on the website or even with </v>

193
00:09:02.621 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 4>binoculars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you actually watch it from day to</v>

194
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:08.991
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will see the moons of Jupiter move </v>

195
00:09:08.991 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 4>in exactly the same way that science </v>
<v Speaker 4>predicts us that they should move.</v>

196
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 4>Were you using Kepler's laws of </v>
<v Speaker 4>planetary motion and Newton's Newton's </v>

197
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.460
<v Speaker 4>law of gravitation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

198
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:18.290
<v Speaker 4>they will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

199
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.300
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they move exactly as if they are a </v>

200
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.800
<v Speaker 4>little simulation of a planetary system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So either the,</v>

201
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.810
<v Speaker 4>some kind of weird hologram up in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>little corner of the sky which moves </v>

202
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 4>around or there is actually a planet </v>
<v Speaker 4>there with little moons orbiting it.</v>

203
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 4>Probably Hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

204
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when did you first become aware of this?</v>

205
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've run medibank for a long time.</v>

206
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 4>And for those who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mick and I met on the Scifi show that it</v>

207
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:49.281
<v Speaker 4>did Joe Rogan questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything where we discussed chem </v>

208
00:09:49.281 --> 00:09:52.161
<v Speaker 4>trails or con trails and what causes a </v>
<v Speaker 4>jet engine to make what looks like </v>

209
00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:56.841
<v Speaker 4>artificial clouds by passing through </v>
<v Speaker 4>condensation in the heat of the engine </v>

210
00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 4>produces these countries.</v>

211
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 4>And people were absolutely convinced </v>
<v Speaker 4>that these are,</v>

212
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 4>that they're spraying the government is </v>
<v Speaker 4>sprang something in the sky.</v>

213
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.860
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

214
00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:04.720
<v Speaker 4>you caught it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

215
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.990
<v Speaker 4>you had a fairly good explanation for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

216
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:10.520
<v Speaker 4>You said they're basically like training</v>
<v Speaker 4>wheels for conspiracy theories because.</v>

217
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:11.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

218
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.610
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

219
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 4>something you can see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

220
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:15.900
<v Speaker 4>I think he's said he's kind of more </v>
<v Speaker 4>enticing.</v>

221
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.990
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

222
00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.170
<v Speaker 4>and I think the same thing applies to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the flat earth.</v>

223
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Now you got some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I got into the flutter thing,</v>

224
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.330
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I became aware of it a few years ago.</v>

225
00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the government is turning up.</v>

226
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.320
<v Speaker 4>Is that your camera?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

227
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government spying on.</v>

228
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

229
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I first heard about the flood of,</v>

230
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.660
<v Speaker 4>they obviously have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard it before my actually my father </v>

231
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:44.660
<v Speaker 4>going back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

232
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.410
<v Speaker 4>when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he told me that he was a member of the </v>

233
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.410
<v Speaker 4>flood to society.</v>

234
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 4>Your father told you that was he joking </v>
<v Speaker 4>around?</v>

235
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.930
<v Speaker 4>A kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what he was doing it in a kind of a </v>

236
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.600
<v Speaker 4>satirical way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ironically,</v>

237
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was doing it because like he was like</v>

238
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.880
<v Speaker 4>saying people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

239
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 4>to sure of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm going to join the flux of the</v>

240
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't believe the earth was round,</v>

241
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 4>so it's been around for quite a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The flat Earth Society and the flesh,</v>

242
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.160
<v Speaker 4>the flusher theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

243
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 4>as beat around obviously like thousands </v>
<v Speaker 4>of years ago,</v>

244
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:17.991
<v Speaker 4>people thought the earth was round and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then slightly fewer thousand years ago </v>

245
00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 4>people figured out that it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was figured out by the ancient Greeks</v>

246
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:22.480
<v Speaker 4>like 3000 years ago that it wasn't a um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the.</v>

247
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>

248
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

249
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucked it up.</v>

250
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.250
<v Speaker 4>You gave up the goose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

251
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.360
<v Speaker 4>you said thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people thought the Earth was round and </v>

252
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 4>they realized it wasn't you just right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now you gave them fuel.</v>

253
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.550
<v Speaker 4>That's a quote that's going to go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube.</v>

254
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 4>I am a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'll quote from the last one.</v>

255
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.640
<v Speaker 4>What do you strike that one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A slight misquote.</v>

256
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

257
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 4>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened was science basically </v>

258
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.820
<v Speaker 4>figured out the shape of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

259
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.440
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

260
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:57.450
<v Speaker 4>the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a gentleman scientist doing </v>

261
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 4>those courses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All kinds of cool things with stars,</v>

262
00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:02.641
<v Speaker 4>like measuring the orbits and checking </v>
<v Speaker 4>out how far away things were and </v>

263
00:12:02.641 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 4>discovering that there were galaxies and</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

264
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:05.020
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all this science going on,</v>

265
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:10.650
<v Speaker 4>but then there was this kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy comes along coal Samuel </v>

266
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 4>Robotham who published under the name of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parallax in 18,</v>

267
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:19.681
<v Speaker 4>60 and he started publishing what is </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically the same as Eric debase book </v>

268
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:25.410
<v Speaker 4>that's been published now pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 4>every single thing that Eric debase </v>

269
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 4>current book you will find in Samuel </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rebirth book from 1860.</v>

270
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you read the book,</v>

271
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.490
<v Speaker 4>which I don't recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

272
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:39.510
<v Speaker 4>you will see that about 80 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the text book is actually quotes from </v>

273
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:41.470
<v Speaker 4>these books from the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds.</v>

274
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 4>It's not actually that this new stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's discovered is all stuff like,</v>

275
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody walks away from you,</v>

276
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:50.080
<v Speaker 4>you will see their feet disappeared </v>
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

277
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.590
<v Speaker 4>And then he has a two page quotes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Samuel wrote both them saying the exact </v>

278
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.680
<v Speaker 4>same thing from the 18 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's basically recycling this,</v>

279
00:12:58.681 --> 00:13:03.681
<v Speaker 4>this theory that started in the 1860 </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and then just adding a few </v>

280
00:13:03.681 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 4>little sprinkles to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

281
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that as astronauts must be fake </v>

282
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:09.880
<v Speaker 4>and the space station is space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Satellites are fake as well.</v>

283
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's hilarious.</v>

284
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 4>He thinks that dinosaurs are fake </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear bombs or fake.</v>

285
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's the idea that one person </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be this mastermind that discovers </v>

286
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 4>all these monumental frauds.</v>

287
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he,</v>

288
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:30.330
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's claiming to discover </v>

289
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.100
<v Speaker 4>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of people who think that </v>

290
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.100
<v Speaker 4>newco nukes are fake and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dinosaurs being fake.</v>

291
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 4>It's an obvious thing for creationists </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people of that ilk.</v>

292
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

293
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's basically recycling theories in a </v>

294
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.781
<v Speaker 4>way that is popular to the reader and </v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how to get them across to </v>

295
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:45.781
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>

296
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:50.121
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is the youtube videos that are very </v>

297
00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 4>engaging and they sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sound,</v>

298
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 4>if you don't know what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they sound like,</v>

299
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 4>they make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>

300
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 4>And some of them are quite technical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least they use a lot of technical</v>

301
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:00.870
<v Speaker 4>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

302
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.980
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the delve into things like,</v>

303
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:04.350
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

304
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a variety of experiments.</v>

305
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.160
<v Speaker 4>The Michelson Morley experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Eddie mentioned is one of them that </v>

306
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 4>keeps cropping up and then there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has never been reproduced.</v>

307
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.980
<v Speaker 4>That's the experiment that actually has </v>
<v Speaker 4>been reproduced because it's the wrong </v>

308
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.871
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the way that they wanted the </v>

309
00:14:24.871 --> 00:14:24.871
<v Speaker 4>Michelson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Morley,</v>

310
00:14:24.871 --> 00:14:27.740
<v Speaker 4>Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Michelson Morley experiment was an </v>

311
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.840
<v Speaker 4>experiment to detect the luminaire </v>
<v Speaker 4>forests ether,</v>

312
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.220
<v Speaker 4>which is the supposedly medium through </v>
<v Speaker 4>which light travels.</v>

313
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Now back in the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't know that the light was made </v>

314
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 4>about a photons [inaudible] light was </v>
<v Speaker 4>was waived.</v>

315
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:44.641
<v Speaker 4>So we thought that there was this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>that permeated all a space called the </v>

316
00:14:44.641 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 4>luminesce luminesce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>luminesce,</v>

317
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 4>ether,</v>
<v Speaker 4>luminaire ether.</v>

318
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 4>It's a little hard to pronounce and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what light travels through as </v>

319
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 4>waves going through and didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly how it works,</v>

320
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:59.330
<v Speaker 4>but the they figured that must be this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff that permeates all space.</v>

321
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 4>And then they figured that since the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth was moving and these scientists </v>

322
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 4>actually knew at the time that the earth</v>
<v Speaker 4>was moving,</v>

323
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.530
<v Speaker 4>so they were using this as a basis for </v>
<v Speaker 4>their experiment.</v>

324
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.510
<v Speaker 4>They thought that if the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving,</v>

325
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.840
<v Speaker 4>then they will be able to detect the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ether by doing these experiments.</v>

326
00:15:13.841 --> 00:15:18.841
<v Speaker 4>So what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they set up this experiment where they </v>

327
00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:18.841
<v Speaker 4>shot light one direction and the shorter</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other direction.</v>

328
00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 4>Then when it came back together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it combined and if they were moving </v>

329
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 4>through the ether or if the ether was </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving through them,</v>

330
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.880
<v Speaker 4>then the light that went one way would </v>
<v Speaker 4>interfere with the,</v>

331
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 4>with the light and went the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was the,</v>

332
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 4>the whole experiment was just just this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

333
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:35.450
<v Speaker 4>They shot these two light beams in two </v>
<v Speaker 4>directions and they figured like,</v>

334
00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we turned the table this way,</v>

335
00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:41.921
<v Speaker 4>it will change because we're now going </v>
<v Speaker 4>through the ether in different </v>

336
00:15:41.921 --> 00:15:44.051
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what happened was nothing was </v>

337
00:15:44.051 --> 00:15:46.541
<v Speaker 4>detected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was kind of the start of people </v>

338
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:46.541
<v Speaker 4>realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

339
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 4>there is no luminary.</v>

340
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.470
<v Speaker 4>Ether use that to say that is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth isn't moving.</v>

341
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.310
<v Speaker 4>That was what the flatter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they did.</v>

342
00:15:55.370 --> 00:16:00.370
<v Speaker 4>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Michelson and Morley knew the earth </v>

343
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.251
<v Speaker 4>was moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to figure out whether the </v>

344
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:06.850
<v Speaker 4>ether was moving with the earth or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether the earth was moving through the</v>

345
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:09.560
<v Speaker 4>ether.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they were trying to detect the ether.</v>

346
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.650
<v Speaker 4>So people who thought that the earth was</v>
<v Speaker 4>the center of the universe,</v>

347
00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:17.651
<v Speaker 4>not really so much pellet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flat earthers people who are Geo </v>

348
00:16:17.651 --> 00:16:21.490
<v Speaker 4>Centrists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who thought that the sun went </v>

349
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.741
<v Speaker 4>around the earth and the whole all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stars went around the earth and there's </v>

350
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:27.061
<v Speaker 4>still people like the recent resurgence </v>
<v Speaker 4>of some of the thing was Gavin mcinnes </v>

351
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:33.731
<v Speaker 4>sent me something or some guy thinks </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the earth is the center of the </v>

352
00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:33.731
<v Speaker 4>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Essentially.</v>

353
00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:36.470
<v Speaker 4>He was saying that it sort of confirms </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything in Genesis.</v>

354
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:37.670
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

355
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

356
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:44.081
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you need to shoehorn a whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe into the descriptions in </v>

357
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:49.721
<v Speaker 4>genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then he probably gonna have to take a </v>

358
00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:49.721
<v Speaker 4>few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A few shortcuts.</v>

359
00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:50.320
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

360
00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

361
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 4>these experiments like the Michelson </v>
<v Speaker 4>Morley experiment and.</v>

362
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:57.280
<v Speaker 4>But people bring them up and they say </v>
<v Speaker 4>that what the detector,</v>

363
00:16:57.281 --> 00:17:02.281
<v Speaker 4>it was no motion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what it actually detects your </v>

364
00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:05.440
<v Speaker 4>detective was no luminaire for as ether.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because they detected no luminary,</v>

365
00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:10.770
<v Speaker 4>luminary burst ether,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they eventually led to theories about </v>

366
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.700
<v Speaker 4>what light actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a wave particle duality.</v>

367
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the light is photons which act both as a</v>

368
00:17:16.281 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 4>wave and a particle and eventually to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the theory of relativity.</v>

369
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you started medibank when,</v>

370
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.960
<v Speaker 4>when did you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

371
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 4>I think it's about five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've been doing the chem trail stuff</v>

372
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:31.400
<v Speaker 4>with control science for like over 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years now.</v>

373
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:36.460
<v Speaker 4>I was just looking at one of my old </v>
<v Speaker 4>posts when a satellite images that's </v>

374
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 4>quite surprised at how long I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>

375
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.890
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

376
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And medibank been going about five years</v>

377
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.040
<v Speaker 4>and the flat earth stuff came up maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>two years ago.</v>

378
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 4>I started to see things about flutter </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth and a</v>

379
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.170
<v Speaker 2>little bit over a year ago I wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>post on what,</v>

380
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 2>what should we do about debunking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat earth?</v>

381
00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.340
<v Speaker 2>And it basically said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people are basically either </v>

382
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Speaker 2>trolling all the crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no point in addressing either</v>

383
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:08.601
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think most of them are just </v>

384
00:18:08.601 --> 00:18:08.601
<v Speaker 2>trolling because no one could seriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed this.</v>

385
00:18:08.601 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're right.</v>

386
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I know I've come to realize that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

387
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 2>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

388
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 2>that post,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's gone down the line,</v>

389
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

390
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been one a from that.</v>

391
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.690
<v Speaker 2>It's stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is stunning.</v>

392
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.750
<v Speaker 2>It's stunning how many people like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is why Jamie made these young Jamie.com.</v>

393
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.680
<v Speaker 2>You can go and get these flatters shell </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirts that uh,</v>

394
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another were being paid to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that the earth is round.</v>

395
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that anybody would </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually believe that I've had so many </v>

396
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:38.780
<v Speaker 2>people tweet at me.</v>

397
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.570
<v Speaker 2>I know where your checks to come in </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

398
00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking sell out.</v>

399
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sell out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would I give,</v>

400
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.170
<v Speaker 2>do you don't think that if I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought the earth was flat,</v>

401
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 2>like if someone thought the earth was </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat,</v>

402
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 2>what a revelation that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What an amazing discovery P,</v>

403
00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 2>every scientist will be clamoring to </v>
<v Speaker 2>expose this.</v>

404
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Every single scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that all these scientists who </v>

405
00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:58.760
<v Speaker 2>make their name off discoveries by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

406
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.500
<v Speaker 2>especially a monumental and provable </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery,</v>

407
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:03.750
<v Speaker 2>like the world being flat like somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>or another,</v>

408
00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:08.751
<v Speaker 2>they would hide that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the big question is why would </v>

409
00:19:08.751 --> 00:19:08.751
<v Speaker 2>the government say the world is flat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

410
00:19:08.751 --> 00:19:13.251
<v Speaker 2>why would they in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would they rather hide the fact the </v>

411
00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:13.251
<v Speaker 2>world is flat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

412
00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:17.530
<v Speaker 2>What motivation would anybody have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show that the world was round who've </v>

413
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:17.530
<v Speaker 2>been pretty fascinating.</v>

414
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:22.010
<v Speaker 2>If we lived on this flat disc and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else throughout the universe </v>

415
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 2>was in a on a planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be like,</v>

416
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

417
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:29.210
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a weird thing that's going </v>

418
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.551
<v Speaker 2>on with some of these flat earth people </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're linking this to assign </v>

419
00:19:31.551 --> 00:19:34.410
<v Speaker 2>that we are in some way special that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the chosen ones.</v>

420
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.480
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

421
00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:39.480
<v Speaker 2>in some it keeps going back to genesis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you know,</v>

422
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 2>that we are the children of God and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>creation is true.</v>

423
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:49.191
<v Speaker 2>And that evolution is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it gets to some weird anti juice </v>

424
00:19:49.191 --> 00:19:50.000
<v Speaker 2>stuff with a lot of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

425
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:55.710
<v Speaker 2>A lot of conspiracy theories basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>boiled down to some kind of suspicion of</v>

426
00:19:56.101 --> 00:20:01.101
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And quite often suspicions of Jewish </v>

427
00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:01.101
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why Jewish people was always the Jews.</v>

428
00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 2>It's just people couldn't catch a break.</v>

429
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know exactly why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think perhaps perhaps because of the,</v>

430
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.810
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

431
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:11.811
<v Speaker 2>the Jews killed Jesus Christians don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>let the Jews or Christians don't like </v>

432
00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:11.811
<v Speaker 2>the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

433
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 2>So the just being viewed as being an </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and they're often near the Jewish.</v>

434
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the broader us population is often like </v>

435
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.741
<v Speaker 2>a minority within sitters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an easy person to pick on when </v>

436
00:20:24.741 --> 00:20:29.181
<v Speaker 2>things go wrong about that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's loads of books written </v>

437
00:20:29.181 --> 00:20:30.840
<v Speaker 2>by Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other subject of conspiracy theorists.</v>

438
00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 2>Do Bay have a recent video about Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>and about Hitler.</v>

439
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.940
<v Speaker 2>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all go down that road.</v>

440
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

441
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.870
<v Speaker 2>what can it be done if anything other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than your website?</v>

442
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.880
<v Speaker 2>What can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything to like</v>

443
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:53.130
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my concern is these young kids that are </v>

444
00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.351
<v Speaker 3>on the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my thoughts are I'm not going to reach </v>

445
00:20:55.351 --> 00:20:59.341
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some 45 year old crazy person </v>

446
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:02.881
<v Speaker 3>who is making youtube videos three times</v>
<v Speaker 3>a day about the world being flat and </v>

447
00:21:02.881 --> 00:21:06.331
<v Speaker 3>ranting and raving and challenging </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone to debates that he's never </v>

448
00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:09.541
<v Speaker 3>gonna engage in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys don't mean anything to me </v>

449
00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:13.190
<v Speaker 3>like you can't do anything about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some 16 year old kids out </v>

450
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.450
<v Speaker 3>there that maybe were in highschool and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe don't have a real formal education</v>

451
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 3>in science or astrophysics and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting confused and they may be smoke a</v>

452
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:22.570
<v Speaker 3>little too much pot as you motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever's listening to this.</v>

453
00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:25.050
<v Speaker 3>That's you and you start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

454
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been tricked before and I wrote </v>

455
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.881
<v Speaker 3>this big instagram posts recently about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rod's about those roswell rods.</v>

456
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got me.</v>

457
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.150
<v Speaker 3>I was convinced.</v>

458
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 3>I was convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just.</v>

459
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:44.370
<v Speaker 3>I never looked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just watched a documentary and this </v>

460
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:44.370
<v Speaker 3>guy had the footage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

461
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.451
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things are flying around and we </v>

462
00:21:48.451 --> 00:21:48.451
<v Speaker 3>can't see them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

463
00:21:48.451 --> 00:21:51.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a show called [inaudible] if </v>

464
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.661
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you'd never saw the instagram posts </v>

465
00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 3>that I made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy that made this video,</v>

466
00:21:55.001 --> 00:22:00.001
<v Speaker 3>a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you made more than one and it </v>

467
00:22:00.001 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 3>showed that there was these things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked like tubes that had jelly fish,</v>

468
00:22:02.681 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 3>like wings that were flying through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>

469
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Supposedly it speeds undetectable to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human eye,</v>

470
00:22:09.101 --> 00:22:12.820
<v Speaker 3>like they were moving so fast we </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't see them and so I was convinced</v>

471
00:22:12.821 --> 00:22:17.821
<v Speaker 3>man I was really good and then there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a show called monster quest and what </v>

472
00:22:17.821 --> 00:22:22.171
<v Speaker 3>they did is they set up two cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one camera which was a very fast high </v>

473
00:22:22.171 --> 00:22:26.761
<v Speaker 3>speed camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other one which is a standard </v>

474
00:22:26.761 --> 00:22:29.041
<v Speaker 3>video camera and the standard video </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera caught all these rods flying </v>

475
00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:32.431
<v Speaker 3>around and then the exact same images </v>
<v Speaker 3>right next to each other with this high </v>

476
00:22:32.431 --> 00:22:35.110
<v Speaker 3>definition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high speed camera showed actual bugs.</v>

477
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:40.380
<v Speaker 3>So what those rods were was just a video</v>
<v Speaker 3>artifact of these bugs that we're moving</v>

478
00:22:40.691 --> 00:22:45.691
<v Speaker 3>so close to the screen and so fast that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the camera couldn't register correctly </v>

479
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.180
<v Speaker 3>and so it created this elongating effect</v>
<v Speaker 3>and made it look like there were these </v>

480
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.180
<v Speaker 3>jellies.</v>

481
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.180
<v Speaker 4>Fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

482
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that type of thing,</v>

483
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.550
<v Speaker 4>that type of video is the type of thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that needs to be done to counteract this</v>

484
00:22:55.551 --> 00:22:56.010
<v Speaker 4>type of</v>

485
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:02.540
<v Speaker 3>work though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if people aren't looking at the </v>

486
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:02.540
<v Speaker 3>of eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they see those images,</v>

487
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.390
<v Speaker 3>I put those images up and dude,</v>

488
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.030
<v Speaker 4>if you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my instagram posts,</v>

489
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.000
<v Speaker 4>it's filled with people angry at me </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they think it's fake.</v>

490
00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 4>They think it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm a shill because I put </v>

491
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.611
<v Speaker 4>that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can't get people to look at </v>

492
00:23:16.611 --> 00:23:16.611
<v Speaker 4>things that that's a challenge in </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

493
00:23:16.611 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 4>How do you get people to look at things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think like if you start slowly,</v>

494
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:24.170
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I engage with a lot of like conspiracy </v>

495
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.430
<v Speaker 4>theorists online and I know when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it I'm not actually going to reach</v>

496
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.430
<v Speaker 4>the vast majority of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking directly to that.</v>

497
00:23:29.431 --> 00:23:32.670
<v Speaker 4>I know there's lots of other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>reading what I'm saying.</v>

498
00:23:32.671 --> 00:23:34.440
<v Speaker 4>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who will and you know,</v>

499
00:23:34.441 --> 00:23:39.441
<v Speaker 4>just because people are complaining </v>
<v Speaker 4>about your posts of the create images </v>

500
00:23:39.441 --> 00:23:42.810
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean that there aren't people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who actually went to look.</v>

501
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.560
<v Speaker 4>Ditto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

502
00:23:43.561 --> 00:23:46.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I think it got like 50,000</v>

503
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.460
<v Speaker 2>likes or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure even besides people that </v>

504
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:51.460
<v Speaker 2>didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people there were like,</v>

505
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is because that was one of the big </v>

506
00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:58.991
<v Speaker 2>things that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flat earth people kept saying that </v>

507
00:23:58.991 --> 00:24:00.020
<v Speaker 2>there's no photos of the earth that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't a composite from space.</v>

508
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Like that's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like this,</v>

509
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.700
<v Speaker 2>this Rod's video that you saw with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two cameras.</v>

510
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:07.760
<v Speaker 2>If that hadn't existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have taken a bit longer.</v>

511
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

512
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:13.811
<v Speaker 2>you might still believe it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be telling your friends about </v>

513
00:24:13.811 --> 00:24:13.811
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you checked seeing these crazy rods</v>

514
00:24:13.811 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 2>that are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who made that video showed up at</v>

515
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:20.651
<v Speaker 2>a q and a that I did once for the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do these q and a's where people yell </v>

516
00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:22.150
<v Speaker 2>out questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about this guy?</v>

517
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:23.390
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

518
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.600
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he waited in line to get to the front of</v>

519
00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:30.130
<v Speaker 2>the line to tell me that I was wrong or </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the rods are reelected,</v>

520
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

521
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you still buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're still,</v>

522
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:33.850
<v Speaker 2>he still selling it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it,</v>

523
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.110
<v Speaker 2>they call them roswell rods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just hilarious,</v>

524
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.370
<v Speaker 2>but they're implying that somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another they're alien.</v>

525
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Probably some guy was at Rosewell taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures,</v>

526
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:43.250
<v Speaker 2>trying to get you fos and some bugs flew</v>
<v Speaker 2>by.</v>

527
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even Rosewell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's funny.</v>

528
00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:47.930
<v Speaker 2>They called Roswell Rod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best footage is from Mexico.</v>

529
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 2>The best footage was from a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cave jumpers.</v>

530
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 2>You know they have that one really </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous cave,</v>

531
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:58.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole essentially a gigantic pit </v>

532
00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:58.210
<v Speaker 2>and people skydive into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen that.</v>

533
00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen things like that.</v>

534
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.730
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty wild.</v>

535
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:06.731
<v Speaker 2>But they filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they set up a camera to watch them jump </v>

536
00:25:06.731 --> 00:25:08.540
<v Speaker 2>off the edge and parachute down and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the rods flying by.</v>

537
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.120
<v Speaker 2>That was like the best footage was from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>

538
00:25:11.121 --> 00:25:13.490
<v Speaker 2>from this one place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it had nothing to do with Roswell.</v>

539
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 2>They just called them roswell rods </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're dorks.</v>

540
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.460
<v Speaker 2>They probably had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

541
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:22.470
<v Speaker 2>they were probably looking down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness of the pit below and then they </v>

542
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 2>had a shaft of sunlight and friends of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

543
00:25:22.761 --> 00:25:25.310
<v Speaker 2>So the books are flying through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunlight with a dark background,</v>

544
00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:26.720
<v Speaker 2>which is something you don't normally </v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

545
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:32.260
<v Speaker 2>So it would have been like an unusually </v>
<v Speaker 2>good environment for rods to show up in.</v>

546
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

547
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:40.360
<v Speaker 2>And it's in that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me waiting in line to get to the front </v>

548
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.201
<v Speaker 2>of the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They asked me a question and tell me </v>

549
00:25:44.201 --> 00:25:44.201
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:25:44.201 --> 00:25:44.201
<v Speaker 2>he has the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to see it.</v>

551
00:25:44.201 --> 00:25:47.240
<v Speaker 2>It's that kind of thinking is once </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone commits to an idea,</v>

552
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:52.270
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to shake them off of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they just look for confirmation </v>

553
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:52.270
<v Speaker 2>bias.</v>

554
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:52.580
<v Speaker 2>They just look for someone else to agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

555
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 2>They find communities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find these flat earth communities,</v>

556
00:25:56.091 --> 00:25:58.010
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flat one of the best.</v>

557
00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.280
<v Speaker 2>One of the best fucking unintentional </v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious things I read online.</v>

558
00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:04.790
<v Speaker 2>This dude wrote the flat Earth Society </v>
<v Speaker 2>has members all around the globe.</v>

559
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoops.</v>

560
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Did he even realized what he was saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>or is that just him fucking.</v>

561
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.690
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's trolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

562
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.060
<v Speaker 2>because the community thing I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a key thing.</v>

563
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

564
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

565
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I recently did a deep bond of a Ufo that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chilean navy supposedly saw a,</v>

566
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.050
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of that way.</v>

567
00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:27.380
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like this.</v>

568
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:32.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking that it was a Chilean </v>
<v Speaker 2>navy helicopter had this infrared camera</v>

569
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.540
<v Speaker 2>and they sold this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this black to black dots off in the </v>

570
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:37.710
<v Speaker 2>distance that looked like a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

571
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.410
<v Speaker 2>like a figure eight type thing flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

572
00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:44.411
<v Speaker 2>And then it started like spraying out </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff and they couldn't figure out </v>

573
00:26:44.411 --> 00:26:44.411
<v Speaker 2>what was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they chased after</v>

574
00:26:44.411 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was too fascinating going away </v>

575
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 4>from them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

576
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.220
<v Speaker 4>and the Chilean government has an </v>
<v Speaker 4>official UFL investigation team and </v>

577
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:58.900
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they set them on it and spent two years </v>

578
00:26:58.900 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 4>figuring out what it was and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't figure out what it was.</v>

579
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:00.840
<v Speaker 4>And they said it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

580
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>confirmed unidentified object.</v>

581
00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:09.550
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they published their findings </v>

582
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.890
<v Speaker 4>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some other people and medibank </v>

583
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:12.890
<v Speaker 4>looked at it and we figured out that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was actually just a,</v>

584
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.770
<v Speaker 4>a plane flying away from the helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaving some controls behind.</v>

585
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.820
<v Speaker 4>We actually figured out exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which plane it was a and so this got </v>

586
00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.820
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got a bit of play online and there was </v>

587
00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.720
<v Speaker 4>unlike Huffington post and things like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and some Ufo enthusiastic,</v>

588
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:32.830
<v Speaker 4>a study talking to me and I joined the </v>
<v Speaker 4>groups and I joined a few of the groups </v>

589
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:39.230
<v Speaker 4>and then I find myself in this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird corner of the Internet where </v>

590
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.360
<v Speaker 4>everybody believes in Ufo shows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unquestioningly and they're always </v>

591
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 4>putting up these photographs of things </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people are like,</v>

592
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great capture dude.</v>

593
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 4>And it's just something like a street </v>
<v Speaker 4>light or something.</v>

594
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.600
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

595
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.810
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think they had this,</v>

596
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.870
<v Speaker 4>this confirmation bias,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this group confirmation bias where they </v>

597
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.010
<v Speaker 4>can't disagree with someone and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>know they're in a safe space.</v>

598
00:28:02.011 --> 00:28:05.710
<v Speaker 4>So they can put out whatever theory that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like and they know that people will</v>

599
00:28:05.711 --> 00:28:08.010
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just very supportive of them.</v>

600
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.490
<v Speaker 4>By one that happened a couple of days </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

601
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.640
<v Speaker 4>some woman put up a picture of a strange</v>
<v Speaker 4>light that she said was in the sky.</v>

602
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.200
<v Speaker 4>And so I downloaded the picture and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>boosted the brightness.</v>

603
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.440
<v Speaker 4>And a story was actually a reflection of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a something in a security light on her </v>

604
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.361
<v Speaker 4>porch and you could see it was like it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was trees behind it and it's a security </v>

605
00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:32.241
<v Speaker 4>license is reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I posted that and then I started </v>

606
00:28:32.241 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 4>getting cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a shill for pointing this out.</v>

607
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.660
<v Speaker 4>A couple of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

608
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:38.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just this life.</v>

609
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:39.720
<v Speaker 4>But other people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

610
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.200
<v Speaker 4>why don't you believe me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why you would like invalidating claims?</v>

611
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:49.610
<v Speaker 4>And so they want to have these kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>walled gardens where everybody believes </v>

612
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.610
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way to put it.</v>

613
00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Walled Gardens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is a good way to put it </v>

614
00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:55.180
<v Speaker 3>because that debt is what those </v>
<v Speaker 3>community seemed like.</v>

615
00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.620
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>found when I did that television show.</v>

616
00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:01.910
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still harbored a few conspiracy </v>

617
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.531
<v Speaker 3>theories before I did that show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but doing that show for several months </v>

618
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:06.760
<v Speaker 3>and constantly interviewing people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>believed in outlandish things.</v>

619
00:29:06.761 --> 00:29:10.390
<v Speaker 3>I found the same thing over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 3>over again.</v>

620
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.510
<v Speaker 3>Illogical people with very little </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence,</v>

621
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.030
<v Speaker 3>believing things in almost a religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

622
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:21.300
<v Speaker 3>And I found it with bigfoot and I found </v>
<v Speaker 3>it with us and I found it with chem </v>

623
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.931
<v Speaker 3>trails and I found it with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just one after the other in </v>

624
00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:28.780
<v Speaker 3>varying stages of ridiculousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feel like contrail chem trails where the</v>

625
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:33.810
<v Speaker 3>most nutty people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ufo people seem to be the most </v>

626
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.490
<v Speaker 3>reasonable because it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable theory at of all of them.</v>

627
00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:41.490
<v Speaker 3>The idea that we have spaceships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why doesn't someone else have </v>

628
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.951
<v Speaker 3>spaceships?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's hundreds of of galaxies in the </v>

629
00:29:43.951 --> 00:29:47.941
<v Speaker 3>known universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of billions of planets in each </v>

630
00:29:47.941 --> 00:29:50.581
<v Speaker 3>galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The odds of there being some sort of a </v>

631
00:29:50.581 --> 00:29:50.581
<v Speaker 3>life form out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty high,</v>

632
00:29:50.581 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the craziest thing.</v>

633
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Like the more I went into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I talk to these people,</v>

634
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 3>the more I went over all their evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>air quotes,</v>

635
00:29:58.811 --> 00:30:03.811
<v Speaker 3>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I asked them why they believe </v>

636
00:30:03.811 --> 00:30:03.811
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is nothing.</v>

637
00:30:03.811 --> 00:30:05.230
<v Speaker 3>There's not a goddamn thing that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>put on a scale.</v>

638
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:10.320
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that you can way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a thing that you can </v>

639
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:10.320
<v Speaker 3>measure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a thing that you can look at</v>

640
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 3>a photo and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

641
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 3>that's compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not one,</v>

642
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.450
<v Speaker 3>they just an idea and that idea is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something in this guy that flies</v>

643
00:30:16.451 --> 00:30:19.260
<v Speaker 3>around that we either might catch if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're there,</v>

644
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 3>the right place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right time or not,</v>

645
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:21.970
<v Speaker 3>and that they're from another planet.</v>

646
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could look at what they put forward as</v>

647
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:28.230
<v Speaker 4>the best evidence is often like snuffing</v>
<v Speaker 4>cases from the six days where there's an</v>

648
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.820
<v Speaker 4>eyewitness who said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some guy on a road who says he</v>

649
00:30:32.821 --> 00:30:34.230
<v Speaker 4>blacked out and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

650
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.900
<v Speaker 4>his car got messed up from the sixties.</v>

651
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing that I know too </v>

652
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:42.070
<v Speaker 3>much about psychedelic drugs and I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>about indogenous psychedelic drugs.</v>

653
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 3>The brain producing this chemical called</v>
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine.</v>

654
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:49.561
<v Speaker 3>That happens when you're sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they've proven that this stuff is </v>

655
00:30:49.561 --> 00:30:53.980
<v Speaker 3>produced in the liver and the lungs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe it's now.</v>

656
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:59.010
<v Speaker 3>They've got evidence that it's produced </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the pineal gland is a very potent </v>

657
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.131
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drugs that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>produces and your brain produces during </v>

658
00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:02.590
<v Speaker 3>rem sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people,</v>

659
00:31:02.591 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 3>they all take naps and during these naps</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have these crazy fucking dreams and</v>

660
00:31:06.491 --> 00:31:11.491
<v Speaker 3>it's entirely possible that during these</v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams what happened is they got some </v>

661
00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:15.541
<v Speaker 3>indogenous dmt dump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they were under stress or </v>

662
00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:19.171
<v Speaker 3>whether they just add just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an erratic dump of this human </v>

663
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:22.540
<v Speaker 3>neurochemical that entered into their </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodstream.</v>

664
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it caused it all these fucking Ufo </v>

665
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 3>abductions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them,</v>

666
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:33.300
<v Speaker 3>like almost exactly happened at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they happen when these people are </v>

667
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:33.300
<v Speaker 3>sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

668
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.750
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you just assume that you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreaming?</v>

669
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you assume you were </v>

670
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:39.840
<v Speaker 3>dreaming?</v>

671
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

672
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:39.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have these.</v>

673
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.330
<v Speaker 4>I used to have a night terror </v>
<v Speaker 4>hallucination things which are kind of </v>

674
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:43.330
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

675
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.630
<v Speaker 4>And it was always the same type of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

676
00:31:44.631 --> 00:31:49.631
<v Speaker 4>It was like a giant spider coming down </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the ceiling to ultimately move.</v>

677
00:31:49.671 --> 00:31:54.671
<v Speaker 4>I was frozen for a second and then jump </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of bed and turn on the light and </v>

678
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.140
<v Speaker 4>look for the spider.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it happened all the time.</v>

679
00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I knew because there was no spider </v>

680
00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:04.601
<v Speaker 4>that it wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I could see if someone was having a </v>

681
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:05.000
<v Speaker 4>different type of hallucination that </v>
<v Speaker 4>seemed a bit more real,</v>

682
00:32:05.001 --> 00:32:05.630
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

683
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.240
<v Speaker 4>it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

684
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.890
<v Speaker 4>it came in between sleep cycles for them</v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

685
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:10.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

686
00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see because it seemed completely</v>

687
00:32:12.171 --> 00:32:13.250
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

688
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:18.340
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to have them all the time and it </v>

689
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:18.340
<v Speaker 4>was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

690
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.070
<v Speaker 4>it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was these like giant really realistic</v>

691
00:32:19.071 --> 00:32:24.071
<v Speaker 4>spider.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't like I was dreaming </v>

692
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:27.100
<v Speaker 4>somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the room and I could see it </v>

693
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:27.900
<v Speaker 4>like I was seeing something crawling </v>
<v Speaker 4>across the table right here.</v>

694
00:32:27.901 --> 00:32:32.901
<v Speaker 4>It was this hallucination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really get them any more than </v>

695
00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:32.901
<v Speaker 4>what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

696
00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:33.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my brain is fixed itself or whatever,</v>

697
00:32:33.591 --> 00:32:34.820
<v Speaker 4>but it's probably a lot.</v>

698
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Do it being young and confused and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones and nerves.</v>

699
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 3>And then also</v>

700
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.770
<v Speaker 2>like your brain starts filling in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blanks.</v>

701
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a very good understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the universe in your brain.</v>

702
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Your imagination runs wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

703
00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:52.430
<v Speaker 2>it was very confusing to me doing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>television show and it really changed me</v>

704
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:57.431
<v Speaker 2>a lot and it changed me to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people started accusing me of being</v>

705
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.390
<v Speaker 2>a co opted by the government that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government threatened my family and told</v>

706
00:33:02.391 --> 00:33:07.391
<v Speaker 2>me to stop talking about conspiracies </v>
<v Speaker 2>like and then the idea that I wouldn't </v>

707
00:33:07.391 --> 00:33:11.861
<v Speaker 2>say that if that was the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't think I would fucking </v>

708
00:33:11.861 --> 00:33:14.951
<v Speaker 2>tell everybody if someone threatened my </v>
<v Speaker 2>family because it was talking about </v>

709
00:33:14.951 --> 00:33:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Ufos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be telling everybody I'd be like,</v>

710
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would tell all my friends.</v>

711
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

712
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.710
<v Speaker 2>they fucking threaten me because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about Ufo is this shit is real.</v>

713
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Hangar 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harry 51.</v>

714
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:28.940
<v Speaker 2>There was a paper a while ago published </v>
<v Speaker 2>online how many people it would take to </v>

715
00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.350
<v Speaker 2>cover up seven conspiracy theories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability of none of those people </v>

716
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.740
<v Speaker 2>ever talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

717
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.840
<v Speaker 2>And it's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't have tens of millions of </v>

718
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.850
<v Speaker 2>people in on a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

719
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.570
<v Speaker 2>the flat earth one is the best one for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

720
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's.</v>

721
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.620
<v Speaker 2>What about those clients?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single scientist.</v>

722
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone who is involved in shipping</v>

723
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:54.071
<v Speaker 2>routes and overseas flights and the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can fly west and land east,</v>

724
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:55.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

725
00:33:55.571 --> 00:33:56.300
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

726
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.240
<v Speaker 2>you can just land in one spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take off again,</v>

727
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:01.580
<v Speaker 2>land in spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could eventually get to the same</v>

728
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:06.581
<v Speaker 2>spot that you're at with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different flights that you can track </v>

729
00:34:06.581 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 2>them on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a gps.</v>

730
00:34:06.771 --> 00:34:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must fight to gps.</v>

731
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's everything is everything.</v>

732
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

733
00:34:11.691 --> 00:34:13.050
<v Speaker 2>one thing I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

734
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:18.580
<v Speaker 2>try to introduce two people who believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>in flat earth is this concept that a </v>

735
00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.900
<v Speaker 2>ground truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ground truth as a concept in a </v>

736
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.870
<v Speaker 2>satellite observations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I kind of touched on before.</v>

737
00:34:24.871 --> 00:34:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Like you take a satellite observation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>

738
00:34:27.541 --> 00:34:29.060
<v Speaker 2>does it match what you see on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground?</v>

739
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Or if he goes something like a weather </v>
<v Speaker 2>prediction model,</v>

740
00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:37.220
<v Speaker 2>predicting the weather you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that match what you see on the </v>

741
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.510
<v Speaker 2>ground?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is something that you can do if</v>

742
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:40.790
<v Speaker 2>you're actually really interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking into the flight.</v>

743
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:45.350
<v Speaker 2>A theory is figure out what the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground truth is.</v>

744
00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Full something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I want to talk very briefly about a </v>

745
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.400
<v Speaker 2>program called delirium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you might've might've seen.</v>

746
00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:54.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just basically a solar system </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulates,</v>

747
00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.910
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows what's in the night sky.</v>

748
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.010
<v Speaker 2>You've probably seen these little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little,</v>

749
00:34:58.011 --> 00:35:03.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things on your phone where you hold it </v>

750
00:35:03.011 --> 00:35:03.011
<v Speaker 2>up and it shows you what the stars are.</v>

751
00:35:03.011 --> 00:35:03.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just went like that for the PC.</v>

752
00:35:03.011 --> 00:35:04.580
<v Speaker 2>And you can use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use the one on,</v>

753
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your phone as well.</v>

754
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:11.770
<v Speaker 2>So what I would encourage people to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is figure out what is this program </v>

755
00:35:12.141 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 2>actually correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it actually showing me what we see in</v>

756
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:17.440
<v Speaker 2>the night sky?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do it really easily.</v>

757
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Basically you just look at what's on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>screen and then you go outside and you </v>

758
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.951
<v Speaker 2>look to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this what I'm seeing on the screen </v>

759
00:35:26.951 --> 00:35:26.951
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

760
00:35:26.951 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 2>so this is basically you checking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground truth of this program,</v>

761
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.700
<v Speaker 2>which seems like a very straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

762
00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:36.701
<v Speaker 2>but then what you can do from that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can then use the program to look at </v>

763
00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:38.110
<v Speaker 2>the sky from other positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

764
00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:43.120
<v Speaker 4>because you verify that it's correct for</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you are and you can ask someone </v>

765
00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.431
<v Speaker 4>else to verify it's correct for where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they are and you can check like other </v>

766
00:35:46.431 --> 00:35:47.280
<v Speaker 4>photographs that have been taken to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>if they match up as well.</v>

767
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.640
<v Speaker 4>You'll eventually build up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the knowledge that this program</v>

768
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.830
<v Speaker 4>is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This still arion program,</v>

769
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.980
<v Speaker 4>all the little program you have in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>phone that shows you the stars in the </v>

770
00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.711
<v Speaker 4>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got this computer showing you </v>

771
00:36:00.711 --> 00:36:00.960
<v Speaker 4>what it expects to see from any </v>
<v Speaker 4>position,</v>

772
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:05.990
<v Speaker 4>any position anywhere on the world and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you by doing ground truth observations </v>

773
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 4>have figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I figured out what it actually is.</v>

774
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's.</v>

775
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.200
<v Speaker 4>That's the type of thing you see in </v>
<v Speaker 4>delirium.</v>

776
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.480
<v Speaker 4>A obviously in a much less light </v>
<v Speaker 4>polluted environment than you have here.</v>

777
00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that a lot of what's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on with these people that are theorizing</v>

778
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.770
<v Speaker 3>and keep that up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty cool.</v>

779
00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:26.771
<v Speaker 3>Look at with a lot of what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>with these people theorizing about flat </v>

780
00:36:26.771 --> 00:36:31.331
<v Speaker 3>earth and there seems to be some desire </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have to expose hidden </v>

781
00:36:31.331 --> 00:36:35.621
<v Speaker 3>truths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hidden hidden discoveries or or things </v>

782
00:36:35.621 --> 00:36:39.371
<v Speaker 3>that are somehow or another being kept </v>
<v Speaker 3>from everybody and the the.</v>

783
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:44.740
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's fascinating to me is they're </v>

784
00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.560
<v Speaker 3>looking into this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're looking into this thing that's </v>

785
00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.750
<v Speaker 3>not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the real space like the actual,</v>

786
00:36:50.751 --> 00:36:55.751
<v Speaker 3>like what is observable about space is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so mind blowing.</v>

787
00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And somehow or another that is what you </v>

788
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.681
<v Speaker 3>absolutely can see every day where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely can observe what you </v>

789
00:37:05.681 --> 00:37:09.851
<v Speaker 3>absolutely can read about and learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>about and what scientists are </v>

790
00:37:09.851 --> 00:37:12.611
<v Speaker 3>discovering on a daily basis is so mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing when you see like they don't </v>

791
00:37:12.801 --> 00:37:17.801
<v Speaker 3>believe satellites are real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see how many satellites we </v>

792
00:37:17.801 --> 00:37:18.350
<v Speaker 3>actually have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's really fucked.</v>

793
00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not that there's no satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

794
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.700
<v Speaker 4>Satellites bashing into each other and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then uh,</v>

795
00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:24.850
<v Speaker 4>we'll have been more centralized there.</v>

796
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of them up there and they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to time,</v>

797
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:32.780
<v Speaker 3>space flights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to time space lights based on </v>

798
00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.521
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they're going to hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>these satellites or space junk or some </v>

799
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:37.750
<v Speaker 3>of the stuff that's been ejected from </v>
<v Speaker 3>various rocket trips.</v>

800
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still floating</v>

801
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.380
<v Speaker 4>up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You seen the movie gravity?</v>

802
00:37:41.381 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

803
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:47.090
<v Speaker 4>This bit in that where the satellite </v>
<v Speaker 4>start bumping into each other and it's </v>

804
00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 4>this big chain reaction eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the satellites.</v>

805
00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:49.870
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't get knocked out.</v>

806
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:52.720
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that Japanese express </v>
<v Speaker 4>expedition that they tried to.</v>

807
00:37:52.721 --> 00:37:57.721
<v Speaker 4>Do they try to capture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how well it worked that </v>

808
00:37:57.721 --> 00:37:58.600
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a really big tether.</v>

809
00:37:58.601 --> 00:37:59.890
<v Speaker 4>They were dragging behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

810
00:37:59.891 --> 00:38:02.770
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to like catch a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>of space junk with a net,</v>

811
00:38:02.771 --> 00:38:03.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

812
00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 4>Somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

813
00:38:04.411 --> 00:38:05.040
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

814
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:06.910
<v Speaker 4>This stuff is way more interesting than.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

815
00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the real stuff that's really </v>

816
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.770
<v Speaker 4>crazy with idea is so it's less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These tiny little thing with the earth </v>

817
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.760
<v Speaker 4>is flat and it was stuck in this weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>prison where people are keeping us here.</v>

818
00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

819
00:38:17.081 --> 00:38:19.120
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that somehow or another,</v>

820
00:38:19.121 --> 00:38:23.580
<v Speaker 4>by being on a flat planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gives you a different perspective and</v>

821
00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:25.120
<v Speaker 4>they don't want you to have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>

822
00:38:25.121 --> 00:38:28.180
<v Speaker 4>so they tell you the world is round like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

823
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One thing I've heard is that they think </v>

824
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.390
<v Speaker 4>that if they can convince you that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world is flat when it isn't,</v>

825
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:38.040
<v Speaker 4>then it's kind of like in 19 four where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they get people to believe that two plus</v>

826
00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:43.081
<v Speaker 4>two equals five and they've actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>indoctrinate people to genuinely believe</v>

827
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:47.290
<v Speaker 4>that even though they know it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>

828
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.020
<v Speaker 4>but they still believe it and it's a way</v>
<v Speaker 4>of mind control,</v>

829
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.840
<v Speaker 4>said the same thing would have happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the flat earth,</v>

830
00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:57.841
<v Speaker 4>but on a far grander scale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not just convincing someone that </v>

831
00:38:57.841 --> 00:38:57.870
<v Speaker 4>two plus two equals five and war equals </v>
<v Speaker 4>peace,</v>

832
00:38:57.871 --> 00:38:58.750
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

833
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 4>You're convincing them that the earth is</v>
<v Speaker 4>flat when it's actually around.</v>

834
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:05.980
<v Speaker 4>So by doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by twisting their minds around something</v>

835
00:39:05.981 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 4>that's demonstrably false and making </v>
<v Speaker 4>another thing that is correct,</v>

836
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:14.970
<v Speaker 4>then you're gaining power over their </v>
<v Speaker 4>minds in the same way that they did in </v>

837
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:15.850
<v Speaker 4>1984.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

838
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the same way the scientologists do or</v>

839
00:39:18.121 --> 00:39:23.121
<v Speaker 3>Mormons do or anybody that creates some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of an ideology that's provably </v>

840
00:39:23.121 --> 00:39:23.340
<v Speaker 3>false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

841
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:28.400
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot of difference </v>

842
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:28.440
<v Speaker 3>between scientology and flatter theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

843
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:33.470
<v Speaker 3>there really isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you really read l Dot Ron </v>

844
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Hubbard's work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you read what his actual theories </v>

845
00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.620
<v Speaker 3>were about the origins of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty fucking loony.</v>

846
00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:42.890
<v Speaker 3>And yet there's thousands and thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>of members of scientology to the point </v>

847
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:46.221
<v Speaker 3>where they're making documentaries about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and writing books about it and these </v>

848
00:39:46.221 --> 00:39:50.001
<v Speaker 3>people are coming out and they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>escaped the church and these harling </v>

849
00:39:50.001 --> 00:39:50.001
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

850
00:39:50.001 --> 00:39:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I had this guy on my podcast a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago.</v>

851
00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Ronnie miscavige is David miscavige's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dads want in the sky has been wasted his</v>

852
00:39:57.031 --> 00:40:02.031
<v Speaker 3>life can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived in the scientology world for 50 </v>

853
00:40:02.031 --> 00:40:02.031
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

854
00:40:02.031 --> 00:40:02.460
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

855
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:02.820
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

856
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:07.830
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not much difference between that and </v>

857
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:07.830
<v Speaker 3>flat earth theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really isn't.</v>

858
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:11.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology works like it's like </v>

859
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.270
<v Speaker 3>gradually sucks you in a bit at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

860
00:40:11.271 --> 00:40:12.600
<v Speaker 3>it just sounds all very reasonable at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

861
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:17.780
<v Speaker 3>It's very self help in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More and more like the further you get </v>

862
00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.170
<v Speaker 3>into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the reverse,</v>

863
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.200
<v Speaker 3>the first original principles of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you start thinking positive </v>

864
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.941
<v Speaker 3>and doing positive things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of benefits to that and </v>

865
00:40:28.941 --> 00:40:31.161
<v Speaker 3>people start seeing those benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start feeling positive and then </v>

866
00:40:31.161 --> 00:40:34.510
<v Speaker 3>they get into the tetons and the frozen </v>
<v Speaker 3>souls chucked into the volcano and </v>

867
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.620
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

868
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:35.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could</v>

869
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:39.440
<v Speaker 4>argue that the sim good in the flood </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>

870
00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:44.450
<v Speaker 4>not the flat earth theory as such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the black death way of thinking like</v>

871
00:40:44.451 --> 00:40:49.451
<v Speaker 4>questioning things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think this is something that </v>

872
00:40:49.451 --> 00:40:50.030
<v Speaker 4>people really like about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you don't,</v>

873
00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:55.120
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't believe scientists just </v>

874
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.520
<v Speaker 4>because scientists say something is this</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing they called the static method,</v>

875
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.570
<v Speaker 4>which basically is a Greek word meaning </v>
<v Speaker 4>questioning.</v>

876
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:06.840
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to question everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't believe that gravity exists or</v>

877
00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.500
<v Speaker 4>pandemic around the scientist because </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist do it.</v>

878
00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:14.501
<v Speaker 4>You actually have to observe it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself and if you can't absorb it for </v>

879
00:41:14.501 --> 00:41:16.460
<v Speaker 4>yourself then it isn't real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which leads people to think the earth is</v>

880
00:41:16.461 --> 00:41:21.461
<v Speaker 4>flat because it kind of appears flat </v>
<v Speaker 4>from various positions and they haven't </v>

881
00:41:21.461 --> 00:41:26.201
<v Speaker 4>been into space or they haven't done the</v>
<v Speaker 4>various experiments that show that is </v>

882
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:29.231
<v Speaker 4>not flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think you've got young people who </v>

883
00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.770
<v Speaker 4>are exposed to the idea of as a techy </v>
<v Speaker 4>ism and they think,</v>

884
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>

885
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

886
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm rebelling against authority like </v>
<v Speaker 4>young people do and they think like,</v>

887
00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:42.330
<v Speaker 4>I will not believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will not believe the scientists.</v>

888
00:41:42.331 --> 00:41:47.331
<v Speaker 4>I'll do my own research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they get sucked into people </v>

889
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:51.790
<v Speaker 4>like Dubay who feed them all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense is very articulate and very </v>

890
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:56.051
<v Speaker 4>smooth the way he talks and he makes his</v>
<v Speaker 4>well edited videos and they're very </v>

891
00:41:56.051 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 4>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because he's not an authority,</v>

892
00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:58.160
<v Speaker 4>he's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

893
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.150
<v Speaker 4>part of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's perhaps the,</v>

894
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

895
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.920
<v Speaker 4>the old culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tend to give his arguments way more</v>

896
00:42:06.381 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 4>weight than mainstream science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

897
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll find out something like</v>

898
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:17.150
<v Speaker 2>that New York Times article that was out</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple months back where it showed </v>

899
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:20.511
<v Speaker 2>that scientists from the 19 fifties were</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid off by sugar companies to switch </v>

900
00:42:20.511 --> 00:42:25.011
<v Speaker 2>the blame to saturated fat and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>started attributing all these health </v>

901
00:42:25.011 --> 00:42:29.721
<v Speaker 2>problems that were really about sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>and about eating processed sugar start </v>

902
00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:34.040
<v Speaker 2>attributed to the saturated fat and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed a lot of people's diets and </v>

903
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.050
<v Speaker 2>really fucked a lot of people up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like,</v>

904
00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:39.330
<v Speaker 2>like people started eating margarine and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things that are filled the </v>

905
00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.181
<v Speaker 2>trans fats and very unhealthy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did it because they thought </v>

906
00:42:42.181 --> 00:42:45.591
<v Speaker 2>that they were following science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so questioning science and </v>

907
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:47.190
<v Speaker 2>questioning scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

908
00:42:47.191 --> 00:42:52.191
<v Speaker 2>occasionally you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally you'll find something like </v>

909
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:52.191
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

910
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:53.850
<v Speaker 2>This conspiracy by the sugar industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

911
00:42:53.851 --> 00:42:55.320
<v Speaker 2>there's the old saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust yet,</v>

912
00:42:55.321 --> 00:42:56.550
<v Speaker 2>verify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

913
00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Reagan popularized that with a salt </v>
<v Speaker 2>talks.</v>

914
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.470
<v Speaker 2>I think yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very good statement.</v>

915
00:43:01.471 --> 00:43:06.471
<v Speaker 2>Trust yet verify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's if you want to trust our </v>

916
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Dubay that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like check,</v>

917
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 2>check the things that he says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I checked one of his things on the way </v>

918
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:12.360
<v Speaker 2>here on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

919
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:17.390
<v Speaker 2>he has a thing that a lot of them say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the horizon always rises to a </v>

920
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.900
<v Speaker 2>higher level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the plane,</v>

921
00:43:18.901 --> 00:43:23.901
<v Speaker 2>on the way here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I checked to see if there was actually </v>

922
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:23.901
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

923
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:24.390
<v Speaker 2>most people when they checked to see if </v>
<v Speaker 2>their horizon rises to a level,</v>

924
00:43:24.391 --> 00:43:26.220
<v Speaker 2>they just look out the window and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

925
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the horizon over there.</v>

926
00:43:27.901 --> 00:43:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I said high level,</v>

927
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.320
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the horizon is actually going down a </v>

928
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.830
<v Speaker 4>little bit when you look out the window </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the plane because you're 30,000</v>

929
00:43:35.831 --> 00:43:40.831
<v Speaker 4>feet up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It actually drops around two or three </v>

930
00:43:40.831 --> 00:43:42.721
<v Speaker 4>degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's very hard to see when he was </v>

931
00:43:42.721 --> 00:43:42.721
<v Speaker 4>looking at it out of the window of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>plane.</v>

932
00:43:42.721 --> 00:43:47.100
<v Speaker 4>So it's very easy to get taken into </v>
<v Speaker 4>believing that is that it stays at eye </v>

933
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:51.260
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what I did is I took this a little </v>

934
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.611
<v Speaker 4>carpenters level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He brought a carpenter stuck up into </v>

935
00:43:53.611 --> 00:43:54.120
<v Speaker 4>very small one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this like a inch,</v>

936
00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:55.220
<v Speaker 4>as long as the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

937
00:43:55.390 --> 00:44:00.390
<v Speaker 4>and I've taped some old tube to the top </v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like a bit of pen and then I </v>

938
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.280
<v Speaker 4>set it level and wedged it so it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>level and then I looked through the tube</v>

939
00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:09.060
<v Speaker 4>on the top of this level and so wide </v>
<v Speaker 4>horizon was and the horizon was just </v>

940
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.070
<v Speaker 4>below the end of a level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the horizon,</v>

941
00:44:12.071 --> 00:44:17.071
<v Speaker 4>it actually dropped away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which meant the debates claim about the </v>

942
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:21.091
<v Speaker 4>horizon rising to a level which is </v>
<v Speaker 4>something you'd expect on a flight to </v>

943
00:44:21.091 --> 00:44:24.030
<v Speaker 4>earth was actually incorrect and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrably incorrect with this $2 </v>

944
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.380
<v Speaker 4>level which actually got free from </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere and anyone can do this.</v>

945
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:30.100
<v Speaker 4>You don't even need to be in a plane if </v>
<v Speaker 4>it works better.</v>

946
00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 4>If you just like on a cliff or something</v>

947
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:37.130
<v Speaker 3>like a thousand feet up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's another claim that people </v>

948
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:40.431
<v Speaker 3>keep saying that or divo tease this flat</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth idea that that if you get on a </v>

949
00:44:40.431 --> 00:44:42.780
<v Speaker 3>plane and you look up and you look out </v>
<v Speaker 3>the window,</v>

950
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.840
<v Speaker 3>it looks flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do not think that people </v>

951
00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.751
<v Speaker 3>understand perspective and they do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand how huge the earth is when </v>

952
00:44:51.061 --> 00:44:55.290
<v Speaker 3>you see there's images,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone did an image that showed how far</v>

953
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:58.950
<v Speaker 3>you are up when you're 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet in the air and then how,</v>

954
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.280
<v Speaker 3>how like huge the earth actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get this like little image of a </v>

955
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:09.711
<v Speaker 3>plane at 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet and then the dot of the plane is </v>

956
00:45:09.711 --> 00:45:11.820
<v Speaker 3>represented in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of distance between the earth</v>

957
00:45:11.821 --> 00:45:15.240
<v Speaker 3>is in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you see how enormous the planet</v>

958
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:20.241
<v Speaker 3>is and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with something that's so </v>

959
00:45:20.241 --> 00:45:20.340
<v Speaker 3>big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost,</v>

960
00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:22.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like it's flat.</v>

961
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.250
<v Speaker 3>It feels like it's flat because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous in your tiny.</v>

962
00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

963
00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 4>that's a huge issue with people is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't really understand the scale </v>

964
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.350
<v Speaker 4>of the planet and they don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>how little it actually curves.</v>

965
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:36.470
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

966
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.940
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

967
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.220
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

968
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.170
<v Speaker 4>if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look up like the longest roads in</v>

969
00:45:41.171 --> 00:45:42.940
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>longest straight road in America,</v>

970
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.300
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this road is in like Oklahoma or </v>

971
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.120
<v Speaker 4>somewhere and it's about 80 miles long </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just perfectly straight.</v>

972
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.150
<v Speaker 4>But it actually isn't perfectly straight</v>
<v Speaker 4>because when they laid it out,</v>

973
00:45:52.151 --> 00:45:54.280
<v Speaker 4>they laid it out along a line of </v>
<v Speaker 4>latitude,</v>

974
00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:57.730
<v Speaker 4>so it's one of the lines that goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>around around the earth.</v>

975
00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.510
<v Speaker 4>So it's actually slightly curved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look at it,</v>

976
00:46:01.511 --> 00:46:06.511
<v Speaker 4>it looks perfectly straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to actually like take their </v>

977
00:46:06.511 --> 00:46:08.920
<v Speaker 4>whole image and then draw a line from </v>
<v Speaker 4>one end to the other in google earth and</v>

978
00:46:08.921 --> 00:46:11.560
<v Speaker 4>you see that it deviates by just these </v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny little amount.</v>

979
00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:13.630
<v Speaker 4>But if you were to drive along this </v>
<v Speaker 4>road,</v>

980
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:18.840
<v Speaker 4>you're actually driving around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're actually turning right slightly </v>

981
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:23.221
<v Speaker 4>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it looks perfectly straight because </v>

982
00:46:23.221 --> 00:46:23.221
<v Speaker 4>it's hardly moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's old over these 80 miles.</v>

983
00:46:23.221 --> 00:46:24.850
<v Speaker 4>It moves maybe like 10 feet or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

984
00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:27.520
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people just don't,</v>

985
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:32.670
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't realize just how small the curve </v>

986
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:34.180
<v Speaker 4>of the earth actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks flat</v>

987
00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.450
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

988
00:46:35.451 --> 00:46:39.170
<v Speaker 3>I think a real big problem with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory and with a lot of these theories,</v>

989
00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:44.171
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these really outlandish </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theories is once they hook </v>

990
00:46:44.171 --> 00:46:45.710
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to unhook yourself.</v>

991
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:51.220
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to believe that you got </v>

992
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:51.220
<v Speaker 3>taken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to believe he'd been had.</v>

993
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:51.560
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to believe you've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>fooled,</v>

994
00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:56.590
<v Speaker 3>so you keep going deeper and deeper down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rabbit hole and you keep finding </v>

995
00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:59.930
<v Speaker 3>more and more confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More people inside that walled garden as</v>

996
00:46:59.931 --> 00:47:00.380
<v Speaker 3>you put it.</v>

997
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some people actually go out and do </v>

998
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.540
<v Speaker 4>scientific experiments and they try </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonably hard.</v>

999
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.900
<v Speaker 4>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they make some kind of mistake </v>

1000
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.320
<v Speaker 4>and then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is actual proof that the earth is </v>

1001
00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:14.320
<v Speaker 4>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those.</v>

1002
00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.930
<v Speaker 4>The level experiment that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone did something similar with that </v>

1003
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:22.070
<v Speaker 4>is that they use like a water level </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you have two tubes connected and </v>

1004
00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:22.070
<v Speaker 4>you use the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1005
00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:26.080
<v Speaker 4>the level of the water because the water</v>
<v Speaker 4>level's the same on both of them and </v>

1006
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.540
<v Speaker 4>then they hold this up and see if it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>below the horizon.</v>

1007
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 4>But they did this experiment and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>did it at sea level,</v>

1008
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:33.070
<v Speaker 4>which meant is always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same as the horizon.</v>

1009
00:47:33.071 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 4>You've actually got to go up a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet before you can see anything,</v>

1010
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:36.940
<v Speaker 4>but they still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1011
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:38.730
<v Speaker 4>even even though they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1012
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 4>they thought that they were doing some </v>
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>

1013
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:47.040
<v Speaker 4>but they make this one key mistake and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they weren't listened to anybody </v>

1014
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 4>trying to tell them what the mistake </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually was.</v>

1015
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.710
<v Speaker 4>A people this a ridiculous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people doing flat earth experiments on </v>

1016
00:47:54.161 --> 00:47:56.770
<v Speaker 4>youtube and just getting it completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

1017
00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:02.940
<v Speaker 4>I think the most common one is people </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking photographs or something that </v>

1018
00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 4>they shouldn't be visible from a certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>

1019
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Like they'll say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a catalina island and it's like </v>

1020
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:13.090
<v Speaker 4>60 miles away and according to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>curvature of the earth,</v>

1021
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:15.730
<v Speaker 4>that means it should been below five </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles of curve.</v>

1022
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:18.010
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it shouldn't be visible.</v>

1023
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:20.500
<v Speaker 4>And then there's all these mistakes that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make.</v>

1024
00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:21.210
<v Speaker 4>Some of them are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1025
00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.480
<v Speaker 4>they do the math wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them,</v>

1026
00:48:22.481 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 4>like they don't account for the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you've got a,</v>

1027
00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:26.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1028
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Speaker 4>a factor in how high the viewer is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or some of them will just,</v>

1029
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.700
<v Speaker 4>they'll get entirely the wrong island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they'll say like,</v>

1030
00:48:33.701 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is this island,</v>

1031
00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 4>which is just layer 100 miles away in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right.</v>

1032
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.840
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at something that's 40 </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles away.</v>

1033
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can we can look out in the.</v>

1034
00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a simple one.</v>

1035
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.450
<v Speaker 4>How can we look out across the ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't see anything on the side.</v>

1036
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's over there?</v>

1037
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so far away that you can't see it.</v>

1038
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 4>They got an out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're got out though because the,</v>

1039
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't get to see anything away </v>

1040
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 4>because of the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So thank you.</v>

1041
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say three things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get further away.</v>

1042
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.100
<v Speaker 4>They get fainter and fainter islands </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they believe in the atmosphere.</v>

1043
00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.520
<v Speaker 4>They do and they use it a lot to make up</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons for certain things like,</v>

1044
00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:05.800
<v Speaker 4>like things going on below the horizon </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's where it gets weird,</v>

1045
00:49:05.801 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that people use some science to try</v>

1046
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:11.500
<v Speaker 4>to debunk science or things that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>claim a science,</v>

1047
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:14.920
<v Speaker 4>like the lore of perspective perspective</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't,</v>

1048
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 4>doesn't exist.</v>

1049
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.010
<v Speaker 4>There's no law of perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1050
00:49:18.011 --> 00:49:21.610
<v Speaker 4>if you were to make a lower perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could say that the size of something</v>

1051
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.610
<v Speaker 4>decreases inversely proportional to its </v>
<v Speaker 4>distance,</v>

1052
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.190
<v Speaker 4>so if it gets twice as far away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's half the size.</v>

1053
00:49:27.191 --> 00:49:31.090
<v Speaker 4>If it gets four times as far away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a quarter of the size and that's it</v>

1054
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.090
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all that perspective is.</v>

1055
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.310
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People talk about vanishing points.</v>

1056
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:41.460
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that came up during the podcast with </v>

1057
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:41.460
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1058
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.120
<v Speaker 4>and Jamie brought it up and then Eddie </v>
<v Speaker 4>started posting pictures on his </v>

1059
00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:48.120
<v Speaker 4>instagram of a guy from the early 19 </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds who is an artist who wrote </v>

1060
00:49:48.461 --> 00:49:50.620
<v Speaker 4>something about the law perspective in </v>
<v Speaker 4>drawing,</v>

1061
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:52.870
<v Speaker 4>just drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just explaining how you,</v>

1062
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Speaker 4>how you define perspective when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>illustrating things.</v>

1063
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:01.380
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the lower perspective on a piece </v>

1064
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:01.380
<v Speaker 4>of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a photograph.</v>

1065
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.290
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing at all to do with the real </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1066
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:05.170
<v Speaker 4>It's about what you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you can see visually,</v>

1067
00:50:05.171 --> 00:50:08.230
<v Speaker 4>what the image is projected onto your </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes or what comes through a camera when</v>

1068
00:50:08.231 --> 00:50:09.520
<v Speaker 4>you take a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1069
00:50:09.521 --> 00:50:11.830
<v Speaker 4>what's the actual perspective of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1070
00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:14.260
<v Speaker 4>things just get smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it says it sounds good.</v>

1071
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:17.740
<v Speaker 4>When you say the law perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds good,</v>

1072
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:22.741
<v Speaker 4>like you're invoking a law scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they will discuss a real law </v>

1073
00:50:22.741 --> 00:50:25.400
<v Speaker 4>like the law of universal gravitation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1074
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:26.370
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1075
00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't have</v>

1076
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.560
<v Speaker 3>anything against Eric do pay or any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people.</v>

1077
00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:33.860
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My real concern is with young people out</v>

1078
00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:38.861
<v Speaker 3>there that are listening to this that </v>
<v Speaker 3>get sucked into this stupid shit and </v>

1079
00:50:38.861 --> 00:50:41.510
<v Speaker 3>there's a soul much that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn.</v>

1080
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.590
<v Speaker 3>There's so much that's fascinating about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the university,</v>

1081
00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.610
<v Speaker 3>so it's fascinating about the natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1082
00:50:46.611 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 3>There's so much to learn and to waste </v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime.</v>

1083
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:54.550
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that's good about it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll recognize the pitfalls that the </v>

1084
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:58.571
<v Speaker 3>human mind can slip into that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>slipped into that many people I know </v>

1085
00:50:58.571 --> 00:50:58.790
<v Speaker 3>have slipped into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1086
00:50:58.791 --> 00:51:01.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a like in any way,</v>

1087
00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:06.041
<v Speaker 3>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not something to be embarrassed </v>

1088
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:06.041
<v Speaker 3>about or sad about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1089
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:10.300
<v Speaker 3>it's a normal natural human inclination </v>
<v Speaker 3>to try to find things that are hidden </v>

1090
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.360
<v Speaker 3>truths or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are covered up mysteries.</v>

1091
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.580
<v Speaker 3>It's natural for whatever reason,</v>

1092
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.770
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very much a part of growing</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and I think it's just a,</v>

1093
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:24.780
<v Speaker 4>it's different for different people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a whole bunch of crazy ideas when </v>

1094
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:24.790
<v Speaker 4>I was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you have a.</v>

1095
00:51:24.791 --> 00:51:29.791
<v Speaker 4>I thought I could bring about world </v>
<v Speaker 4>peace by getting a whole bunch of world </v>

1096
00:51:29.791 --> 00:51:32.311
<v Speaker 4>leaders together and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually sent letters to a bunch of </v>

1097
00:51:32.311 --> 00:51:36.661
<v Speaker 4>world leaders and I figured like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't send it directly to the world </v>

1098
00:51:36.661 --> 00:51:37.660
<v Speaker 4>leaders because there'd be a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll be a bit.</v>

1099
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will want to read my letters.</v>

1100
00:51:38.841 --> 00:51:41.790
<v Speaker 4>So I sent it to the brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I sent a letter to,</v>

1101
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.670
<v Speaker 4>to Raul Castro who is now a the </v>
<v Speaker 4>president of Cuba,</v>

1102
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:48.550
<v Speaker 4>but back then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I can,</v>

1103
00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:53.580
<v Speaker 4>I can set up this organization of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>relatives of world leaders and bringing </v>

1104
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.600
<v Speaker 4>about will piece now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that like I was like 13 at the time</v>

1105
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.030
<v Speaker 4>that you decided to get ahold of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers.</v>

1106
00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.680
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1107
00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:02.370
<v Speaker 4>well I think it like a sneaky backdoor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:07.970
<v Speaker 4>And I found his address in a WHO's who </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the library back in the day,</v>

1109
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:09.910
<v Speaker 4>back in the day when you look things up </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the library.</v>

1110
00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1111
00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:14.920
<v Speaker 4>that's not even that unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like you thinking,</v>

1112
00:52:14.921 --> 00:52:17.170
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>world piece seems to make sense to me.</v>

1113
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 4>This idealistic child,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1114
00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:24.210
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to try to do something and you </v>

1115
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:25.951
<v Speaker 4>think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think you can make a difference and </v>

1116
00:52:25.951 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 4>you can add rebelling against things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had delusions of solving great </v>

1117
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.410
<v Speaker 4>mathematical problems when I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those like,</v>

1118
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>problems like how do you try sex and </v>

1119
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.371
<v Speaker 4>angle with a by this geometrical methods</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was proved to be impossible to do.</v>

1120
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:44.320
<v Speaker 4>And yet I still spent months and months </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to do it when I was a kid because</v>

1121
00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:47.440
<v Speaker 4>I thought that can't tell me what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible and what's not possible.</v>

1122
00:52:47.441 --> 00:52:50.320
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it's possible to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you did discover it,</v>

1123
00:52:50.321 --> 00:52:52.960
<v Speaker 4>what a gigantic it would have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>feather in your cap.</v>

1124
00:52:52.961 --> 00:52:54.550
<v Speaker 4>That would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the motivation really.</v>

1125
00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.650
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just like pure altruism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to,</v>

1126
00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:02.810
<v Speaker 3>I believe in a bunch of stupid shit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the big one for me that I've clung to </v>

1127
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:06.240
<v Speaker 3>longest has bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one man.</v>

1128
00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard for me to let that one go </v>

1129
00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:12.540
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1130
00:53:12.541 --> 00:53:14.460
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it used to be an animal,</v>

1131
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:17.130
<v Speaker 3>needs to be gigantic pithy guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

1132
00:53:17.131 --> 00:53:20.190
<v Speaker 3>when my friend Les Stroud actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>started doing that show,</v>

1133
00:53:20.191 --> 00:53:22.350
<v Speaker 3>that bigfoot show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen that show?</v>

1134
00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:25.470
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that show with some fucking</v>

1135
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:31.040
<v Speaker 2>guy who's just a total hoax or and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy put on a big foot mask and they got </v>

1136
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.620
<v Speaker 2>this high resolution photo and video of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this big foot mask that they're claiming</v>

1137
00:53:34.621 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 2>is big foot to staring at them through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods.</v>

1138
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 2>It is so stupid looking CV and finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie and this guy,</v>

1139
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:44.670
<v Speaker 2>this is our wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is the bigfoot community.</v>

1140
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Thinks he's full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when you know you fucked up when </v>

1141
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 2>the big foot community is calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>shenanigans,</v>

1142
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.480
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>

1143
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not buying this as spending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get these schisms in this community,</v>

1144
00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.560
<v Speaker 2>so they fracture off into sub </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>

1145
00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.190
<v Speaker 2>The scientologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who have purchased from</v>

1146
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.330
<v Speaker 2>the scientologists watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is awesome.</v>

1147
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:06.870
<v Speaker 2>See is guys in the woods and he sees it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sees it's through the trees.</v>

1148
00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:07.710
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is it?</v>

1149
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 2>And he can't.</v>

1150
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not even moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1151
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:12.420
<v Speaker 2>bigfoot's just been running from people </v>
<v Speaker 2>from day one.</v>

1152
00:54:12.421 --> 00:54:17.421
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's one animal is just standing </v>

1153
00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:17.421
<v Speaker 2>there and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1154
00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:17.421
<v Speaker 2>I think I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I said.</v>

1155
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 2>So then towards the end of the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets really close,</v>

1156
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:24.801
<v Speaker 2>like looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fuck out of here is Galligan Afro </v>

1157
00:54:24.801 --> 00:54:24.801
<v Speaker 2>from the Nineteen Seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1158
00:54:24.801 --> 00:54:27.510
<v Speaker 2>look how clean it's hair looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1159
00:54:27.511 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 2>it looks so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not moving.</v>

1160
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets close up on it.</v>

1161
00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that wink or something?</v>

1162
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

1163
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how bad this is bad.</v>

1164
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:39.590
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the this.</v>

1165
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Here's how you know it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever something looks like a dude in </v>

1166
00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 2>a monkey suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a dude in a monkey suit.</v>

1167
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.390
<v Speaker 2>That's all you need to know because your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain knows.</v>

1168
00:54:48.391 --> 00:54:49.560
<v Speaker 2>Your brain's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1169
00:54:49.561 --> 00:54:51.390
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at a gorilla,</v>

1170
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.940
<v Speaker 2>gorilla doesn't look like a person in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gorilla suit.</v>

1171
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Feel good a giraffe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not look like a person in draft </v>

1172
00:54:59.180 --> 00:54:59.180
<v Speaker 2>suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel like a big foot and it looks like a</v>

1173
00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:00.740
<v Speaker 2>dude in a monkey suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking dude.</v>

1174
00:55:00.741 --> 00:55:05.741
<v Speaker 2>The monkey suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your brain starts filling in the </v>

1175
00:55:05.741 --> 00:55:06.270
<v Speaker 2>blanks and also whether you recognize it</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>

1176
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.180
<v Speaker 2>your brain recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize geometry.</v>

1177
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Facial geometry recognizes a FIBONACCI </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequence.</v>

1178
00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Hogwash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:55:12.661 --> 00:55:14.760
<v Speaker 2>And you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why people freak out when you see</v>

1180
00:55:14.761 --> 00:55:18.320
<v Speaker 2>someone fake lips or fake nose upside </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and things like that when,</v>

1181
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.510
<v Speaker 2>when people do weird shit to their face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when someone,</v>

1182
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:26.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the plastic surgery in the face and </v>

1183
00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:27.330
<v Speaker 2>they like radically altered their face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's jarring to us.</v>

1184
00:55:27.331 --> 00:55:31.200
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why it's jarring </v>
<v Speaker 2>is because the brain recognizes geometry</v>

1185
00:55:31.201 --> 00:55:35.700
<v Speaker 2>and human facial recognition or facial </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns and the structure of the face.</v>

1186
00:55:35.701 --> 00:55:38.640
<v Speaker 2>And when that geometry is off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's confusing to us.</v>

1187
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Like why are their cheeks so big?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

1188
00:55:40.561 --> 00:55:42.390
<v Speaker 2>No so small?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are the lips so big?</v>

1189
00:55:42.391 --> 00:55:47.391
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like your body starts to react to </v>

1190
00:55:47.391 --> 00:55:47.391
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1191
00:55:47.391 --> 00:55:51.831
<v Speaker 2>there's an illusion with a put two sets </v>
<v Speaker 2>of eyes on people and you look at that </v>

1192
00:55:51.831 --> 00:55:55.311
<v Speaker 2>and you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain just is constantly resetting </v>

1193
00:55:55.311 --> 00:55:55.311
<v Speaker 2>and you go my eyes across the way or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

1194
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.560
<v Speaker 2>You frightened just so hard wired to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize faces.</v>

1195
00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it just automatically recognize </v>

1196
00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 2>faces in your face and my face are </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

1197
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:08.880
<v Speaker 2>but there's a science to you or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of your face that's applied to</v>

1198
00:56:08.881 --> 00:56:09.720
<v Speaker 2>the science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My face,</v>

1199
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:12.240
<v Speaker 2>and that's the golden ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

1200
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.660
<v Speaker 2>if you look at a person's face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually do the math where their</v>

1201
00:56:15.661 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 2>chin is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where their eyes are.</v>

1202
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.180
<v Speaker 2>It all lines up and your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizes when that's not the case.</v>

1203
00:56:21.181 --> 00:56:23.650
<v Speaker 2>So if you see that and you see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh a person,</v>

1204
00:56:23.651 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's</v>

1205
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:29.070
<v Speaker 3>going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it is a person that's a person </v>

1206
00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:31.771
<v Speaker 3>that's a dude in a monkey suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a good one and there's so </v>

1207
00:56:31.771 --> 00:56:31.870
<v Speaker 3>many people that tried out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Patterson footage,</v>

1208
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:33.780
<v Speaker 3>which is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1209
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1210
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:37.390
<v Speaker 3>they believe so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believe so hard.</v>

1211
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 3>It's the hardest one for me to realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that those people were all full of shit </v>

1212
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 3>because when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1213
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:44.320
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want a big foot to be real.</v>

1214
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:46.210
<v Speaker 3>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a tough one.</v>

1215
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Tough one to let go and plus it was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real animal at one point in time there </v>

1216
00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 3>was really a thing called [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was an eight to 10 foot tall,</v>

1217
00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:00.130
<v Speaker 3>if it may have been by people at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally.</v>

1218
00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1219
00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:03.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's A.</v>

1220
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want things to be true like Ufos.</v>

1221
00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:09.970
<v Speaker 4>I was going to a Ufo is and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird stuff on it when I was younger and</v>

1222
00:57:09.971 --> 00:57:14.971
<v Speaker 4>I think partly like me figuring out the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it was just bullshit was part </v>

1223
00:57:14.971 --> 00:57:17.670
<v Speaker 4>of the buddy for getting into like </v>
<v Speaker 4>debunking stuff later,</v>

1224
00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.240
<v Speaker 4>but at a certain degree I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>no harm in people believing in things </v>

1225
00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.660
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little kids believe in Santa Claus,</v>

1226
00:57:24.661 --> 00:57:26.880
<v Speaker 4>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That type of things rather christmas,</v>

1227
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:31.930
<v Speaker 4>easter bunny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just that for some people it </v>

1228
00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:34.641
<v Speaker 4>kind of goes a bit wrong because a bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>too far they don't let the child is </v>

1229
00:57:34.641 --> 00:57:38.151
<v Speaker 4>beliefs drop away as they get older or </v>
<v Speaker 4>they stay longer or when they come of </v>

1230
00:57:39.631 --> 00:57:43.920
<v Speaker 4>age they go into that kind of the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>level of disbelief,</v>

1231
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:49.380
<v Speaker 4>of imaginary things that they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be true and a lot of that boils down to </v>

1232
00:57:49.501 --> 00:57:51.690
<v Speaker 4>what we're talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the distrust in authority,</v>

1233
00:57:51.691 --> 00:57:52.760
<v Speaker 4>like people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1234
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:57.770
<v Speaker 4>distrust of others,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the belief that there's some secret </v>

1235
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:59.760
<v Speaker 4>cabal of people doing things to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The illuminati.</v>

1236
00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:04.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's partly this kind of a </v>

1237
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:06.941
<v Speaker 4>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 4>childish wanting to believe in things </v>

1238
00:58:06.941 --> 00:58:10.880
<v Speaker 4>which we all have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all believed strange things when we </v>

1239
00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:11.680
<v Speaker 4>were young and I think that aliens in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of ways,</v>

1240
00:58:11.681 --> 00:58:16.681
<v Speaker 4>they're like a cosmic daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that there's someone who's </v>

1241
00:58:16.681 --> 00:58:20.600
<v Speaker 4>really on the ball that's watching us </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can make sure we don't fuck </v>

1242
00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.901
<v Speaker 4>everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where this content movies are so </v>

1243
00:58:23.901 --> 00:58:23.901
<v Speaker 4>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just the idea of like,</v>

1244
00:58:23.901 --> 00:58:27.620
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aliens coming to help us or whatever is </v>

1245
00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:27.620
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so enticing.</v>

1246
00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:27.660
<v Speaker 4>It'd be so amazing.</v>

1247
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

1248
00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 3>I think the movie alien is probably more</v>
<v Speaker 3>likely.</v>

1249
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.600
<v Speaker 3>What's gonna happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just come down here and fuCk us up.</v>

1250
00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:39.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm the weird thing about the ufo </v>
<v Speaker 3>community and the big foot community and</v>

1251
00:58:39.731 --> 00:58:44.731
<v Speaker 3>all these different communities is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>along the line they become people that </v>

1252
00:58:44.731 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 3>make a living at it and they become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1253
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:50.581
<v Speaker 3>air quotes experts and that that becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem because then they have a </v>

1254
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:55.651
<v Speaker 3>vested interest in making sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people believe they start writing </v>

1255
00:58:55.651 --> 00:58:55.651
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thEy start doing lectures,</v>

1256
00:58:55.651 --> 00:59:00.391
<v Speaker 3>they start showing pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also here's what's interesting as </v>

1257
00:59:00.391 --> 00:59:04.330
<v Speaker 3>the number of phones that have cameras </v>
<v Speaker 3>have radically increased.</v>

1258
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.470
<v Speaker 3>The number of usable ufo pictures is </v>
<v Speaker 3>radically decreased.</v>

1259
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:10.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which doesn't make sense.</v>

1260
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.890
<v Speaker 4>Was like this one got 83 times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zoom on it.</v>

1261
00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.370
<v Speaker 4>You can take pictures of if there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ufo,</v>

1262
00:59:16.371 --> 00:59:19.880
<v Speaker 4>you can take a real close up picture of </v>
<v Speaker 4>I take patients on planes all the time,</v>

1263
00:59:19.881 --> 00:59:23.190
<v Speaker 4>the flying five away or 10 miles away or</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes even like,</v>

1264
00:59:23.191 --> 00:59:28.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every 100 miles away and you can make </v>

1265
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:28.191
<v Speaker 4>out the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the windows a.</v>

1266
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depending on the angle.</v>

1267
00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:34.640
<v Speaker 4>That's the claim that they can trail is </v>
<v Speaker 4>put out sometimes at the planes don't </v>

1268
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.111
<v Speaker 4>have windows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is generally that a generally </v>

1269
00:59:38.111 --> 00:59:41.411
<v Speaker 4>because they using these crappy little </v>
<v Speaker 4>cameras and you just can't see the </v>

1270
00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:41.411
<v Speaker 4>windows got the less than one pixel </v>
<v Speaker 4>wide.</v>

1271
00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've got a good camera and use zoom</v>

1272
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:44.940
<v Speaker 4>in far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the windows appear kind of like,</v>

1273
00:59:44.941 --> 00:59:49.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things appearing over the horizon when </v>

1274
00:59:49.941 --> 00:59:49.941
<v Speaker 4>you zoom in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Speaking of this camera,</v>

1275
00:59:49.941 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 4>this suddenly coming up in august,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the eclipse,</v>

1276
00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:58.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be a total eclipse of the </v>

1277
00:59:58.350 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 4>sun over north America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think August 21st this year.</v>

1278
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:04.250
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be a great opportunity for </v>

1279
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.790
<v Speaker 4>people to encourage anybody who believes</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the earth to actually start looking </v>

1280
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.280
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1281
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:13.330
<v Speaker 4>the what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't they have any excuse for that </v>

1282
01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:13.330
<v Speaker 4>though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hadn't like how are they,</v>

1283
01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:14.580
<v Speaker 4>how are they going to justify it by </v>
<v Speaker 4>eight?</v>

1284
01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:19.590
<v Speaker 4>They actually look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the challenge is getting people </v>

1285
01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:21.080
<v Speaker 4>to look at things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The excuse the excuse.</v>

1286
01:00:21.081 --> 01:00:26.081
<v Speaker 4>The reason we're giving them is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an eclipse and everybody wants </v>

1287
01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:26.081
<v Speaker 4>to look at the eclipse because it's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing thing.</v>

1288
01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.290
<v Speaker 4>The moon goes in front of the sun and </v>
<v Speaker 4>blocks the there.</v>

1289
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that you're giving them too </v>

1290
01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:33.731
<v Speaker 4>much credit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think all someone has to do is make a </v>

1291
01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:34.400
<v Speaker 4>youtube video with some wonky </v>
<v Speaker 4>explanation for why an eclipse works and</v>

1292
01:00:34.401 --> 01:00:37.820
<v Speaker 4>then it works because the earth is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disk and the sun gets below the disc and</v>

1293
01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:39.110
<v Speaker 4>it blocks it out from below.</v>

1294
01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just doesn't seem to me that it's.</v>

1295
01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:43.580
<v Speaker 4>It's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a like a solar eclipse though.</v>

1296
01:00:43.581 --> 01:00:48.581
<v Speaker 4>They finished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can tell that the moon is going in </v>

1297
01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:49.970
<v Speaker 4>front of the sun because I know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying is logical,</v>

1298
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the flight others believed that the</v>

1299
01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:53.990
<v Speaker 4>moon goes in front of the sun for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>solar eclipse.</v>

1300
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they can.</v>

1301
01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:58.280
<v Speaker 4>You can track the position of the moving</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the sky and they know that,</v>

1302
01:00:58.290 --> 01:00:59.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets closer to the sun every,</v>

1303
01:00:59.671 --> 01:01:01.910
<v Speaker 4>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't they believe that the earth's sits</v>

1304
01:01:01.911 --> 01:01:04.070
<v Speaker 4>flat and then everything spins around </v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth.</v>

1305
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.740
<v Speaker 4>The earth is flat and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1306
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.620
<v Speaker 4>the sun a sun and the moon are orbiting </v>
<v Speaker 4>above like this.</v>

1307
01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:17.621
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes the moon is going to be below </v>

1308
01:01:17.621 --> 01:01:17.930
<v Speaker 4>the sun and it blocks out the light of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sun.</v>

1309
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:21.380
<v Speaker 4>And that's how an eclipse happens on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>earth and on the rounder.</v>

1310
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.900
<v Speaker 4>So it will be an amazing thing to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're a flat earth believer,</v>

1311
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:30.440
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this very rare coincidence when the moon</v>

1312
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:35.620
<v Speaker 4>is in front of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I usually encourage people who have </v>

1313
01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.260
<v Speaker 4>flat earth believers to look at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing thing that's happening.</v>

1314
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.600
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they still don't give a fuck.</v>

1315
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:44.170
<v Speaker 4>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a uniformity in the flat earth </v>

1316
01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.080
<v Speaker 4>community and they like all greed or is </v>
<v Speaker 4>there a dissension?</v>

1317
01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.860
<v Speaker 4>There's some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1318
01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:48.860
<v Speaker 4>that it's because the ice wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1319
01:01:48.861 --> 01:01:52.040
<v Speaker 4>there's no fucking ice wall just to drop</v>
<v Speaker 4>off and everybody dies.</v>

1320
01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:52.850
<v Speaker 4>There is kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1321
01:01:52.851 --> 01:01:56.780
<v Speaker 4>this mainstream thing where the dubay </v>
<v Speaker 4>model of things,</v>

1322
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:58.730
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like in the chem trail </v>
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>

1323
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got this one guy,</v>

1324
01:02:00.111 --> 01:02:05.111
<v Speaker 4>a dane wigington who's this really </v>
<v Speaker 4>popular guy and then you've got like a </v>

1325
01:02:05.111 --> 01:02:05.111
<v Speaker 4>bunch of other patients.</v>

1326
01:02:05.111 --> 01:02:06.680
<v Speaker 4>one is he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is he the guy that made that,</v>

1327
01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:07.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the videos,</v>

1328
01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that was michael.</v>

1329
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:13.721
<v Speaker 4>James murphy was the guy that guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a little loony and,</v>

1330
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:15.560
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1331
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:20.590
<v Speaker 4>wigington is the guy who lives in a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>house on 200 acres up in the mountains </v>

1332
01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:22.000
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1333
01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.120
<v Speaker 4>he got obsessed with the solar panels </v>
<v Speaker 4>being blocked by contractors and so </v>

1334
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:27.120
<v Speaker 4>began the counter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll believe it,</v>

1335
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.490
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like the equivalent of dubay.</v>

1336
01:02:28.491 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 4>Rarely because he's the guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>really promoting it.</v>

1337
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.710
<v Speaker 4>But then there's other people in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

1338
01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.780
<v Speaker 4>the community who are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1339
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.130
<v Speaker 4>doing their own thing and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1340
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:42.140
<v Speaker 4>we can send guy's full of crap because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he believes in global warming and we </v>

1341
01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:42.140
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's this,</v>

1342
01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.930
<v Speaker 4>there's this division between people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe in global warming and who don't.</v>

1343
01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:50.070
<v Speaker 4>So there's some people I think that chem</v>
<v Speaker 4>trials are trying to stop global warming</v>

1344
01:02:50.071 --> 01:02:53.820
<v Speaker 4>and other people think that chem trails </v>
<v Speaker 4>are causing global warming.</v>

1345
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:59.090
<v Speaker 4>And then there's other people that think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kim kendrick was something </v>

1346
01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:01.191
<v Speaker 4>completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This spreading nano robots to control </v>

1347
01:03:01.191 --> 01:03:04.101
<v Speaker 4>people's minds and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got the same type of range of </v>

1348
01:03:04.101 --> 01:03:04.920
<v Speaker 4>things in the flat earth believers as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1349
01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:07.890
<v Speaker 4>Like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people think that the earth is kind</v>

1350
01:03:07.891 --> 01:03:10.650
<v Speaker 4>of concave and it's not actually flat at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1351
01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:13.530
<v Speaker 4>What about the hollow earth people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the earth is hollow.</v>

1352
01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.700
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not even,</v>

1353
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:19.730
<v Speaker 4>that's not really a flatter thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like around us with a hole in the top </v>

1354
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:23.120
<v Speaker 4>and a whole new world in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People live on the inside of the earth,</v>

1355
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:28.250
<v Speaker 4>which makes even less sense than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>data from a physical point of view.</v>

1356
01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 4>While they think there's monsters in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1357
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were those aliens?</v>

1358
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:34.500
<v Speaker 4>The rothschilds they think their lizard </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1359
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.820
<v Speaker 4>They live under the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1360
01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:38.640
<v Speaker 4>Lasers make tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've heard that.</v>

1361
01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1362
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:41.160
<v Speaker 4>It sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds real.</v>

1363
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:42.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking into it.</v>

1364
01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>

1365
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:46.620
<v Speaker 4>any conspiracy theory is going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>range of a plausibility.</v>

1366
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From reasonably plausible to completely </v>

1367
01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:51.680
<v Speaker 4>implausible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you think of some of the.</v>

1368
01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 4>A nine slash 11 conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like at one end you've got like the.</v>

1369
01:03:55.170 --> 01:04:00.090
<v Speaker 4>The world trade center was destroyed by </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear bombs that were in the basement.</v>

1370
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.280
<v Speaker 4>Nuclear bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear bombs.</v>

1371
01:04:02.281 --> 01:04:03.390
<v Speaker 4>People think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1372
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:06.060
<v Speaker 4>I haven't heard that one now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fringe one,</v>

1373
01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:07.920
<v Speaker 4>but it's got a few people who believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1374
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:10.710
<v Speaker 4>Then there's people who think a bit bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>more plausible.</v>

1375
01:04:10.711 --> 01:04:12.900
<v Speaker 4>They were destroyed by energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weapons from space.</v>

1376
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:17.901
<v Speaker 4>Like there was these beams of energy </v>
<v Speaker 4>like high powered microwave or something</v>

1377
01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:22.941
<v Speaker 4>that blew the buildings up and then this</v>
<v Speaker 4>know you get more and more plausible.</v>

1378
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:28.130
<v Speaker 4>Those pre planted explosives or some </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys running there on the day with some </v>

1379
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:31.020
<v Speaker 4>explosives to blow building seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you've got just,</v>

1380
01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:34.860
<v Speaker 4>they let buildings haven't burned when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have to.</v>

1381
01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.320
<v Speaker 4>And then then they got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1382
01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.760
<v Speaker 4>they knew it was going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it did nothing about it.</v>

1383
01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:41.910
<v Speaker 4>And then they had some warnings about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they didn't do anything about it.</v>

1384
01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:45.900
<v Speaker 4>So you got this whole range of </v>
<v Speaker 4>plausibility for the conspiracies,</v>

1385
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the flat earth.</v>

1386
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.580
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty much all of this end because</v>
<v Speaker 4>the flush,</v>

1387
01:04:51.581 --> 01:04:55.230
<v Speaker 4>her theory is that the earth is flat or </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's round.</v>

1388
01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:00.620
<v Speaker 4>So with the flesh of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've only got a very extreme.</v>

1389
01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:03.370
<v Speaker 4>And then more extreme theories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1390
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.700
<v Speaker 4>some of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most extreme thing which we,</v>

1391
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:08.310
<v Speaker 4>all conspiracy theories ended up with is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1392
01:05:08.311 --> 01:05:09.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything is an illusion.</v>

1393
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:15.140
<v Speaker 4>We're living in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A conspiracy theory or that theory is </v>

1394
01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 4>very compelling that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is very bizarre because</v>

1395
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:22.900
<v Speaker 2>one day if technology continues the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>it has been,</v>

1396
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.960
<v Speaker 2>there will come a time where they able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to create an artificial reality that's </v>

1397
01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:31.410
<v Speaker 2>indiscernible from this reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as we don't blow ourselves up </v>

1398
01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:34.291
<v Speaker 2>and technology continues to advance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation continues to advance at the </v>

1399
01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:35.350
<v Speaker 2>rate it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exponential,</v>

1400
01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:40.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that a hundred </v>

1401
01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:43.440
<v Speaker 2>years from now or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll be some way that they can </v>

1402
01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.381
<v Speaker 2>interface with your somehow with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain and create some sort of an </v>

1403
01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:48.690
<v Speaker 2>artificial experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1404
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:53.730
<v Speaker 2>That's not outside the realm of prospect</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory is that doing it now and it's </v>

1405
01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:54.970
<v Speaker 2>detectable that these things that we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing,</v>

1406
01:05:54.971 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I kind of artifacts or living in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>matrix,</v>

1407
01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.880
<v Speaker 2>you might have heard of the mandela </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

1408
01:06:00.881 --> 01:06:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

1409
01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:06.580
<v Speaker 2>the people who believe that this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>glitches in the matrix,</v>

1410
01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:10.810
<v Speaker 2>like the berenstein bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>berenstein bears are actually called the</v>

1411
01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.990
<v Speaker 2>bear steinbeck as a and an alternate </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeline.</v>

1412
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this movie,</v>

1413
01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:17.670
<v Speaker 2>a cold shazamm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1414
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.160
<v Speaker 2>done by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1415
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:22.180
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the guy's name now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say sinbad.</v>

1416
01:06:22.181 --> 01:06:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Sinbad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Khazan.</v>

1417
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mixed fleet.</v>

1418
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.880
<v Speaker 2>They completely believe that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually happened,</v>

1419
01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:33.760
<v Speaker 2>but that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1420
01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:34.930
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they believe it.</v>

1421
01:06:34.931 --> 01:06:39.931
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that's at the end of </v>

1422
01:06:39.931 --> 01:06:39.931
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these conspiracy theories.</v>

1423
01:06:39.931 --> 01:06:43.020
<v Speaker 2>That's not a very reasonable one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some really reasonable </v>

1424
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:46.441
<v Speaker 2>scientists that believe that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to come a time where the elon </v>

1425
01:06:46.441 --> 01:06:46.441
<v Speaker 2>musk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1426
01:06:46.441 --> 01:06:46.930
<v Speaker 2>believes that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1427
01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1428
01:06:47.731 --> 01:06:52.731
<v Speaker 2>I not really convinced myself because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a simplistic argument </v>

1429
01:06:52.731 --> 01:06:56.831
<v Speaker 2>saying that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology will always advance and get </v>

1430
01:06:56.831 --> 01:06:59.941
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are fundamental limits on </v>

1431
01:06:59.941 --> 01:07:03.150
<v Speaker 2>information theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much information that we can </v>

1432
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.290
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever messed around with um,</v>

1433
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 2>a htc vive or any of the more recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of the art?</v>

1434
01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Now they're mindblowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mindblowing.</v>

1435
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:12.310
<v Speaker 2>And this is one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribed to it.</v>

1436
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:13.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not today,</v>

1437
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:15.340
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one day in the future,</v>

1438
01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:17.260
<v Speaker 2>whether there's 100 years or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is of technology.</v>

1439
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just got to think 150 years ago they</v>

1440
01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:24.781
<v Speaker 2>were using teletypes to date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the only way to get a medicine </v>

1441
01:07:24.781 --> 01:07:24.781
<v Speaker 2>message across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1442
01:07:24.781 --> 01:07:26.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what can we do today?</v>

1443
01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:29.020
<v Speaker 2>We can take a film and send it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in Australia.</v>

1444
01:07:29.021 --> 01:07:34.021
<v Speaker 2>They get it in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very reasonable to assume </v>

1445
01:07:34.021 --> 01:07:37.321
<v Speaker 2>that if you put on the htc vive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this one underwater </v>

1446
01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:37.330
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1447
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Jamie scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could find it,</v>

1448
01:07:38.861 --> 01:07:41.920
<v Speaker 2>because I know it's in video form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's reasonable it on.</v>

1449
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be extremely realistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that make you think that you are </v>

1450
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:47.000
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1451
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.520
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's realistic that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be able to not detect that a </v>

1452
01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.510
<v Speaker 2>scientist wouldn't be able to detect </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1453
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:56.630
<v Speaker 2>that we are all living in a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this simulation just just you?</v>

1454
01:07:57.011 --> 01:07:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Is it just your head to see this right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

1455
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.610
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put this thing on.</v>

1456
01:08:00.611 --> 01:08:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1457
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:06.810
<v Speaker 2>We're in 2017 and this is all and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly fairly adolescent stage and man,</v>

1458
01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:13.951
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in this thing and you're </v>

1459
01:08:13.951 --> 01:08:14.020
<v Speaker 2>looking around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily high definition.</v>

1460
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.130
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1461
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.550
<v Speaker 2>it's very clear</v>

1462
01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:20.210
<v Speaker 3>and you know that it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but god,</v>

1463
01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:25.211
<v Speaker 3>it gives you this feeling that it's real</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a whale pulls up and all these </v>

1464
01:08:25.211 --> 01:08:25.211
<v Speaker 3>fish swim by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1465
01:08:25.211 --> 01:08:29.420
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing and it more than anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives you a window into the future.</v>

1466
01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.760
<v Speaker 3>It gives you a window when you sit next </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this whale and it makes noises and </v>

1467
01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.410
<v Speaker 3>the noises are all three d.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you a window when you start </v>

1468
01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:39.890
<v Speaker 3>thinking about pong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember pong game that you would play.</v>

1469
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:44.891
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I'm controlling </v>

1470
01:08:44.891 --> 01:08:44.891
<v Speaker 3>something on the television to to to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1471
01:08:44.891 --> 01:08:44.891
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1472
01:08:44.891 --> 01:08:49.110
<v Speaker 3>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you compare that to like halo and </v>

1473
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:50.150
<v Speaker 3>the games you can play right now and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>xbox and was like my god,</v>

1474
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:55.540
<v Speaker 3>like the improvements are radical and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that the improvements in this sort</v>

1475
01:08:55.791 --> 01:09:00.791
<v Speaker 3>of artificial reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this virtual reality that you're seeing </v>

1476
01:09:00.791 --> 01:09:00.791
<v Speaker 3>in this</v>

1477
01:09:00.791 --> 01:09:05.370
<v Speaker 2>current htc vive 100 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would only imagine that we could get </v>

1478
01:09:06.731 --> 01:09:10.060
<v Speaker 2>to a point where it's indiscernible that</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody I next to you.</v>

1479
01:09:10.061 --> 01:09:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1480
01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:11.670
<v Speaker 2>That's why lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

1481
01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.410
<v Speaker 2>That whale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whale is a living thing.</v>

1482
01:09:14.411 --> 01:09:19.411
<v Speaker 2>It's made up of cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could take one cell from that whale </v>

1483
01:09:19.411 --> 01:09:22.921
<v Speaker 2>and you could put it under a microscope </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could dissect it and you could </v>

1484
01:09:22.921 --> 01:09:22.921
<v Speaker 2>look at the cell and everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1485
01:09:22.921 --> 01:09:24.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're having a different argument here.</v>

1486
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:29.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking that it's going to feel </v>

1487
01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:29.940
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying scientists will be great,</v>

1488
01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe you won't be able to.</v>

1489
01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:36.900
<v Speaker 2>You will be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that they could make </v>

1490
01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.181
<v Speaker 2>something that you could not detect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not text with science cripple the </v>

1491
01:09:39.891 --> 01:09:43.960
<v Speaker 2>cripple your intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're away from it.</v>

1492
01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:49.080
<v Speaker 2>They'll be able to make something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>indiscernible like while you're </v>

1493
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.501
<v Speaker 2>experiencing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you would a scientist could </v>

1494
01:09:52.501 --> 01:09:52.501
<v Speaker 2>come along and check it.</v>

1495
01:09:52.501 --> 01:09:53.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit of a philosophical question </v>
<v Speaker 2>though because like you know,</v>

1496
01:09:53.351 --> 01:09:56.710
<v Speaker 2>what we have now is our observable </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe with the laws of physics.</v>

1497
01:09:57.170 --> 01:10:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't think within this universe you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could make something that stimulates the</v>

1498
01:10:01.661 --> 01:10:06.661
<v Speaker 2>universe that's the same because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just too much information in the </v>

1499
01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:10.861
<v Speaker 2>universe to be stimulated by something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is within the universe or even </v>

1500
01:10:10.861 --> 01:10:11.650
<v Speaker 2>something like as small as like the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1501
01:10:11.651 --> 01:10:16.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you could simulate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire earth in our physical universe,</v>

1502
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:21.830
<v Speaker 2>not now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think you could do it a </v>

1503
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.830
<v Speaker 2>thousand years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1504
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:25.280
<v Speaker 2>really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there are fundamental limits </v>

1505
01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:25.280
<v Speaker 2>as to how much information will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>required.</v>

1506
01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:27.340
<v Speaker 2>You could get something that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1507
01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.820
<v Speaker 2>an imitation of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will be detectable different.</v>

1508
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Like each.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each simulation is going to be lower </v>

1509
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:39.610
<v Speaker 2>fidelity than the universe that created </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1510
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1511
01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:45.540
<v Speaker 2>So you can only create something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>less complex than the universe you have </v>

1512
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:45.940
<v Speaker 2>currently in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true though?</v>

1513
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean as time moves on 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now,</v>

1514
01:10:48.701 --> 01:10:50.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1515
01:10:50.321 --> 01:10:55.321
<v Speaker 2>how could anyone possibly discern or how</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you even guess and estimate how </v>

1516
01:10:55.321 --> 01:10:57.770
<v Speaker 2>far it would advance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go back 5,000</v>

1517
01:10:57.771 --> 01:10:59.380
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were modern humans,</v>

1518
01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:04.740
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people that built the </v>

1519
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:04.740
<v Speaker 2>pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're modern humans,</v>

1520
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:04.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1521
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:04.900
<v Speaker 2>they looked like us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a little smaller.</v>

1522
01:11:04.901 --> 01:11:06.970
<v Speaker 2>They didn't get as much to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look just like us.</v>

1523
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:09.340
<v Speaker 2>If you went 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years in the future,</v>

1524
01:11:09.341 --> 01:11:14.341
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not unreasonable if we don't blow </v>

1525
01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:16.231
<v Speaker 2>ourselves up that you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we would have some sort of quantum </v>

1526
01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:19.401
<v Speaker 2>computing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some astronomically powerful devices </v>

1527
01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:23.300
<v Speaker 2>that could render and create an </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial reality that felt to you </v>

1528
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:28.790
<v Speaker 2>entirely real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don'T think that's outside the realm </v>

1529
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:31.251
<v Speaker 2>of possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but could you then create within that </v>

1530
01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:31.560
<v Speaker 2>universe the same quantum computers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are stimulating yourself?</v>

1531
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.950
<v Speaker 2>So I think that that's kind of a paradox</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

1532
01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:38.340
<v Speaker 2>It has to be as powerful as the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is simulating it.</v>

1533
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think artificial intelligence is gonna</v>

1534
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 2>lead us to a well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if You can create something that's </v>

1535
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.520
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1536
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Which we feel like is going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>way quicker than 5,000</v>

1537
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:54.111
<v Speaker 2>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you create SomethIng that's </v>

1538
01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:54.111
<v Speaker 2>artificially intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to improve upon.</v>

1539
01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:58.461
<v Speaker 2>It's designed almost instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to realize like if you've </v>

1540
01:11:58.461 --> 01:11:58.461
<v Speaker 2>given autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:11:58.461 --> 01:11:59.250
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what's gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1542
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Quantum computers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how well they're going to </v>

1543
01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.591
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it could be a dud because could be </v>

1544
01:12:06.591 --> 01:12:06.720
<v Speaker 2>fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be fucking amazing.</v>

1545
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

1546
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:13.510
<v Speaker 2>It's something to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when when scientists start thinking </v>

1547
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:15.960
<v Speaker 2>that we are currently living in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of computer simulation,</v>

1548
01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't discard it.</v>

1549
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.070
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it a pause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't,</v>

1550
01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't subscribe or not subscribed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something as ridiculous as that because </v>

1551
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.240
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me within the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>future possibility,</v>

1552
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1553
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:32.890
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like it's a thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment because like if we are the </v>

1554
01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:36.591
<v Speaker 2>simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were not going to figure it out when </v>

1555
01:12:36.591 --> 01:12:36.591
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to have to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it if we do figure it out.</v>

1556
01:12:36.591 --> 01:12:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1557
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:37.750
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.980
<v Speaker 2>A thought experiment and the scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>are looking at the laws of physics.</v>

1559
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.280
<v Speaker 2>If they keep drilling down far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe eventually they'll discover like </v>

1560
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.450
<v Speaker 2>the some kind of artificial substrate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe,</v>

1561
01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:53.451
<v Speaker 2>which is all ones and zeros and that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually living in some kind of </v>

1562
01:12:53.451 --> 01:12:56.390
<v Speaker 2>simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just basically as resolving </v>

1563
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:57.960
<v Speaker 2>the laws of physics and more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1564
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:59.560
<v Speaker 2>if we get down that deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can we.</v>

1565
01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:01.140
<v Speaker 2>We can't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1566
01:13:01.141 --> 01:13:06.141
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that actually mean that we are </v>

1567
01:13:06.141 --> 01:13:08.631
<v Speaker 2>living in some sort of an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>realm or does it mean that that's what </v>

1568
01:13:08.631 --> 01:13:08.970
<v Speaker 2>the universe is made of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not artificial,</v>

1569
01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:14.210
<v Speaker 2>but that the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much like what we're creating like that </v>

1570
01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:18.050
<v Speaker 2>the universe is almost fractal and much </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what we're creating when we're </v>

1571
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:21.411
<v Speaker 2>creating these artificial environments </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the universe itself is made out of </v>

1572
01:13:21.411 --> 01:13:22.650
<v Speaker 2>ones and zeros and then this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really mathematical.</v>

1573
01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that just because we haven't been </v>

1574
01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:29.841
<v Speaker 2>able to detect it up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean it hasn't been running </v>

1575
01:13:29.841 --> 01:13:32.781
<v Speaker 2>on some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a uber complicated </v>

1576
01:13:32.781 --> 01:13:33.310
<v Speaker 2>mathematical principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1577
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I think he's kind of a moot point in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Way because like what's important is </v>

1578
01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:39.210
<v Speaker 2>what are the laws of physics and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1579
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.240
<v Speaker 2>can we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we detect what's actually running </v>

1580
01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:44.240
<v Speaker 2>the laws of physics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1581
01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.720
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1582
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:49.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a philosophical question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What mental masturbating.</v>

1583
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that that's a thing that </v>

1584
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:57.591
<v Speaker 2>people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we could bring it back to </v>

1585
01:13:57.591 --> 01:14:00.171
<v Speaker 2>this flat earth thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that people love to go down these </v>

1586
01:14:00.171 --> 01:14:03.620
<v Speaker 2>honey holes of of information and have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate and ideas and whether it's </v>

1587
01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:09.171
<v Speaker 2>bigfoot or ufos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we love to chase ourselves chasing our </v>

1588
01:14:09.171 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>own tail when it comes to these bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects</v>

1589
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.340
<v Speaker 3>that that may or may not be real and </v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely aren't real.</v>

1590
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:20.700
<v Speaker 3>We love to chase and become like </v>
<v Speaker 3>engrossed in these things and I wonder </v>

1591
01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:21.640
<v Speaker 3>why we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if we're distracting ourselves.</v>

1592
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:23.080
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1593
01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:28.150
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fully happy with their life that really </v>

1594
01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 3>get into this kind of stuff that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>go all in and balls deep.</v>

1595
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:39.510
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get a guy who has lIke a </v>

1596
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 3>promising career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's at the top of his field.</v>

1597
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Happy family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great friends,</v>

1598
01:14:42.461 --> 01:14:43.700
<v Speaker 3>great hobbies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loves his law,</v>

1599
01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.990
<v Speaker 3>and then it just becomes a ufo and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem to be the case.</v>

1600
01:14:46.991 --> 01:14:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1601
01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:50.450
<v Speaker 4>You still got these pool players who </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe they're not doing so good.</v>

1602
01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.730
<v Speaker 4>It's hard out there for a pool player </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1603
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:54.260
<v Speaker 4>The guys at the top of the game is </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1604
01:14:54.261 --> 01:14:56.870
<v Speaker 4>the teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think those guys just watched too many</v>

1605
01:14:56.871 --> 01:14:59.000
<v Speaker 4>fucking youtube videos and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have any science.</v>

1606
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:04.120
<v Speaker 4>Most of pool players.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things about what's that </v>

1607
01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.270
<v Speaker 4>common expression about pool players.</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone plays pool really well,</v>

1608
01:15:05.271 --> 01:15:10.271
<v Speaker 4>it's the glorious results of a misspent </v>
<v Speaker 4>youth because it takes a long time to </v>

1609
01:15:10.271 --> 01:15:14.101
<v Speaker 4>learn how to play pool really well and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be doing that while </v>

1610
01:15:14.101 --> 01:15:14.101
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1611
01:15:14.101 --> 01:15:18.580
<v Speaker 4>got your nose buried in physics books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think like people like things like </v>

1612
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:18.580
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they,</v>

1613
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:22.651
<v Speaker 4>that they get things out to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're getting something out of it is </v>

1614
01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:22.730
<v Speaker 4>giving them purpose in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1615
01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's kind of like a hobby in a way.</v>

1616
01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.150
<v Speaker 4>Like you just doing something because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you enjoy doing it.</v>

1617
01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:27.280
<v Speaker 4>Like playing chess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1618
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Except along with that hobby of doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1619
01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:33.260
<v Speaker 4>They actually have a belief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's is required for them to actually</v>

1620
01:15:33.261 --> 01:15:36.710
<v Speaker 4>do their hobby and they don't obviously </v>
<v Speaker 4>think of it like that,</v>

1621
01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 4>but that's essentially what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have these activities that they </v>

1622
01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 4>like doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like gardening or whatever,</v>

1623
01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.330
<v Speaker 4>but it requires them to believe that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>earth is flat,</v>

1624
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:46.860
<v Speaker 4>so they're spending all that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1625
01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.940
<v Speaker 4>like making youtube videos about how the</v>
<v Speaker 4>earth is flat or doing their experiments</v>

1626
01:15:52.011 --> 01:15:57.011
<v Speaker 4>about how the earth is flat and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're getting something out of it </v>

1627
01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:59.831
<v Speaker 4>because it's the little hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do The same thing except I'm actually </v>

1628
01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:05.710
<v Speaker 4>doing it for science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I do these fun little experiments </v>

1629
01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:06.320
<v Speaker 4>like on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the plane today I was on the plane,</v>

1630
01:16:06.321 --> 01:16:08.720
<v Speaker 4>like wedged up against the window </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for,</v>

1631
01:16:08.721 --> 01:16:11.690
<v Speaker 4>with this holding my camera up against </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and the woman next to them.</v>

1632
01:16:11.691 --> 01:16:16.691
<v Speaker 4>So I thought I was this crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should have told you that the earth </v>

1633
01:16:16.691 --> 01:16:17.000
<v Speaker 4>isn't flat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ma'am.</v>

1634
01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.760
<v Speaker 4>she probably thought that I was thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the earth was flat.</v>

1635
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:24.790
<v Speaker 4>I've seen other people on youtube that </v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing levels onto the plane and </v>

1636
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.790
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1637
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:26.520
<v Speaker 4>look for the level isn't moving well if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you work</v>

1638
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:31.750
<v Speaker 3>day and you have an eight hour day plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>commute plus family plus whatever bills </v>

1639
01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:37.231
<v Speaker 3>and issues that you have to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get into one of these </v>

1640
01:16:37.231 --> 01:16:37.231
<v Speaker 3>youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you simply,</v>

1641
01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:42.320
<v Speaker 3>you simply don't have the time to really</v>
<v Speaker 3>explore all of the possibilities and all</v>

1642
01:16:43.541 --> 01:16:46.540
<v Speaker 3>the science behind all of the arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just.</v>

1643
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:49.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what happens is either they,</v>

1644
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:54.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get this superficial understanding </v>

1645
01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:54.570
<v Speaker 4>of the conspiracy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1646
01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:57.220
<v Speaker 4>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual real life suffers.</v>

1647
01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.500
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people get sucked into </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy theories like,</v>

1648
01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:05.570
<v Speaker 4>like chem trails or nine slash 11 truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they become socially isolated and </v>

1649
01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:11.780
<v Speaker 4>they become the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get divorced and they lose custody </v>

1650
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:11.780
<v Speaker 4>of the children.</v>

1651
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.070
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't like,</v>

1653
01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not like the government punishing </v>

1654
01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.631
<v Speaker 2>them or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just because they become obsessed </v>

1655
01:17:19.631 --> 01:17:22.061
<v Speaker 2>with something that is outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>societal norms and they feel this </v>

1656
01:17:22.061 --> 01:17:26.200
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling need to tell other people </v>

1657
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:26.200
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.550
<v Speaker 2>And they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1659
01:17:28.551 --> 01:17:33.551
<v Speaker 2>people roll their eyes when I bring up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the subject of controls or the flat </v>

1660
01:17:33.551 --> 01:17:33.551
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course they do.</v>

1661
01:17:33.551 --> 01:17:35.270
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from their point of view,</v>

1662
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.020
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to wake up other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing,</v>

1663
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:42.140
<v Speaker 2>they're doing the lord's work by giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth to people.</v>

1664
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:45.140
<v Speaker 2>But then there's some theories that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really compelling,</v>

1665
01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:50.170
<v Speaker 2>like when you look into like operation </v>
<v Speaker 2>northwoods and you find out that the </v>

1666
01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:53.711
<v Speaker 2>government really was planning false </v>
<v Speaker 2>flag attacks and it didn't work out as </v>

1667
01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:53.960
<v Speaker 2>sex saturated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now it's not.</v>

1668
01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.700
<v Speaker 2>How's exaggeration?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1669
01:17:55.890 --> 01:18:00.890
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a discussion document signed by </v>

1670
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.890
<v Speaker 2>the joint chiefs of staff.</v>

1671
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1672
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.440
<v Speaker 2>it was rejected by a candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by candidate,</v>

1673
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:08.160
<v Speaker 2>by the joint chiefs of staff very far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just one documents.</v>

1674
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.440
<v Speaker 2>They signed it though they got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't sign you that they wanted to</v>

1675
01:18:12.441 --> 01:18:14.120
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was an idea,</v>

1676
01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:16.790
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you were going to attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>american civilians,</v>

1677
01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:19.340
<v Speaker 2>that you were going to arm cuban </v>
<v Speaker 2>friendlies and attack one tunnel,</v>

1678
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:21.330
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to blow up a drone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>airliner.</v>

1679
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:23.530
<v Speaker 2>These were all proposed things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will propose things.</v>

1680
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was just like,</v>

1681
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can understand.</v>

1682
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but spit balling that you're going to </v>

1683
01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:31.520
<v Speaker 2>deceive the american people and kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>american civilians,</v>

1684
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:34.670
<v Speaker 2>and then this is a normal part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way nero burned rome.</v>

1685
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 2>HiTler burned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burned.</v>

1686
01:18:35.601 --> 01:18:40.601
<v Speaker 2>The reichstag that false flag attacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>are real and that they have happened </v>

1687
01:18:40.601 --> 01:18:42.650
<v Speaker 2>throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you do have an open mind and you</v>

1688
01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:47.651
<v Speaker 2>are compelled to try to seek the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to be aware that these things </v>

1689
01:18:47.651 --> 01:18:48.200
<v Speaker 2>have happened in history.</v>

1690
01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:52.040
<v Speaker 2>They are real and if you dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

1691
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:57.250
<v Speaker 2>you'll be thought of as a shill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as I mean as much as people who </v>

1692
01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 2>look for conspiracies and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are also people who try to dismiss</v>

1693
01:18:59.481 --> 01:19:04.481
<v Speaker 2>everything and you have to be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful because there are a lot of </v>

1694
01:19:04.481 --> 01:19:06.650
<v Speaker 2>things that people do conspire to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things that I brought up</v>

1695
01:19:06.651 --> 01:19:08.030
<v Speaker 2>before and people hate when I talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1696
01:19:08.031 --> 01:19:09.360
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1697
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:12.740
<v Speaker 2>people say I don't believe in conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy's.</v>

1698
01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.530
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't believe in any conspiracies?</v>

1699
01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:15.440
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1700
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe nine slash 11 happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that people flew planes </v>

1701
01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:25.660
<v Speaker 2>into jet blue jet planes into buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then you believe in conspiracies </v>

1702
01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.500
<v Speaker 2>because someone can aspire to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did it.</v>

1703
01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:30.320
<v Speaker 2>They pulled it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people got together,</v>

1704
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:31.650
<v Speaker 2>decided they were going to attack.</v>

1705
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:37.030
<v Speaker 2>They flew a plane into the pentagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They flew two planes into the world </v>

1706
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:38.300
<v Speaker 2>trade center towers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that really happened.</v>

1707
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:41.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's a conspiracy and they pulled </v>
<v Speaker 2>it off.</v>

1708
01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:46.540
<v Speaker 2>So when you debunk all of these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are absolutely false,</v>

1709
01:19:46.551 --> 01:19:50.090
<v Speaker 2>like flat earth and chem trails and ufo </v>
<v Speaker 2>is and all that Jazz,</v>

1710
01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:54.090
<v Speaker 2>you got to be careful to not try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>debunk everything because now people are</v>

1711
01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.130
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think like,</v>

1712
01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 2>I personally just feel the northwest </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is a bit overblown.</v>

1713
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't it what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it speaks volumes about what the</v>

1714
01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 2>mindset of the joint chiefs of staff for</v>
<v Speaker 2>one example.</v>

1715
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:05.810
<v Speaker 2>And a good one though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1716
01:20:05.811 --> 01:20:07.190
<v Speaker 2>But they didn't come up with any others.</v>

1717
01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about what got us into Vietnam?</v>

1718
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 4>Gulf of tonkin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:13.800
<v Speaker 4>That was a false flag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1720
01:20:13.801 --> 01:20:18.801
<v Speaker 4>that's debatable too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that was just basically they </v>

1721
01:20:18.801 --> 01:20:18.801
<v Speaker 4>thought that they were being attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

1722
01:20:18.801 --> 01:20:19.710
<v Speaker 4>Debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1723
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.920
<v Speaker 4>I think that's pretty much been agreed </v>
<v Speaker 4>upon the flag.</v>

1724
01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:25.650
<v Speaker 4>It was a series of events led.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was the,</v>

1725
01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:30.700
<v Speaker 4>it didn't happen to over two nights the </v>
<v Speaker 4>report of the boats being fired upon a.</v>

1726
01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:36.180
<v Speaker 4>And it turns out that probably wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything there.</v>

1727
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's debatable is,</v>

1728
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.780
<v Speaker 4>did they think there was something there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they wanted to be.</v>

1729
01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.590
<v Speaker 4>So did they completely invented out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thin air right now?</v>

1730
01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:50.720
<v Speaker 4>Probably used it as a pretext to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1731
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:53.520
<v Speaker 4>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start the Vietnam war.</v>

1732
01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:56.850
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they just took advantage of it.</v>

1733
01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:01.860
<v Speaker 4>learn the same way the bush took </v>
<v Speaker 4>advantage of the nine slash 11 attacks </v>

1734
01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:03.340
<v Speaker 4>to push his agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1735
01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 4>is that a conspiracy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to say like what knowledge did</v>

1736
01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:10.980
<v Speaker 4>bush have of the nine slash 11 attacks </v>
<v Speaker 4>beforehand?</v>

1737
01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 4>We know he took advantage of it and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that,</v>

1738
01:21:14.761 --> 01:21:15.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1739
01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.210
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1740
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:21.320
<v Speaker 4>the american administration back then </v>
<v Speaker 4>took advantage of the gulf of tonkin </v>

1741
01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.921
<v Speaker 4>reports.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know for sure whether the gulf </v>

1742
01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:27.621
<v Speaker 4>of tonkin reports were fabricated or how</v>
<v Speaker 4>much they were fabricated or what </v>

1743
01:21:27.621 --> 01:21:29.440
<v Speaker 4>actually happened on that night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1744
01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:34.700
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we do know that they were taken </v>

1745
01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:34.850
<v Speaker 4>advantage of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1746
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:35.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1747
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:36.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1748
01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:39.280
<v Speaker 2>my whole point is that you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful when you,</v>

1749
01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.590
<v Speaker 2>a person who debunks things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimately ridiculous,</v>

1750
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:47.950
<v Speaker 2>that you have to take into consideration</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility that people do </v>

1751
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:48.980
<v Speaker 2>conspiring to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1752
01:21:48.981 --> 01:21:49.760
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1753
01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:53.810
<v Speaker 2>If that's happened within pretty high </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of government with enron,</v>

1754
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this and there's been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ton of conspiracies that turned out to </v>

1755
01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:02.081
<v Speaker 2>be true and that's what they arms very </v>
<v Speaker 2>ryan the Iran contra scandal.</v>

1756
01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.310
<v Speaker 2>I probably went to all the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top.</v>

1757
01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reagan probably knew all that.</v>

1758
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:09.260
<v Speaker 2>That was where it was hilarious when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1759
01:22:09.261 --> 01:22:12.080
<v Speaker 2>when reagan was showing the first signs </v>
<v Speaker 2>of alzheimer's,</v>

1760
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:17.470
<v Speaker 2>when he didn't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't remember anything and people </v>

1761
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.470
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1762
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.470
<v Speaker 2>he's lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out no,</v>

1763
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:19.280
<v Speaker 2>and he's actuallY memories really </v>
<v Speaker 2>eroding.</v>

1764
01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:21.140
<v Speaker 2>The community was an older man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Mean,</v>

1765
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:23.360
<v Speaker 2>he's in his late seventies at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't he?</v>

1766
01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1767
01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:28.690
<v Speaker 2>He was a trump sage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think jesus christ trump.</v>

1768
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:33.790
<v Speaker 2>There was a fucking hilarious article </v>
<v Speaker 2>about trump today that he doesn't </v>

1769
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:36.551
<v Speaker 2>believe in exercise because he believes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the body has a finite amount of </v>

1770
01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:39.110
<v Speaker 2>energy in it and then when you exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>you use up that energy and that's why he</v>

1771
01:22:39.111 --> 01:22:40.790
<v Speaker 2>has so much energy because he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>

1772
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.390
<v Speaker 2>He has strange diets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he has his steaks.</v>

1773
01:22:44.391 --> 01:22:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Well done and he likes to eat lunch meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight out of the fridge,</v>

1774
01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.880
<v Speaker 2>but It's not the head of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1775
01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:54.740
<v Speaker 2>He's a very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you never met the guy?</v>

1776
01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't look healthy,</v>

1777
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:58.430
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a lot of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1778
01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much energy he has.</v>

1779
01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Alex jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1780
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:03.050

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1781
01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 2>he kind of looks reasonably healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess he's not healthy?</v>

1782
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1783
01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Alex hasn't looked at healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's overweight and he's,</v>

1784
01:23:09.881 --> 01:23:11.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's younger than me.</v>

1785
01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:13.420
<v Speaker 2>like I was used to freak out that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger than me.</v>

1786
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:13.840
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Alex goes hard all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1789
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.830
<v Speaker 2>and now it takes a toll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1790
01:23:20.831 --> 01:23:22.440
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1791
01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:25.350
<v Speaker 2>constantly worrying that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government's after you and that there's,</v>

1792
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:31.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every fucking turned he take has a </v>

1793
01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.601
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the mind can only take so much </v>

1794
01:23:33.601 --> 01:23:33.601
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>

1795
01:23:33.601 --> 01:23:34.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1796
01:23:36.150 --> 01:23:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should we talk about some of flood of </v>

1797
01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:41.150
<v Speaker 4>that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1798
01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:41.150
<v Speaker 4>What else you get out there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got notes.</v>

1799
01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:45.430
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read everything I could think of on </v>

1800
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.430
<v Speaker 4>the fly to which is a shit load of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1801
01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the international space station.</v>

1802
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good one.</v>

1803
01:23:48.811 --> 01:23:50.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that footage is fake.</v>

1804
01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.430
<v Speaker 4>They think it's all fake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what you can do is you guys,</v>

1805
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:59.520
<v Speaker 4>you can get back to the skylab footage </v>
<v Speaker 4>and ask someone who believes in flat </v>

1806
01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.681
<v Speaker 4>earth how they faked the skyline footage</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this footage of skylight with </v>

1807
01:24:03.681 --> 01:24:03.681
<v Speaker 4>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1808
01:24:03.681 --> 01:24:06.110
<v Speaker 4>they're running around and running </v>
<v Speaker 4>around in circles in zero gravity,</v>

1809
01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:11.140
<v Speaker 4>as long sequences of people doing stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>in zero gravity and it's in a space </v>

1810
01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.860
<v Speaker 4>that's actually too big to fit in any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any plane that's ever been built.</v>

1811
01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:19.250
<v Speaker 4>So it couldn't be filled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>filmed in a thing Where they do the </v>

1812
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.350
<v Speaker 4>vomit comet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1813
01:24:19.530 --> 01:24:21.320
<v Speaker 4>It has to be something that was actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>a zero</v>

1814
01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.140
<v Speaker 2>for people don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

1815
01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:27.800
<v Speaker 2>when you see scenes in movies where </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone was moving in zero gravity,</v>

1816
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:31.520
<v Speaker 2>they would film that in a plane that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would literally be,</v>

1817
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:33.410
<v Speaker 2>tHey would get the plane up to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>40,000</v>

1818
01:24:33.411 --> 01:24:38.030
<v Speaker 2>feet or whatever and then they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just literally shoot down so that you're</v>

1819
01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:42.530
<v Speaker 2>kind of going faster down than gravity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could float around.</v>

1820
01:24:42.531 --> 01:24:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1821
01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.140
<v Speaker 4>So this is zero gravity here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1822
01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:48.020
<v Speaker 4>Running around in circles and they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>all kinds of stuff like that.</v>

1823
01:24:48.021 --> 01:24:50.720
<v Speaker 4>You get three of them running and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the space that they're in.</v>

1824
01:24:50.721 --> 01:24:52.760
<v Speaker 4>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is so big that it wouldn't fit in.</v>

1825
01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:58.290
<v Speaker 4>Like you probably wouldn't even fit in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the beluga thing that they use for </v>

1826
01:24:58.290 --> 01:25:01.541
<v Speaker 4>transporting a planes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it ties us back to area 51 because </v>

1827
01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:03.860
<v Speaker 4>there's some giant airplanes that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>make an area 51.</v>

1828
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:06.020
<v Speaker 4>They used to simulate zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1829
01:25:06.021 --> 01:25:07.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's obvious that this isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>

1830
01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:09.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is like from the seventies.</v>

1831
01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty amazing,</v>

1832
01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.360
<v Speaker 4>but the space station,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the international space station,</v>

1833
01:25:14.361 --> 01:25:19.361
<v Speaker 4>it flies over at regular intervals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not one of the ground truth </v>

1834
01:25:19.361 --> 01:25:20.330
<v Speaker 4>things that I was talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see it,</v>

1835
01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.070
<v Speaker 4>you can look up when it's going to fly </v>
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>

1836
01:25:22.071 --> 01:25:23.450
<v Speaker 4>You can get them to send you a list.</v>

1837
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:26.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a cycle spot the station as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nasa site,</v>

1838
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to trust it,</v>

1839
01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:32.480
<v Speaker 4>but you can still sign up and it will </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you when the space station is going</v>

1840
01:25:32.481 --> 01:25:37.481
<v Speaker 4>to fly over to the second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll tell you to the second one it's </v>

1841
01:25:37.481 --> 01:25:37.481
<v Speaker 4>going to appear and how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

1842
01:25:37.481 --> 01:25:41.800
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it will be and how long it'll be </v>

1843
01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:41.800
<v Speaker 4>visible for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can get to send you an email and</v>

1844
01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.330
<v Speaker 4>then get your camera out and take </v>
<v Speaker 4>photographs of it when it,</v>

1845
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:48.390
<v Speaker 4>when it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know that this website is </v>

1846
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:50.981
<v Speaker 4>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've proven it on the ground and you </v>

1847
01:25:50.981 --> 01:25:53.711
<v Speaker 4>can also do it from different positions </v>
<v Speaker 4>and get two people doing it and you can </v>

1848
01:25:53.711 --> 01:25:57.221
<v Speaker 4>figure out how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how high the space station is by </v>

1849
01:25:57.221 --> 01:25:57.221
<v Speaker 4>triangulating acu?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1850
01:25:57.221 --> 01:25:57.590
<v Speaker 4>What's the angle?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the angle?</v>

1851
01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:02.860
<v Speaker 4>How far apart they are and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out that the space station is </v>

1852
01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:02.860
<v Speaker 4>actually 250 miles high.</v>

1853
01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:07.550
<v Speaker 4>It is orbiting the earth at 250 miles </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can also take photographs of the</v>

1854
01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:13.121
<v Speaker 4>space station with this camera and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can zoom in close enough on the space </v>

1855
01:26:13.371 --> 01:26:18.371
<v Speaker 4>station to actually see the shape of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>space station and the solar panels and </v>

1856
01:26:18.371 --> 01:26:21.851
<v Speaker 4>the main modules and everything so you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can see that actually is something that </v>

1857
01:26:21.851 --> 01:26:25.871
<v Speaker 4>is moving along the same path that nasa </v>
<v Speaker 4>says is moving along and at the same </v>

1858
01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:31.061
<v Speaker 4>speed as they suggest and it's at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right height and is the right size </v>

1859
01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:37.360
<v Speaker 4>because you can do the calculations on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the camera and figure out what the size </v>

1860
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.130
<v Speaker 4>of the space station is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we know that something that the exact</v>

1861
01:26:40.131 --> 01:26:44.730
<v Speaker 4>same size and shape and speed of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>space station is exactly where nasa says</v>

1862
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.590
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's really no way you could fake</v>

1863
01:26:48.591 --> 01:26:52.850
<v Speaker 4>that on a flat earth because you'd have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have this bizarre.</v>

1864
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:58.330
<v Speaker 4>A thousand foot wide a floating thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving along at like 14,000</v>

1865
01:26:59.421 --> 01:27:04.421
<v Speaker 4>miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doing this kind of whizzy pattern all </v>

1866
01:27:04.421 --> 01:27:05.480
<v Speaker 4>around this spiral graph pattern around </v>
<v Speaker 4>the flat earth.</v>

1867
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:07.310
<v Speaker 4>It's Just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's literally impossible.</v>

1868
01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:09.830
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you'd look at it from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>globe model point of view,</v>

1869
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.970
<v Speaker 4>it's just the space station orbiting the</v>
<v Speaker 4>globe,</v>

1870
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:19.090
<v Speaker 4>but does this bother you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you're even debunking the </v>

1871
01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:19.090
<v Speaker 4>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it,</v>

1872
01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:19.970
<v Speaker 4>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does I catch myself and go,</v>

1873
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:21.320
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I doing?</v>

1874
01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:22.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's obviously,</v>

1875
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:27.520
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the most stupidly obvious proofs </v>

1876
01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.840
<v Speaker 4>that were not on the flatter is that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get three people yesterday,</v>

1877
01:27:29.850 --> 01:27:34.850
<v Speaker 4>standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of them or the bottom of South </v>

1878
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:37.300
<v Speaker 4>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of them at the bottom of south </v>

1879
01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.401
<v Speaker 4>America and one of them in Australia and</v>
<v Speaker 4>have them all look south from that </v>

1880
01:27:39.401 --> 01:27:40.940
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now on the flat earth,</v>

1881
01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.070
<v Speaker 4>you got one person here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one person here,</v>

1882
01:27:43.071 --> 01:27:48.071
<v Speaker 4>one person here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if the old south like away from the </v>

1883
01:27:48.071 --> 01:27:50.441
<v Speaker 4>north pole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all looking in completely </v>

1884
01:27:50.441 --> 01:27:50.990
<v Speaker 4>different directions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the real world,</v>

1885
01:27:50.991 --> 01:27:51.980
<v Speaker 4>what do they actually see?</v>

1886
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:53.930
<v Speaker 4>The lcd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the exact same constellation,</v>

1887
01:27:53.931 --> 01:27:56.330
<v Speaker 4>the southern cross right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1888
01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:00.020
<v Speaker 4>so they're all looking in different </v>
<v Speaker 4>directions on the flood earth,</v>

1889
01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:05.490
<v Speaker 4>but on the round earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all just looking towards the </v>

1890
01:28:05.490 --> 01:28:05.900
<v Speaker 4>southern cross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So see what you're sayIng.</v>

1891
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:10.930
<v Speaker 4>It's literally impossible to do that on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the flat earth and you can actually see </v>

1892
01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:13.000
<v Speaker 4>this and take photographs of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>constellations and compare.</v>

1893
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:18.370
<v Speaker 4>And that's something I was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the ground truth thing with </v>

1894
01:28:18.370 --> 01:28:18.370
<v Speaker 4>malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like you can,</v>

1895
01:28:18.370 --> 01:28:23.080
<v Speaker 4>you could go virtually yourself to these</v>
<v Speaker 4>places and see what the sky looks from </v>

1896
01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.310
<v Speaker 4>that position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1897
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:27.800
<v Speaker 4>so either solarium is lying or these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1898
01:28:27.801 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 4>the southern cross does actually appear </v>
<v Speaker 4>from these three different positions.</v>

1899
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.240
<v Speaker 4>Well that's another thing that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>flatters people keep bringing up as </v>

1900
01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.180
<v Speaker 4>polaris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that this one star puts a great</v>

1901
01:28:38.181 --> 01:28:43.181
<v Speaker 4>one and that all these other stars </v>
<v Speaker 4>rotate aroUnd it and that this is </v>

1902
01:28:43.181 --> 01:28:43.181
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another proof that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not spinning.</v>

1903
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:44.570
<v Speaker 4>What are there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're on a flat earth.</v>

1904
01:28:44.571 --> 01:28:49.571
<v Speaker 4>What's so stupid about that is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in Australia have a completely </v>

1905
01:28:49.571 --> 01:28:52.721
<v Speaker 4>different constellations and the stars </v>
<v Speaker 4>rotate the other direction around from </v>

1906
01:28:52.721 --> 01:28:56.650
<v Speaker 4>the start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all coming towards us from the </v>

1907
01:28:56.650 --> 01:28:56.650
<v Speaker 4>east.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you look north,</v>

1908
01:28:56.650 --> 01:28:57.860
<v Speaker 4>they're going that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look south the going that way.</v>

1909
01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:03.180
<v Speaker 4>So the rotating around the north star,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which actually isn't anything special,</v>

1910
01:29:03.181 --> 01:29:05.970
<v Speaker 4>it's just the stuff that happens to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>closest to the point,</v>

1911
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.980
<v Speaker 4>the north point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it changes all the time.</v>

1912
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:13.010
<v Speaker 4>If you zoom in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can actually see there are stars </v>

1913
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:14.100
<v Speaker 4>that are even closer and if you take a </v>
<v Speaker 4>time lapse of the north star,</v>

1914
01:29:14.101 --> 01:29:15.710
<v Speaker 4>it actually makes a little circle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1915
01:29:15.711 --> 01:29:20.711
<v Speaker 4>and also that north star is not the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>north star is in the past because the </v>

1916
01:29:20.711 --> 01:29:20.860
<v Speaker 4>axis of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1917
01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:22.770
<v Speaker 4>there's this thing called procession </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they,</v>

1918
01:29:22.771 --> 01:29:24.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every 26,000</v>

1919
01:29:24.151 --> 01:29:26.110
<v Speaker 4>years and wobbles away.</v>

1920
01:29:26.230 --> 01:29:27.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1921
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:28.500
<v Speaker 4>the south,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the south team,</v>

1922
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:33.530
<v Speaker 4>everyone's looking at the same thing in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the south and the stars are rotating in </v>

1923
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.530
<v Speaker 4>that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1924
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:38.511
<v Speaker 4>polaris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>polaris is a good one for a number of </v>

1925
01:29:38.511 --> 01:29:38.511
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is not really fixed.</v>

1926
01:29:38.511 --> 01:29:42.670
<v Speaker 4>It's one degree off from the center of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the celestial sphere,</v>

1927
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:45.630
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at a time lapse </v>
<v Speaker 4>photograph of the earth,</v>

1928
01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:48.510
<v Speaker 4>if they point a camera up like say from </v>
<v Speaker 4>north America,</v>

1929
01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:52.420
<v Speaker 4>what you get is the illusion that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these stars are spinning around that one</v>

1930
01:29:52.421 --> 01:29:53.250
<v Speaker 4>star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fixed,</v>

1931
01:29:53.670 --> 01:29:58.670
<v Speaker 4>but it's because you're looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>time lapse of only a few hours where </v>

1932
01:29:58.670 --> 01:29:59.890
<v Speaker 4>it's dark at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas this procession of the equinoxes</v>

1933
01:29:59.891 --> 01:30:04.891
<v Speaker 4>is a very slow process that takes 26,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years and you're just not going to get a</v>

1934
01:30:05.011 --> 01:30:10.011
<v Speaker 4>26,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years time lapse photo of you could </v>

1935
01:30:10.011 --> 01:30:10.510
<v Speaker 4>simulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could still area.</v>

1936
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:12.750
<v Speaker 4>And I was going to believe that.</v>

1937
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:14.430
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting is that some </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures,</v>

1938
01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:17.730
<v Speaker 4>it's been pretty much observed that some</v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures were aware of.</v>

1939
01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:19.770
<v Speaker 4>The procession of the equinox is </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years ago.</v>

1940
01:30:19.771 --> 01:30:22.610
<v Speaker 4>Somehow that they kind of knew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1941
01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:23.940
<v Speaker 4>quite impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will.</v>

1942
01:30:23.941 --> 01:30:28.941
<v Speaker 4>A lot of old coaches did actually take </v>
<v Speaker 4>records of the stars because stars we </v>

1943
01:30:28.941 --> 01:30:30.240
<v Speaker 4>used for navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1944
01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.390
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the post,</v>

1945
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:35.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously is something that gives you,</v>

1946
01:30:35.641 --> 01:30:39.180
<v Speaker 4>this fixed north a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the other stars as well,</v>

1947
01:30:39.181 --> 01:30:40.780
<v Speaker 4>like if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1948
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:42.890
<v Speaker 4>how long it takes to go from one place </v>
<v Speaker 4>to another.</v>

1949
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:45.240
<v Speaker 4>You don't really understand the exact </v>
<v Speaker 4>math,</v>

1950
01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:49.170
<v Speaker 4>but you can use it for navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called celestial navigation.</v>

1951
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:53.220
<v Speaker 4>What other ridiculous things can we </v>
<v Speaker 4>point out before we wrap this up?</v>

1952
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.700
<v Speaker 4>My head's starting to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had food poisoning yesterday,</v>

1953
01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 4>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened.</v>

1954
01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:00.240
<v Speaker 4>I ate something bad at a greasy diner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1955
01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:05.420
<v Speaker 4>polaris is a good thing because you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually look at the angle of polaris </v>

1956
01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:08.010
<v Speaker 4>was at a bang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you hear banging?</v>

1957
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:11.230
<v Speaker 5>I heard banging.</v>

1958
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:19.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's next door.</v>

1959
01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:23.790
<v Speaker 4>He is putting something on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like they shut down the stream</v>

1960
01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:25.320
<v Speaker 4>twice on us already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

1961
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's flat earth.</v>

1962
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm recording the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>

1963
01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:35.620
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the things that were they to </v>

1964
01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:36.090
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the others wonder why they.</v>

1965
01:31:36.150 --> 01:31:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Earth's atmosphere isn't sucked off into</v>
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>

1966
01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:39.060
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1967
01:31:39.061 --> 01:31:40.830
<v Speaker 4>how about the one where that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1968
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:43.590
<v Speaker 4>but it's a good one because I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>wondered that myself.</v>

1969
01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:47.340
<v Speaker 4>I know now why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why that is.</v>

1970
01:31:47.341 --> 01:31:52.341
<v Speaker 4>I know why it's such going to get stuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this space because you think you </v>

1971
01:31:52.341 --> 01:31:53.020
<v Speaker 4>think that a vacuum sucks things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1972
01:31:53.130 --> 01:31:56.190
<v Speaker 4>It's going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything sucks everything away.</v>

1973
01:31:56.191 --> 01:31:57.840
<v Speaker 4>So if there's this atmosphere on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>

1974
01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:02.900
<v Speaker 4>the vacuum of space suck it away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is like vacuum doesn't </v>

1975
01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:03.500
<v Speaker 4>actually suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vacuum is nothing.</v>

1976
01:32:03.501 --> 01:32:05.230
<v Speaker 4>He has no energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't do anything.</v>

1977
01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:10.230
<v Speaker 4>There's no power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that things flow into vacuum </v>

1978
01:32:10.230 --> 01:32:11.650
<v Speaker 4>is air pressure and air pressure as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>function of gravity.</v>

1979
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.870
<v Speaker 4>So gravity is pulling everything down </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards the earth.</v>

1980
01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:21.250
<v Speaker 4>So there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no nothing that can push it out.</v>

1981
01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:23.320
<v Speaker 4>If you see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see what I'm saying?</v>

1982
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:28.350
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you imagine like if the universe was </v>

1983
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:28.350
<v Speaker 4>suddenly filled with loads and loads of </v>
<v Speaker 4>gas like oxygen.</v>

1984
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:30.810
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you stick a big planet in the,</v>

1985
01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:36.130
<v Speaker 4>all the gas would kind of like gravity </v>
<v Speaker 4>would bring it down towards this planet.</v>

1986
01:32:36.370 --> 01:32:39.810
<v Speaker 4>Will they don't believe in gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Electromagnetic.</v>

1987
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:43.300
<v Speaker 4>This is my favorite new one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't see the font one.</v>

1988
01:32:43.301 --> 01:32:45.430
<v Speaker 4>Whether they show that if the earth was </v>
<v Speaker 4>a globe,</v>

1989
01:32:45.431 --> 01:32:46.690
<v Speaker 4>that all the water would be on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom.</v>

1990
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's wonderful.</v>

1991
01:32:48.581 --> 01:32:51.010
<v Speaker 4>I think that was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a joke.</v>

1992
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:52.310
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can you show?</v>

1993
01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.890
<v Speaker 4>What about the other ones as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1994
01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:54.190
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1995
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:55.000
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bring it up.</v>

1996
01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:56.800
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one's wonderful.</v>

1997
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:58.740
<v Speaker 4>I think they're being serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1998
01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:03.920
<v Speaker 4>Now the gravity thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like almost irrelevant </v>

1999
01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.160
<v Speaker 4>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that things fall down,</v>

2000
01:33:06.270 --> 01:33:11.270
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's electromagnetic something or </v>

2001
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.270
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2002
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:14.360
<v Speaker 4>it's magic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a magical force that's making </v>

2003
01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:14.360
<v Speaker 4>things hold down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really matter.</v>

2004
01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:14.360
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gravity.</v>

2005
01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:18.721
<v Speaker 4>We could say we don't really understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>what gravitates lava lava as part of </v>

2006
01:33:18.721 --> 01:33:20.140
<v Speaker 4>gravity to write lava.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2007
01:33:20.141 --> 01:33:25.141
<v Speaker 4>it's the idea that all these rocks are </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing down and there's extreme heat </v>

2008
01:33:25.141 --> 01:33:27.440
<v Speaker 4>and buoyancy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buoyancy and density and density.</v>

2009
01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:32.450
<v Speaker 4>The functions of gravitate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you stick something in the </v>

2010
01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:35.131
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all the water is flowing into the </v>

2011
01:33:35.131 --> 01:33:35.530
<v Speaker 4>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This we're looking at this image folks.</v>

2012
01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:40.710
<v Speaker 4>It says gravity is not strong enough to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop a small stream from flowing to its </v>

2013
01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:45.091
<v Speaker 4>lowest point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then what is stopping the oceans north </v>

2014
01:33:45.091 --> 01:33:46.510
<v Speaker 4>of the equator from emptying into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean south of the equator.</v>

2015
01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:50.500
<v Speaker 4>This is what the earth would look like </v>
<v Speaker 4>if we lived on a globe.</v>

2016
01:33:50.530 --> 01:33:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Gravity is pseudo science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dot,</v>

2017
01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:56.360
<v Speaker 4>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dot a theory that can't be proven.</v>

2018
01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:01.400
<v Speaker 4>They forgot the apostrophe and can't you</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking don't look at that image though.</v>

2019
01:34:02.321 --> 01:34:05.320
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is there water on the top at all?</v>

2020
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:06.550
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You stupid.</v>

2021
01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:09.340
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it's raining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It rains on top.</v>

2022
01:34:09.341 --> 01:34:11.040
<v Speaker 4>Only separates from the bottom and comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

2023
01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:16.190
<v Speaker 4>I'll would be kinda cool if half the </v>
<v Speaker 4>planet was dirt and have plant was </v>

2024
01:34:16.190 --> 01:34:16.630
<v Speaker 4>watering word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether that be any weirder than what it</v>

2025
01:34:16.631 --> 01:34:21.631
<v Speaker 4>is now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the reason they didn't like </v>

2026
01:34:21.631 --> 01:34:22.951
<v Speaker 4>gravity is that if you actually apply </v>
<v Speaker 4>the lows that gravitates to a flooded </v>

2027
01:34:22.951 --> 01:34:24.400
<v Speaker 4>flooded with actually scrunch up into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bowl.</v>

2028
01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2029
01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2030
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.700
<v Speaker 4>There's no way it can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can lay flat.</v>

2031
01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:30.970
<v Speaker 4>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would.</v>

2032
01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:32.670
<v Speaker 4>It would either be like gravity.</v>

2033
01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:35.350
<v Speaker 4>It would be an intensely lodge because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got an infinite abundance of rock</v>

2034
01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:36.040
<v Speaker 4>underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:41.340
<v Speaker 4>Or it's like something on the back of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>turtle or something and it will just </v>

2036
01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:41.340
<v Speaker 4>scrunched up into a bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do they think?</v>

2037
01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Lava is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Molten rock.</v>

2038
01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:48.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean they just think it's brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it heats up and becomes less </v>

2039
01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:48.240
<v Speaker 4>dense than the other rock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it?</v>

2040
01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.160
<v Speaker 4>Why is it down there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the bottom was a core of the fires </v>

2041
01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:53.160
<v Speaker 4>of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A heating it up.</v>

2042
01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:55.240
<v Speaker 4>The fires of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

2043
01:34:55.241 --> 01:34:56.770
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tennis ball?</v>

2044
01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.330
<v Speaker 4>Why doesn't water fly off the earth </v>
<v Speaker 4>spins because the,</v>

2045
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:05.710
<v Speaker 4>this for suspending this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a fundamental misunderstanding </v>

2046
01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:05.710
<v Speaker 4>that they will have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2047
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.980
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2048
01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:10.210
<v Speaker 4>misinterpret angular velocity and linear</v>
<v Speaker 4>velocity.</v>

2049
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:12.530
<v Speaker 4>Like we know the earth is spinning </v>
<v Speaker 4>around a thousand miles an hour,</v>

2050
01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:18.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think if this bowl was spinning </v>

2051
01:35:18.130 --> 01:35:18.130
<v Speaker 4>around at a thousand miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the water would,</v>

2052
01:35:18.130 --> 01:35:19.070
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would fly off.</v>

2053
01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.800
<v Speaker 4>But it's not flying off because of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>surface of the bowl going a thousand </v>

2054
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.780
<v Speaker 4>miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's flying off because it's rotating it</v>

2055
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:30.110
<v Speaker 4>like 50 times a second or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and 10 times a second,</v>

2056
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:34.100
<v Speaker 4>it's the angular velocity which creates </v>
<v Speaker 4>the outward force.</v>

2057
01:35:34.130 --> 01:35:35.630
<v Speaker 4>Linear plots has got nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2058
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:37.280
<v Speaker 4>He's anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're actually turning,</v>

2059
01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.680
<v Speaker 4>you know when you're driving in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you'd be driving really,</v>

2060
01:35:39.681 --> 01:35:41.780
<v Speaker 4>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't really feel any forces act on</v>

2061
01:35:41.781 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you go around the corner,</v>

2062
01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:48.400
<v Speaker 4>you get slumped over to one side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's the the rate of your angular </v>

2063
01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:50.620
<v Speaker 4>velocity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the earth rotates once,</v>

2064
01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.600
<v Speaker 4>once every 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's going really,</v>

2065
01:35:53.601 --> 01:35:54.860
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really slow.</v>

2066
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:59.300
<v Speaker 4>Put that back up please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you imagine that tennis ball,</v>

2067
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:01.280
<v Speaker 4>and if you take it and stick in a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>turntable,</v>

2068
01:36:01.281 --> 01:36:03.110
<v Speaker 4>the rotates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once every 24 hours,</v>

2069
01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:08.500
<v Speaker 4>the water is not going to fly off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's the exact same force acting on </v>

2070
01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.650
<v Speaker 4>the earth because the earth rotates once</v>
<v Speaker 4>every 24 hours.</v>

2071
01:36:09.651 --> 01:36:11.570
<v Speaker 4>The fact that it's like you're going a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand miles an hour,</v>

2072
01:36:11.571 --> 01:36:16.571
<v Speaker 4>it's completely irrelevant because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially going in straight lines </v>

2073
01:36:16.571 --> 01:36:16.610
<v Speaker 4>around the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

2074
01:36:16.611 --> 01:36:18.650
<v Speaker 4>go to that photo on the upper left hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

2075
01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Scroll up</v>

2076
01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:25.670
<v Speaker 2>satan's globe earth like this.</v>

2077
01:36:25.770 --> 01:36:30.770
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this bottom picture here is a great </v>

2078
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.770
<v Speaker 4>example of how ridiculous things are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hold on</v>

2079
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:33.460
<v Speaker 2>satan's globe earth lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big bang and evolution.</v>

2080
01:36:33.461 --> 01:36:35.530
<v Speaker 2>Explain life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were an accident.</v>

2081
01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:40.150
<v Speaker 2>We evolved from primordial soup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are specs in the universe.</v>

2082
01:36:40.151 --> 01:36:42.460
<v Speaker 2>Some people are more valuable than </v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

2083
01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Foundation for the new world order you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are worthless.</v>

2084
01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Next image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's flat earth creation is the only </v>

2085
01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:52.720
<v Speaker 2>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are incredibly valuable.</v>

2086
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:57.990
<v Speaker 2>The bible is 100 percent true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live on an unmoving firm foundation.</v>

2087
01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:03.840
<v Speaker 2>You were created by god in all caps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God loves you and that that</v>

2088
01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.710
<v Speaker 4>seems better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably a true believer.</v>

2089
01:37:06.711 --> 01:37:11.711
<v Speaker 4>The oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think that image there is a is a </v>

2090
01:37:11.711 --> 01:37:14.710
<v Speaker 4>good example of things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely ridiculous on the flutter </v>

2091
01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:18.310
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see they have the sun on one side </v>

2092
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.310
<v Speaker 4>and it's eliminating healthier and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

2093
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:21.350
<v Speaker 4>the way it's cooked like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that runs way closer to.</v>

2094
01:37:21.351 --> 01:37:21.830
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2095
01:37:21.831 --> 01:37:24.290
<v Speaker 4>They think the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The son acted like a spotlight.</v>

2096
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.800
<v Speaker 4>He's looking at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a spotlight is </v>

2097
01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.190
<v Speaker 4>illuminating all of the ice wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's the ice wall?</v>

2098
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:32.580
<v Speaker 4>That's the white stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2099
01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:35.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2100
01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Which is actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a antarctica stretched into </v>

2101
01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.881
<v Speaker 4>this projection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why doesn't one of those dickheads </v>

2102
01:37:42.881 --> 01:37:42.881
<v Speaker 4>getting a boat and take a photo that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wall?</v>

2103
01:37:42.881 --> 01:37:42.881
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's another thing.</v>

2104
01:37:42.881 --> 01:37:44.230
<v Speaker 4>They think they'll go god's all the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>around it.</v>

2105
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:45.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are guards.</v>

2106
01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>

2107
01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.940
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true for like 36,000</v>

2108
01:37:49.941 --> 01:37:54.941
<v Speaker 4>miles of guards of gods in the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 4>with on a freezing ice</v>

2109
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.230
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the wall from it.</v>

2110
01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Game of thrones is that 36,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles.</v>

2111
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:05.760
<v Speaker 2>They make up facts and then they use </v>
<v Speaker 2>those facts to kind of stayed there.</v>

2112
01:38:05.761 --> 01:38:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Point like you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal to fly over antarctica.</v>

2113
01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of based on like half.</v>

2114
01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Well a quarter truth like you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

2115
01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:20.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't fly to engine jet over </v>
<v Speaker 2>antarctica because if an engine fails </v>

2116
01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.080
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to get to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport.</v>

2117
01:38:22.410 --> 01:38:24.930
<v Speaker 2>So they only allow a four engine jets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

2118
01:38:24.931 --> 01:38:25.470
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

2119
01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:26.600
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

2120
01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:29.080
<v Speaker 2>three eight is to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all those,</v>

2121
01:38:29.110 --> 01:38:31.650
<v Speaker 2>those flights that you see that go over </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the antarctic ice,</v>

2122
01:38:31.670 --> 01:38:32.300
<v Speaker 2>they're all seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

2123
01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:33.810
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2124
01:38:33.811 --> 01:38:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Because if it fucks up your doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2125
01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a long way with nothing because set</v>

2126
01:38:38.601 --> 01:38:43.601
<v Speaker 2>of regulations called itar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is all about how far you can go </v>

2127
01:38:43.601 --> 01:38:47.901
<v Speaker 2>away from an airport and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>configuration of plane that you have to </v>

2128
01:38:47.901 --> 01:38:47.901
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2129
01:38:47.901 --> 01:38:49.920
<v Speaker 2>See now I wonder how many people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to this and it's turning their</v>

2130
01:38:49.921 --> 01:38:51.960
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's possible?</v>

2131
01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be a spectrum of people </v>

2132
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:57.050
<v Speaker 2>that believe there is a spectrum and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people will,</v>

2133
01:38:57.050 --> 01:39:01.760
<v Speaker 2>will be turned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will cause a lot of ruffled </v>

2134
01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:01.860
<v Speaker 2>feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you ready for the shill tweets?</v>

2135
01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2136
01:39:03.151 --> 01:39:08.151
<v Speaker 2>you were around her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll shirt if we get you one and </v>

2137
01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:08.730
<v Speaker 2>jamie.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually done like.</v>

2138
01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.290
<v Speaker 2>It's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's all,</v>

2139
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:13.170
<v Speaker 2>it's all in good humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soft people like joking around,</v>

2140
01:39:13.190 --> 01:39:14.950
<v Speaker 2>but take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2141
01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:20.280
<v Speaker 2>With that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make stuff up that my wife got me </v>

2142
01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:20.790
<v Speaker 2>because I'm always making stupid jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2143
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:26.000
<v Speaker 2>And someone saw a photograph of me </v>
<v Speaker 2>online wearing this tee shirt that said </v>

2144
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.061
<v Speaker 2>I make stuff up and says make west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd missing a completely serious.</v>

2145
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2147
01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:34.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's part of the mesa to reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>people if,</v>

2148
01:39:34.771 --> 01:39:35.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the pointing the been,</v>

2150
01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.420

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2151
01:39:39.450 --> 01:39:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2152
01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I guess I guess I hear what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

2153
01:39:41.791 --> 01:39:43.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty easy to dismiss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2154
01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:45.900
<v Speaker 2>they always say that you work for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

2155
01:39:46.110 --> 01:39:47.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a government employee.</v>

2156
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:50.690
<v Speaker 2>You made video games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video game programmer.</v>

2157
01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I helped make the tony hawk series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>video games and made enough money to </v>

2158
01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.331
<v Speaker 2>retire on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I just pushed her around the </v>

2159
01:39:59.331 --> 01:39:59.940
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do gardening and do a debunking stuff.</v>

2160
01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Do fun experiments in the village.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live in the goddamn american dream.</v>

2161
01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:08.780
<v Speaker 2>It's where you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You made enough money to not have to </v>

2162
01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:11.301
<v Speaker 2>slave away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these assholes who want to think </v>

2163
01:40:11.301 --> 01:40:13.911
<v Speaker 2>that you're some government shill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the governments involved in the </v>

2164
01:40:13.911 --> 01:40:13.911
<v Speaker 2>tony hawk video games.</v>

2165
01:40:13.911 --> 01:40:14.520
<v Speaker 2>They recruited you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

2166
01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:19.521
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're doing a good job making </v>

2167
01:40:19.521 --> 01:40:19.521
<v Speaker 2>these video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a better place for you.</v>

2168
01:40:19.521 --> 01:40:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I need to do is cover up the flat earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and chem trails and you have photos.</v>

2169
01:40:23.041 --> 01:40:24.480
<v Speaker 2>And what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else you cover up?</v>

2170
01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Morgellons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morgellons disease is a fascinating one.</v>

2171
01:40:28.521 --> 01:40:32.250
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the ones that we introduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we investigated on that show.</v>

2172
01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:37.490
<v Speaker 2>And do you know that one of the guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we interviewed was a doctor and </v>

2173
01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:42.321
<v Speaker 2>what he thinks is that everyone who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>more gallons also has lyme disease and </v>

2174
01:40:43.111 --> 01:40:45.660
<v Speaker 2>lyme disease has a neuro toxicity </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

2175
01:40:45.661 --> 01:40:50.661
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking to himself about his </v>
<v Speaker 2>own hallucinations that he sees things </v>

2176
01:40:50.661 --> 01:40:51.780
<v Speaker 2>like crawling crosses eyes that he knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't there.</v>

2177
01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a very rational and he</v>

2178
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.970
<v Speaker 3>was also saying that lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get it from ticks,</v>

2179
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:00.460
<v Speaker 3>that you're not just getting this one </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

2180
01:41:00.461 --> 01:41:05.461
<v Speaker 3>but you're getting a host of pathogens </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes these pathogens will </v>

2181
01:41:05.461 --> 01:41:09.690
<v Speaker 3>interact with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In very different ways and that you </v>

2182
01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:09.690
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some are more extreme,</v>

2183
01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:14.191
<v Speaker 3>some are less extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's like you might be dealing with </v>

2184
01:41:14.191 --> 01:41:16.171
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of different pathogens that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>an undiscovered or are undefined and he </v>

2185
01:41:16.721 --> 01:41:21.721
<v Speaker 3>thinks that what's going on with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these people that have more jealous </v>

2186
01:41:21.721 --> 01:41:24.840
<v Speaker 3>is lyme disease and whatever these other</v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases are that's causing them to </v>

2187
01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:27.400
<v Speaker 3>hallucinate and think that fibers are </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing out of their skin would really.</v>

2188
01:41:27.401 --> 01:41:31.360
<v Speaker 3>What it is is they're scratching </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and then they get like carpet</v>

2189
01:41:31.361 --> 01:41:36.361
<v Speaker 3>fibers or clothing fibers on their skin </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they think it's coming out of </v>

2190
01:41:36.361 --> 01:41:36.820
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very reasonable and he made a ton</v>

2191
01:41:36.821 --> 01:41:41.821
<v Speaker 3>of sense because we went to this more </v>
<v Speaker 3>jealous convention and we talked to all </v>

2192
01:41:41.821 --> 01:41:43.450
<v Speaker 3>these people that had it and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking all have lyme disease.</v>

2193
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:44.350
<v Speaker 3>They all have it.</v>

2194
01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:44.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll.</v>

2195
01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:50.020
<v Speaker 4>They'll get tested positive for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a bit of controversy about that </v>

2196
01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:50.870
<v Speaker 4>because the test that you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can basically keep doing it and it's</v>

2197
01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:55.900
<v Speaker 4>kind of a very inexact test for lyme </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease and it gives a lot of false </v>

2198
01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:56.450
<v Speaker 4>positives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different tests,</v>

2199
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:57.310
<v Speaker 4>but there's so many people</v>

2200
01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:02.380
<v Speaker 3>with lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is where it's interesting because </v>

2201
01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:02.380
<v Speaker 3>lyme diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

2202
01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:04.040
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people that have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>it from ticks and it's fair</v>

2203
01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.270
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a real thing that's devastating.</v>

2204
01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:08.730
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2205
01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:13.900
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things that the </v>

2206
01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:16.370
<v Speaker 4>medical community as a mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion about whether the longterm </v>

2207
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:19.940
<v Speaker 4>effects from lyme disease and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people who think that there is </v>

2208
01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:20.220
<v Speaker 4>the longterm effects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's some dispute.</v>

2209
01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:20.810
<v Speaker 4>There is some.</v>

2210
01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.660
<v Speaker 3>Let me clArify from people that I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have gotten it.</v>

2211
01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.720
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about the medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>community is the ignorance of the of </v>

2212
01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.270
<v Speaker 3>lyme disease and that you go to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different doctors and they.</v>

2213
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:31.650
<v Speaker 3>They poo poo it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

2214
01:42:31.651 --> 01:42:33.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is nothing to worry about.</v>

2215
01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:36.270
<v Speaker 3>My friend's son got it and he developed </v>
<v Speaker 3>bell palsy,</v>

2216
01:42:36.630 --> 01:42:41.630
<v Speaker 3>bell's palsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His face went numb and that was when </v>

2217
01:42:41.630 --> 01:42:44.301
<v Speaker 3>they took it seriously and they finally </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave him this intense round of </v>

2218
01:42:44.301 --> 01:42:47.691
<v Speaker 3>intravenous antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my friend was on antibiotics for </v>

2219
01:42:47.691 --> 01:42:47.691
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2220
01:42:47.691 --> 01:42:51.441
<v Speaker 3>he was devastated and we had a guy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>here that had it for three years and he </v>

2221
01:42:51.441 --> 01:42:53.260
<v Speaker 3>had it for a full year where he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>undying.</v>

2222
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Steven kotler it a full year where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's undiagnosed?</v>

2223
01:42:56.071 --> 01:42:58.050
<v Speaker 3>And his body just was ravaged</v>

2224
01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.050
<v Speaker 4>by this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2225
01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:00.960
<v Speaker 4>I used to do write a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 4>morgellons,</v>

2226
01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:06.230
<v Speaker 4>which is related to lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons I stopped doing </v>

2227
01:43:06.230 --> 01:43:09.201
<v Speaker 4>it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a personal thing for the </v>

2228
01:43:09.201 --> 01:43:09.201
<v Speaker 4>people involved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2229
01:43:09.201 --> 01:43:12.690
<v Speaker 4>and I just really wasn't comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 4>like calling them liars.</v>

2230
01:43:13.110 --> 01:43:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Not that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just trying to,</v>

2231
01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:19.970
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out what's really going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and raising possibilities that it </v>

2232
01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:23.391
<v Speaker 4>might not be like these bugs living </v>
<v Speaker 4>under their skin because they just get </v>

2233
01:43:23.391 --> 01:43:24.320
<v Speaker 4>very upset and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really,</v>

2234
01:43:24.330 --> 01:43:27.510
<v Speaker 4>you weren't reaching a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So eventually I stopped that and I moved</v>

2235
01:43:27.511 --> 01:43:32.511
<v Speaker 4>on to chem trails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I thought would be a more </v>

2236
01:43:32.511 --> 01:43:33.230
<v Speaker 4>reasonable people involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2237
01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:37.370
<v Speaker 3>it's another one where people or </v>
<v Speaker 3>initially invested in that idea.</v>

2238
01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:39.590
<v Speaker 3>And then once they become initially </v>
<v Speaker 3>invested,</v>

2239
01:43:39.591 --> 01:43:41.960
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to shake them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard.</v>

2240
01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.850
<v Speaker 3>They just are absolutely convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government is spraying things.</v>

2241
01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:49.851
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a conversation with a friend of </v>

2242
01:43:49.851 --> 01:43:49.851
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2243
01:43:49.851 --> 01:43:50.990
<v Speaker 3>dad has got to be the most ineffective </v>
<v Speaker 3>use of money ever.</v>

2244
01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.840
<v Speaker 3>like they're spraying things and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck has changed?</v>

2245
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's changed.</v>

2246
01:43:55.730 --> 01:44:00.730
<v Speaker 3>They're spending all this money spraying</v>
<v Speaker 3>things in the sky that just happened to </v>

2247
01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:01.400
<v Speaker 3>look like clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet we know that you can make clouds</v>

2248
01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:04.550
<v Speaker 3>with a jet engine and a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of condensation in the atmosphere.</v>

2249
01:44:04.551 --> 01:44:06.620
<v Speaker 3>The heat of the jet engine causes </v>
<v Speaker 3>clouds.</v>

2250
01:44:06.621 --> 01:44:08.570
<v Speaker 3>Like we know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't think that's what</v>

2251
01:44:08.610 --> 01:44:09.150
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:14.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is established science established </v>

2253
01:44:14.490 --> 01:44:14.490
<v Speaker 4>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2254
01:44:14.490 --> 01:44:14.490
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2255
01:44:14.490 --> 01:44:18.471
<v Speaker 4>the flood earth is just steadily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lack of flatness of the earth is </v>

2256
01:44:18.471 --> 01:44:20.220
<v Speaker 4>established science that's been going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a real long time.</v>

2257
01:44:20.670 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people just pick and choose which </v>

2258
01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:26.760
<v Speaker 4>science they went to to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What keeps you going with all this stuff</v>

2259
01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.440
<v Speaker 4>for the running metal bunk?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2260
01:44:28.450 --> 01:44:33.450
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy like doing this little little </v>

2261
01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:33.450
<v Speaker 4>experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2262
01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:33.450
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2263
01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:35.280
<v Speaker 4>going into my backyard and testing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things out,</v>

2264
01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of this stuff you,</v>

2265
01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.630
<v Speaker 4>there's pictures of ufo was and things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that and you can,</v>

2266
01:44:39.690 --> 01:44:41.330
<v Speaker 4>you can duplicate them because some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them are like,</v>

2267
01:44:42.130 --> 01:44:44.490
<v Speaker 4>like reflections or things in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>canberra and yoU can go out and say,</v>

2268
01:44:44.491 --> 01:44:45.360
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this did this.</v>

2269
01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:50.780
<v Speaker 4>Or people are saying that certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>photograph is a indication that it's </v>

2270
01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:51.780
<v Speaker 4>false or these shadows go this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2271
01:44:51.781 --> 01:44:54.480
<v Speaker 4>the moon landing has lots of fake shadow</v>
<v Speaker 4>claims made about it.</v>

2272
01:44:54.690 --> 01:44:58.050
<v Speaker 4>What do you think happened at roswell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Mexico?</v>

2273
01:44:58.051 --> 01:45:00.260
<v Speaker 4>the one that's the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>July,</v>

2274
01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:01.390
<v Speaker 4>1947.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A ufo crash.</v>

2275
01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:02.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's what the,</v>

2276
01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.810
<v Speaker 4>what it said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2277
01:45:03.811 --> 01:45:05.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>

2278
01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:10.550
<v Speaker 4>those balloons that they were using to </v>
<v Speaker 4>detect a russian nuclear bombs in the </v>

2279
01:45:10.681 --> 01:45:15.681
<v Speaker 4>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was a secret program so they </v>

2280
01:45:15.681 --> 01:45:15.681
<v Speaker 4>weren't allowed to tell anybody about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2281
01:45:15.681 --> 01:45:19.550
<v Speaker 4>So they came in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they picked up the remains of the </v>

2282
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.550
<v Speaker 4>balloon and then the story just took </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

2283
01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.740
<v Speaker 3>That's a funnY one though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

2284
01:45:21.741 --> 01:45:23.300
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's made a whole town.</v>

2285
01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Famous for ufo,</v>

2286
01:45:25.230 --> 01:45:29.180
<v Speaker 3>if you go there noW,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have like alien themed gift shop,</v>

2287
01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.900
<v Speaker 4>so the milking it and it's like you said</v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier,</v>

2288
01:45:30.901 --> 01:45:35.901
<v Speaker 4>like people make money out of something </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they get stuck into that just </v>

2289
01:45:35.901 --> 01:45:40.090
<v Speaker 4>because they're making money out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're motivated to promote whatever it</v>

2290
01:45:40.291 --> 01:45:42.030
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big foot or if it's aliens.</v>

2291
01:45:42.330 --> 01:45:47.330
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen anything and all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your years of trying to debunk these </v>

2292
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:50.130
<v Speaker 4>things that made you question whether or</v>
<v Speaker 4>not this was a legitimate phenomena,</v>

2293
01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.990
<v Speaker 4>the chem trail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything?</v>

2294
01:45:51.991 --> 01:45:52.830
<v Speaker 4>Anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

2295
01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:55.730
<v Speaker 4>Bufo chem trail thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like with ufo.</v>

2296
01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.510
<v Speaker 4>There's all things that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain.</v>

2297
01:45:57.511 --> 01:46:02.511
<v Speaker 4>There are things that are identified,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are usually plausible </v>

2298
01:46:02.511 --> 01:46:03.980
<v Speaker 4>explanations for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to,</v>

2299
01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:06.300
<v Speaker 4>whenever I'm given something that can be</v>
<v Speaker 4>mysterious thing,</v>

2300
01:46:06.301 --> 01:46:11.301
<v Speaker 4>I like to list all the explanations that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can think of and maybe none of them </v>

2301
01:46:11.301 --> 01:46:16.101
<v Speaker 4>are a perfect fix that fits that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>guarantee this is what the explanation </v>

2302
01:46:16.101 --> 01:46:19.701
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like it being like a ghost or an </v>

2303
01:46:19.701 --> 01:46:20.670
<v Speaker 4>alien spacecraft as an explanation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>usually pretty close to the bottom.</v>

2304
01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:21.780
<v Speaker 4>Like you started out saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2305
01:46:21.781 --> 01:46:26.781
<v Speaker 4>it's a balloon or a bird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or it's a drone or at cgi or it's </v>

2306
01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:30.420
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something somebody faked afterWards,</v>

2307
01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:35.960
<v Speaker 4>or it's an alien spacecraft or in </v>
<v Speaker 4>between that like always something else </v>

2308
01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.981
<v Speaker 4>that we don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any evidence like in terms of </v>

2309
01:46:39.981 --> 01:46:40.380
<v Speaker 4>ufo?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

2310
01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:44.710
<v Speaker 4>I haven't to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't really looked into the,</v>

2311
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:47.730
<v Speaker 4>the whole sphere of ufo biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2312
01:46:47.770 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just looking at the quality of the </v>

2313
01:46:52.770 --> 01:46:54.600
<v Speaker 4>best cases they put forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I mentioned earlier,</v>

2314
01:46:54.601 --> 01:46:56.940
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some guy in 1964,</v>

2315
01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.360
<v Speaker 4>like got his car beat up on a road a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are like the top 10 best cases.</v>

2316
01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:04.680
<v Speaker 4>And this was like number two or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2317
01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:05.500
<v Speaker 4>What about bob?</v>
<v Speaker 4>LiZ,</v>

2318
01:47:05.501 --> 01:47:10.501
<v Speaker 4>are you ever looking at that guy and ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was he as the guy who supposedly </v>

2319
01:47:10.501 --> 01:47:15.320
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposedly worked at area 51 and became </v>

2320
01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:15.320
<v Speaker 4>a whistle blower.</v>

2321
01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:16.020
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't,</v>

2322
01:47:16.050 --> 01:47:19.350
<v Speaker 4>but a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something You see.</v>

2323
01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:25.260
<v Speaker 4>And the nine slash 11 community is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in the chem trail community is </v>

2324
01:47:25.771 --> 01:47:28.960
<v Speaker 4>people kind of becoming celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2325
01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:31.820
<v Speaker 4>And then they kind of start going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>road shows and you know,</v>

2326
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:37.070
<v Speaker 4>they go to conventions and they speak </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they write books and then they </v>

2327
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:38.440
<v Speaker 4>start doing things and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get sucked into the,</v>

2328
01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:39.540
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beliefs.</v>

2329
01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:44.720
<v Speaker 4>And there's been lots of examples in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>past of people who made claims like </v>

2330
01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:45.180
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then eventually,</v>

2331
01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:46.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2332
01:47:46.330 --> 01:47:47.410
<v Speaker 4>owned up to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2333
01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:52.420
<v Speaker 4>the classic one really classic one is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cost tingly fair is where these </v>

2334
01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:55.650
<v Speaker 4>girls and continually england sound I </v>
<v Speaker 4>went to school in,</v>

2335
01:47:55.651 --> 01:47:59.430
<v Speaker 4>but it's still world famous thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fake these photographs of fairies.</v>

2336
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they convinced a large number of people </v>

2337
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:05.000
<v Speaker 4>in including,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like arthur conan doyle,</v>

2338
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.600
<v Speaker 4>a really guy wrote tarzan.</v>

2339
01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He believed in fairies.</v>

2340
01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:09.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2341
01:48:09.121 --> 01:48:13.280
<v Speaker 4>the guy who wrote sherlock holmes did </v>
<v Speaker 4>arthUr conan doyle,</v>

2342
01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.320
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Turns out that was a william burroughs </v>

2343
01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:18.320
<v Speaker 4>and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2344
01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:18.480
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone else.</v>

2345
01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:21.300
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they look at that.</v>

2346
01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:26.270
<v Speaker 4>They stuck to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they obviously fake out of a magazine</v>

2347
01:48:26.271 --> 01:48:28.280
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2348
01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:33.710
<v Speaker 4>and then they owned up like basically on</v>
<v Speaker 4>their deathbeds live 70 years later.</v>

2349
01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:39.700
<v Speaker 4>But they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were milking it because once they </v>

2350
01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:40.800
<v Speaker 4>get into it is embarrassing to admit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you made something up,</v>

2351
01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.750
<v Speaker 4>plus you're getting all this attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2352
01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:46.800
<v Speaker 4>And in some cases you're getting money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they get any money and I</v>

2353
01:48:46.801 --> 01:48:48.880
<v Speaker 4>wonder how many people were so duped by </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2354
01:48:48.890 --> 01:48:53.890
<v Speaker 4>that changed their life and they started</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for ferries and wasting their </v>

2355
01:48:53.890 --> 01:48:53.890
<v Speaker 4>time when I was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

2356
01:48:53.890 --> 01:48:56.400
<v Speaker 4>that was put out as being a genuine </v>
<v Speaker 4>fairy citing.</v>

2357
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2358
01:48:58.410 --> 01:48:59.630
<v Speaker 4>And you believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull them?</v>

2359
01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.430
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I probably did when I was like,</v>

2360
01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:02.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>13.</v>

2361
01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Oh six people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People get sucked in and they become </v>

2362
01:49:08.641 --> 01:49:10.840
<v Speaker 4>celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2363
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:13.290
<v Speaker 4>and then they like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there it is.</v>

2364
01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:19.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:27.570
<v Speaker 4>just behind the house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for 70 years this lady kept lie.</v>

<v Speaker 4>community who like made up stories of </v>

2371
01:49:36.511 --> 01:49:40.140
<v Speaker 4>abductions and things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then later the stories either become</v>

2372
01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:43.560
<v Speaker 4>so ridiculous and contradictory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that they were lying.</v>

2373
01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:48.740
<v Speaker 4>There's a wonderful one from this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the 19 fifties where it's a great </v>

2374
01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:48.740
<v Speaker 4>old black</v>

2375

<v Speaker 2>and white footage and they talked to him</v>
<v Speaker 2>about his ufo experiences and all the </v>

2376
01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:57.181
<v Speaker 2>different aliens that he communicates </v>
<v Speaker 2>with and he just seems so obviously </v>

2377
01:49:57.181 --> 01:50:01.261
<v Speaker 2>crazy and yet this was heralded as one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the most important cases of ufr log </v>

2378
01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:03.700
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy I'm talking about,</v>

2379
01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:08.730
<v Speaker 2>I forget the guy's now as many.</v>

<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The montauk chronicles,</v>

2381
01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:12.530
<v Speaker 2>which I think you would do the segments </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that.</v>

2382
01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:17.610
<v Speaker 2>it was like an island where they have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>underground thing where they really </v>

2383
01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:21.580
<v Speaker 2>meant to be experimenting on children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plum island wasn't plum island.</v>

2384
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

2385
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:26.680
<v Speaker 2>there was something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy basically said he had all these</v>

2386
01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:29.360
<v Speaker 2>remembered memories of working on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret government base.</v>

2387
01:50:29.850 --> 01:50:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he became like pretty famous.</v>

2388
01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:36.691
<v Speaker 2>You'd read loads of books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he might have just been a </v>

2389
01:50:36.691 --> 01:50:36.691
<v Speaker 2>bit crazy.</v>

2390
01:50:36.691 --> 01:50:36.691
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2391
01:50:36.691 --> 01:50:38.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that out there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2392
01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything else in your pile of </v>
<v Speaker 2>notes over there to get people to?</v>

2393
01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:47.940
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing I would really </v>
<v Speaker 2>encourage people to do is look closely </v>

2394
01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:51.130
<v Speaker 2>at things like it's really hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if people who are on the fence,</v>

2395
01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:56.600
<v Speaker 2>they they need to look very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very closely at the claims that people </v>

2396
01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:57.940
<v Speaker 2>are making claims that the bay is </v>
<v Speaker 2>making.</v>

2397
01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:00.100
<v Speaker 2>If eric debase say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2398
01:51:00.101 --> 01:51:04.540
<v Speaker 2>the horizon always rises to eye level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something you can actually check</v>

2399
01:51:04.930 --> 01:51:09.930
<v Speaker 2>and it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got to be reasonably careful with us </v>

2400
01:51:09.930 --> 01:51:13.290
<v Speaker 2>$2 level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can actually check to see </v>

2401
01:51:13.290 --> 01:51:15.751
<v Speaker 2>whether that is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can check for yourself if something </v>

2402
01:51:15.751 --> 01:51:20.461
<v Speaker 2>reappears over the horizon when you zoom</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and which is something that he </v>

2403
01:51:20.461 --> 01:51:24.121
<v Speaker 2>claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that as ridiculous claim that </v>

2404
01:51:24.121 --> 01:51:26.761
<v Speaker 2>has been made for like over a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years that when things move away from </v>

2405
01:51:26.761 --> 01:51:28.120
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they disappear from the bottom up and if</v>

2406
01:51:28.121 --> 01:51:29.470
<v Speaker 2>you zoom in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will reappear.</v>

2407
01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:31.980
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't actually happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you zoom in on something,</v>

2408
01:51:32.010 --> 01:51:33.360
<v Speaker 2>all it does is it makes the picture </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>

2409
01:51:33.370 --> 01:51:36.040
<v Speaker 2>It makes the image bigger and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>check this for yourself.</v>

2410
01:51:36.041 --> 01:51:41.041
<v Speaker 2>You can go down to santa monica pier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can focus on like the north shore </v>

2411
01:51:41.201 --> 01:51:46.201
<v Speaker 2>like malibu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can zoom in and you can see the </v>

2412
01:51:46.201 --> 01:51:49.380
<v Speaker 2>picture does not change at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the entire zone and when </v>

2413
01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:49.900
<v Speaker 2>you're fully zoomed in so you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cars whizzing along,</v>

2414
01:51:49.901 --> 01:51:53.190
<v Speaker 2>pca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will see that the bottom part of,</v>

2415
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2416
01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:58.940
<v Speaker 2>of the road is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the buildings are obscured and you </v>

2417
01:51:58.940 --> 01:51:59.290
<v Speaker 2>can do it with catalina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can turn around and look at catalina</v>

2418
01:51:59.291 --> 01:52:04.291
<v Speaker 2>and you can zoom in on that and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>see that two thirds of catalina island </v>

2419
01:52:04.291 --> 01:52:08.611
<v Speaker 2>is missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of what you're saying is </v>

2420
01:52:08.611 --> 01:52:10.540
<v Speaker 2>very important because what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about is just being able to look</v>

2421
01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:15.541
<v Speaker 2>at things objectively and use facts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine that this one theory in </v>

2422
01:52:15.541 --> 01:52:20.311
<v Speaker 2>particular flatter theory is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think what's really going on is </v>

2423
01:52:20.311 --> 01:52:23.770
<v Speaker 2>the thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a way the human mind gravitates</v>

2424
01:52:23.771 --> 01:52:26.680
<v Speaker 2>towards these puzzles and these problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these,</v>

2425
01:52:27.130 --> 01:52:29.990
<v Speaker 2>these undiscovered truths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2426
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:34.540
<v Speaker 2>these mysteries that people just want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the person that knows they want to be</v>

2427
01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:39.541
<v Speaker 2>in the know and it's very intoxicating </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what really this stuff's all </v>

2428
01:52:39.791 --> 01:52:44.791
<v Speaker 2>about more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the way the mind works and </v>

2429
01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:45.680
<v Speaker 2>about the way your mind can be tricked</v>

2430
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:51.040
<v Speaker 3>and it's an information issue that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with today with things like </v>

2431
01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.700
<v Speaker 3>youtube where no one can stop you from </v>
<v Speaker 3>making like you don't have to go through</v>

2432
01:52:52.701 --> 01:52:55.430
<v Speaker 3>the people that work at nbc or fox or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2433
01:52:55.610 --> 01:53:00.610
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to go through the wall street</v>
<v Speaker 3>journal or the New York times editorial </v>

2434
01:53:00.610 --> 01:53:01.460
<v Speaker 3>board where they have to review your </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper and go,</v>

2435
01:53:01.461 --> 01:53:02.510
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wrote a bunch of stuff.</v>

2436
01:53:02.511 --> 01:53:05.360
<v Speaker 3>ThAt's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't have to happen anYmore.</v>

2437
01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Now you can just make a video and it can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be really well done with good music and </v>

2438
01:53:10.911 --> 01:53:15.911
<v Speaker 3>good images and the way it's done can </v>
<v Speaker 3>really influence a lot of people who </v>

2439
01:53:16.161 --> 01:53:21.161
<v Speaker 3>don't have a background in science or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not curious about looking into the </v>

2440
01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:21.960
<v Speaker 3>debunking version.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of it,</v>

2441
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:24.830
<v Speaker 3>whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone sends me something,</v>

2442
01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:30.160
<v Speaker 3>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just google that whatever you sent me </v>

2443
01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.250
<v Speaker 3>and then debunked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just do that first and then look at both</v>

2444
01:53:31.251 --> 01:53:32.360
<v Speaker 3>sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2445
01:53:32.361 --> 01:53:34.940
<v Speaker 3>But people don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>debunk that debunks not sexy.</v>

2446
01:53:35.110 --> 01:53:37.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty sexy.</v>

2447
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:40.230
<v Speaker 4>I know people are turned off by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>debunking thing.</v>

2448
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.260
<v Speaker 4>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2449
01:53:41.261 --> 01:53:44.560
<v Speaker 4>and that's why I do tell people to go do</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own research,</v>

2450
01:53:44.561 --> 01:53:49.561
<v Speaker 4>but really actually do some real </v>
<v Speaker 4>research as in do some actual </v>

2451
01:53:49.561 --> 01:53:50.380
<v Speaker 4>observations and experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boring.</v>

2452
01:53:50.410 --> 01:53:52.330
<v Speaker 4>Youtube videos are fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2453
01:53:52.331 --> 01:53:54.540
<v Speaker 4>you watch a youtube video about </v>
<v Speaker 4>dinosaurs being faked.</v>

2454
01:53:54.541 --> 01:53:56.090
<v Speaker 4>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2455
01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:57.640
<v Speaker 4>They're fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe it.</v>

2456
01:53:57.641 --> 01:54:00.490
<v Speaker 4>They fucking got me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like watching a youtube video about</v>

2457
01:54:00.491 --> 01:54:05.491
<v Speaker 4>roswell rods or any of these other silly</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and kind of excited about the </v>

2458
01:54:05.491 --> 01:54:09.331
<v Speaker 4>eclipse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's an opportunity to get </v>

2459
01:54:09.331 --> 01:54:10.750
<v Speaker 4>people excited about a scientist though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not thinking like a loon.</v>

2460
01:54:11.070 --> 01:54:12.970
<v Speaker 4>I know like I get excited about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>eclipse,</v>

2461
01:54:12.971 --> 01:54:14.280
<v Speaker 4>but not everyone does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2462
01:54:14.290 --> 01:54:15.550
<v Speaker 4>it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is exciting.</v>

2463
01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:16.870
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Solar eclipse.</v>

2464
01:54:16.930 --> 01:54:18.960
<v Speaker 4>The moon is going to come of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2465
01:54:19.090 --> 01:54:20.080
<v Speaker 4>Get your camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that happen?</v>

2466
01:54:20.110 --> 01:54:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Check it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>August 21st.</v>

2467
01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:27.570
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be totality in Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you had to see it from all of a lot </v>

2468
01:54:27.570 --> 01:54:29.020
<v Speaker 4>of people going to go to Oregon just to </v>
<v Speaker 4>see it.</v>

2469
01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:29.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to Oregon.</v>

2470
01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2471
01:54:31.001 --> 01:54:32.920
<v Speaker 4>Look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't fuck around type relative.</v>

2472
01:54:32.921 --> 01:54:37.921
<v Speaker 4>So it an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to try to schedule some </v>

2473
01:54:37.921 --> 01:54:38.890
<v Speaker 4>sort of a dinner time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2474
01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:40.690
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be out of the campsite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2475
01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Looking at the eclipse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2476
01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:43.600
<v Speaker 4>anything else?</v>

2477
01:54:46.150 --> 01:54:47.370
<v Speaker 4>And I saw the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2478
01:54:47.490 --> 01:54:49.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2479
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:54.910
<v Speaker 4>and it's kind of complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let me just run right by you real </v>

2480
01:54:54.910 --> 01:54:54.910
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>maps,</v>

2481
01:54:54.910 --> 01:54:54.910
<v Speaker 4>maps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maps,</v>

2482
01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:57.340
<v Speaker 4>and you hit the maketa projection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2483
01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:01.120
<v Speaker 4>the standard map that you see in school </v>
<v Speaker 4>rooms has this really stretched out.</v>

2484
01:55:01.121 --> 01:55:03.280
<v Speaker 4>Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>greenland,</v>

2485
01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:05.980
<v Speaker 4>it looks like kind of distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like the real world.</v>

2486
01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:11.360
<v Speaker 4>And the reason that we use these maps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this particular type of map is that if </v>

2487
01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:12.400
<v Speaker 4>you draw a line between two points on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the map,</v>

2488
01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:15.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you sail along that heading,</v>

2489
01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:19.030
<v Speaker 4>you will end up at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this,</v>

2490
01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:24.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a type of navigation called a </v>

2491
01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.480
<v Speaker 4>rum line navigation that's been used for</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hundreds of years,</v>

2492
01:55:26.050 --> 01:55:31.050
<v Speaker 4>and the thing is that the map,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the makeda matt gets stretched out to </v>

2493
01:55:31.050 --> 01:55:34.501
<v Speaker 4>the top but also get stretched out at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom because the navigators have </v>

2494
01:55:34.501 --> 01:55:38.880
<v Speaker 4>from hundreds of years ago knew that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world was round and that they knew if </v>

2495
01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:42.751
<v Speaker 4>they drew a line between two points in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the southern hemisphere using the same </v>

2496
01:55:42.751 --> 01:55:45.641
<v Speaker 4>map,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would get you to that destination </v>

2497
01:55:45.641 --> 01:55:48.741
<v Speaker 4>using rum navigation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is basically just one more piece </v>

2498
01:55:50.161 --> 01:55:51.000
<v Speaker 4>of evidence.</v>

2499
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:56.210
<v Speaker 4>That's the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the global map matches reality because </v>

2500
01:55:56.210 --> 01:55:59.220
<v Speaker 4>people have used rum navigation for </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of years,</v>

2501
01:55:59.221 --> 01:56:04.221
<v Speaker 4>if not thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying that the image of the </v>

2502
01:56:04.221 --> 01:56:04.221
<v Speaker 4>continents is in some way stretched out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and distorted?</v>

2503
01:56:04.221 --> 01:56:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2504
01:56:04.471 --> 01:56:05.790
<v Speaker 4>if you take a glider,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do that.</v>

2505
01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:07.620
<v Speaker 4>We will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you take a globe and like just,</v>

2506
01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:10.200
<v Speaker 4>you can't just put it onto a flat </v>
<v Speaker 4>surface,</v>

2507
01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:15.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you're gonna have to distort it </v>

2508
01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:15.340
<v Speaker 4>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2509
01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:15.550
<v Speaker 4>so there's various different ways people</v>
<v Speaker 4>use of,</v>

2510
01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.000
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of putting it on,</v>

2511
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:18.390
<v Speaker 4>on the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could just take,</v>

2512
01:56:18.391 --> 01:56:20.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you love to do to longitude and just map</v>

2513
01:56:20.221 --> 01:56:22.470
<v Speaker 4>it into a rectangle and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that works out fairly well.</v>

2514
01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:25.440
<v Speaker 4>that's a nice thing that's called </v>
<v Speaker 4>equirectangular map,</v>

2515
01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:28.350
<v Speaker 4>but the most common map that was used </v>
<v Speaker 4>like before,</v>

2516
01:56:28.351 --> 01:56:31.770
<v Speaker 4>like say 30 years ago was this maketa </v>
<v Speaker 4>projection,</v>

2517
01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:34.260
<v Speaker 4>which is the map that people use.</v>

2518
01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:39.300
<v Speaker 4>Navigating ship routes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can get from point a to b if you </v>

2519
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.430
<v Speaker 4>wanted to go from england to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2520
01:56:40.930 --> 01:56:43.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>north America across the ocean,</v>

2521
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:47.370
<v Speaker 4>you just draw a line between the two </v>
<v Speaker 4>points and then you say,</v>

2522
01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:48.590
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the heading I've got to go in.</v>

2523
01:56:48.610 --> 01:56:53.610
<v Speaker 4>And so you head off in that heading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that doesn't take you in a straight </v>

2524
01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:56.811
<v Speaker 4>line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It actually takes you into kind of a </v>

2525
01:56:56.811 --> 01:56:59.301
<v Speaker 4>curved line because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going on a constant compass </v>

2526
01:56:59.301 --> 01:57:03.711
<v Speaker 4>heading on a globe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually kind of curve in towards </v>

2527
01:57:03.711 --> 01:57:04.350
<v Speaker 4>the poles or away from the pole </v>
<v Speaker 4>depending which way you're going.</v>

2528
01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:05.820
<v Speaker 4>I really don't understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

2529
01:57:07.530 --> 01:57:12.530
<v Speaker 4>but all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that this method of navigation that </v>

2530
01:57:12.530 --> 01:57:13.800
<v Speaker 4>people use that relies upon the earth </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a globe.</v>

2531
01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:18.860
<v Speaker 4>And it's this really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really simple map that is in thousands </v>

2532
01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:21.681
<v Speaker 4>of homes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>millions of homes and schools that </v>

2533
01:57:21.681 --> 01:57:21.681
<v Speaker 4>everybody uses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can see that on the map,</v>

2534
01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:24.930
<v Speaker 4>the lines get smaller towards the top </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it gets more towards the bottom.</v>

2535
01:57:25.170 --> 01:57:26.220
<v Speaker 4>And if people are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2536
01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:31.340
<v Speaker 4>a voyage around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to use this map and it </v>

2537
01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:34.701
<v Speaker 4>only works on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it works on there around the globe </v>

2538
01:57:34.701 --> 01:57:34.701
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another issue too.</v>

2539
01:57:34.701 --> 01:57:35.250
<v Speaker 4>People have circumnavigated the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:37.500
<v Speaker 4>Well they think they do sail around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside,</v>

2541
01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:40.350
<v Speaker 4>which of course would take a lot longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2542
01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.400
<v Speaker 4>that's another thing like the Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen Australia on the flood </v>

2543
01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:48.471
<v Speaker 4>earth map?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a no on the image that was up </v>

2544
01:57:48.691 --> 01:57:50.160
<v Speaker 4>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this kind of squish thing,</v>

2545
01:57:50.161 --> 01:57:55.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where to Australia it looks like it's </v>

2546
01:57:55.161 --> 01:57:55.161
<v Speaker 4>more or less like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this looks like it's kind of like this,</v>

2547
01:57:55.161 --> 01:57:59.871
<v Speaker 4>it's all stretched out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like twice as long and half as </v>

2548
01:57:59.871 --> 01:57:59.871
<v Speaker 4>wide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the theory,</v>

2549
01:57:59.871 --> 01:58:01.290
<v Speaker 4>the conspiracy theory that Australia is </v>
<v Speaker 4>scooby doo a?</v>

2550
01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:03.510
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give it to his head.</v>

2551
01:58:03.570 --> 01:58:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:58:05.090 --> 01:58:06.360
<v Speaker 4>I can say that it's just a joke.</v>

2553
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Italy as a boot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2554
01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:09.390
<v Speaker 4>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those joke names.</v>

2555
01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:13.620
<v Speaker 4>The distances between places in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia don't work.</v>

2556
01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Is that the flatter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2557
01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:17.390
<v Speaker 4>that's the flat earth map and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia and Australia.</v>

2558
01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:22.460
<v Speaker 4>It looks nothing like that and if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>live in Australia you would know it </v>

2559
01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:23.580
<v Speaker 4>looks nothing at all like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just hilarious that there's so many</v>

2560
01:58:23.581 --> 01:58:28.581
<v Speaker 4>versions of this similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many people who've taken the </v>

2561
01:58:28.581 --> 01:58:31.881
<v Speaker 4>time in front of a computer to create </v>
<v Speaker 4>this flat earth map and put this ice </v>

2562
01:58:31.881 --> 01:58:34.200
<v Speaker 4>wall and the idea that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do they know?</v>

2563
01:58:34.201 --> 01:58:35.700
<v Speaker 4>It's a nice wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where?</v>

2564
01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Where's the pictures?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's pictures of ice shelves from </v>

2565
01:58:40.970 --> 01:58:45.560
<v Speaker 4>antarctica,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they think that that's the whole </v>

2566
01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:45.560
<v Speaker 4>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the wool.</v>

2567
01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:45.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that you'll see memes like,</v>

2568
01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:47.740
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>globally what?</v>

2569
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:51.520
<v Speaker 4>Flat ice wall and they'd be like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they show you.</v>

2570
01:58:51.530 --> 01:58:55.320
<v Speaker 4>they suck on an ice shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like 200 feet high.</v>

2571
01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:57.250
<v Speaker 4>What'd you could fly over?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the mentality,</v>

2572
01:58:57.251 --> 01:59:02.251
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a bunch of little kids or a bunch </v>

2573
01:59:02.251 --> 01:59:02.251
<v Speaker 4>of dumb people or a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have very little education or a bunch of</v>

2574
01:59:02.251 --> 01:59:04.990
<v Speaker 4>people that are also speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're preaching to the choir.</v>

2575
01:59:05.590 --> 01:59:08.440
<v Speaker 4>It ties into like a misconception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a natural,</v>

2576
01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:11.380
<v Speaker 4>like a funny thing like when I worked in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the video game industry,</v>

2577
01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:16.860
<v Speaker 4>there was a platform games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You jumped from little platforms and </v>

2578
01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:19.240
<v Speaker 4>some of the times the platforms and move</v>
<v Speaker 4>around and like mario type things,</v>

2579
01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:19.850
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2580
01:59:19.890 --> 01:59:24.890
<v Speaker 4>in some video games when you jump up on </v>
<v Speaker 4>a moving platform and then jumped down </v>

2581
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:29.330
<v Speaker 4>and fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will fall down because the platform </v>

2582
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:32.551
<v Speaker 4>moves out from underneath you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you jump up and you move with </v>

2583
01:59:32.551 --> 01:59:32.551
<v Speaker 4>the platform and you land on it.</v>

2584
01:59:32.551 --> 01:59:37.240
<v Speaker 4>It depends on what the program did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now a friend of mine was doing a </v>

2585
01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:39.910
<v Speaker 4>video game and I wanted the program and </v>
<v Speaker 4>said like,</v>

2586
01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:41.470
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he jumped up and then jump down.</v>

2587
01:59:41.471 --> 01:59:43.210
<v Speaker 4>The platform should have moved out from </v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath you.</v>

2588
01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:45.250
<v Speaker 4>So you should be able to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2589
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:47.570
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2590
01:59:47.690 --> 01:59:52.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the way we should program the </v>

2591
01:59:52.690 --> 01:59:52.690
<v Speaker 4>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then my friend matt said,</v>

2592
01:59:52.690 --> 01:59:52.690
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's wrong.</v>

2593
01:59:52.690 --> 01:59:54.640
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't convince this other guy.</v>

2594
01:59:54.641 --> 01:59:56.320
<v Speaker 4>So eventually what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

2595
01:59:56.321 --> 01:59:57.880
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're going to do is we're going to</v>

2596
01:59:57.881 --> 02:00:01.240
<v Speaker 4>go out onto the road with my pickup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my pickup truck,</v>

2597
02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:04.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get in the back and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to drive along at 30 miles an hour</v>

2598
02:00:04.650 --> 02:00:09.650
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to jump straight up in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>air and we're going to see whether I </v>

2599
02:00:09.650 --> 02:00:10.600
<v Speaker 4>land in the truck or a land on the road.</v>

2600
02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:16.320
<v Speaker 4>So they did this experiment and the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other guy who was driving the truck </v>

2601
02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:18.871
<v Speaker 4>was totally expecting him to like jump </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and pull out the back of the truck </v>

2602
02:00:18.871 --> 02:00:21.961
<v Speaker 4>because the truck went and moved on </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's moving the same speed as </v>

2603
02:00:21.961 --> 02:00:22.330
<v Speaker 4>the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he jumps up and then he lands back in</v>

2604
02:00:22.331 --> 02:00:24.290
<v Speaker 4>the tRuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

2605
02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:29.420
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is illustrating that this video </v>

2606
02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:31.801
<v Speaker 4>game program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had the exact same misconception that </v>

2607
02:00:31.801 --> 02:00:31.801
<v Speaker 4>the flat earth is due because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2608
02:00:31.801 --> 02:00:36.481
<v Speaker 4>what if the earth is moving so fast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't you just go up in a </v>

2609
02:00:36.481 --> 02:00:36.481
<v Speaker 4>helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hover a bit,</v>

2610
02:00:36.481 --> 02:00:36.970
<v Speaker 4>wait for the earth to move underneath </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2611
02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:39.460
<v Speaker 4>and then go back down again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2612
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:44.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's completely backwards physics </v>

2613
02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:46.171
<v Speaker 4>because you are already moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you'd have to slow down to zero a </v>

2614
02:00:46.171 --> 02:00:47.710
<v Speaker 4>which is the same as speeding up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>relatively speaking.</v>

2615
02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:49.350
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2616
02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:54.340
<v Speaker 4>the point is that anyone can make </v>
<v Speaker 4>misconceptions about physics like that.</v>

2617
02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's easy to get sucked into that </v>

2618
02:00:59.500 --> 02:00:59.520
<v Speaker 4>and it's actually quite hard to break </v>
<v Speaker 4>them even play.</v>

2619
02:00:59.521 --> 02:01:01.820
<v Speaker 4>This is reasonable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a video game program,</v>

2620
02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:04.060
<v Speaker 4>but who presumably knew something about </v>
<v Speaker 4>physics.</v>

2621
02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:09.420
<v Speaker 4>He was convinced that matt was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fall out to the back of the truck and </v>

2622
02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:10.780
<v Speaker 4>quite possibly die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he still didn't do the experiment.</v>

2623
02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's end it on that because this is </v>

2624
02:01:15.930 --> 02:01:15.930
<v Speaker 4>literally hurting my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2625
02:01:15.930 --> 02:01:17.290
<v Speaker 4>But what you're doing is very important </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I really want to thank you.</v>

2626
02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.060
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your website is very important.</v>

2627
02:01:19.061 --> 02:01:24.061
<v Speaker 4>It's very important for people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>curious and concerned and don't </v>

2628
02:01:24.061 --> 02:01:24.910
<v Speaker 4>understand the physics and the logic and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the science behind it all,</v>

2629
02:01:24.911 --> 02:01:27.460
<v Speaker 4>but I've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've sent your site to many,</v>

2630
02:01:27.461 --> 02:01:31.840
<v Speaker 4>many people that believed or don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe and we're trying to figure out a</v>

2631
02:01:31.841 --> 02:01:34.060
<v Speaker 4>way to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so thank you.</v>

2632
02:01:34.450 --> 02:01:34.990
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2633
02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:36.940
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right folks,</v>

2634
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:38.480
<v Speaker 4>that's it for the week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Syria.</v>
