<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>they'll give back notes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>she just tells me like,</v>

74

<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>

75
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.630
<v Speaker 1>how much I owe her,</v>

76
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.441
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

77
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:54.730

78
00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:55.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking way.</v>

79
00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:55.931
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

80
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:56.141
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

81
00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:56.561
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

82
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

83
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're a fucking pimp,</v>

84
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.210
<v Speaker 1>wants to kick my ass and fucking kill me.</v>

85
00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not paying that fucking much much.</v>

86
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I for,</v>

87
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I forget it was so long ago,</v>

88
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.923
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

89
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.071
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

90
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>I was outraged.</v>

91
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

92
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 1>was how she did it just,</v>

93
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 1>it just wasn't in that case.</v>

94
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I exactly.</v>

95
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I remember clearly I was like,</v>

96
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

97
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you want that mentioned I said,</v>

98
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

99
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you this much and that's how much he get period.</v>

100
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.690
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

101
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.930
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

102
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.261
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

103
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:23.981
<v Speaker 1>we came out,</v>

104
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.083
<v Speaker 1>They got,</v>

106
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I got to go film and a walking through the lobby,</v>

108
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Knoxville is down there having breakfast.</v>

109
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>This hooker comes walking by Knoxville and she says,</v>

110
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>that's not steevo that's achievable</v>

111
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>when</v>

112
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.990
<v Speaker 2>you're faced with a bunch of different alternative theories that are coming in</v>

113
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>

114
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like take,</v>

115
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.911
<v Speaker 2>take physics.</v>

116
00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:49.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

117
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 2>every physicist like you just had Lawrence Krauss,</v>

118
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 2>he gets these letters daily of people saying,</v>

119
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I think I figured out why Einstein was wrong and he can't address them all.</v>

120
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>And they're smart people.</v>

121
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 2>They're thoughtful people.</v>

122
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 2>They really believe it.</v>

123
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with that?</v>

124
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.463
<v Speaker 2>That's my point.</v>

125
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I feel that's not my problem.</v>

126
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.100
<v Speaker 2>And if there are alternative,</v>

127
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>the other alternative theories,</v>

128
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 2>that's not my problem either.</v>

129
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 2>It's the problem for the mainstream to sort it out and figure which to pay</v>

130
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:13.804
<v Speaker 2>attention to and which,</v>

131
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.693
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

132
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.071
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

133
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm suspicious of this,</v>

134
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of the mainstream,</v>

135
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:19.710
<v Speaker 2>because even looking in the mainstream,</v>

136
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.030
<v Speaker 2>you find so many divergent points of view that I,</v>

137
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

138
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I think that's basically a fiction that there is this mainstream that has</v>

139
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 2>arrived at this consensus and that there are no alternative ulterior motives</v>

140
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

141
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

142
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.490
<v Speaker 2>and that there are no dogmas that are being perpetuated there.</v>

143
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.701
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

144
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

145
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I look at the lot of the geological stuff and,</v>

146
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:46.970
<v Speaker 2>and realize that there are many different points of view when we talk about the,</v>

147
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 2>these floods at the end of the last ice age.</v>

148
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 2>There are many divergent points of view.</v>

149
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.370
<v Speaker 2>There is what could be considered the mainstream yet even that has multiple</v>

150
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 2>interpretations.</v>

151
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.850
<v Speaker 2>And the same with this,</v>

152
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>the comment idea.</v>

153
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

154
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:02.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

156
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what constitutes the mainstream Nair because there had been a group</v>

157
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 2>that has opposed it at every turn,</v>

158
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

159
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>the group that accepts the comment hypothesis has continued to grow.</v>

160
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:12.641
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

161
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:13.560
<v Speaker 2>there's even a number of,</v>

162
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.130
<v Speaker 2>of individuals involved that set out specifically to,</v>

163
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 2>to disprove it or discredit it,</v>

164
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 2>who are now basically on board.</v>

165
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 2>And it has grown from being a small handful of scientists that are now 63</v>

166
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:30.421
<v Speaker 2>scientists from 55 different institutions that are on board with the idea that</v>

167
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 2>something remarkable happened at the end of the last ice age.</v>

168
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 2>It was probably exogenic meaning something from outside,</v>

169
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.853
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

170
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 2>something from space.</v>

171
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 2>There's no consensus as to exactly what that was,</v>

172
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.070
<v Speaker 2>which would be normal because the,</v>

173
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 2>these discoveries are in their infancy at this point.</v>

174
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 2>But there has been an attempt to discredit the idea simply because that as the</v>

175
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 2>evidence has come in over the last decade,</v>

176
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 2>it has evolved in,</v>

177
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 2>in new mysteries had been opened up.</v>

178
00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.441
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

179
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 2>as the evidence comes in and the claim is being made,</v>

180
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:02.591
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

181
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:04.580
<v Speaker 2>there's no consistent,</v>

182
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

183
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of this evidence and therefore we've debunked it.</v>

184
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

185
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 2>that's a really important lesson for parenthood.</v>

186
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't just tell kids what to do,</v>

187
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:16.151
<v Speaker 2>like you just do it.</v>

189
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:16.931
<v Speaker 2>Cause I told you to do it.</v>

190
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:17.171
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

191
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:17.621
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

192
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:18.454
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be a hooker.</v>

193
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 3>That's in that,</v>

194
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 3>and that applies not only to kids and you're 100%,</v>

195
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.280
<v Speaker 3>it applies to kids,</v>

196
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.540
<v Speaker 3>but it applies to adults as well.</v>

197
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 3>And that is people need to understand why they're doing what they're doing.</v>

198
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.391
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

199
00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:32.720
<v Speaker 3>if I want you to go take down some building and capture some bad guy,</v>

200
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.411
<v Speaker 3>I don't go,</v>

201
00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:33.740
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

202
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.370
<v Speaker 3>hey Joe,</v>

203
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.590
<v Speaker 3>I want you to go take down this building once you pack captures bad guy,</v>

204
00:05:36.591 --> 00:05:37.880
<v Speaker 3>these are the guys I want you to take with you.</v>

205
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Here's the route I want you to take in.</v>

206
00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:40.970
<v Speaker 3>Here's the methodology I want you to use for the clearance.</v>

207
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.040
<v Speaker 3>Because then when I send you to go do that mission,</v>

208
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 3>it's not your mission.</v>

209
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.290
<v Speaker 3>It's my mission.</v>

210
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.910
<v Speaker 3>I came up with a plan you didn't.</v>

211
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.923
<v Speaker 3>So you might be,</v>

212
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.300
<v Speaker 3>you might have thought there was a better way to do it or you might had a</v>

213
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:51.680
<v Speaker 3>different idea of how to get it done.</v>

214
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.590
<v Speaker 3>And now when you go out there and you meet some kind of resistance,</v>

215
00:05:54.591 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 3>whether it's an obstacle you didn't expect or whether it's some scenario you</v>

216
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 3>didn't foresee,</v>

217
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 3>instead of you're trying to overcome it,</v>

218
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:00.690
<v Speaker 3>you just blame me.</v>

219
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 3>You just looked mad jack who came up with this stupid plan and here we are.</v>

220
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 3>It's failing.</v>

221
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.551
<v Speaker 3>Forget it.</v>

222
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:05.151
<v Speaker 3>We're going back.</v>

223
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to carry out the mission.</v>

224
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if I said,</v>

225
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 3>hey Joe,</v>

226
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 3>here's what I want you to do,</v>

227
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 3>go figure out the best way to do it.</v>

228
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 3>And now you come up with a plan and now you make up all the methodologies of how</v>

229
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get it done and you decide who you're going to take with you.</v>

230
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 3>Now what's your plan?</v>

231
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 3>You own that plant and when you go out in the field and you meet a little</v>

232
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 3>resistance,</v>

233
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 3>guess what you do?</v>

234
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

235
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find a way around it.</v>

236
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to overcome this.</v>

237
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna overcome that obstacle.</v>

238
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.374
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna make it happen.</v>

239
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's another piece of leadership.</v>

240
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 3>And it's the exact same thing with kids.</v>

241
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 3>If you tell your kid,</v>

242
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

243
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 3>you will get good grades in school,</v>

244
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 3>that means nothing to them.</v>

245
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 3>But if you explain to them,</v>

246
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

247
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 3>I would love for you to get good grades and here's why it's gonna open</v>

248
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 3>opportunities for you in the future.</v>

249
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 3>It's going to allow you to be able to outsmart people cause you're gonna have</v>

250
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 3>more knowledge than them.</v>

251
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 3>And then you're gonna be able to end up making more money,</v>

252
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 3>which is actually gonna give you more freedom in the long run.</v>

253
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Instead of doing a job that you don't want to do.</v>

254
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 3>If you explain all those things to a kid,</v>

255
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a lot more successful than just,</v>

256
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

257
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I told you get good grades because I said so.</v>

258
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 3>Now when you do these conferences where when you speak it at,</v>

259
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

260
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 3>businesses and they bring you in to sort of have these leadership,</v>

261
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

262
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.610
<v Speaker 3>media,</v>

263
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.443
<v Speaker 3>what would you call them?</v>

264
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

265
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 3>their leadership seminars.</v>

266
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.481
<v Speaker 3>Seminars.</v>

267
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

268
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Now when you have these seminars or these,</v>

269
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:13.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

270
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 3>some of the principles that you discuss when you talk about absolutely.</v>

271
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

272
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.640
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

273
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Because that's another,</v>

274
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 3>another big piece of this is that all this ideas about interacting with human</v>

275
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:23.451
<v Speaker 3>beings,</v>

276
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 3>they just don't change.</v>

277
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a little variance,</v>

278
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 3>but whether you're dealing with kids or whether you're dealing with adults and</v>

279
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 3>whether you're dealing with business people,</v>

280
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 3>whether you're dealing with soldiers on the battlefield,</v>

281
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 3>the leadership principles,</v>

282
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 3>they don't change.</v>

283
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 3>And therefore you can,</v>

284
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 3>whether you're trying to get people to go out and capture and kill a bad guy,</v>

285
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 3>or whether you're trying to get them to build some product and sell it,</v>

286
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 3>the principal's leadership don't change.</v>

287
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.570
<v Speaker 3>Do,</v>

288
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 3>you're still trying to get a bunch of totally independent people.</v>

289
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

290
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the myths we have to overcome a lot because everyone thinks,</v>

291
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:53.530
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

292
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 3>in the military wounds just like a robot.</v>

293
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's just not true.</v>

294
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Everybody in the military is free.</v>

295
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 3>There are people,</v>

296
00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.571
<v Speaker 3>they're people,</v>

297
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 3>they're free thinking people,</v>

298
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 3>and they're gonna come up with their own ideas.</v>

299
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have with their own agendas,</v>

300
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to think of ways to do things that they think are better than</v>

301
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 3>yours.</v>

302
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.150
<v Speaker 3>So you can have all these independent free thinkers,</v>

303
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to get them on board with the same plan to you to go out and</v>

304
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 3>execute.</v>

305
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 3>And so it doesn't matter if you're on the battlefield or in business.</v>

306
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:15.800
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

307
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're trying to get done.</v>

308
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 3>And the leadership principles don't change.</v>

309
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
