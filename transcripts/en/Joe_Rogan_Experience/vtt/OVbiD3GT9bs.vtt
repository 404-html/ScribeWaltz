00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>let me use another example because I think this will help show what's happening</v>

3
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:08.251
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

4
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:09.084
<v Speaker 1>So there was a,</v>

5
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>a Chinese,</v>

7
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>a site,</v>

8
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:12.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>most drug trials,</v>

10
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>they take place at different sites so they have multiple locations that are</v>

11
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>testing so that they can get data on different populations,</v>

12
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:21.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>not just in white Americans,</v>

14
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>also Chinese people and you know,</v>

15
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>so they do it different centers.</v>

16
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a,</v>

17
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>it was a trial for an anticoagulant drug.</v>

18
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.570
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

20
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>they found that this Chinese center had falsified a whole bunch of patient data</v>

21
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:43.821
<v Speaker 1>and change the results and if they took that Chinese center's data out of the</v>

22
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:44.581
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>

23
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>that drug would have failed.</v>

24
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't have been more effective than placebo.</v>

25
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>But even though the FDA busted this group in China,</v>

26
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.060
<v Speaker 1>the study that was published on that drug still included that data from the</v>

27
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>study in China and even studies that were being published 18 months later still</v>

28
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>included that data in the original data set.</v>

29
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>So the FDA busted them.</v>

30
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>It was clear that they had falsified the data and yet that data is still being</v>

31
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>included in the studies that doctors are relying on all over the world to make</v>

32
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>decisions about whether to prescribe these drugs.</v>

33
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

34
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>there's fraud happening and whether it's,</v>

35
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>from financial interests or just human error that's not actually being reported</v>

37
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.090
<v Speaker 1>and translating into clinical decisions that,</v>

38
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>that doctors are making.</v>

39
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>So there are a lot of.</v>

40
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole peer review process,</v>

41
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned peer review to a,</v>

42
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>there was a pretty big study where,</v>

43
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.033
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

45
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

46
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>paper was submitted to Bmj,</v>

48
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>British Medical Journal and other big medical journal with eight major errors</v>

49
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>and not a single one of the 221 scientists that were asked to review the paper,</v>

50
00:01:55.921 --> 00:02:00.921
<v Speaker 1>caught all of the errors and only 30 percent recommended rejecting the paper.</v>

51
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 1>And this was even more problematic because half of those scientists were warned</v>

52
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.883
<v Speaker 1>in advance.</v>

53
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>We're going to give you a paper that has a lot of errors.</v>

54
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

55
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>and the ones who were warned didn't get any more of the errors than the</v>

56
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>scientists that weren't warned in advance.</v>

57
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>They broke them up into two groups.</v>

58
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that just a lack of time to do the research and people being overwhelmed by a</v>

59
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>workload?</v>

60
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably part of it.</v>

61
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really an excuse.</v>

63
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

64
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

65
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:32.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem with peer review because our artist,</v>

66
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 1>it is a big part of the scientific method to,</v>

68
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>to have the results validated by somebody else or,</v>

69
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>or two to review the work and make sure that it sounds.</v>

70
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 1>But what this paper indicated is that a lot of findings that we take to be true</v>

71
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>and valid might not actually be true and valid.</v>

72
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And you may have heard about this,</v>

73
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>it actually made the news,</v>

74
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>there was a recent,</v>

76
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.480
<v Speaker 1>the open science collaboration did a review of one psychology studies and that</v>

77
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>had never been replicated.</v>

78
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Replicating findings is really important in the scientific method to like if you</v>

79
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>design a study and you do it and you have,</v>

80
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>you find a certain result in science,</v>

81
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not really considered to be valid unless I do it and,</v>

82
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>and confirm your results,</v>

83
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>or someone else does.</v>

85
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>It's independent of you.</v>

86
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And in a shocking number of studies,</v>

87
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>this never happens.</v>

88
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

89
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>this group went back and looked at 100 psychology studies and tried to replicate</v>

90
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.034
<v Speaker 1>them using the,</v>

91
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:35.401
<v Speaker 1>almost identical conditions from the original studies and they were only able to</v>

93
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>do that in 35 percent of cases there.</v>

94
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

95
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>another group looked at a precancer,</v>

96
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>a clinical studies and found that could only replicate 11 percent of those.</v>

97
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a well known saying in the pharmaceutical world that,</v>

98
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.220
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

99
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>like more than half of the drug trials can't be replicated.</v>

100
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>And have a group of researchers from Bayer,</v>

101
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>from a pharmaceutical company tried to do that in 2011.</v>

102
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>They took a bunch of trials and try to replicate them less than one quarter.</v>

103
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Then they were able to replicate the results.</v>

104
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>So what this means is,</v>

105
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>a study can be done,</v>

107
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>it's never validated and then a whole bunch of other studies are done that refer</v>

108
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:20.131
<v Speaker 1>to that study and whole fields of scientific research are spawn on a study that</v>

109
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>was never confirmed or validated.</v>

110
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a house of cards built on a foundation of falsehood.</v>

111
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

112
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

113
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 1>science is great.</v>

114
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>We need to keep improving science,</v>

115
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of problems with the way that studies are performed right now</v>

116
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>and it Kinda,</v>

117
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.680
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

118
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>it's both,</v>

119
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>conflicts of interest that are based on money and it's just also human human</v>

121
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:43.751
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>

122
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Are</v>

123
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.640
<v Speaker 2>these black mold spores just being poisoned all the time.</v>

124
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Do they have home tests for that?</v>

125
00:04:48.861 --> 00:04:49.770
<v Speaker 2>I bet you anything.</v>

126
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:50.970
<v Speaker 2>I have so much black,</v>

127
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.490
<v Speaker 2>black people,</v>

128
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 2>fucking son of a bitch.</v>

129
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.313
<v Speaker 2>He's</v>

130
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.230
<v Speaker 2>got to keep an eye on it.</v>

131
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Help the jokes.</v>

132
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.151
<v Speaker 2>They come,</v>

133
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:03.984
<v Speaker 2>they just come.</v>

134
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.400
<v Speaker 2>I hit a bunch of mold the other day.</v>

135
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.920
<v Speaker 2>It's late at night and we bought strawberries.</v>

136
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 2>You know like underneath the strawberry was like green and stuff.</v>

137
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea because it was dark.</v>

138
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Speaker 2>I was eating strawberries and the next day I go in to get some more and I'm</v>

139
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:16.501
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

140
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:17.310
<v Speaker 2>they're all moldy.</v>

141
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

142
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.633
<v Speaker 2>was I eating?</v>

143
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.110
<v Speaker 2>I was eating moldy strawberry in the dark.</v>

144
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:22.944
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

145
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.833
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

146
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not even that bad for you.</v>

147
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 2>It's probably just all in your head.</v>

148
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

149
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 2>otherwise people would be dying left and right,</v>

150
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.360
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

151
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

152
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Because everybody eats strawberries and doesn't pay attention.</v>

153
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize people actually could pass up behind a dumpster late.</v>

154
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.260
<v Speaker 2>I've never been that drunk to where that's where I would lay down.</v>

155
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I fucked by a dumpster but never slept there.</v>

156
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.360
<v Speaker 2>He fucked by a dumpster,</v>

157
00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:46.340
<v Speaker 2>like call that dumpster grease on the ground now.</v>

158
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Slippery to boxes down,</v>

159
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.320
<v Speaker 2>but oh my God,</v>

160
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:50.730
<v Speaker 2>what a classy girl you must have been.</v>

161
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I told you about this and the guy came out and he caught us having sex and he's</v>

162
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:54.990
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

163
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

164
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.011
<v Speaker 2>you got nervous.</v>

165
00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

166
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 2>do you guys want some pizza?</v>

167
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Because he thought</v>

168
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.843
<v Speaker 3>we were homeless.</v>

169
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Homeless Bank to homeless people,</v>

170
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Bang on pizza boxes next to dumpsters.</v>

171
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty much it.</v>

172
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 3>You heard this media narrative that it sells papers.</v>

173
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.851
<v Speaker 3>It sell,</v>

174
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 3>it didn't sell clicks at the time because they were doing,</v>

175
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 3>it's about the Internet,</v>

176
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 3>but it sells papers,</v>

177
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 3>which is the idea that the internet is a haven of crooks and fraudsters and</v>

178
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:20.710
<v Speaker 3>terrorists and pedophiles and pornography.</v>

179
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.643
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

180
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

181
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Criminal use of advanced technology,</v>

182
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.641
<v Speaker 3>criminal use,</v>

183
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 3>the most advanced technology they can get their hands on because they're in a</v>

184
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 3>very highly competitive,</v>

185
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:31.311
<v Speaker 3>high margin,</v>

186
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 3>high risk business.</v>

187
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.600
<v Speaker 3>And of course they're going to say they criminals wear shoes to run away from</v>

188
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 3>bank heist criminals drive cars to get away from raw bank robberies.</v>

189
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 3>They use cell phones to coordinate with each other.</v>

190
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 3>They drink water.</v>

191
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 3>So it does not to die of dehydration.</v>

192
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to ban all of those things.</v>

193
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.903
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

194
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 3>And so you have that anger.</v>

195
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.943
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

196
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 3>and they tried that for awhile.</v>

197
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.943
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

198
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.210
<v Speaker 3>every time they try that,</v>

199
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 3>you just turn around and say,</v>

200
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.711
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

201
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

202
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

203
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.490
<v Speaker 3>actually the biggest money launderers of drugs in the world are HSBC,</v>

204
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:07.394
<v Speaker 3>the Hong Kong,</v>

205
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.001
<v Speaker 3>Hong Kong,</v>

206
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Shanghai banking consortium.</v>

207
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Inconvenient fact is that laundry is in the world.</v>

208
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.771
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

209
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:16.471
<v Speaker 3>They would call it the model.</v>

210
00:07:16.471 --> 00:07:17.121
<v Speaker 3>New Laundering,</v>

211
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:22.121
<v Speaker 3>$700,000,000,000 for the Sinaloa cartel over a period of 10 years during which</v>

212
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 3>19,000 people died in Mexico as a direct result of that.</v>

213
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.873
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

214
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 3>and they got a fine and no one went to jail.</v>

215
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 3>So there are inconvenient facts like that.</v>

216
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Every time they say bitcoin fund's terrorism,</v>

217
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:37.270
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

218
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.103
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

219
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 3>I see them driving Toyota's and Humvees,</v>

220
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.343
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

221
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't,</v>

222
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.810
<v Speaker 3>that's a bit incongruence.</v>

223
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.571
<v Speaker 3>Like they're,</v>

224
00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 3>they're driving around in the vehicles.</v>

225
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 3>We left behind and there they got a lot of their funding from pallets of money</v>

226
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:58.781
<v Speaker 3>that we left behind and they're getting paid for dollar in dollars for oil that</v>

227
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 3>they're selling to our closest allies.</v>

228
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't really mentioned Saudi Arabia.</v>

229
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

230
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.110
<v Speaker 3>so these are the inconvenient truth,</v>

231
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:07.371
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

232
00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 3>So you don't talk about these in polite company or at least you do.</v>

233
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

234
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 3>that's what I said when I was invited to speak in front of the Senate in Canada</v>

235
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 3>and they started asking me about terrorism and I said to actually mostly funded</v>

236
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:21.231
<v Speaker 3>by our allies.</v>

237
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 3>And what did they say when you do that?</v>

238
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 3>That was the end of that train of thought.</v>

239
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.831
<v Speaker 3>They stopped,</v>

240
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:26.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

241
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 3>it was live public tv,</v>

242
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>

243
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

244
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 3>like what went down when we moved on to talk about more realistic and</v>

245
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 3>interesting things in a much more positive view of what this thing is.</v>

246
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 3>So they tried to discredit bitcoin by attaching it to terrorism and you informed</v>

247
00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 3>them of the facts of where terrorists are actually funded from.</v>

248
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

249
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 3>In a very public forum on live TV,</v>

250
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 3>which was very difficult to continue that line of conversation.</v>

251
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 3>So that's anger.</v>

252
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Is there a resistance in Canada?</v>

253
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Like there isn't the United States where.</v>

254
00:08:56.261 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

255
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.920
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

256
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

257
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:57.710
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

258
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.531
<v Speaker 3>they've been very,</v>

259
00:08:58.531 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 3>very positive,</v>

260
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 3>very positive to,</v>

261
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.523
<v Speaker 3>towards,</v>

262
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 3>towards cryptocurrencies in general.</v>

263
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

264
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

265
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:06.760
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of.</v>
