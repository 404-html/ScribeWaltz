WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
How we are alive.
Abby Martin,
how do you feel about that?
I feel great.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.530
You've done that live shit before.
Hell yeah.
Hell yeah.
You're free.

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:11.010
The Russians free.
That'd be Martin,
formerly of Russia today.

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.450
The lone standing voice.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.850
You were like the person you ever want to say Russia today.

6
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:18.570
Who the fuck's gonna Watch that?
Well that chick seems to be speaking her mind.

7
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:19.600
Yeah.
Mm.

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.450
Gave me in a lot of credibility to the network when you have dissent against the

9
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.780
funder.
I mean,
yeah.
That's a weird place to be though.
Huh?

10
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.130
Like that whole Crimea thing.

11
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.940
When you were a protest to what you were talking and speaking and I guess an

12
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:37.230
editorial fashion on your show about what was going on with the,
uh,

13
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.240
the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
the Crimean situation.
And they were like,

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.220
well,
you should go there yourself and see it.
And you're like,
fuck that.

15
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.460
Was that when you were starting to think like,
man,
maybe I should not be here.

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.960
Well,
well,

17
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.870
the problem was waking up to a press release saying that I was already going to

18
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:58.950
be shipped there without asking me.
So that was when you shipped shipped.

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.530
So I just said,
no,
I'm not going to,

20
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:04.650
I just didn't want it to be a vetted press experience for me.

21
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.310
I wanted to make my own contacts on the ground and Kiev plus it was like a war

22
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:10.280
zone at the time.
I mean maybe not Crimea,

23
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.140
but you crane even though it's part of it.
Um,
yeah.

24
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:16.350
So I wanted to get training and also make my own context instead of just going

25
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:20.070
with like vetted Russians and just like going around Russians there and being

26
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:23.420
like,
look,
everything's great.
They're all happy.
Like we vetted everyone already.

27
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.600
Here's your experience.
You asked me a weird gig working for Russia,

28
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.890
like the Russian sponsored news network in America,

29
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.330
living in Washington DC.
Like what a block from the White House.

30
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.060
Yeah,
it's great.

31
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:42.360
You're in the belly of the beast and you're also working for the enemy.
Right.

32
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.500
It's amazing.
Um,
whenever I'd meet guys at bars and they'd be like,

33
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:49.200
what are you do?
I'm like,
I work for Putin's propaganda machine.

34
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.870
I just like to shut it down.
Just make everyone really uncomfortable.
Yeah.

35
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:57.960
They'd be like,
I don't want to Texas check,
we'll get on a list.
You know,

36
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.300
I think Dave would put you on some sort of a list,
right?

37
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.630
I'm assuming that everybody who's friends with you is on some sort of a list.

38
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.950
Well I think,
I don't like to live in fear of the NSA,
but I think that obviously,

39
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:11.520
you know when you have John Carry out there all the time fearmongering about

40
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:15.600
Russia today and bringing it up saying that using Russia today as an example,

41
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:20.430
why the US State Department propaganda apparatus needs tens of millions of

42
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.190
dollars more funding,
which is called the broadcasting board of governors.

43
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.410
So it's Radio Free Europe and Voice of America and it's the,

44
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.100
it's what the US does to put their propaganda out to the rest of the world.

45
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.600
And so John Kerry's using Russia today as an example of how good Russia is that

46
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:38.430
putting these counter talking points out there and using it to get more money so

47
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:41.850
you know that they're paying attention and you know that they are really

48
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:42.541
bothered by it.

49
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:46.500
But if they did anything like sanction the station or tried to shut it down,

50
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.100
it would look really fucking bad.
They can't go that far

51
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.291
though.
It's,

52
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:56.790
it just shows you that the world is really just these odd shades of gray.

53
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.130
It's not really black and white because obviously Putin is

54
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.570
<v 1>a dictator.</v>

55
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.230
I mean there can be no doubt at a certain point after a certain amount of Sass

56
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:10.231
nations and certain amount of taking oligarchs money and throwing them into jail

57
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.400
and all the crazy shit that guy's done.

58
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.560
He's essentially some sort of a new dictator,
a new style of dictator,

59
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.190
and yet Russia today reported on some real shit and then gave you a lot of

60
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:30.040
freedom to report on real shit,
which is weird.
You know,
it's,

61
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.390
it's,
it gets everybody in this strange predicament.
Like,
do I,

62
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.560
can I pay attention to Russia today?
Do I,
do I trust it?

63
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.470
<v 2>First of all,
Putin is not addicted dictator because he was elected,
but,
but,</v>

64
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.980
but here's what's weird is that he created this new position.

65
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.980
So you have [inaudible] Dev and then you have Putin basically reemerging,
right?

66
00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:54.140
It's like Bush coming back and just be like,
Yo,

67
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:56.570
I'm going to fucking just create this position and just come back into

68
00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:57.320
government.

69
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.850
So he did kind of create this caveat to come back in and have like a giant

70
00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:05.180
sphere of influence still.
But I mean he does have a huge,

71
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.130
but he has huge support there and I think in due part to this Cold War

72
00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:11.750
resurrection going on in the West,

73
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:15.620
so when you have Russia been bombarded with attacks constantly,

74
00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:18.800
it kind of reinforces that homeland feel to the people in Russia and they're

75
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:21.770
like,
fuck y'all.
You guys are just like constantly attacking us.

76
00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:25.750
So we're going to kind of maintain the strength here and really be
nationalistic.

77
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.260
So it's almost like helping Putin.

78
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.700
What I don't understand about the whole thing is that we're not looking at

79
00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:33.260
communism.
This is not the Cold War.

80
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:36.380
So I don't understand what the US is getting out of it.

81
00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:41.381
When you have like an oligarchies Anna Uber capitalist nation that's basically

82
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:42.890
in line economically.

83
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.520
What the U S I mean it's run by oligarchs just like the U S is,

84
00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:48.640
we're not talking about like communism versus capitalism anywhere.

85
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.770
So what are we getting out of it to kind of continue

86
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.690
to like create this dueling narrative?
Well,
I think first of all,

87
00:04:56.691 --> 00:04:59.750
people are nervous about Putin.
I mean he's,
he's uh,

88
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.360
when you look at him,
you know,

89
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.540
at least the image that's being betrayed through the media.

90
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.450
He's this very macho guy.

91
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.380
You see him with his shirt off riding horses and shit,
and you have a

92
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.320
<v 1>one guy who,
the guy recently,</v>

93
00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:18.350
they said Putin could be worth as much as $200 billion.

94
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.290
When you look at all the money that he's stolen,
all the,

95
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:23.930
the different people's money that he's taken,

96
00:05:23.931 --> 00:05:27.830
all these oligarchs that he throws in jail and takes their companies,

97
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.320
they think that it can be worth as much as 200 billion.

98
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.160
<v 2>But you know what people have said that about Hugo Chavez and Maduro too.</v>

99
00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:39.020
And they take all of the nationalized like assets into account.

100
00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:41.990
And they just say that Maduro owns like billions of dollars worth of wealth

101
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:43.900
because of the nationalization of products.

102
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:47.660
So I don't necessarily take that at face value and say that like Putin has,

103
00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:50.500
you know,
as a mass this giant wealth that he has.
I,

104
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.530
the problem with the propaganda wars is that you don't know what's fucking true.

105
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.940
Right.
Of course series investor Putin

106
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.850
<v 1>could be the world's richest man with 200 billion stolen,</v>

107
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.050
who's hermitage capital management,
I don't know,
Bill Prouder,

108
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:10.580
CEO of Hermitage capital management.
It's so,
so crazy.

109
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.140
Scroll down,
Jim,
you know.
Oh

110
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.040
Wow.

111
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.730
<v 2>Um,
yeah.
What I love about,</v>

112
00:06:20.731 --> 00:06:23.930
about the propaganda war though is that you have all these like establishment

113
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.940
journalists who will immediately say that Putin and he very Mel may well have

114
00:06:30.301 --> 00:06:33.030
killed that dude.
You know,
I don't know.
Um,

115
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.370
but to immediately come on the media and say that Putin is politically as hasn't

116
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:39.150
in all of these people in the street right in front of the Kremlin,

117
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.840
but then you can never ever question any sort of political assassinations that

118
00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:44.190
have taken place in this country.

119
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.400
So it's like a way to just project all of these issues when it comes to either a

120
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.730
false flag terrorism or political assassinations,

121
00:06:50.731 --> 00:06:53.730
or just suspicious deaths outwardly.
And then just say like,
well,

122
00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:56.910
that's fucking bad shit.
If you ever apply that to our political system here,

123
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.070
<v 1>well that would be sort of like if ran Paul was assassinated,</v>

124
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.900
if ran Paul was running against Putin or against Obama and was,

125
00:07:07.901 --> 00:07:11.330
it was like second term and he was,
uh,
you know,

126
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.860
campaigning and running against Obama and then was murdered in the street.

127
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.030
That would be what it would be more like.
It's,
it's,

128
00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:23.031
it's a lot more brutal and open than any of the political assassinations that

129
00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:28.020
may or may not have taken place under the United States.
Like,
what,

130
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.450
can you,

131
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.450
can you think of a similar political assassination that you could attribute to

132
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:37.480
the United States?
Like maybe Vince Foster,
which allegedly was an assassin.

133
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.510
<v 2>I mean,
all of the,
you know,
of course,
obviously other than the Kennedys,
Mlk,
um,</v>

134
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.500
which of course a court case found that the government was complicit in his

135
00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:51.150
assassination as well.
Uh,
Memphis,
Tennessee court,
um,
jury found that.

136
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.081
But yeah,

137
00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:56.640
I mean actually there was an embassy row bombing of a fucking just car bomb

138
00:07:56.641 --> 00:08:01.240
exploded and killed some leader and it came back to some complicity within the u

139
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:03.750
s government and another government working together.
So their husband,

140
00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:08.310
shit like that happened.
But yeah,
I mean,
nothing just as overt of a,
you know,

141
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.630
that guy being just often

142
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.390
<v 1>that guy,</v>

143
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:16.390
that guy was a very vocal supporter and he thought that his fame would protect

144
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:21.470
him.
That was,
that was what he thought.
[inaudible] that didn't work.
No,
no.

145
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.210
<v 2>I don't know what the fuck is going on there,
man.
It's so,
it's so,
you know,</v>

146
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.020
it's hard.
It's a,
and this is when people would give me shit all the time.

147
00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:31.990
Why aren't you talking about Russia every day?
And it's like,
look,

148
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.560
it's extremely hard to talk about any country that you don't understand fully.

149
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.210
I never been there.
And also you're looking at a country that,
you know,
uh,

150
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.510
the Soviet Union collapsed not that long ago and they're figuring shit out.

151
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.560
And so it's kind of,

152
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:50.110
it's kind of like our moral and position on the Middle East and being like,

153
00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:52.300
you guys are so barbaric and why aren't you,

154
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:55.380
why haven't you evolved to where we are?
And it's like,
well,
first of all,

155
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:58.800
there's so many different factors playing into that on a completely different

156
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:01.620
political evolution.
So it's just like,
just hold,

157
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.250
hold your fucking like judgment for a second and try to understand how these

158
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.980
countries are the way they are.
Of course you can,
yeah,

159
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.320
you can call it like criminal activity in other countries,

160
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:14.520
but it just seems like people have a lot of shit to say without really

161
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:19.340
understanding all of these different dynamics that go into global affairs.
Yeah.

162
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.363
Putting myself,

163
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.580
<v 3>yeah.
I don't understand Russia at all.
All right.
It's,</v>

164
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:25.540
it's a fascinating place though.
It's,

165
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.560
it's interesting to think that when we were kids,
when I was kid,
um,

166
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.890
we were always worried about going to war with Russia.

167
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.380
That was the big fear that was hanging over everyone's head.

168
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.920
It was like people really would go to sleep at night,

169
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:40.290
terrified of potential nuclear war,

170
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.750
and we will use thought we were one incident away.

171
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.200
And then for a long time it went away.
You know,

172
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:51.201
when the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia became this new sort of much more

173
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:56.370
peaceful place,
it was,
it seemed like there was never gonna happen again.

174
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.230
And now it's all ramping up again.

175
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:03.150
And now they just sold missiles to Russia or to,
um,
uh,
ran.
Rather,

176
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.760
it was a,
in the news in the last couple of weeks,

177
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:07.950
they lifted their embargo of selling

178
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.281
<v 2>scares me.</v>

179
00:10:09.281 --> 00:10:13.510
Is there a two proxy wars going on right now between the U S in Russia,
Ukraine,

180
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.160
and Syria?
I mean,
that is happening.
That is real.
And now,
um,
you know,

181
00:10:18.161 --> 00:10:19.150
we have Ukraine,

182
00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:22.930
obviously the u s is openly endorsing and funding the Ukrainian government with

183
00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:26.020
lethal aid.
And then you have Russia army and these rebels there.

184
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.050
So basically the US and Russia are fighting a war in Ukraine.

185
00:10:29.051 --> 00:10:32.750
And then you have the Assad factor where Russia is funding Assad.

186
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.640
And then you have the u s openly funding these fucking jihadist Islamic

187
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.010
terrorist essentially on the ground in Syria.

188
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.100
That scares me because the war's already happening.

189
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.870
It's just through different mediums.

190
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.210
<v 3>Jesus,
I know.
So you were working for Russia today.
First of all,</v>

191
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:50.230
how'd you get that Gig?

192
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.880
How does one get a Gig and like working for Russia today and was there any

193
00:10:54.881 --> 00:10:56.020
hesitation on your part?

194
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.070
<v 2>So I w I came from antiwar activism and long story short,</v>

195
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:04.520
realize that media was really the platform that we need to be fighting because I

196
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:07.820
saw both parties selling the Iraq war and I was like,
what the fuck is going on?

197
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.810
So then going back to Oakland and the police stayed just showed up in my

198
00:11:11.811 --> 00:11:13.490
backyard.
Once occupy Oakland happened,

199
00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:16.880
there was like seven police helicopters flying around the city at all times.

200
00:11:16.881 --> 00:11:18.590
There was tens of thousands.

201
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:23.591
It felt like storm troopers to respond to like 80 hippies camping out in a park.

202
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.550
So I was like,
this is fucking crazy.

203
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.410
And then Russia today was the only like legitimate news organization covering

204
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:32.900
the occupy movement.
So during that time,

205
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:37.460
the mainstream media was ridiculing occupies so hard and I just kept seeing

206
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.530
videos pop up of like Russia today,

207
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:41.780
this little like a Russian with the green logo.
And I was like,

208
00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:44.510
what is this network?
Why is it the only one covering occupy?

209
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.000
I didn't really give a shit though because I was just like,

210
00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:50.360
this is great that this network is covering it.
I don't know why,

211
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.380
but that's amazing.

212
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.710
So I became kind of the liaison in Oakland for our t and d DC in New York and

213
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:59.470
Moscow.
And I was just like kind of conveying what I was seeing.

214
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:02.890
And a lot of my videos went viral from my website media routes that I was

215
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:06.130
covering,
you know,
the police raids and them tear gassing people.

216
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:08.560
One of my videos helped Scott Olson when his court case,

217
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.100
the guy who got shot with the tear gas canisters face like in pointblank range.

218
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.533
Anyway,
um,

219
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.020
so our t just really liked the videos that I was doing and asked me to come

220
00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:20.970
there for an interview.
And,
um,
I just said,
there's no way I want to move to DC.

221
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.460
That sounds horrible,
but I just couldn't,
I couldn't pass up the opportunity.

222
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:27.850
And they said that they wanted me to have a show and just do exactly what I was

223
00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:30.940
doing and just rant,
um,
and,

224
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.470
and have an international platform to do so.
But the only hesitation that I had,

225
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:35.651
I mean,

226
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:38.680
I talked to someone who initially interviewed me for our tea and I asked her,

227
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:39.970
why do you work here?
Like,

228
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:44.140
why is Russia today covering things that activists care about?
Like what is,

229
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.120
what is going on here?
And she was like,
look,

230
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:48.400
if I have to work for the Russian government to tell the truth about what's

231
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:49.570
happening in my country,

232
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.590
that's what I'm going to do because we have to get the information out there.

233
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.160
At that time,
the Cold War,

234
00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.200
Russia was not in the news like militarily or like this crazy cold war relic,

235
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.690
renaissance and resurrection in terms of like propaganda wars.

236
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.020
So at that time I was like,
that's great.
And I mean,

237
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.170
the editorial freedom that our t gives is completely unmatched.

238
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:13.900
And of course people are going to lovey that,

239
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.290
that gross generalization that everything on the networks propaganda.

240
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:20.920
The problem is everything's propaganda.
Every fucking thing is propaganda.

241
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:26.310
Tell me one media source that is not used in some way to push a viewpoint or a

242
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:31.390
bias.
Everyone has bias.
There is no such thing as like a new trouty.
You know,

243
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:33.910
everyone comes with an opinion,
everyone comes with a bias.

244
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:36.490
And I'd rather know the bias,
which is Russia today.

245
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.750
You may not get the truth about Russia from going to Russia and watching Russia

246
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:41.470
today,

247
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.560
but you will get the fucking truth about the u s government and you will get the

248
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:46.930
truth about corporations because it's state funded.

249
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:49.840
So you can talk about those things without worrying about advertisers and

250
00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:53.920
sponsorship.
So I always tell people,
navigate around the bias.
No,

251
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.760
I'm not going to tell people that there is no bias.
That's fucking stupid.

252
00:13:57.761 --> 00:14:00.880
Of course there is,
it's Russia today.
It's fun by the Russian government.

253
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.100
So there's a lot of factors that go into that.

254
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:06.400
But I'd much rather know the bias blatantly in front of my face than not know

255
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:09.610
the tens of thousands of like special interests and conflicts of interests going

256
00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:14.611
into the entire corporate media apparatus and all these other agencies.

257
00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:14.891
I mean,

258
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:18.850
and that's even scarier because you have people on those channels that had been

259
00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:22.540
fired for criticizing the u s government and it's not even state funded media.

260
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.070
That's just corporate media.

261
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.850
<v 1>The other thing about what you were doing that I thought was really interesting</v>

262
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:31.050
was you,
you weren't like easily definable.
You know,

263
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.200
there's liberals and there's conservatives and they're on television and they,

264
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.310
they kind of stick to a narrative because that makes it,

265
00:14:40.311 --> 00:14:43.480
it makes their career more definable.
Like who they are.
You know,

266
00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:47.200
if you look at like the best examples are the really ridiculous Republican guys

267
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:51.260
like the Hannity guys.
Like they're,
they're,
they're putting on a show like that.

268
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.100
The bill

269
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.430
<v 3>O'Reilly's.
Those guys are putting on a show,
whether they realize it or not.</v>

270
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:56.264
Like you could,

271
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.290
you will know their opinions like long in advance before you ever hear it from

272
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:02.930
their mouth because you know what they're going to be.
It's,
it's real simple.

273
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:05.660
Cut and dry.
There's going to be no surprise.
There's just no subtlety,

274
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:06.590
there's no nuance,

275
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.880
there's no consideration of all the objective facts that go into all these

276
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:14.390
different things and objective reasoning.
There's none of that.

277
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:16.970
It's just this is a Republican,
this is a democrat.

278
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:20.750
This is Alan Colmes and he's going to argue with this guy because this guy is

279
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:23.850
Joe Scarborough and he's a no nonsense Republican in Pharma

280
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.080
<v 2>and who has a dead intern that has not explained what happened.
Joe Scarborough,</v>

281
00:15:29.081 --> 00:15:33.010
who used to be like a congressmen and one day the is intern was just found dead

282
00:15:33.011 --> 00:15:37.050
in his office.
What?
Yeah,
and he was like having an affair with her.
I don't know.

283
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.870
No fucking gun every time and was having an affair with her.

284
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.220
That's what they say.
And everyday that's that fucking day.
Nice Day.

285
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.120
They say the experts say that,
Joe.
See what you can find Jamie.
Yeah,

286
00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:50.830
I find that check.
Cause every time Joe Scarborough,

287
00:15:50.831 --> 00:15:53.230
we'll like tweet something out.
All those group responses are like,

288
00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:57.220
what about your dead internship?
Or like no one has let him live it down.
Oh,

289
00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.660
so when did this take place?
2001.
Okay,
so as long time ago.
Yeah.

290
00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:06.620
But 14 years.
And now do you know that Lori?
Yeah.
This was um,

291
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.930
co anchor,
whatever on that show.
Morning Joe is Brazinski his daughter.

292
00:16:10.931 --> 00:16:15.310
Did you know that is a big new Brzezinski's daughter who,
who's presents g?
Um,

293
00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:17.150
he is like a,
uh,

294
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:21.700
an oligarch like Neil liberal strategist who wrote a book called the Grand Chess

295
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.180
Board.
It's like this giant like overlooking policy base.
I mean,

296
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.620
Obama's read his book,
it's a,

297
00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:30.220
he's very influential global leader in terms of like policy making in foreign

298
00:16:30.221 --> 00:16:31.360
policy and um,

299
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.990
he's kind of like an over seer of a lot of political ideology and thought that

300
00:16:37.391 --> 00:16:40.540
has been applied.
Um,
Brzezinski's daughter.

301
00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:43.210
It just shows you the incestual nature of the whole core of media that you have.

302
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:43.781
Like,
you know,

303
00:16:43.781 --> 00:16:48.781
Andrea Mitchell and all these people have really close connections to the

304
00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:51.070
political establishment and very high places.

305
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.230
<v 3>The Gary Condit thing,
everybody knew about,
everybody heard about that,</v>

306
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.540
that that scandal,
the Shandra Levy,
she disappeared,

307
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:03.480
she found was turned up,
murdered and he was never charged.

308
00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:07.400
And it was all very creepy.
I never heard a word of this.
Oh,

309
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.920
so she's 28 years old.
They,
she was dead.
She's from den.

310
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.690
No foul play or any outward indication of suicide.
Well,

311
00:17:15.691 --> 00:17:16.830
what does that mean?
Right.

312
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.390
<v 2>She uses found on the ground and I said that she hit her head on the desk and</v>

313
00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:24.050
just died.
It makes no sense.
Really,
really mean

314
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:29.110
<v 3>how convenient she was found slumped next to a desk and the floor of the</v>

315
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.810
Republican congressman Joe Scarborough's,

316
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.620
Fort Walton Beach Office where laureate serves consultant services.

317
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.270
So how do they know that?
June.

318
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.820
Is there any evidence at all that they had an affair?

319
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.760
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

320
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.140
<v 3>Or is it just bullshit talk or just talk rather it's just talk.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Well,</v>

321
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.720
what they should they say?
Yeah.

322
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.100
Well it's just

323
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.510
<v 0>crazy.
Yeah.
It's just weird,
right?
I mean,
who just dies at 28 with like,
no,</v>

324
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.390
I mean,
what a bummer.
What happened that she have on one or two.
It's also when,

325
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.410
when someone does die like that,

326
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:06.470
it's all like how does the person who is guilty or accused rather,

327
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.750
how do they react?
You know,

328
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:13.590
are they bummed out that that person's gone or they immediately like,

329
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.350
like it wasn't mood tell you one thing.

330
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.190
Definitely wasn't me feeling how Joe reacted that day.

331
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.630
This is very strange.
It is.
I didn't know that it is,

332
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.130
but I think that when you're looking at rt,
um,

333
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.640
and I wasn't easily definable because my whole angle was coming outside of party

334
00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:38.490
lines cause I'm so disgusted with both parties.

335
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:41.670
And I think that that's why people are so disillusioned because they,

336
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.140
they're watching the media and they just think that there's just two camps,

337
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:47.760
two parties that you know,

338
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:52.380
and it's bullshit and both are perpetuating really disastrous policies on a

339
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.120
domestic and foreign policy front.

340
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.110
They're indistinguishable when it comes to war.
So we'll look at this,

341
00:18:58.111 --> 00:18:59.840
look at this.
They found such a medical

342
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.570
<v 3>examinator.
The medical examiner,
Dr. Michael Burke Land,</v>

343
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:07.250
said she had a past medical history that was significant,

344
00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:09.650
but it remains to be seen whether that played a role in her death.

345
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.280
Soon after a member of the immediate family reached out,
uh,

346
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.940
rejected out of hand that Lori had any significant medical problems.

347
00:19:16.941 --> 00:19:17.570
She wasn't fat,

348
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:22.570
quite an athlete having recently run an eight k and a very respectable time and

349
00:19:22.671 --> 00:19:26.750
she belonged to the northwest Florida track club as a result of the mandatory

350
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.380
autopsy.
However,
it was deemed inconclusive.

351
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.230
Docker Burke land ordered more specific toxicology tests.

352
00:19:33.231 --> 00:19:36.740
The results were expected by the middle of the following week and the first or

353
00:19:36.741 --> 00:19:37.580
second day of August.

354
00:19:37.581 --> 00:19:42.170
Docker Berkland commented on the time this turns over several puzzle pieces in

355
00:19:42.171 --> 00:19:44.900
the case of her death and reveals more of the picture.

356
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.670
Now listen to this Berkland.

357
00:19:46.671 --> 00:19:50.420
It turns out as a very interesting background himself recently relocated to

358
00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:51.770
Florida as a matter of public record.

359
00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:54.430
The Dr. Perkins Medical License in the State of Mississippi,

360
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:59.590
Missouri was revoked in 1998 as a result of Berkland reporting false information

361
00:20:00.081 --> 00:20:05.060
regarding a brain tissue sample.
And in 1996 autopsy report,

362
00:20:05.061 --> 00:20:08.870
Brooklyn does not deny the charges is also a matter of public record.

363
00:20:08.871 --> 00:20:12.260
He was suspended from his position as medical examiner in the state of Florida

364
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.690
in July of 1999.

365
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.730
<v 0>Yeah,
motherfucker.</v>

366
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.880
And look at down below it says basically that she would have never killed

367
00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:23.770
herself.
I'm sorry.
Was it a suicide or not?

368
00:20:23.771 --> 00:20:26.500
Like I thought that they rolled it out.
Well,
what is going on?

369
00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:31.180
She's as close as Lori died as a result of a blow to the head because of an

370
00:20:31.181 --> 00:20:34.330
undiagnosed heart condition caused her to collapse and fall.

371
00:20:34.331 --> 00:20:37.120
That's what I'm saying.
Hitting her head on the desk.
It sounds very sketchy.

372
00:20:37.121 --> 00:20:40.010
It's super hard to kill somebody by hitting their head in the dusk.
Uh,

373
00:20:40.011 --> 00:20:45.011
you got a really fucking whack your head like it can happen,

374
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.280
boy,
but it's not likely.
It's if you fall

375
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.870
<v 1>and just bang your head off the dust.
That's where your skulls for your skulls.</v>

376
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.700
We can't hear you when you talk.
You're not on a microphone.

377
00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.070
Abby's friends get a little excited here.
Um,
she falls,
hits her head,

378
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.000
dies this shady fucking medical examiner.

379
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.690
The whole thing is weird,
isn't it?
Or someone needs to look into that.

380
00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:11.830
So cold files,
those TV shows,
they bust everybody.
Yeah.
Need to look into that.

381
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:14.770
But there's not much you could do after.
Right after all this time.

382
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.860
You know when you're talking about like 14 years later.
Yeah.

383
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:22.390
It's still sketch though.
Well,
do you ever look into the,
um,
Vince foster?

384
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.430
I read a book,
the strange death of Vince foster hall.

385
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:31.960
That was the guy that was involved in,
what was it called?
Whitewater was the,
um,

386
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.650
the Clinton scandal.
The real estate's gambled.
The Clintons were involved in,

387
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:39.760
he had some knowledge of that.
He was found key,
committed suicide,

388
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.670
but he still had the gun in his hand,
which never happens.

389
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:46.080
The gun goes flying out of everyone's hand.
When you shoot yourself brown,

390
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.550
you know,
the gun was fine.
He still had the gun in his hand.

391
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.830
There was a lot of blood missing from his body.

392
00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:53.040
But almost none of the seat in the crime.
They're there,

393
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.890
almost absolutely convinced that his body was moved and that somehow or another

394
00:21:56.891 --> 00:22:00.730
he was moved to the spot where they found him,
but yet that was it.

395
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:05.230
Guy Killed himself,
shot himself in the head.
Here's the gun.
We're good.

396
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.960
That's insane,
man.
Yeah.

397
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:12.970
I seen if you're one of those cats that's willing to send people to war and you

398
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:16.000
have to be to be a president,
almost every single PR,
I guess,

399
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:20.830
let's say every single president responsible for someone's death,
even even,

400
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.630
you know,
think of like the most,

401
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.210
I guess Jimmy Carter would be the most peaceful guy.

402
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.870
He had to be responsible for someone dying,
right?
Yeah.

403
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.250
Gerald Ford had to be responsible for someone dying.
Reagan for sure.

404
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.820
They're all diverse spot.
I guess it's not that hard or just fucking,

405
00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:39.970
this guy is going to sing and he's going to fuck up everything and he's going to

406
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:43.370
ruin America.
Let's just stack 'em out.
Well,

407
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.190
<v 2>perfect example of this is the anthrax attacks.</v>

408
00:22:46.191 --> 00:22:50.840
Have you heard what the fuck is going on with this?
No.
Oh my God,
man.

409
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.370
All right.
Um,
so first of all,
when the anthrax letter,
you know,

410
00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.930
like one will happen,
right?
I just don't know.
So right after nine 11,

411
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.990
the nation was in a complete like traumatized state of hysteria and fear,

412
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:09.170
right?
So literally like weeks later,
I think it was like October,

413
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.630
maybe even late to Denver,
I think it was October though,

414
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.940
the first anthrax letters were sent in the mail.
Um,
and they were,

415
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.450
they said like a death to America,
death to Israel,
like on these letters.

416
00:23:20.451 --> 00:23:24.800
And they were sent oddly enough to like Tom Daschel and other like people who

417
00:23:24.801 --> 00:23:26.930
were opposed to the Patriot Act at the time.

418
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.750
And also it killed a five postal workers.

419
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.400
It got sent to like reporters and Congressmen's office and by postal workers

420
00:23:34.401 --> 00:23:37.550
ended up dying.
Um,
some of them were fake.

421
00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.900
Basically what came out after Cheney and Rumsfeld and all these assholes when

422
00:23:41.901 --> 00:23:46.580
all of the media and touch started tying anthrax to Saddam immediately and

423
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:48.920
immediately saying that it was all Islamic terrorism.

424
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.910
Weeks later it came out that it wasn't Islamic terrorism.

425
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.750
After you know if Colin Powell hand holding up the vial of anthrax at the UN,

426
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.380
like using all of this to connect to Saddam Hussein saying that there was like

427
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:03.350
anthrax labs there and you have Judith Miller,

428
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.220
the New York Times basically printing like all this bullshit about anthrax and

429
00:24:07.221 --> 00:24:10.040
bioterror coming from Iraq all at the same time.

430
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.170
Then it comes out that it would came,

431
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.950
it was a high grade like anthrax strain,

432
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:20.951
the Ames strain that came from a US bioweapons lab within our own country,

433
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:23.150
within our own government facilities.

434
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.600
Then they blame this guy called Steven Hatfill for years.

435
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.990
They blame this guy who worked with in the lab and it was like case closed.

436
00:24:32.991 --> 00:24:35.000
They basically ruined this guy's fucking life.
They'd,

437
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.240
they made him a person of interest multiple times.

438
00:24:38.241 --> 00:24:40.340
John Ashcroft came out there and he said,
this is a person of interest.

439
00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:44.470
They never said what evidence they had against him years later after everyone

440
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.990
like just thinks that it's this guy.
It comes out that it's not this guy.

441
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:51.470
He had to settle with the u s government taxpayer funded settlement of like,

442
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.131
I don't know,

443
00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:57.131
like $6 million for being falsely accused as the anthrax perpetrator for years

444
00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:00.080
and years.
You know,
they're stalking this guy.

445
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:04.250
They're like threatening his family,
searching through his garbage,
makes him,

446
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.520
you know,
ruins his life essentially.
And uh,

447
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.780
and then next they blame this other guy named Bruce Ivan's.

448
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.670
Once again,
he had like,
there is no actual evidence that this guy did it.

449
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.240
So Bruce Ivins was just another guy who worked within it.

450
00:25:19.241 --> 00:25:23.120
He was like a specialist and anthrax and they tried to pin it on him,

451
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.820
tried to threaten his hospitalized daughter,

452
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:30.260
briber searched as trash,
like stalked him for months and months.

453
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:34.940
And he was like,
um,
he was a toxicologist as well.
He ended up dying,

454
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.870
committing suicide by taking an overdose of Tylenol,

455
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.300
which is actually a really insane,
horrible way to die.

456
00:25:41.301 --> 00:25:43.820
And it would toxify your liver to take like three days to die.

457
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.110
And that would be really awful for someone who is a toxicologist and like knows

458
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.910
how to kill yourself quickly.

459
00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:54.140
Why would you kill yourself that way and then so that was the case close.
Right,

460
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:58.550
so so here we are with no actual proof that Bruce Evans really did the antiques.

461
00:25:58.551 --> 00:26:01.640
All of his coworkers are like,
he didn't do it.
There is no proof.

462
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.460
He would never have done this.
He was helping the government.

463
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.440
The investigation here you have fast forward a couple of years.

464
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.590
The FBI agent in charge of the anthrax case,

465
00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:11.030
this just came out a couple of weeks ago.

466
00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:13.820
The FBI agent is now suing the government.

467
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.830
He's suing the FBI because he's saying you purposefully hid evidence that proved

468
00:26:18.831 --> 00:26:20.750
that Bruce Ivins was not the perpetrator.

469
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.870
There's exculpatory evidence that shows that he was not,

470
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.510
I am assuming you guys are fucking up the investigation.

471
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:31.660
You put all these like low level interns to run this investigation and it was

472
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.490
totally botched from the get go.
Obama administration shut this down.

473
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:40.910
He shut down the case.
He said they didn't want to reopen the anthrax case.
Okay.

474
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.250
Best case scenario on the attacks

475
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.130
<v 0>is that there's still a bio weapons terrorists running around free.</v>

476
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.570
That's the best case scenario.

477
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.490
Worst case scenario is that the government is complicit and either way the

478
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:57.300
government's complicit because they are not investigating who the actual

479
00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:01.350
perpetrators or wanting to find them.
So whoever did it is out there?
Yes.

480
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.920
Whoa.
Yep.
Yeah.
I have not looked into that at all.

481
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.530
It's almost like there's too much shit going on.

482
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.770
You can't pay attention to everything.
And if you do pay attention to it,

483
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:13.760
you can't keep paying attention to it's cause some new shit comes on.
Yeah.

484
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.090
But I mean this is huge.

485
00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:19.350
This is the u s government being complicit in a bio terror attack.

486
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.910
We went to a duck control syllable,

487
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.010
Duncan Trussell and I went to the Center for Disease Control in Galveston,

488
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.750
the big lab that they have where they keep all the anthrax and all the Bolo

489
00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:35.751
locked behind four foot thick concrete walls and bulletproof glass and everybody

490
00:27:36.001 --> 00:27:38.940
were space suits.
It's fucking creepy.

491
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.310
It's so creepy.

492
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.040
And they're working on this stuff and trying to find cures for it.

493
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:48.120
I did this episode of that,
a Siphon show I did where we talked about Webinars,

494
00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:51.060
web weaponized,
um,
diseases and viruses.

495
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:56.061
And I talked to a guy from the Soviet Union and talk to guys that used to run

496
00:27:57.181 --> 00:27:59.280
the weapons division of the Soviet Union,

497
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:04.260
the weaponized disease version.
And they,
um,

498
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:08.490
they were telling me they had trenches of anthrax,
like trenches.

499
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.140
They had enough anthrax to kill the entire country or they just had why exactly.

500
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.440
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
I don't understand it.
I mean,

501
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.320
I think during the Cold War when everything was really crazy,

502
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:20.970
I think there were just ramping it up.

503
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.150
Everybody was preparing for mutual self destruction.

504
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:28.230
I guess my biggest question about it is why,
why was there no,

505
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:30.480
like if the government had nothing to do with it,

506
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.060
why botched the investigation so hard?

507
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.670
Why hide evidence to just try to pin it on this guy?

508
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.210
Why was the Bush administration and press people on Cipro,

509
00:28:39.211 --> 00:28:41.010
which is like a really,
um,

510
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.450
intense antibiotic for anthrax strain before the attacks even happen?

511
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:50.550
They were,
yeah.
And why give it to them?
Exactly.
Exactly.

512
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.010
These are all questions that I have that I've never been addressed.

513
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.730
And also why would the letters be sent to people who are opposing the Patriot

514
00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:01.020
Act and also why would they frame Muslims in the letters like nothing about it

515
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:04.720
makes any sense at all.
Very strange.
Men Cherry strange.

516
00:29:04.721 --> 00:29:09.300
John Ashcroft was a,
and still is a co Reebie motherfucker.

517
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.080
All of them are,

518
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.600
somebody sent me an a vinyl album of a John Ashcroft was,

519
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:19.910
Ashcroft was in some sort of a religious band when they were singing religious

520
00:29:21.721 --> 00:29:26.520
music,
like some Christian band back in the day.
Yeah.
And He,
um,

521
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:29.970
he had a song.
Did you ever see the lift?
The Eagles soar?
Oh my God.

522
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:34.230
If you ever see it,
watch it,
watch it.
Let's watch it.

523
00:29:34.231 --> 00:29:39.231
It's the idea that this maniac somehow or another got into office,

524
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:42.100
if you'd never seen it,
if you've seen the guy saying the bank of America

525
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.550
<v 4>Song Guy was like super psyched to work for Bank of America,</v>

526
00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:50.380
ever seen the Bank of America zone.
It's equally maybe more creepy.
Um,
but the,

527
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:54.760
the Ashcroft least the Bank of American guys just working at a bank and Loves

528
00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:58.150
Bank of America in some strange way.
It was.
Remember when John,

529
00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:01.870
I've come to hid the titties and the Lady Justice Purple Drape.
Yeah,

530
00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:06.730
he was a fucking cool.
Haley Bob comment style.
Like the cult,
the Purple Velvet.

531
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.700
So bizarre man.
Let's hear it.
Let's hear them.

532
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:15.850
We've heard Karl Rove wrapping right.
Um,
MC row when I'm what?

533
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.270
Yeah,
it's super weird.
Really?
Yeah.
No,
both of them.

534
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:24.310
Let's go and Ashcroft first.
Karl Rove wrapped.

535
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.930
It's disgusting pig on stage.
Just running around.

536
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:37.200
Do we have the video?
We need to see this.
Uh,

537
00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.210
Ooh.

538
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:46.210
I get some like pharmaceutical
think tank.

539
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:51.250
Oh my God.
She's cried a bit or what?
We put her through.

540
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.710
Let him do this.
I didn't realize that he actually sang this night.

541
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.150
Oh yeah.
Guards suite for you.

542
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.730
Was the dance.

543
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:06.580
The watch fires of a nation torn by.
Whoa.

544
00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.360
That we started.
She's far too young to die

545
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.320
in her eyes.
She's not yet begun to fly.

546
00:31:17.321 --> 00:31:20.690
It's time to let the my is five minutes long.

547
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.270
So bad too.
It seems like he must've wrote it right.

548
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.010
<v 5>Oh.</v>

549
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.310
<v 4>Oh,
horrible.</v>

550
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:35.780
She's never saw before.

551
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.030
<v 1>How was she different parody or no,
no,
no.</v>

552
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.630
I want to know how her soaring this time was different than our other soaring.

553
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.100
How can she saw like she's never saw it before.
It's fucking soaring.
Okay Dude.

554
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.050
It's not like complex math.
She's just flying around.
She's a fucking bird.
I mean,

555
00:31:52.051 --> 00:31:53.430
what is she doing so different?

556
00:31:53.431 --> 00:31:57.630
You fuck let her sore like she's never sword before.
What did she do?

557
00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:58.710
She getting crazy.

558
00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.640
She's flying down like a two inches above the ground and the backup to the sky

559
00:32:02.641 --> 00:32:05.790
and then down again.
She's sewing like she's never saw it before.

560
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.200
This bitch is crazy.

561
00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:08.983
<v 4>Geez,</v>

562
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.270
that's a mentally ill person,
right?
That's what that is.

563
00:32:14.271 --> 00:32:18.230
That's a person who has a mental illness.
First of all,
he's socially retarded.

564
00:32:18.231 --> 00:32:21.110
He doesn't realize that this is a ridiculous thing that he's doing.

565
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:25.340
He doesn't realize how awful it is in terms of like the artistic value of his

566
00:32:25.341 --> 00:32:30.140
work.
Unbelievably bad music.
And he's a fucking creep.

567
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.070
Wrapping it up all those things together.
God Damn.

568
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.740
So here's Carl Robb wrapping.
What is this?

569
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.220
This is radio

570
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.330
<v 6>tells you the correspondent dinner that everyone goes to and it's like a giant</v>

571
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:47.610
circle jerk.
Okay.

572
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.340
We just want to ask you some questions about,
uh,

573
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.940
w w people want to ask me question

574
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:56.803
under oath.

575
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:02.090
What do you like to do for fun when you're not working?
Besides fuck dude.

576
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.360
Skin babies have any hobbies like to go home in a gray only the non alcoholic

577
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.540
[inaudible] hollow Shank
here.

578
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.520
The tops off small animals X.
Yeah.

579
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.280
So better when they're topless and aren't thinking that what he said.

580
00:33:21.281 --> 00:33:24.290
Tear the tops off.
Small animals.
[inaudible] heads off.

581
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.880
The thing is he's not joking the lambs,
isn't it?
This is like,
okay,

582
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.720
but you actually have any hobbies that you can,

583
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:37.910
I readily admit that I'm a practicing philatelist.
Oh,

584
00:33:37.911 --> 00:33:42.440
practicing philatelist I do with stamps.
God,

585
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:46.960
I hope it stamps.
Goodness is so awkward in my mind.

586
00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.910
Wasn't stamps.
It was a duty area.
Probably sound like douchebag journalists.

587
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.330
Whose life anyways?
What's that?
Or two guys from WHO's line?
Oh really?

588
00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.750
Oh yeah.
Remember the letters or?
Yup.

589
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.680
Wow.
You might want to try the booze.
Hey.

590
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:14.670
Hey.
Okay.
Here it goes.

591
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:18.500
Well they brought a black guy on stage for this.
What the fuck?

592
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:27.430
Wait.
See road is a heads off.
Well,
that's true,

593
00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.620
but he's not a about animal cruelty.
He's a man.

594
00:34:32.621 --> 00:34:36.900
He's a treasure troll.
But tell me,
what is your name?
I'm at zero.

595
00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:42.070
That's right.
It can't be beat because he's so head to his feet,

596
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.610
but he will wrap it when you give him a chance,
look at him.

597
00:34:45.611 --> 00:34:50.350
Move doing a rapid data.
That's true.
Peace.
It paints in resident.

598
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.100
He is the sidekick to the president.
Tow it.

599
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.640
This is just the comedian though,
right?
This is not even,
yeah.

600
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.300
I had a weird memory of him actually rapping.
I guess.
Maybe it does later.

601
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:04.810
He's so hideous.

602
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.460
They're really getting into it.
We get them dancing.

603
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:20.130
Tell me the black guy does not want any part of this.

604
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:22.610
Look at him.
He's like barely moving.

605
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.710
Totally made him come up there just because I know he realizes why he's up
there.

606
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:31.640
He's like,
I know why they brought me up here.
These fucks.
It's not Wayne Brady,

607
00:35:31.641 --> 00:35:34.580
is it Wayne Brady was on who's line?
Is it anywhere?

608
00:35:34.581 --> 00:35:38.040
But the contrast is not so good.
I hate to be racist,
but

609
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.170
<v 1>we can't tell if it's Wayne Britain.
No,
it's not.
Wayne Brady.</v>

610
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:45.170
How many Chins does Karl Rove?
Well,
it's just one sloping hold.

611
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.550
The skin cancerous tumor like Chan.

612
00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.770
So painful.
Yeah.
Well he only rove,
right?
Yeah.

613
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.553
Wow.

614
00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.570
<v 2>Sorry to push
those Preston,
or is a strange,</v>

615
00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.760
those are really weird.
It's like the antithesis of what journalists should,

616
00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:07.870
should be doing,
you know,
going in and like,
I don't even know,

617
00:36:07.871 --> 00:36:10.120
just going into honoring politicians and,

618
00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.910
and schmoozing with them and rubbing elbows with them.
It just strange

619
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.800
<v 1>the get co opted,
right?
No.
Yeah.
Well they must like,</v>

620
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:20.060
I remember when Dennis Miller said that he wouldn't make jokes about George Bush

621
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:24.850
and he's all,
she's my friend,
he gets a pass,
like,
gets a pass.
Like,
hi,

622
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.220
you're a fucking comic,
right?
Yeah.
And your comic,
and he's the president.

623
00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.220
You got to,
you can't goof on them at all.
Well,

624
00:36:31.221 --> 00:36:34.580
it's just like when Ed Eddie Murphy said he wasn't gonna make fun of Bill Cosby.

625
00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.930
Well,
I think he just didn't want to do a sketch,

626
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.120
which is kind of understandable if you're Eddie Murphy,
especially because,

627
00:36:44.121 --> 00:36:48.770
uh,
he's fucking,
he's,
he's talking about it while he's got his foot pushing,

628
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.990
pushing against his own closet,
you know,

629
00:36:50.991 --> 00:36:54.830
trying to keep that pitch shot was skeleton fingers are poking at him.

630
00:36:54.831 --> 00:36:58.890
And that's true.
I mean,
he's a guy who's been arrested with transvestites.
Right.

631
00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.820
Maybe you might want to shut the fuck up about a scandal.
You know,
I'm here.

632
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:07.510
It just doesn't seem like a smart thing to do.
If you've got it,

633
00:37:07.511 --> 00:37:09.980
a little dirt that you're trying to cover up your own self,

634
00:37:09.981 --> 00:37:11.500
you might want to shut the fuck up.
Right.

635
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:16.890
The causeway thing was a very dark one though.
It just keeps it going.
Um,

636
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:21.880
I've worked at this place that told me that Cosby,
uh,
wanted to,
first of all,

637
00:37:21.881 --> 00:37:23.780
they wanted people to watch him eat.

638
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:29.060
He wanted people to sit and watch him eat and he wanted the security guard to

639
00:37:29.061 --> 00:37:32.540
tuck him into bed at night.
Like the security,
no,

640
00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:36.890
not security guard at the casino.
They wanted him to tuck him into bed at night.

641
00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:41.610
Like he has all these like bizarre demands that he wants people to do.
They,

642
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.500
they said that he was very strange.
They said he was very strange.

643
00:37:45.501 --> 00:37:49.670
Like you got this weird feeling around him.
Like you never really,

644
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.010
there was no real connection with him.

645
00:37:52.011 --> 00:37:57.011
It was entirely about you being in the presence of bill Cosby and a bunch of

646
00:37:57.261 --> 00:38:01.700
stuff that you had to do in order to make Cosby happy.
And then,
you know,

647
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.830
he would leave and everybody would go like,
whoa.

648
00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.140
<v 2>Maybe about is that he could've fucked all these women,
I'm sure.
But he instead,</v>

649
00:38:08.141 --> 00:38:10.390
he wanted to rape that lifeless bodies.

650
00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:14.430
He wanted to rape like a dead body alleged that's allegedly,
sorry.
Rather than,

651
00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.600
you know,
when it goes,
when it comes to be 30 women,

652
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.280
when it's a hundred and then we could say,

653
00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.230
you want to hear a really creepy story about Cosby.
So he interviewed this guy,

654
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.290
or this woman from AP,

655
00:38:23.291 --> 00:38:26.500
interviewed him years ago before Hannibal Burress resurrected,

656
00:38:26.501 --> 00:38:28.150
the serial rapist shit.

657
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.530
And the woman said he was super condescending and crazy and fucking nuts cause

658
00:38:32.531 --> 00:38:36.610
he's bill Cosby and he thinks he's God and after the interview was over he was

659
00:38:36.611 --> 00:38:37.444
like,
um,

660
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.750
I'm going to send you fruit to let you know what I thought of the interview.

661
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:43.520
He told this woman and she was like,
all right you fucking Weirdo.

662
00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:44.440
Like just forgot about it.

663
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:49.710
So a couple of weeks later a AP AP gets a box for this woman.

664
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:53.920
Like he sent this to a news organization and it was directed to her and she

665
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:57.850
opened the box and it was just a dead dried up apple and it said like,

666
00:38:57.851 --> 00:39:00.220
this is what I thought of the interview.
They'll Cosby

667
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:05.610
<v 1>whoa.
What did she ask him about that was so upsetting and often,</v>

668
00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.430
no,
she probably just didn't treat him with reverence exactly like the king,

669
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.310
<v 2>but also think about how long it takes to get an apple that's rotted.</v>

670
00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:16.050
He must've like sent an intern out and he was like,

671
00:39:16.051 --> 00:39:17.940
go dig in the dumpster and find me a rotten apple.

672
00:39:17.941 --> 00:39:19.310
That should take like months to Rod.

673
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.200
You can put an APP on your fridge for like six months and I won't,
rod

674
00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:27.280
<v 1>does a really good point.
Like he is fine mafia shit.
Yeah.</v>

675
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.410
Instead of [inaudible].

676
00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.600
I think that those guys that were around a long time ago like that,

677
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:39.660
those guys were like today almost anything you do get scrutinized and gets

678
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:45.601
criticized by not just the press but like say if you are a bill Cosby type

679
00:39:45.611 --> 00:39:50.410
character,
like say like,
like Kevin Hart who's a huge famous comedian.

680
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.250
If he did a bunch of really creepy shit or set a bunch of really creepy shit,

681
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:56.230
people could talk about it on social media and they would,

682
00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.300
it would start chitter chatter when you start get,

683
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.870
but back then you could kind of get away with doing anything and then the

684
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:06.290
publicist would just hush it up.
So I,
you know,
I don't,

685
00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:09.250
I'm certainly not exonerating him.
I'm not making excuses for him,

686
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:14.610
but I wonder what the climate was like when he was famous in the 60s and the 70s

687
00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:20.140
and the eighties like he was a giant,
huge fucking superstar.

688
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:24.310
And I wonder like how much enabling was going on,

689
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.110
how many people just would cover up for anything that happened and Ray Donovan,

690
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:29.980
like,
you know,

691
00:40:29.981 --> 00:40:34.981
just go in and sweep up all your problems and if you're a creepy old guy that's

692
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:39.850
just not connected at all to regular people.
Yes.
I'm a regular person.

693
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:40.710
Like Richard Pryor and

694
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.310
<v 2>him were like the two most famous black comedians in the first famous black</v>

695
00:40:44.311 --> 00:40:48.360
comedians in the world.
And he was,
he was a god at that time.

696
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.020
And definitely I think there's a conspiracy of silence and Hollywood when you

697
00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:54.150
look at things like Jimmy Savile from the BBC,

698
00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:58.590
he was just like straight up raping little little shelter and he was like

699
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:03.120
visiting hospitals.
He was like fucking ordained by the royal family to be like,

700
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:06.930
you know,
a lord or whatever.
And he's just treated like royalty.

701
00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:10.350
And then you have Jian Ghomeshi in um,
the CBC in Canada,
the,

702
00:41:10.351 --> 00:41:14.490
the radio host of queue.
Just like punch women randomly.
Yeah.

703
00:41:14.491 --> 00:41:16.110
What does that guy's deal?
He would,

704
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.730
he would say that it was like bondage or play a Sam.
Yeah.
So this is,
this is,

705
00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:24.300
I'm super fascinated with this because it just goes back to how these things are

706
00:41:24.301 --> 00:41:26.910
able to happen for so long and why they're covered up.

707
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.960
And Jian Ghomeshi is a really interesting case cause he's like this,
you know,

708
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.700
attractive like kind of hipster looking guy who was like,

709
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:39.140
had like rape culture debates and like,
it's like a feminist and you know,

710
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:43.130
and like puts himself off as like,
this guy really cares about women's issues.

711
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.430
Super sensitive dude.
So then,

712
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:50.030
so then it came out that he just like would coerce these women who he met at

713
00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:53.000
book events and like makes them feel special of course.
And then they,

714
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.390
he would go on a date with them and randomly just punch them in the face,

715
00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.550
fucking sock him in the face.

716
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.350
Or like he would just like be hooking up with someone and then just like rape

717
00:42:03.351 --> 00:42:06.140
them with his hand,
like rat,
like,
and they'd just be like,
what the fuck?

718
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.120
Like start strangling them,

719
00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.130
<v 1>just like rape them</v>

720
00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.493
and

721
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:18.270
has this bear that he would turn around and be like,
my bear,

722
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.600
<v 2>you can't see this.
What?
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
Many women had the same story.</v>

723
00:42:22.601 --> 00:42:24.850
Like he would have this stuffed animal bear and be like,
this,

724
00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.180
my little bear can't see me.
Like why so far?

725
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.650
What if the bear had a camera on her or something?
Yeah,
dude,
it's all sick.

726
00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.340
And that's the thing is how did no one know this?
And the thing is they did,

727
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:40.300
you're telling me that people at BBC didn't know that Jimmy Savile was like,

728
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.390
why were they bringing all these little kids and like,
you know what I mean?

729
00:42:43.391 --> 00:42:45.930
It's just like,
don't tell me that you didn't know it was going on

730
00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:48.640
<v 1>Dusky case,
the Sandusky case where,</v>

731
00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:52.510
I mean everyone kind of knew that guy was a child rapist.

732
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.020
Everyone knew it was just this weird thing where no one was saying anything.

733
00:42:56.021 --> 00:42:57.610
Everybody wanted to keep their job.

734
00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:01.430
And he had reached this prominent position of power where it was almost,

735
00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.880
you know,
no one knew what exactly to do.

736
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.760
That's fucking crazy because that guy is just a coach.

737
00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:11.800
Did someone see him raping?
And then they're like,
oh,
I didn't see that one.

738
00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:16.540
Yeah,
no,
he,
he reported it.
And I don't know exactly what happened,

739
00:43:16.541 --> 00:43:20.200
but that's where the whole paternal Joe paternal thing,

740
00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:25.570
and it's so awfully,
we're,
Joe Paterno was like a god in that state.

741
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.380
I mean,
he was the man at Penn state and when it all went down,

742
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:34.060
Joe Paternal got sick like really quickly afterwards and then died of cancer.

743
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:39.280
He was dead within two years.
He was dead quick after that.

744
00:43:39.281 --> 00:43:39.461
I mean,

745
00:43:39.461 --> 00:43:44.461
it must have been devastating to him as a person to realize like how horribly he

746
00:43:44.681 --> 00:43:49.681
had fucked up and let this monster be amongst him for so long and not doing

747
00:43:51.481 --> 00:43:53.290
anything about it.
Just full

748
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.900
<v 2>pay that bill Cosby's alive to see these women and coming out because I really</v>

749
00:43:56.901 --> 00:44:01.370
do believe that he raped them.
And,
um,
I think it's great that,
you know,

750
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.710
unlike Jimmy Savile who's just dead and like no one,
you know,

751
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.340
he was just glorified until they died and then it comes out after that he's a

752
00:44:07.341 --> 00:44:08.180
fucking pedophile.

753
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:08.820
<v 1>Well,</v>

754
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.870
the Savile thing is very strange too because there's this thing going on right

755
00:44:12.871 --> 00:44:17.871
now in the UK where they're investigating all of these royals and these all

756
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.920
these politicians,

757
00:44:19.921 --> 00:44:24.840
all these people that are involved in child pornography and child rape and

758
00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:28.740
you're aware of all this stuff,
like what exactly is going on with that?

759
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.980
I don't know enough to really lay

760
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.341
<v 0>it down,</v>

761
00:44:32.341 --> 00:44:37.341
but there is a lot of weird sex ring like child pornography and stuff going on

762
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:41.220
with with British royalty and also politicians.

763
00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:45.480
It's really strange and I haven't really dug into it and Clinton's tied to it.

764
00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.453
That was different.

765
00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.450
One that was on Clinton was tied to this other guy needed spent time at this

766
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:54.390
guy's compound.
Yeah,
yeah.

767
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:59.420
This guy was getting child prostitutes and like underage prostitutes.

768
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:05.460
Fuck Man Sane.
It just shows you like this.
All this,

769
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.250
this culture of suppression,

770
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:13.251
like did John Ashcroft's the world Livie goes like that.

771
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:16.740
All that is like you're creating the diamond.

772
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.780
You know you're creating something.
This,

773
00:45:18.781 --> 00:45:23.460
this weird culture of suppression that these people operate under by being this

774
00:45:23.461 --> 00:45:27.900
fake thing,
this operating politician,
this operating president,

775
00:45:27.901 --> 00:45:31.970
this operating game show host talk,
show,
host this,
you know,

776
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.840
whatever the thing is that you're pretending to be Joe Scarborough or all these

777
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:41.220
different characters.
[inaudible]
murderer.
Yeah,
they're not themselves.
Bill Cosby.

778
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.470
Bill Cosby,
who was always Mr Clean.

779
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:47.130
My is that famous bit that Eddie Murphy did about bill Cosby calling him up and

780
00:45:47.131 --> 00:45:50.280
tell him to stop swearing and Richard Price and do the people laugh.

781
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.000
Do you get paid?
Tell bill to have a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up.

782
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:59.220
And that is a real incident there.
Those bill Cosby used to call comedians.

783
00:45:59.221 --> 00:46:02.640
He did it to Chris Rock.
He would tell them to steal your pants up.

784
00:46:02.641 --> 00:46:07.140
Black people come on,
stop.
Right?
Yeah.
Just stop raping people and,

785
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:09.510
and drugging them too.
Don't even drug them.

786
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.940
Don't rape a more dry either or I'd still drug them and I'll just jerk off on

787
00:46:13.941 --> 00:46:18.880
them.
No,
that's still kinda read fucking asshole said Dude.
What?

788
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.320
It's also what kind of a person jets,

789
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:27.410
what kind of a person sees a naked person like completely and just can do that

790
00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:31.780
can just what?
Necrophilia fuck.
I don't know man.

791
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:36.270
What the fuck man,
that's so crazy about it.

792
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.160
I would love to have somebody took bill Cosby and gave him like Ibogaine or

793
00:46:41.161 --> 00:46:44.670
some,
you know,
some sort of psychedelic and made him talk about it.

794
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.440
I've always said that if someone actually wants to do like functional terrorism,

795
00:46:49.441 --> 00:46:53.550
they should just dose the punch bowl at the White House correspondence dinner

796
00:46:53.551 --> 00:46:58.140
with acid.
I mean that would be like a really good strategy if you were to,

797
00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:02.470
if you wanted to fuck with the establishment,
Dorsey,
Matt,

798
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:06.520
than I would ever to suggesting that even it's just a theoretical theoretical

799
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.530
lived in a different dimension and the same human beings existed in that

800
00:47:10.531 --> 00:47:15.360
dimension.
It'd be interesting to see what would take place.
Then again,
here's DC,

801
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:17.670
which overwhelmingly passed marijuana legalization.

802
00:47:17.671 --> 00:47:21.030
So why is everyone such douche still if everyone smokes weed?

803
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.470
I guess the people though,
that's not the politician.

804
00:47:23.471 --> 00:47:27.210
So how about this fucking Chris Christie,
fuck this fat slob.
What happened.

805
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:30.040
He said that if he becomes president will actively

806
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.330
<v 1>go after all the states that have legalized marijuana and he would put a stop to</v>

807
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:38.470
it and he cites something about the east side,

808
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:40.870
some nonsense about addiction addiction,

809
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:44.620
which is what difference does addiction mean if no one's dying,
you dumb ass.

810
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:48.790
Like you know what?
People die from being fat as fuck.
Right?
Okay.

811
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:50.140
Your fat as fuck.
Right?

812
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:55.200
300,000 people die in this country as a direct result of obesity every year.

813
00:47:56.290 --> 00:48:00.880
It's like right below cigarettes and this guy is talking about,

814
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:05.010
I mean you want to talk about the kettle calling the pot black like,
dude,

815
00:48:05.011 --> 00:48:06.400
look at yourself.

816
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.060
You are a walking poster boy for American excess.

817
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.530
People that are starving in other countries can look upon you when you are a

818
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:16.420
symbol of American greed,

819
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.980
crackdown and not permit legal marijuana is present.
Well guess what fucker?

820
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:24.640
That's why you'll never be president when you guys are shy and percentage of

821
00:48:24.641 --> 00:48:27.310
America that believes in personal freedom,

822
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.090
especially when it comes to something as innocuous as marijuana.

823
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.720
When you can die from fucking Tylenol.
Like you just said,

824
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:38.500
you can be a Goddamn toxicologist and die from Tylenol.

825
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:41.080
No one's ever died from pot.
A lot of people,

826
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.680
these people are just going against the current,

827
00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:46.540
the gay marriage thing and marijuana.
It's like,
dude,

828
00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:49.870
you guys are fighting a losing battle.
Like what are you doing?

829
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.480
This is not where the fight needs to be.
Dude,

830
00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:57.190
look up Jared Polis and the d a,
I forget her name,

831
00:48:57.191 --> 00:48:59.980
but it is one of the best clips I've ever seen because it shows you how you've

832
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:02.440
seen that,
right?
Where she's just like,
yeah,
he's like as crack,

833
00:49:02.441 --> 00:49:06.880
more damaging than marijuana.
And she's like,
yeah,
this is amazing.

834
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:08.490
<v 7>Okay.</v>

835
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:12.510
<v 6>Yeah,
play this or a person than marijuana.</v>

836
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:14.600
<v 7>Okay.</v>

837
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.060
<v 6>I believe all alone,
all over on our bed.</v>

838
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:22.480
Is Methamphetamine worse for somebody's health and marijuana?

839
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:28.300
I don't think any illegal drugs.
Heroin,
a worse,
uh,

840
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:30.190
for someone's health and marijuana

841
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.433
<v 7>again.</v>

842
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:37.450
<v 6>Oh No,
I don't know.
You don't know.
Uh,
you can look this up.</v>

843
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:40.480
You should know this is the chief administrator for the Drug Enforcement Agency.

844
00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:41.980
I'm asking you a very straight forward question.

845
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.430
Is heroin worse for someone's health than marijuana?

846
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:50.980
All illegal drugs are are bad.
Unbelievable.

847
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:54.280
One causes an addiction.
Okay.
It causes,

848
00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.253
<v 1>okay.</v>

849
00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:01.060
You probably can send that hard to Michelle Leonhard Drug Enforcement

850
00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:03.730
Administration.
What you're

851
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:07.270
<v 6>telling me that administrator,
I think you're asking is the objective</v>

852
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.810
just looking at the science.
This is your,
what is it?
Schedule One.
Yup.

853
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.860
Layperson schedule one.
Right.
Some of the studies and aware of it,

854
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:18.850
I'm just asking you as an expert in the subject area is a heroine where

855
00:50:18.851 --> 00:50:21.190
someone's helping write expert in the subject area.

856
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.940
I man's me as a police officer and oh wow.
Yay.
Agent.

857
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.070
That these drugs are illegal because

858
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.090
<v 3>they are dangerous because they are addictive because it seems like she's stoned</v>

859
00:50:32.091 --> 00:50:35.120
on like pose right now.
Probably a little Xanax.

860
00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:41.070
Just deal with the grilling come Jolie's the properties of heroin.

861
00:50:41.301 --> 00:50:44.600
Yes.
More addictive.
Yes.
Methamphetamine.
More addictive than marijuana.

862
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.210
<v 7>Well,
both.</v>

863
00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.113
<v 3>They're addictive.</v>

864
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:49.970
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

865
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.970
<v 3>What is is that's not true?
No.
Are highly addictive than marijuana.</v>

866
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.490
See the thing that she can,
because then she can't justify the classification.

867
00:50:58.491 --> 00:51:01.610
I mean,
yeah,
so she has,
yeah,
she's stuck.

868
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.380
The marijuana is no more addictive than playing video games.
I mean,
it's,
it's,

869
00:51:06.381 --> 00:51:10.700
it's an addiction in terms of your,
you decide that you needed in your life,

870
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:13.110
just like kick a person can be addictive.
Right.

871
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:16.040
But it says no physical properties that are addicted unless you have some really

872
00:51:16.041 --> 00:51:19.100
weird biology,
but did some very rare person,

873
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:22.370
like the type of person that would be allergic to sunflowers.
Yeah.
You know,

874
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:24.830
there's,
there's weird things out there biologically,

875
00:51:24.831 --> 00:51:29.831
but the average person that just shows you this is a criminal organization

876
00:51:30.081 --> 00:51:33.980
that's in charge of pretending to be looking after the people,

877
00:51:33.981 --> 00:51:38.720
but really just in Joe in charge of keeping things as usual,

878
00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:41.810
just keeping policy as usual moving forward the same way.

879
00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:43.760
And that's what that woman's doing.
Yeah.
Even the DOJ,

880
00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:45.140
it's not even just Chris Christie.

881
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:48.980
The DOJ has basically gone rogue and said that there's still going to prosecute

882
00:51:48.981 --> 00:51:52.850
individual marijuana users and you're like,
dude,
what are you talking about?

883
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.560
In states that have legalized it?

884
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:57.080
Like they're actually saying that they're going to overstep state law.

885
00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:02.110
I don't understand why people are focusing on something that makes life better,

886
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:04.120
but well,
because they get pressure,
right?

887
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.690
They get pressure from three big factions.
One prison guard unions,

888
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:12.890
a privatized prisons and Pharma of pharmaceutical companies.

889
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.920
Those are three big pressure organizations that prison guards and and per

890
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:22.580
private prisons,
there's a lot of money involved in keeping people in jail.

891
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:23.181
There's a,

892
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:26.420
they have a vested interest in continuing to rest the same amount of people or

893
00:52:26.421 --> 00:52:29.510
more people every year because whenever you make a business,

894
00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:34.460
businesses don't like to stay static.
They like growth.
They like more business.

895
00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:37.880
And when you have a business that's for profit,
like a prison business,

896
00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:42.740
their business like what they're involved in is locking people in jail.

897
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.920
They would like to lock more people in jail.
That's how they make more money.

898
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.570
You know?
Um,
fucking chocolate bars,

899
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.160
Hershey selling chocolate bars.

900
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.410
They don't want to sell the same amount of chocolate bars next year.

901
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.150
They want to sell more.
They want to look,

902
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:59.360
we've got a new ad campaign to get people involved with chocolate.

903
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:00.770
We've got some new chocolates.

904
00:53:00.771 --> 00:53:03.830
We got a little chocolate guy that waves to ya and he's going to get you to buy

905
00:53:03.831 --> 00:53:06.950
more chocolate.
You know,
that's what businesses do.

906
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:11.120
That's the natural function of a capitalistic business.

907
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:14.480
You want to make more money every year.
Well,
guess what?

908
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:18.530
That's the same thing when it comes to the industry of locking people up for

909
00:53:18.531 --> 00:53:20.390
drugs.
They want to keep locking people up.

910
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.850
If they made x amount of money this year,

911
00:53:22.851 --> 00:53:26.010
they want to make wine next year and that's just what they do.
It's just,
it's

912
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.720
<v 0>a part of being a part of a business.</v>

913
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:31.080
No matter where your apple computer or whether you're fucking,

914
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:35.370
you sell legal paper or whether you,
whatever you sell,
you want to sell more.

915
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:37.990
Do you want to make more money?
That's the problem.
And I know that you're,

916
00:53:37.991 --> 00:53:40.200
you're going to disagree with this,
but that's the problem with capitalism.

917
00:53:40.201 --> 00:53:43.770
Is this planned obsolescence in order to make more money?
Like for example,

918
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:48.210
the fact that I'm going to disagree because I,
because you're all about you.

919
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:52.230
I've heard you talk about,
um,
how,
you know,
capitalism encourages competition,

920
00:53:52.231 --> 00:53:53.820
which it does,
but at the same time,

921
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:58.350
if it encouraged sustainability and competitive advantages in terms of like how

922
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:01.440
to be sustainable,
which it does not,
that's the problem.

923
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:06.770
I just wish that people gave a shit about making things like harmonious with how

924
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:10.410
the earth functions instead of just like sucking up all this shit and just,

925
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.770
I completely name with you,
but saying it does not,

926
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:16.710
is he's looking at it in a very blanket way.

927
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.550
Capitalism is just the way we do business,

928
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:23.910
but you can certainly have ethical capitalism.

929
00:54:23.911 --> 00:54:28.911
Capitalism doesn't have to be pushed to the nth degree to where all out profit

930
00:54:29.131 --> 00:54:31.620
is the only motivation at the expense of the environment,

931
00:54:31.621 --> 00:54:34.740
of the expense of the people,
the expensive laws.
It doesn't have to be that way.

932
00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:35.670
I don't believe that.

933
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:39.390
I think that we've decided has to be that way because of this competitive nature

934
00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:44.070
that people have where they put the number of the score above and beyond

935
00:54:44.071 --> 00:54:44.731
everything else.

936
00:54:44.731 --> 00:54:49.140
But it doesn't have to be that way and Marxism doesn't have to turn into the

937
00:54:49.141 --> 00:54:52.110
communism structures that we've seen,
you know,
fail.

938
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:56.340
I mean that's all philosophical.
It's like people who say that voluntaryism is,

939
00:54:56.350 --> 00:55:01.350
is the ideal society sounds great and conscious capitalism sounds great too,

940
00:55:01.351 --> 00:55:05.760
but I don't see how we can just turn it into a conscious functioning system that

941
00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:08.310
works with you.
Like planet people will demand it.

942
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:11.700
People have to demand it and they have to,
they have to vote with their dollars.

943
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.640
They have to demand only ethical companies.

944
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:19.530
They have to demand that they only support companies with their money that are

945
00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:23.040
involved in an ethical,
sustainable business.

946
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:26.640
And if you don't do that,
then we're not interested in spending money on you.

947
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.680
And how many people have to die,
like look at seat belts in cars.
I mean,
if,

948
00:55:30.681 --> 00:55:33.060
if Ralph Nader never tried to,

949
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.790
it never forced the government to actually make that a mandate.

950
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:39.180
How many tens of thousands more people would've died until the market quote

951
00:55:39.181 --> 00:55:40.170
unquote corrected itself,

952
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:42.810
where people force pressure and just didn't buy from the cards that weren't

953
00:55:42.811 --> 00:55:44.850
putting seatbelts in.
Well.
That's interesting.

954
00:55:44.851 --> 00:55:48.300
That's an interesting way to put it because motorcycles are still illegal.

955
00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:51.510
You know,
there's a lot of stuff that's legal that's way more dangerous.

956
00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:56.190
If you really think about all the activities that people were involved in where

957
00:55:56.191 --> 00:56:00.530
they voluntarily put themselves in harm's way.
Seatbelts,

958
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.670
I certainly use them.
I think they're important.
I think all safety measures,

959
00:56:05.671 --> 00:56:09.090
whether it's air bags or you know,
they should certainly be encouraged,

960
00:56:09.091 --> 00:56:14.091
but I think that people would have naturally lean towards them if they found out

961
00:56:14.341 --> 00:56:15.450
the other,
they were safer.

962
00:56:15.451 --> 00:56:20.451
I think the competition involved in creating cars that are more safe and that

963
00:56:20.641 --> 00:56:24.550
are provably more,
more safe for the passengers,

964
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:27.220
that that would have helped in the long run.

965
00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:31.900
Them sell more cars and it would have like encourage other companies to do the

966
00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:34.960
same thing,
then tons more people would've died.

967
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:39.140
You mean if Ralph Nader didn't step up as a consumer advocate?
No,
I'm not.

968
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:43.210
I'm not arguing against consumer advocacy.
I think what Ralph Nader's done,

969
00:56:43.211 --> 00:56:46.390
not just with seat belts,
were a lot of things.
It's like super important.

970
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:47.970
You have to have someone that's looking at,

971
00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.720
but that's also a different era back then.

972
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:54.010
A much less transparent error where the age of information hadn't really been

973
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:55.690
established like it is today.

974
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.050
But the problem with today is you have such a saturation of information and you

975
00:56:59.051 --> 00:57:02.680
have these multibillion dollar companies that aren't conscious capitalists,

976
00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:02.950
you know,

977
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:06.100
that are just all about the bottom line and maximizing that shit chasing,

978
00:57:06.101 --> 00:57:08.380
you know,
the,
the port,
you know,
in Bangladesh,
let's say,

979
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:11.470
just like chasing wherever the dollar's stronger and bigger for them.

980
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:13.360
They saturate the information,

981
00:57:13.361 --> 00:57:16.600
airwave so much to put out so much disinformation and propaganda that it makes

982
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:19.570
it way harder for people to sort through and understand what's an ethical

983
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:20.740
company,
what's a moral company.

984
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:25.060
And then also the monopolization of these industries makes it that much harder.

985
00:57:25.061 --> 00:57:28.930
Like let's say I,
Comcast is like the monolith that where I live.

986
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:32.230
Like I don't even have a fucking choice anymore.
Um,

987
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.240
so even though I hate Comcast,
it's like that's,

988
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:38.830
that's your only option because they've swallowed up all of the other options in

989
00:57:38.831 --> 00:57:41.050
the area.
And I think that that's another huge problem.

990
00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:45.940
So even though you might want to be a conscious consumer and buy from like

991
00:57:45.941 --> 00:57:48.180
ethical companies,
it's really fucking hard because everyone,

992
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:53.170
you can't be a big corporation and not have bloody hands somewhere.
No,

993
00:57:53.171 --> 00:57:55.120
I think there's,
there's certainly a point to that.

994
00:57:55.121 --> 00:58:00.121
I think the Internet is starting to dissolve a lot of these monopolies and I

995
00:58:00.641 --> 00:58:04.570
think things like Comcast controlling vast majorities of the,

996
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:09.340
you know the cable business and I think that's slowly going to get eaten up by

997
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:13.360
various Internet companies and you start seeing things like what does it HBO go

998
00:58:13.361 --> 00:58:15.880
that was called Hbo now,
Hbo go now.

999
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:21.400
All those things where you're seeing these traditional cable channels that are

1000
00:58:21.401 --> 00:58:23.200
now available on the Internet.

1001
00:58:23.201 --> 00:58:28.201
What Netflix is doing with all these Netflix now has all sorts of new programs

1002
00:58:28.661 --> 00:58:32.350
that they're creating themselves.
House of cards,
a bunch of different ones.

1003
00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.900
The jail one orange is the new black,

1004
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:39.880
there's like critically acclaimed shows they're creating in house and I think

1005
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:44.020
that having just a connection to the Internet is going to be the new cable and

1006
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:47.740
then it's going to be about monopolizing internet connections and how long are

1007
00:58:47.741 --> 00:58:50.830
people going to tolerate that?
I mean that's,
that's the real,

1008
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.390
the real portal right now I think is the Internet and I think that's the real

1009
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:58.150
porterfil portal for information as well.

1010
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:03.220
I think that all these cable companies that are producing new shows,

1011
00:59:03.221 --> 00:59:08.221
whether it's CNN or CNBC and like that antiquated format of delivering the news,

1012
00:59:08.381 --> 00:59:13.120
like that shit is not going to fly.
You're entering into a new age this age.

1013
00:59:13.121 --> 00:59:17.470
If people aren't going to tolerate this old school lead bullshit that you're

1014
00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:22.040
doing this weird wearing a tie,
talking like a robot,
like that stuff is

1015
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:22.873
<v 3>out the window.</v>

1016
00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:27.710
And I think the age of information that we're involved in right now,

1017
00:59:27.711 --> 00:59:29.510
all of us,
whether we realize it or not,

1018
00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:33.980
w this is like one of the craziest times in human history and people were aware

1019
00:59:33.981 --> 00:59:35.930
of more things than they've ever been before.

1020
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.660
And I think that the people that are involved,

1021
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:42.290
even in these corporations that are involved in these unethical activities and

1022
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:46.820
monopolization of resources and just control over foreign governments and all

1023
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:50.030
the different shit,
all that stuff is that's got,

1024
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:53.390
it's got a time to it.
It doesn't have much time left.

1025
00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:55.570
<v 2>Well,
every empire is going to fall.
Uh,</v>

1026
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.950
and especially when you have one is arrogant,
you know,
as ours,
it's,

1027
00:59:58.951 --> 01:00:01.210
it's just a matter of time before that happens.

1028
01:00:01.211 --> 01:00:05.510
So they gotta get their shit together and unless if we want to survive,
um,

1029
01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:07.630
and you look at what's going on right now.
I mean,

1030
01:00:07.631 --> 01:00:12.631
look at the political dynasties that might be running for President Jeb Bush and

1031
01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:16.740
Hillary Clinton.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Like running right,
right.

1032
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:18.190
They're both right now.
Rand Paul,

1033
01:00:18.191 --> 01:00:20.200
the guy who tried to get my press credentials stripped,

1034
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:22.820
why don't you try to get your press credentials to,
when I first moved to DC,

1035
01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:26.880
I confronted rand Paul with my friend Luke and um,
I had uh,

1036
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.770
we were going to a public press event.
We had passes,

1037
01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:33.550
I was in the halls of Congress and he just started walking toward me in the

1038
01:00:33.551 --> 01:00:34.810
hallway and I was like,
oh well shit,

1039
01:00:34.811 --> 01:00:37.030
let's ask Rand Paul the question right now since he's right here.

1040
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:40.960
So I asked him why endorsement Romney Cause Mitt Romney's is a psychotic

1041
01:00:40.961 --> 01:00:44.320
warmonger and that's the way you said it.
I said,

1042
01:00:44.321 --> 01:00:45.550
why didn't your endorsement Romney,

1043
01:00:45.551 --> 01:00:49.180
a lot of people who are followers of yours have questions because you know,

1044
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.910
he's the opposite of what you claim to be in terms of foreign ballsy.

1045
01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:54.970
And Rand Paul just put his head down and kept walking and that was it.

1046
01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:58.540
A week later the video goes viral and I walk into our t,

1047
01:00:58.541 --> 01:01:01.240
this is when I first moved to DC,
walked into our t and they were like,

1048
01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:03.700
why is the Capitol police threatening to come and arrest you?

1049
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.550
And Strip you of your press credentials.
And I was like,
I don't know.

1050
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.800
And they were like,
what did you do to Rand Paul there?

1051
01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:13.060
They're talking about charging you with harassment and stalking.
And I said,

1052
01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.790
have them come and arrest me.
This is great.
Film it.
I was like,

1053
01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.950
we're at a fucking TV station if ran.

1054
01:01:17.951 --> 01:01:21.340
Paul wants to arrest me for asking him a question.
That's fantastic.

1055
01:01:21.341 --> 01:01:24.100
Let's film it,
let's do it.
So it turned out to be all empty threats.

1056
01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:28.360
But the guy who runs the capitol like media center told me that he wanted me to

1057
01:01:28.361 --> 01:01:32.590
come in for a meeting and nothing was in writing because he knew like he knew

1058
01:01:32.591 --> 01:01:36.010
that it was all empty.
So I was really nervous.
I was like,
should I get a lawyer?

1059
01:01:36.011 --> 01:01:38.980
Like let's,
I was like,
let's come up with a story.
This is a huge story,

1060
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.610
but I'm so they were like,
no,
just see what he wants to say.

1061
01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:44.920
Like don't get a lawyer yet.
Go and meet this guy.

1062
01:01:44.921 --> 01:01:48.550
So I went and met this guy and like an interrogation room in the Capitol

1063
01:01:48.551 --> 01:01:52.120
building with all of the bureau chiefs of all of the major media organizations

1064
01:01:52.121 --> 01:01:55.120
in this room.
And I sit down with them and I was like,

1065
01:01:55.121 --> 01:01:58.630
what in the hell is going on?
Like why am I here but what is happening?

1066
01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:02.440
And the guy was like,
look,
how did you get in here?
Like how did,

1067
01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:05.440
how did you sneak Lucan and I was like,
we didn't sneak in.
We,

1068
01:02:05.441 --> 01:02:08.320
it was a public event,
we have press credentials.
And he was like,
look,

1069
01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:12.580
we have worked for decades to get the access that we do to these politicians.

1070
01:02:12.581 --> 01:02:13.001
And he was like,

1071
01:02:13.001 --> 01:02:16.000
we cannot have people like you coming in here and fucking up that access.

1072
01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:20.040
And so many words.
It was very like house of cards style shit

1073
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:21.540
<v 0>where they're basically saying,</v>

1074
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:25.620
we have worked to get this special access like this.

1075
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:29.130
And it's all like preordained,
you know,
it's all predetermined.

1076
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.030
You probably have everything vetted.
You go and they all know you,
you know,

1077
01:02:33.031 --> 01:02:35.100
and they don't want people coming up and fucking that up.

1078
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:38.490
So they don't want anybody asking real questions.

1079
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:43.790
They don't want anybody asking uncomfortable questions that would get these

1080
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:46.980
politicians to pull back and restrict access.

1081
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.690
So they're saying you're not playing the game.
That's what they say.

1082
01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:52.830
You don't know the game we've been,
we've said this game up for 20 years.

1083
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:58.110
Abby Martin fucker coming in here and ruining our thing by asking them real

1084
01:02:58.111 --> 01:02:59.780
questions.
It was great.

1085
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:03.350
Had questions that we've all been approved.
Right.

1086
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.670
Exact softball questions.
Wow.
Yeah,

1087
01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:10.110
it was a bizarre like [inaudible] wakening.
How'd you in that car?

1088
01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:11.940
How long did the conversation?
It was like,

1089
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:15.810
it was like a 30 minute conversation and after I left the office I like taped it

1090
01:03:15.811 --> 01:03:18.710
all on my phone cause I couldn't believe that it actually happened and I wanted,

1091
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.920
no,
it's on my old phone.
I think it's on my computer and I was just like,

1092
01:03:22.921 --> 01:03:27.030
this just happened because it just seems so fake.
And it ended with the guy,

1093
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:28.320
I think his name is Mike and he was like,

1094
01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:32.850
I'll let you know like what the final charges are going to be for you charges.

1095
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:37.520
And I was like asking a question.
We did exactly.
He didn't touch him.
No.

1096
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:41.710
So how the fuck could they charge you with anything?
It was totally insane.
And,

1097
01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.440
and,
and when I came up with this Guy Mike,
who exactly,
what is his name?

1098
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.470
I don't know his last name.
You fuckhead.

1099
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.090
But what's crazy is all the people who will defend rand Paul to me still cause

1100
01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:57.660
they like Ron Paul and look,
I voted for Ron Paul in 2008 I,
I like him.

1101
01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:02.880
I agreed with a lot of his stance on foreign policy and civil liberties and I

1102
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:06.660
just ran.
Paul is not his father.
Right.

1103
01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.520
Is it possible that he didn't,
I mean just given this particular circumstance,

1104
01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.240
is it possible that he didn't have anything to do with that and he just send it

1105
01:04:14.241 --> 01:04:14.971
directly from him?

1106
01:04:14.971 --> 01:04:19.440
I got that confirmed that he made the complaint and had them come after me.
Oh.

1107
01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:23.820
So he said,
I want you to strip their credentials or something along those lines.

1108
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.420
What a Dick.
Yeah,
brand you'd brand.
It's like,
dude,

1109
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:32.310
out of all people who rand really come on son is very strange,

1110
01:04:32.311 --> 01:04:35.350
but the Hillary Clinton thing is just so fucked up because you have a Bush and

1111
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:38.700
Clinton.
I got white people supported Obama.

1112
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.630
I don't understand how anyone can support Hillary.
I really don't.

1113
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.960
They're happy to have a chicken there and so next time or we just going to have

1114
01:04:45.961 --> 01:04:49.350
a gay person.
Yeah,
because this is bull Shavel gay people.

1115
01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:53.520
Then we can slide in evil gave me more super into war.
Is there any out there?

1116
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.970
There must be.
I mean is this just,

1117
01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:58.920
it has this just term turn into just pure symbolism.

1118
01:04:58.921 --> 01:05:02.070
So we're going to have the first black guy and then the woman and then a gay

1119
01:05:02.071 --> 01:05:05.040
person and then that's it.
Well then we'll have to go back to straight evil.

1120
01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:06.180
Right?
I don't know.

1121
01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:09.780
I mean it doesn't make any sense at all to have this system that we have in

1122
01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:14.130
place.
Right.
It doesn't make sense.
Any,
anyone who's a strict Democrat,

1123
01:05:14.131 --> 01:05:18.040
like I had a conversation once with a friend and he was talking about Democrats

1124
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.150
<v 3>versus Republicans in a,
in an electrician and he kept using the term we,</v>

1125
01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:25.010
you know,
we got to win this and we got to win that.
And I'm like,
wait,
wait,
wait.

1126
01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:28.270
I go,
you're,
you're talking like you're talking about the red sox man,
right?

1127
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:31.070
I mean you're talking about like getting ready for the world series.
Like you're,

1128
01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.630
you're talking like a team person.
These are politicians,
man.

1129
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:37.780
You know who they work for fucking corporations.
They don't work for you.

1130
01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.440
This is a dog and pony show and you're completely committed to it.

1131
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:44.170
We got to get rid of it.
We've got to get rid of that.

1132
01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:47.830
It's got to be who has the best ideas.
It came,
the,

1133
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:52.870
the party system has failed us for so long that we're just invested in having

1134
01:05:53.321 --> 01:05:57.670
the best version of this failed,
fucked up party governess.
I mean,

1135
01:05:57.671 --> 01:06:02.671
it's a terrible version of what could be the governing principles of the

1136
01:06:03.761 --> 01:06:05.100
greatest nation the world has ever known.

1137
01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.900
And I don't think any other country has this kind of absurd show,

1138
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.710
multibillion dollar show where it's like a Hollywood extravaganza,
you know,

1139
01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:15.100
and it gets worse every year and last year they spent over a billion dollars

1140
01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:19.690
each and I can they really country that has the same last terrain.
Yeah.
Sorry,

1141
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:26.170
I just can't and it is a complete facade and the fact that you need millions of

1142
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:29.680
dollars to even get on the ballot almost,
and maybe not millions,

1143
01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:32.050
but I mean you need a substantial amount of money to get even on the ballot in

1144
01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:33.880
every state.
And then to get into debates,

1145
01:06:33.881 --> 01:06:37.300
it's completely impossible because it's all run by like the oil and gas.

1146
01:06:37.301 --> 01:06:40.910
Like all these corporations fund the presidential debate systems on our

1147
01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:44.320
commission for presidential debates and privately funded institution.
You Go,

1148
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.210
yeah.
And so you can't get on it.

1149
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:49.390
Well they used to use to be able to get on it with a small percentage of the

1150
01:06:49.391 --> 01:06:53.170
popular vote in certain certain elections.
But you can't,

1151
01:06:53.171 --> 01:06:56.590
you can't do that anymore because of our good friend Ross Perot,

1152
01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:00.250
Ross Perot fuck things up back in the old days.
Because this guy,

1153
01:07:00.251 --> 01:07:04.030
if you guys aren't aware of Ross Perot or where you weren't alive back when this

1154
01:07:04.031 --> 01:07:04.864
was going on,

1155
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.890
it was a very unique moment in human history because this guy who was worth

1156
01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:12.850
billions of dollars just said,
fuck it.
I am.
This is pre-internet.

1157
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.373
Skye said,
fuck it.

1158
01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:19.380
I'm going to buy a half an hour of time on ABC during primetime or NBC.

1159
01:07:20.261 --> 01:07:21.490
I don't remember what network it was.

1160
01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.410
And I am going to show everyone what's fucked up about the tax system and show

1161
01:07:26.411 --> 01:07:28.840
everyone what's fucked up about the Federal Reserve.

1162
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.230
And I'm going to talk about what kind of changes I would make files president.

1163
01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.310
And everybody was like,
look at this guy.
And he was out.

1164
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:41.370
He was able to debate with these guys because during the primaries he had gotten

1165
01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:44.320
whatever number of the popular vote you were,

1166
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:46.720
you knew you needed to get in order to be involved.

1167
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:49.840
So they changed it and they jacked it up much higher.
Now,

1168
01:07:49.841 --> 01:07:50.920
I forget what the percentage is,

1169
01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:54.610
but it's virtually impossible for any third party candidate,
which is why,

1170
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:59.440
you know,
everybody looked at,
um,
at Ron Paul and saying,
well,

1171
01:07:59.441 --> 01:08:02.980
Ron Paul's is wild independent.
Ember actually he's a Republican,
right?
I mean,

1172
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.590
you call him a wild independent in terms of,

1173
01:08:05.591 --> 01:08:07.960
a lot of his ideas are very controversial and unique,

1174
01:08:07.961 --> 01:08:12.190
but he's not an independent,
he's Republican.
Because if he wasn't independent,

1175
01:08:12.191 --> 01:08:14.890
he would have never been in those fucking debates there.
There's no,

1176
01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.190
no independence

1177
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.220
<v 2>are ever going to get to that point where they're like,</v>

1178
01:08:19.221 --> 01:08:21.580
there's three candidates being considered for the,
the,

1179
01:08:21.581 --> 01:08:23.210
the number one position in the country.

1180
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:27.350
And one of them is completely untethered to the system.
It's not going to happen.

1181
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:31.490
And it's all like this political and intellectual bribery on so many levels

1182
01:08:31.491 --> 01:08:33.890
because first it goes to the supreme court.
I mean,

1183
01:08:33.891 --> 01:08:37.340
we're basically have a monarchy running this country that our supreme court

1184
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:41.200
justices have more power than like the fucking queen of England.
Um,

1185
01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:41.901
so they have the,

1186
01:08:41.901 --> 01:08:45.410
they're the final arbitrator on so many different things that are really life

1187
01:08:45.411 --> 01:08:49.220
and death shit here.
And they,
it's basically turned into like,
well,

1188
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.390
do you want like a crazy neo-con to pick the next Supreme Court justice?

1189
01:08:53.391 --> 01:08:54.890
And it's like,
that's what we've come down to.

1190
01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.740
Like that's what it's all degenerated it down to is just who's going to pick a

1191
01:08:57.741 --> 01:09:00.620
supreme court does,
is if someone dies,
I mean,
no fuck that.

1192
01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.980
I'm not going to capitulate my moral compass to vote for a war criminal Hillary

1193
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:06.410
Clinton as a war criminal.
I'm sorry.
And I,

1194
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:09.740
because she has voted for,
first of all,

1195
01:09:09.741 --> 01:09:14.150
let's just look at the Iraq war vote killed 2 million people in Iraq.

1196
01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.080
New figures just came out that said that 2 million people have died in Iraq and

1197
01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:21.140
Afghanistan since 2003 not even to mention the million.

1198
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:26.150
That'd be babies who died from sanctions in the 90s.
Aside from that,

1199
01:09:26.151 --> 01:09:30.560
Hillary Clinton,
uh,
Gaddafi,
Libya,
Syria,

1200
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:35.270
she wants to bomb me,
ran.
I mean she is the worst.
If Obama Room,

1201
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:38.990
you look at someone who did a report,
I think it was in the New York Times,

1202
01:09:38.991 --> 01:09:42.800
kind of an embedded report in the national security to cabinet.

1203
01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.290
And they said that she is on par,

1204
01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:49.040
if not worse than John Mccain of all of her war hawkish ideals in terms of

1205
01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:51.170
foreign policy.
It is scary shit man.

1206
01:09:51.171 --> 01:09:55.100
So as much as people want to pretend like she's like this liberal do gooder,

1207
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:58.820
I'm most concerned about any of imperialism militarism,

1208
01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:00.740
and you know us had Gemini,

1209
01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:04.430
so I'm not going to be voting for Hillary Clinton because she's a fucking woman.

1210
01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:08.390
I don't give a shit if someone's a woman,
if they're black,
if they're gay,

1211
01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:13.340
if they are perpetuating war crimes and killing innocent people.
I know.

1212
01:10:13.341 --> 01:10:14.180
Going back to what you said,

1213
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:16.670
it's hard to be a president and not have someone's death on your hands,

1214
01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:17.570
but fucking a,

1215
01:10:17.571 --> 01:10:22.180
you don't have to just sign up to kill millions of people on a fake war against

1216
01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:23.510
nonexistent threat.

1217
01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:28.610
I wonder what motivates someone like Hillary Clinton at this stage of gold

1218
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.930
money.
You should look at who funds her campaign.
It is unbelievable.

1219
01:10:32.931 --> 01:10:37.490
The Clinton Foundation,
dude,
check this out.
The Clinton Foundation,
not only,

1220
01:10:37.491 --> 01:10:41.150
you know,
like all these giant corporations and banks.

1221
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:46.730
The real creepy part is when you see Saudi and Gulf states actually giving her

1222
01:10:46.731 --> 01:10:50.420
tens of millions of dollars over the years.
That should is scary.

1223
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:54.980
Saudi Arabia basically as bribed so many politicians,
Harvard,
Oxford,

1224
01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:57.740
like all of these institutions to get Saudi money.

1225
01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:01.610
And then you start to understand the culture of silence around Saudi Arabia and

1226
01:11:01.611 --> 01:11:02.990
why we have this double standard,

1227
01:11:02.991 --> 01:11:07.040
this egregious double standard and the war on terror and this unholy partnership

1228
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.810
with this country.
Now we're bombing Yemen together,
bombing Yemen together,

1229
01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.850
Saudi Arabia and the US bombing the shit out of Yemen,

1230
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:19.770
the poorest country in the entire Arab world.
What,
what good is that going to do?

1231
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:24.000
How is that going to exacerbate the problems they're bombing the poorest country

1232
01:11:24.001 --> 01:11:25.860
in the Middle East?
What is the motivation?

1233
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:31.340
So Saudi Arabia doesn't want the Houthi rebels because they threatened Saudi

1234
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:38.210
Arabia.
So Saudi Arabia,
like back to cu,
um,

1235
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:41.730
and supported a puppet regime in Yemen a while back.

1236
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:44.700
And Yemen is just kind of a thorn in Saudi Arabia's side.

1237
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.100
What do we get out of bombing Yemen,
bribery,
political bribery,

1238
01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:54.630
and had Gemini and dom domination,
regional influence.
Um,
and,

1239
01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:55.980
and plus Saudi Arabia wants us to,

1240
01:11:55.981 --> 01:11:58.860
but when you look at the coalition that's actually bombing Yemen,

1241
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:00.720
it's like brutal,

1242
01:12:00.721 --> 01:12:05.721
oppressive monarchies and like genocidal dictators like Sudan dictator.

1243
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.220
And then you have like,
I think Egypt,

1244
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:13.170
Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and a couple other countries.
It's like,
wow,

1245
01:12:13.171 --> 01:12:18.060
great job.
Great job.
Why is the US supporting bombing Yemen?
And on a side note,

1246
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:22.310
the u s has been bombing Yemen with drones for years anyway.
Um,

1247
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:26.430
and then you keep hearing on the news that Iran is backing the Houthi rebels in

1248
01:12:26.431 --> 01:12:28.980
Yemen and that's why we need to go in and destroy them.

1249
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:32.520
But I talked to this guy who's like an expert and he's,

1250
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:34.500
and he's Saudi and he runs this institute.

1251
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:36.910
Everyone check out the podcast on media roots.
It's a really,

1252
01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.920
really mind blowing shit cause he just breaks down really what is happening on

1253
01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:42.060
the ground.
And he says,
look,

1254
01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:46.350
Iran is not backing who these any more than Saudi Arabia is backing isis.

1255
01:12:46.351 --> 01:12:50.280
Like all of these things have,
um,
influence and yeah,

1256
01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:53.160
the money's filtered down,
but it's such a double standard.

1257
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:56.640
If we're going to say Ron's backing who the rebels and we need to say that Isis

1258
01:12:56.641 --> 01:13:01.320
is funded by Saudi Arabians,
so as al Qaeda,
because for a large part it is,

1259
01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.150
that is the double standard.
And Saudi Arabia is a bizarre,

1260
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:10.830
it's bizarre and creepy.
It's unbelievably insane.

1261
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.040
Saudi Arabia is Orthodox,

1262
01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:18.480
like they are the worst interpretation of Islam that exists.
So Wahhabi Islam,

1263
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:22.380
it's the most Orthodox,
oppressive,

1264
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:26.160
bastardized version of Islam.
And they,

1265
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.750
we look at them and say like this is the only good Arab state.

1266
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.400
Like that is fucked because not only are you telling the rest of the world that

1267
01:13:35.401 --> 01:13:37.920
that version of Islam is somehow good,

1268
01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.500
but you're also making it seem like,
um,
yeah.
I mean it's just unbelievable.

1269
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:47.220
You should see what kind of rights women has in the country.
They can't exercise,

1270
01:13:47.221 --> 01:13:49.290
they can't play sports.

1271
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:52.660
You wouldn't be able to tell it cause their,

1272
01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:55.440
cause they're covered and they're not allowed to exercise.
Yeah.

1273
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:59.480
That's what this guy was telling me,
and I'm not allowed to fight back.
Well,

1274
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.960
first of all,
they their property.

1275
01:14:00.961 --> 01:14:04.970
So women can't do anything without a male master like approval of a males that

1276
01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.620
they can't go to school.
They can't go to work,
they can't drive.

1277
01:14:07.621 --> 01:14:11.890
They can't do a lot of things without having like a mail permit like permitting.

1278
01:14:11.891 --> 01:14:13.900
How many people live over there?
I don't know.

1279
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:17.860
They also do like public beheadings in the middle of freeways.

1280
01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:18.694
They'll be heading,

1281
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.450
they'll do public floggings of someone who simply criticized that king online.

1282
01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:26.470
They'll be head women for adultery,
sorcery.

1283
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:29.830
This is the shit that we're talking sorcery,
sorcery,

1284
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:35.330
<v 1>some checks.
Ken's cast a spell though.
You gotta be careful.</v>

1285
01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.680
Don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water.

1286
01:14:39.681 --> 01:14:43.820
There might be a little sorcery going on.
They got to put a stop to,
can't drive.

1287
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:47.450
Can't exercise.
Fuck that.
Escape either.

1288
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:50.750
<v 2>No.
Oh and,
and you know,
King Abdulla when he died,</v>

1289
01:14:50.751 --> 01:14:52.230
everyone was saying he was this great reformer.

1290
01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:57.260
The Pentagon even like did an essay contest honoring King Abdullah giving out

1291
01:14:57.651 --> 01:15:01.640
prizes for people.
Like that's how insanely twisted his whole scenario is.

1292
01:15:01.641 --> 01:15:04.190
Meanwhile,
of course,
the 28 pages movement that shows it,

1293
01:15:04.191 --> 01:15:08.650
Saudi Arabia was involved in nine 11.
We're actively carrying up that,
um,

1294
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.860
Bandar Bush was,

1295
01:15:09.861 --> 01:15:13.670
which was a Saudi in the Saudi government and they actually called him a Bush

1296
01:15:13.671 --> 01:15:18.350
because he was so close to the Bush administration and he,
I mean Bob Graham,

1297
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:21.530
Senator Bob Graham has come out and said,
why did Bandar Bush like,

1298
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:25.850
why are we protecting Saudis who were involved in the nine 11 attacks?
I mean,

1299
01:15:25.851 --> 01:15:30.410
straight up everyone asks yourself that.
If you can give me a good answer,

1300
01:15:30.411 --> 01:15:32.450
that would be great.
If it's not about political bribery,

1301
01:15:32.451 --> 01:15:33.650
what the fuck is it about?

1302
01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:37.370
If it's not about like paying off these politicians with tens of millions of

1303
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:38.060
dollars,
I don't know.

1304
01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.520
<v 1>What else could it be about if you really stopped them?
I don't know.</v>

1305
01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:45.980
What else could it be about except having an ally in quotes in the Middle East.

1306
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.083
What other

1307
01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:51.510
<v 2>worst ally to have if you really cared about stopping terrorism?</v>

1308
01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:55.460
Saudi Arabia is the biggest exporter of terror.
Hobby terrorism,

1309
01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:59.210
<v 1>our dairy.
What are you saying?
It's unbelievable.</v>

1310
01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:03.380
Ron Allies aren't clean bone.
Well,
yeah.
Yeah.
That is pretty fucked.

1311
01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:07.370
What I was getting when we would start us all off was I was trying to figure out

1312
01:16:07.371 --> 01:16:10.880
what would be the motivation of Hillary Clinton at this stage of her life.
Like,

1313
01:16:10.881 --> 01:16:12.350
well,
how much money does she need?

1314
01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.870
How much does she have and how much does she need?

1315
01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:19.430
Hillary's two point $5 billion.
I've obscene fundraising goal.

1316
01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:23.010
That's her goal in order to become president.
You were,

1317
01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:27.350
<v 2>I remember a,
um,
an article came out that said that her,
uh,</v>

1318
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:30.750
she had like a student discount on the speaking tours that she was giving and it

1319
01:16:30.751 --> 01:16:34.890
was like $250,000 was like a speaking fee at a university and that was the

1320
01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:35.300
student

1321
01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:39.260
<v 1>discount,
$250,000 to speak.
What is she going to say?</v>

1322
01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:42.590
What is she going to fucking say?
Well,
when bill got blown by Monica Lewinsky,

1323
01:16:42.591 --> 01:16:46.330
I was super bummed out.
We smoked a victory cigar too,

1324
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:50.120
but I knew that one day I want to be president and so I let it slide.

1325
01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.730
Yeah.
What?
Huh?

1326
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.970
<v 2>Hillary Clinton is the worst man.
She's the fucking worst.
And you know,
the whole,</v>

1327
01:16:56.971 --> 01:17:01.110
the whole Saudi Arabia thing really grinds my gears because it's,
you know,

1328
01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:06.111
here you have Saudi Arabia beheading people for sorcery x supporting terrorism

1329
01:17:06.181 --> 01:17:09.920
around the world.
And then you have Cuba,
which today,

1330
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:12.470
<v 3>you know for,
here we go.
56 years after the Cold War,</v>

1331
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:16.220
Cuba finally got removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list.
Yeah,

1332
01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:20.360
you bought a cheap cigars.
Now they're sweet state sponsors of terrorism.

1333
01:17:20.361 --> 01:17:21.230
That's what Cuba was,

1334
01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.520
was on for decades and decades for no fucking reason.

1335
01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:30.460
Not even North Korea is on the list.
Really Weird.

1336
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:36.190
We're so weird.
I just,
I just feel like we just seem to hang in there.

1337
01:17:36.191 --> 01:17:37.070
Hang in there too.

1338
01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:40.820
All this become so obscene and ridiculous that they're forced to change,

1339
01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:45.410
but probably not going to be in 2016 it's probably not going to be this.

1340
01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:46.490
Go around.
There's just no,

1341
01:17:46.491 --> 01:17:51.491
there's no good choice there between Jeb Bush who's just the creepiest and

1342
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:56.610
Hillary and then ran Paul,
who now I hate you rent.
It's,

1343
01:17:56.611 --> 01:18:00.260
it's,
it's really happy.
Even Bernie,
even Bernie Sanders,

1344
01:18:00.261 --> 01:18:04.640
you know it's bad when it's sitting congressman or senator had like comes out

1345
01:18:04.641 --> 01:18:06.920
and is like,
we need a massive political revolution,

1346
01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:11.030
like a massive grassroots revolution.
We certainly,

1347
01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:14.300
Congress will.
We certainly did it.
Amazing.
Yeah,

1348
01:18:14.301 --> 01:18:17.900
and these Chris Christie types who I think he realizes he'll never be president

1349
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.820
anyway,
which is one of the reasons why he's saying those things.

1350
01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:24.821
In order to keep the coalition or whatever he's established with whatever powers

1351
01:18:25.491 --> 01:18:28.100
that be that are trying to keep marijuana illegal in New Jersey.

1352
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:32.600
He's somehow or another in bed with those fucks and that's what he's doing.

1353
01:18:32.601 --> 01:18:34.170
He's serving them with that speech.

1354
01:18:34.171 --> 01:18:35.670
She doesn't really think he's going to be president.

1355
01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:40.370
He knows that the shit that he did by blocking the bridge and all of the various

1356
01:18:40.371 --> 01:18:44.720
scandals that he's involved with the bridge gate thing,
that was so ridiculous.

1357
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:48.410
He's just come back.
You know,
he's a New Jersey's come back and plus he's fat.

1358
01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.680
You can't be that fat and be president and people who grew your food shaming a

1359
01:18:51.681 --> 01:18:55.320
woman,
not fat being like in his position.
Hilarious.
That's hilarious.

1360
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:58.610
You can't look it if you're that obese,

1361
01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:00.860
it shows you have no respect for your body.

1362
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:05.720
I don't care what anybody says about metabolism and all this nonsense talk,
whoa,

1363
01:19:05.721 --> 01:19:10.460
motions,
stop,
stop.
You're a fucking grown adult.
If you want to be a leader,

1364
01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.420
you're a leader.

1365
01:19:11.690 --> 01:19:16.690
How can you be a leader when you have such poor respect for your very biology?

1366
01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.050
Your very body is all a wash in shitty food.

1367
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:26.120
You have made terrible choices with your diet and with how you present yourself.

1368
01:19:26.121 --> 01:19:31.121
You're presenting this disgusting Slob and Lee Lazy thing that you,

1369
01:19:31.581 --> 01:19:35.060
that's your meat wagon.
That's your what you're walking around in.
You know,

1370
01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:38.810
if you went over someone's house and there was stacks of old newspapers and cat

1371
01:19:38.811 --> 01:19:41.720
shit all over the floor,
you'd be like,
oh,
this person's a fucking nut.

1372
01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.370
That's the same thing when you see a morbidly obese person as suit that wants to

1373
01:19:46.371 --> 01:19:48.860
run America like you've got other problems.

1374
01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.860
Do you need to start eating vegetables?
You Fuck?

1375
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:55.550
You need to start drinking water or whatever you're doing to your body is not

1376
01:19:55.551 --> 01:19:57.860
good,
and getting your stomach stapled or whatever.

1377
01:19:57.861 --> 01:20:01.610
The crazy fucking procedure that just shows me you can't even deal with it on

1378
01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:03.650
your own.
You've got to do,
that's not a leader.

1379
01:20:03.651 --> 01:20:07.050
And I'm not talking about the average person who has emotional issues,

1380
01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:09.900
whatever that causes you to overeat.
And you know,

1381
01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:12.770
I hope everybody listens to in an exact that under Sjogren's.

1382
01:20:12.771 --> 01:20:15.550
I mean it's that under wraps,
whoever you are.
But when you're,

1383
01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.060
when you're stepping up and saying,
I want to be a leader,

1384
01:20:18.061 --> 01:20:21.870
I want to be a leader of the country,
the entire country.

1385
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:25.380
You can't be fat.
You just can't.
You can't be fat.
I mean,

1386
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.830
not saying you have to be like super fit,
but you can't be morbidly obese.

1387
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:31.870
That guy's morbidly obese.
Yeah,
he's,
he's,
he's pretty on fire.

1388
01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:35.310
Just big waddling fucking thighs rubbing together,

1389
01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:37.860
gut overflowing over his belt,

1390
01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:42.150
pulling it up and just be not Joey asshole fat shaming.

1391
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:45.270
Fat Shaming is a hilarious thing because you know what?

1392
01:20:45.271 --> 01:20:50.271
We're not talking about shaming someone who has a congenital disease or some

1393
01:20:51.241 --> 01:20:55.950
disfigurement because of an accident.
You're talking about slovenly behavior.

1394
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.420
You're stuffing your body with way more food than,

1395
01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.980
and did you do not have mirrors?
Do not have a scale in your fucking house.

1396
01:21:01.981 --> 01:21:03.810
Do you not see yourself being like,
man,

1397
01:21:03.811 --> 01:21:07.140
I probably am unhealthy as fuck right now and I'm still eating.

1398
01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:10.440
What's that all about?
Right.
Sitting there with a Napkin.
Talk through your third

1399
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:17.610
bitten and the big fucking fat fork fulls of food and your greedy ass hole,

1400
01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:21.940
mouth fat shaming,
but that's no lists.

1401
01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:26.700
This is a reason to mock fat people like that.
There's a Chris Christie,

1402
01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:30.570
you're trying to be a leader and you have a horrible,

1403
01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:36.510
like real obvious poor judgment when it comes to your health.
No,

1404
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:38.880
no,
you can't.
No,
you can't by the way,

1405
01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:43.020
can't shoot heroin and be present either asshole if I catch you in your fucking

1406
01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.120
office with a big rubber band around your buys,

1407
01:21:45.121 --> 01:21:48.890
having your fucking banging at lunch.
Yeah,
exactly.

1408
01:21:48.891 --> 01:21:52.860
But that's what they say about everything.
Everything is a goddamn disease,
right?

1409
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:56.160
I have,
did you see that video of the police car that's just came out last night?

1410
01:21:56.161 --> 01:22:00.530
Just going full speed into it,
dude.
Like who just robbed a store and just like,

1411
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:03.120
yeah dude,
check this out.
It is unreal.

1412
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:07.710
Ray and I were watching this as we were like,
what the fuck?
You're like,

1413
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:11.880
I've got this theory that I've been throwing around a lot lately.

1414
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.090
I don't think anybody should be a cop.
I don't think anybody is qualified.

1415
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.640
I really don't.
I don't think anybody is qualified to be a cop.

1416
01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:20.370
I don't think anybody is qualified to be president cop.

1417
01:22:20.371 --> 01:22:24.960
Especially though I think that job requires so much self control.

1418
01:22:24.961 --> 01:22:27.180
You mean you almost have to be like a monk.

1419
01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:32.450
You almost have to be some enlightened being who's separate from the pressure

1420
01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:37.410
that the average person's going to receive the PTSD by going into how many

1421
01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:41.850
domestic violence situations do you have to go into and watch,
you know,

1422
01:22:41.851 --> 01:22:46.851
men and women who have killed each other in these horrible love triangles or

1423
01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:50.320
robberies or you know,
fill in the blank rapes or you know,

1424
01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.000
how many times do you have to see these horrible things before your brain is

1425
01:22:54.001 --> 01:22:55.470
just broken?
I mean,

1426
01:22:55.471 --> 01:23:00.060
how many times you have to just think that everyone is out to get you everywhere

1427
01:23:00.061 --> 01:23:04.590
you go because you've had guys,
you know,
try to grab your gun or you've had,

1428
01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:08.650
you know,
prisoners try to punch you as you're trying to put the handcuffs on me.

1429
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.420
I think those guys are broken.

1430
01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.390
I think I've met a lot of them and I know a lot of them.

1431
01:23:13.391 --> 01:23:17.440
They're good people and I think they do the best job they can.

1432
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:19.150
But I honestly think that it is,

1433
01:23:19.151 --> 01:23:24.151
we're asking for someone to do something that the human body is not designed for

1434
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:29.440
to be the professional enemy and also the professional power.

1435
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.680
Like you have massive power as a cop.

1436
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:37.210
And I don't think the average person is qualified to wield that kind of power.

1437
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:41.800
The psychological ramifications of being a person who can end someone's life

1438
01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:46.510
with your finger anytime you want by squeezing some small muscles and your

1439
01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:47.290
finger.

1440
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:50.870
It's insane when you see that guy and that guy's running in South Carolina,

1441
01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:51.733
that guy's running.
Yeah.

1442
01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.250
And that guy pulls that gun out and he's shooting him as he runs.

1443
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:59.520
What the fuck has to go through your mind where you're seeing a middle aged guy

1444
01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:04.180
running away from you and you're shooting him in the back.

1445
01:24:04.530 --> 01:24:09.230
<v 2>A lot of people want the kill.
It's like the military.
Um,
and,</v>

1446
01:24:09.231 --> 01:24:10.770
and I talked to this guy,
Ray Lewis,

1447
01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:14.310
a former captain of the Philadelphia police force and he said that they

1448
01:24:14.311 --> 01:24:18.900
purposefully vet sociopathic and people lacking empathy for the job.

1449
01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.290
And if you're too intelligent,
they actually don't want you to be a cop.

1450
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.980
<v 3>No,
I've seen guys who have high Iq is actually getting turned down.</v>

1451
01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:30.700
There was a story about that this guy had some genius Iq and they turned him

1452
01:24:30.701 --> 01:24:31.750
down for the police force.

1453
01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.693
<v 2>Maybe cause you,</v>

1454
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:36.000
they don't want you to overthink and they just want you to like react quickly

1455
01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:40.260
tal areas,
um,
as if your brain works too.
Good.
You're going to overthink.
I,
yeah,

1456
01:24:40.261 --> 01:24:44.670
I think that cop should,
um,
I,
I liked the idea and I've posited this before of,

1457
01:24:44.671 --> 01:24:48.780
of disarming police,
not the society,
not taking away guns from people,

1458
01:24:48.781 --> 01:24:53.640
but taking away guns from cops until they can understand how to properly use

1459
01:24:53.641 --> 01:24:57.300
them.
Um,
there's other countries that have many guns per capita,

1460
01:24:57.330 --> 01:25:00.270
like some European countries and I,
and I forget what I want.

1461
01:25:00.271 --> 01:25:03.540
I want to say Norway.
Um,
they have guns,
they have a shitload of guns,

1462
01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:07.830
but they're cops don't,
um,
Iceland for example,

1463
01:25:07.831 --> 01:25:12.120
their police do have guns,
but they don't ever use them.
A cop,

1464
01:25:12.121 --> 01:25:14.400
I think killed one guy in the whole country.
Mourned.

1465
01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:17.940
It was like the first time that had happened since the existence of Iceland,

1466
01:25:17.941 --> 01:25:19.110
like since the revolution.

1467
01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:20.370
<v 3>Well,
here's the craziest statistic.</v>

1468
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:24.560
Cops in America have killed more people in March of this year.

1469
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:29.830
Then since 1900 in England [inaudible]

1470
01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:30.900
<v 2>and it shouldn't,</v>

1471
01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:34.740
in England there's been like acts wielders like people running out the axes and

1472
01:25:34.741 --> 01:25:38.850
it shows how cops can peacefully disarm them instead of just executing people.

1473
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:41.990
<v 3>Yeah.
It's a serious problem here.</v>

1474
01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:45.440
It's definitely a serious problem and it's not just a problem with standard

1475
01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:46.191
police officers.

1476
01:25:46.191 --> 01:25:50.570
It's a problem with the DEA and anybody who's seen those DEA raids where they

1477
01:25:50.571 --> 01:25:55.130
kick in doors and shoot little dogs like fucking Shitzu's and shit.

1478
01:25:55.190 --> 01:25:58.490
Throw Flash bangs.
Remaining cribs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For work.

1479
01:25:58.491 --> 01:26:03.020
Someone has some substance in there that's not sanctioned by a tax stamp.
You

1480
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.700
<v 0>a lot of times,
not even like the one where the kid with the crib,</v>

1481
01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:12.530
they didn't even have any drive or the,
there's a famous in the culture high,

1482
01:26:12.531 --> 01:26:13.364
the documentary,

1483
01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:18.860
there's that famous video where they shoot this guy's dog because they had found

1484
01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:22.790
like some pot in the,
his his trash.

1485
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:26.090
They had found like a grind or something in his trash.
So they,

1486
01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.320
they did a swat rate on this guy's house in front of his family and you hear a

1487
01:26:30.321 --> 01:26:34.460
Bang Bang and the dog's Jiping,
the guy's crying,
you shot my fucking dog.
Like,

1488
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:37.010
why'd you shoot my dog?
And you know,

1489
01:26:37.011 --> 01:26:41.270
they're handcuffing him and this just that power over people in that power

1490
01:26:41.271 --> 01:26:42.230
without reason,

1491
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:46.790
without reasonable understanding of the situation.

1492
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:50.090
A reasonable conversation just kicked down the door at bulletproof vest,

1493
01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:54.820
gotten down the door,
know gun down the dog,
the,
this is what we do.
Yeah,
Swat,

1494
01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.980
no knock raids are insane.
And there's been instances where they've done no,

1495
01:26:57.981 --> 01:27:01.280
not grades,
like in the middle of the fucking night.
And then they,

1496
01:27:01.281 --> 01:27:02.300
and then like a person,

1497
01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:05.810
we'll shoot that and thinking that it's just an armed robber and then they'll go

1498
01:27:05.811 --> 01:27:09.310
to jail for the rest of their lives.
And you're like,
how is this legal?
Another,

1499
01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.680
I think one of the most insane things that police are doing right now is called

1500
01:27:12.681 --> 01:27:14.750
the civil asset forfeiture under this.

1501
01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.630
But they just can seize your assets for no reason.

1502
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:20.930
And there was literally no reason.
One state just overturned that.

1503
01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.160
What was the state that I'd heard that I don't know.
Yeah,
Hoo Hoo.

1504
01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:28.180
That's actually a really good point.
I need to write about that.
Um,
we'll Jamie,

1505
01:27:28.181 --> 01:27:31.970
we'll find it out.
But it was,
uh,
some states are stepping up and saying,
look,

1506
01:27:31.971 --> 01:27:33.890
enough already,
like this is Craig Mafia.

1507
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:38.270
Cops can just stop anyone they want take all of the money on them.

1508
01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:41.300
And this has happened many times and it's tragic.

1509
01:27:41.301 --> 01:27:44.770
It's heartbreaking because someone will maybe lose $30,000 people who don't want

1510
01:27:44.771 --> 01:27:49.640
a bank account per say.
They want to keep cash on them because why not?
Yeah,

1511
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.860
why not?
Like it doesn't mean you're a fucking drug dealer.

1512
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:55.700
And so they just take their cash and then they just won't get it back.
And if,

1513
01:27:55.701 --> 01:28:00.701
and if they cannot afford to hire a lawyer for $10,000 in spend months in

1514
01:28:00.831 --> 01:28:02.960
litigation to get their money back,
then maybe they can.

1515
01:28:02.961 --> 01:28:04.490
But really like these people,

1516
01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:07.670
maybe they had a giant pile of cash because they wanted to refurbish their like

1517
01:28:07.671 --> 01:28:10.370
kitchen or in the restaurant they were working in.

1518
01:28:10.371 --> 01:28:13.070
A lot of people have had to close down their businesses after the police have

1519
01:28:13.071 --> 01:28:13.904
stolen their,

1520
01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:17.360
their cash and then they're allowed to use them and they're allowed to use the

1521
01:28:17.361 --> 01:28:21.560
Chi,
take that cash.
And it's,
there's no right,
it goes into their coffers.

1522
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:23.210
It's just so weird.

1523
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:28.450
We've entered into this really weird time and especially when it comes to law

1524
01:28:28.581 --> 01:28:29.240
enforcement,

1525
01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.450
it's being exposed now in a way that's never been before because of all these

1526
01:28:32.451 --> 01:28:34.280
youtube clips of cameras.
Yeah.

1527
01:28:34.281 --> 01:28:37.910
You're just getting to see cops shooting people and beating people up.

1528
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:41.240
Those guys that they found that cop,
uh,
those cops,

1529
01:28:41.241 --> 01:28:43.850
they found that guy who would run away from them on horseback.

1530
01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:47.450
So they're kicking him in the head while he's laying face down.

1531
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:50.750
They're just punching him in the head and the guys out,
he's out.

1532
01:28:50.751 --> 01:28:54.560
My older beating the shit out of him,
kicking his body like,
what are you doing?

1533
01:28:54.561 --> 01:28:57.640
Like you're not a cop.
You're,
you're a fucking criminal right now.

1534
01:28:57.641 --> 01:29:00.350
So don't you know that people are probably filming you?
They didn't know.

1535
01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.040
I mean they were being filmed by cameras

1536
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.160
<v 1>above them.
That was a helicopter news cameras.</v>

1537
01:29:05.161 --> 01:29:08.700
I believe that caught them kicking the guy in the head because it was,

1538
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:10.650
it was this wild chase.

1539
01:29:10.651 --> 01:29:14.970
The guy was on fucking horseback and they were trying to catch the guy,
whatever.

1540
01:29:14.971 --> 01:29:17.250
You don't get to kick a guy in the head just cause he ran,

1541
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:19.650
you know you're supposed to capture him,
you've lazy.
Fuck.

1542
01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.390
And then once you capture them,
you lock them up.

1543
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:25.920
<v 6>Did you find her how to use their card players?
The NBA players in New York City.</v>

1544
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:30.650
What beat hold up here.
This player saw Dabo stuff.

1545
01:29:30.651 --> 01:29:33.150
Malosha there was a,
it was a really crazy story happened last week.

1546
01:29:33.151 --> 01:29:36.540
This player for the Pacers named Chris Copeland was stabbed in an incident

1547
01:29:36.541 --> 01:29:39.030
outside of club.
And a couple of hours later,

1548
01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:41.790
two other players from a separate NBA team showed up.

1549
01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:46.250
And there's video of this guy,
uh,
he's actually black and Chavo sef alone.

1550
01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.420
He's not from America.
I forget the country he's from,

1551
01:29:48.421 --> 01:29:51.660
but he's shown getting beaten and arrested by like six cops.

1552
01:29:52.230 --> 01:29:55.350
And it ended up being that he broke his leg and the incident has ligament damage

1553
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:59.100
out for us this season in the playoffs.
It's a,
an incident right now.

1554
01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:02.370
There's a lot of stories coming out right now.
What actually happened?

1555
01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.290
Why they were,
uh,

1556
01:30:04.291 --> 01:30:08.910
the charge was that they were arrested for a obstructing the police from setting

1557
01:30:08.911 --> 01:30:12.510
up a crime scene,
but the setting up a crime scene,
and this is,
like I said,

1558
01:30:12.511 --> 01:30:15.600
this was hours after the and a

1559
01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.980
and m right now.
Like there's just,

1560
01:30:20.370 --> 01:30:23.760
I think they're going to sue the police that it hasn't really come out exactly

1561
01:30:23.761 --> 01:30:25.020
what,
like I said,
what's going to happen yet,

1562
01:30:25.021 --> 01:30:28.560
this is every day that the NBA players units as investigating the FBI.

1563
01:30:28.561 --> 01:30:29.000
I think it's

1564
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.170
<v 1>so,
I'm sorry,
I'm still confused.
So they,
what does it say there?</v>

1565
01:30:33.171 --> 01:30:36.020
That he was provoked by the police before the arrest?

1566
01:30:36.250 --> 01:30:38.200
<v 6>Pull up the story.
This just came out today too.</v>

1567
01:30:38.201 --> 01:30:42.460
There's a sources that were at the like outside of this club filming it and

1568
01:30:42.461 --> 01:30:45.820
people are saying,
I saw this happen and I was just reading this just now.

1569
01:30:45.821 --> 01:30:46.600
It said that he,

1570
01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.840
during this incident they were him and the other player and tick is his name.

1571
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:52.780
I forget his first name.
Who's a like six 10 white guy.

1572
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:56.120
He wasn't roughed up by the cops at all either by the way.
Um,

1573
01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.310
they didn't ramp up the white guy,

1574
01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:02.300
he was just sitting there in the video and they said he tacked or ran towards

1575
01:31:02.301 --> 01:31:02.920
the cop.

1576
01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:06.790
And then then other of said he didn't really do that and the cop was stalking

1577
01:31:06.791 --> 01:31:10.210
him like a defensive back.
And when they were walking away towards the car,

1578
01:31:10.211 --> 01:31:13.090
he just simply said to the cop,
what's your problem with me?
And that's when,

1579
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:17.080
what the video picks up there and he's getting beat up.
Jesus Christ.

1580
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:21.880
And this is just coming out.
Yeah.
This has happened maybe last week or this week.

1581
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.140
<v 1>Oh boy.
Yeah.
No one should be a comp.
We need Robo Cop.</v>

1582
01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:30.610
You know,
all the people are saying,
you know,
where are the moderate Muslims?

1583
01:31:30.611 --> 01:31:33.640
Whenever like there's like some sort of attack where the moderate police coming

1584
01:31:33.641 --> 01:31:37.600
out and speaking out against every single cop.
That's a very good point.

1585
01:31:37.601 --> 01:31:39.820
Where are the moderate moderate cops?

1586
01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:44.830
Supreme Court overturns forfeiture of homes.
Has a state failed to show law.

1587
01:31:45.010 --> 01:31:49.450
That's Tennessee.
That's one.
That's one.
Okay.

1588
01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:54.480
This one statute actions under Tennessee civil forfeiture statutes state must

1589
01:31:54.671 --> 01:31:58.900
present evidence and that's good.
That's good.
Good,
good for,

1590
01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:00.160
that's brilliant.

1591
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.710
<v 2>That's a really surprising actually in Tennessee you've got good.
Yeah,</v>

1592
01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:03.740
<v 3>that's fine.
You know what?</v>

1593
01:32:03.741 --> 01:32:07.490
Someone along the line probably go fucked and they're just enough already.

1594
01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:11.870
Just you're stealing money from people,
right?
You can't just steal them on evil.

1595
01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:17.120
Yeah,
I mean it all the idea behind it,
it probably,

1596
01:32:17.121 --> 01:32:19.490
there's some good idea behind it.

1597
01:32:19.491 --> 01:32:22.250
If you're dealing with organized crime and then having massive sums of money,

1598
01:32:22.251 --> 01:32:26.630
they've got through nefarious ways and then you figure out a way to catch those

1599
01:32:26.631 --> 01:32:28.130
people and take that money from them.

1600
01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:32.480
But it's as soon as you allow regular people like the police,

1601
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:36.860
regular people like that fucking dumb old man that shot that guy the other day

1602
01:32:36.861 --> 01:32:40.580
cause he thought he had a taser out and he had a gun out and he said,
oops,

1603
01:32:40.581 --> 01:32:44.360
I shot him.
Like that's the key.
That's the type of people you have as cops.

1604
01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:45.800
And he was 73,
by the way,

1605
01:32:45.930 --> 01:32:49.730
when she sees a fucking way too old John Mccain like why are you in a position

1606
01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:50.564
of power?

1607
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:55.310
Why you better be all bad ass fucking 73 guy to be a cop.

1608
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:59.620
<v 2>He was a reserve I think is a donut donor.
Reminds me of um,</v>

1609
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:03.210
what do you think of Tom Cotton?
Have you been following this Douche bag?
No,

1610
01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.640
it's like overly buffed up military dude.
He was like in the marines.

1611
01:33:06.641 --> 01:33:09.540
He came out on the scene like six months ago and then all the sudden it was

1612
01:33:09.541 --> 01:33:12.340
trying to like go to war with Iran.
Like you know you have Obama,

1613
01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:16.270
you have Obama doing these diplomatic negotiations with Iran,

1614
01:33:16.271 --> 01:33:20.620
which I completely support diploma diplomacy.
Amazingly,

1615
01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:22.090
you have all these assholes,

1616
01:33:22.091 --> 01:33:27.091
I think 47 senators or congressmen sign onto this letter by Tom Cotton who is

1617
01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:30.910
basically backed by these neo-con Warhawks and places like the foreign policy

1618
01:33:30.911 --> 01:33:35.020
initiative and,
and Bill Kristol who love war,
like their,

1619
01:33:35.021 --> 01:33:37.630
their whole problem is that the public is to war weary.

1620
01:33:37.631 --> 01:33:42.460
He's actually written this.
So they pick like Tom Cotton to be like,

1621
01:33:42.461 --> 01:33:43.180
they're trolls.

1622
01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:47.710
Like this guy comes out and writes this letter to Iran basically saying like,

1623
01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:52.270
we don't support these like diplomatic negotiations and encouraging all of these

1624
01:33:52.271 --> 01:33:56.140
congressmen to sign on the bus letter to basically stimi the process.

1625
01:33:56.141 --> 01:33:58.300
And it's like I,
it's unfucking heard of,
it's like,
well,

1626
01:33:58.301 --> 01:34:01.870
since a one does this asshole get to come out?

1627
01:34:01.871 --> 01:34:06.040
And kind of like you serp the president,
you know what I mean?
It's unbelievable.

1628
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:07.870
And all these people sign on to it.

1629
01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.350
And every time you look at like a military intervention,
the last decade,

1630
01:34:11.351 --> 01:34:15.130
it always stems from these letters from these think tanks that like try to shape

1631
01:34:15.131 --> 01:34:17.860
policy.
And here's,
here's this semester's guy,

1632
01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.460
Tom cotton was a total troll.

1633
01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:25.930
<v 3>So it says here,
oh I love this.
The Red State,
the uh,</v>

1634
01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.600
the title Tom Cotton,
rock star,

1635
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:34.220
<v 2>Tom Cotton.
He also like just as blatantly funded by defense companies.</v>

1636
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:37.100
100% is he?
Yeah.
Wow.

1637
01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:42.470
There was just a phone call that was recorded,
um,
by a Deutsche Bank,

1638
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:46.820
I think analysts and Lockheed Martins CEO or the Deutsche Bank.

1639
01:34:46.821 --> 01:34:47.750
I was saying,
hey,

1640
01:34:47.751 --> 01:34:51.710
we're really worried that the Iran negotiations is going to depress weapons

1641
01:34:51.711 --> 01:34:54.860
sales.
What should we do?
This is how these people talk.

1642
01:34:54.861 --> 01:34:56.810
Like this is actually happening,

1643
01:34:57.050 --> 01:35:00.350
that they're worried that diplomacy with Iran is going to,

1644
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:04.730
you know,
hurt the bottom line of the military industrial complex.

1645
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:06.410
Isn't that just comforting

1646
01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:09.650
<v 3>whenever you have,
uh,
any,</v>

1647
01:35:09.651 --> 01:35:13.010
any sort of a political environment,

1648
01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:17.390
you're going to have extremes on both sides.
So with this guy is,

1649
01:35:17.391 --> 01:35:20.720
is the extreme on the right side and uh,

1650
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:25.640
these articles about him pro and con,
um,
that I'm seeing right now,

1651
01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:29.630
they seem to uh,
to highlight how smart he is.

1652
01:35:30.170 --> 01:35:32.510
The guy is smart and very articulate and very,

1653
01:35:32.511 --> 01:35:37.120
very aware of all the minutia of the Middle East and the conflict in the Middle

1654
01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:37.210
East

1655
01:35:37.210 --> 01:35:37.781
<v 2>be asshole.</v>

1656
01:35:37.781 --> 01:35:39.970
He was just in the military and things that that makes him have fucking

1657
01:35:39.971 --> 01:35:42.010
experience and it doesn't,
you know,
well does it,

1658
01:35:42.011 --> 01:35:47.011
I'm just reading what they're saying when your your take may vary but this is

1659
01:35:48.251 --> 01:35:52.750
uh,
this is also the people who invited Netanyahu to come speak at Congress.

1660
01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:57.760
Completely bizarre move,
unheard of to invite a foreign leader to come,

1661
01:35:57.761 --> 01:35:58.980
like try to use syrup,

1662
01:35:58.990 --> 01:36:02.850
a diplomatic process that's going on because of course it Netanyahu's in the

1663
01:36:02.851 --> 01:36:06.490
sane and wants to bomb Iran.
So that happened.

1664
01:36:08.170 --> 01:36:10.900
<v 3>There's a lot of these fucking people that will jump on board with this guy</v>

1665
01:36:10.901 --> 01:36:13.690
though.
There there is,
yeah.
That's what we get.
Scary as.

1666
01:36:13.691 --> 01:36:17.200
If a guy like doc and weasel his way all the way up to the top and run for

1667
01:36:17.201 --> 01:36:19.180
president,
that's when shit gets weird.

1668
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:24.750
If we've got a really hawkish military based president who was totally down to

1669
01:36:29.981 --> 01:36:30.814
just start bombing,

1670
01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:37.750
especially a guy who's got a little PTSD.
Yup.
Maybe been over there a little,

1671
01:36:38.770 --> 01:36:39.603
seen some shit.

1672
01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:43.990
<v 2>Saint little too much.
Did a little too much.
Yeah.</v>

1673
01:36:43.991 --> 01:36:48.850
Tom Cotton is a total douche.
How dare you.
How dare you.

1674
01:36:49.690 --> 01:36:52.330
But I liked that you said it's the extreme ideologues cause I think that that's

1675
01:36:52.331 --> 01:36:54.370
the way it is in all of these complexes.

1676
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:56.290
It's not a fight between Islam and the West.

1677
01:36:56.291 --> 01:37:00.430
It's a fight between the most extreme ideologues on all sides and the most

1678
01:37:00.431 --> 01:37:05.230
militaristic fascist stick ideologues,
you know that you'll see that.
Take these,

1679
01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:08.880
these to the extreme.
Unfortunately in America these people have um,

1680
01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:11.320
suits and they're called politicians.
A couple of them.

1681
01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.440
<v 3>Well,
this guy,
this Tom Cotton guy,</v>

1682
01:37:13.441 --> 01:37:17.610
the the picture and the red state article where it says Tom Cotton,

1683
01:37:17.611 --> 01:37:22.611
rock star is him in full fatigues with a,

1684
01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:27.710
with a machine gun in his hand,
which is,
that is insane.
Why is he public?

1685
01:37:27.711 --> 01:37:32.430
It is that his head is so small to
very small neck,

1686
01:37:32.431 --> 01:37:35.640
very narrow shoulders,
which would lead to a lot of overcompensation.

1687
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:40.260
That's not good.
Genetics,
redstate.com what the hell is this

1688
01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:45.840
website?
Rock star.
He's a rock star.
What does that,

1689
01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.660
Ooh.
Can't look at it.
There's going to be people like that,
right?

1690
01:37:51.690 --> 01:37:55.740
There's going to be the Karl Rove's.
Yeah,
for the world.
It's going to the,
uh,

1691
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:57.720
Ken Starr's.

1692
01:37:58.010 --> 01:38:01.610
<v 2>But then there'd be the,
the Obamas who you think are so much better,</v>

1693
01:38:01.611 --> 01:38:04.880
but then look at,
he has,
what?
Seven countries that he's bombing under his belt.

1694
01:38:04.881 --> 01:38:06.050
He's,
he's,

1695
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:10.040
he's sold more guns in the first five years of his term then Bush did and the

1696
01:38:10.041 --> 01:38:11.510
entire eight years term.

1697
01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:16.730
<v 3>Well,
it's one of those things where you can't be in that position unless you're</v>

1698
01:38:16.731 --> 01:38:18.260
playing the game.
You,
you just,

1699
01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:21.860
it doesn't seem like you can get there unless you're playing the game.

1700
01:38:21.861 --> 01:38:23.990
And he got in and he showed he's playing the game.

1701
01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:28.430
He's doing what everybody else did,
making everybody money.
I wonder,

1702
01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:33.500
I would love to see rationalization of that.
You know,
if there comes a time,

1703
01:38:33.501 --> 01:38:36.710
one day when Obama was like 80 years old where he gets to sit down and explain

1704
01:38:36.711 --> 01:38:39.260
like the way Jimmy Carter does speeches today,
you know,

1705
01:38:39.261 --> 01:38:41.930
Jimmy Carter does interviews today.
We talks about that ran crisis,

1706
01:38:41.931 --> 01:38:45.110
the hostage crisis.
And it's a pretty sobering when you,
you know,

1707
01:38:45.111 --> 01:38:49.160
you realize that he knows that the Republicans were already negotiating for the

1708
01:38:49.161 --> 01:38:52.760
release of the hostages before he was,
you know,
I mean,

1709
01:38:52.761 --> 01:38:53.900
he didn't really have a chance.

1710
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:58.790
They kept those people in there up until the moment where Reagan won and Reagan

1711
01:38:58.791 --> 01:39:03.200
got an office and then they were off magically freed and is really creepy.

1712
01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.230
And when you,
when you hear him talk today,
uh,

1713
01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.610
with very measured tones and very measured sentences,
you know,

1714
01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:13.640
I would love to see that kind of a conversation with Obama in the future where

1715
01:39:13.641 --> 01:39:14.720
you could really tell us like,

1716
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:17.750
like what was going on during this whole drone thing.

1717
01:39:17.751 --> 01:39:19.370
When you were getting the statistics,

1718
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:22.790
when you were realizing that eight 80 plus percentage of the people that you

1719
01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:25.220
were killing were innocence.
Like how was that?

1720
01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:30.340
And you're still using surgical drone strikes as that was the narrative.

1721
01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:35.180
Like how's that possible?
How'd you,
how are you allowing that to happen?
What was,

1722
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:36.770
what was going on behind the scenes?

1723
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:41.290
<v 2>They're going back to that report that said that 4 million have died in Iraq,</v>

1724
01:39:41.291 --> 01:39:42.124
Afghanistan,

1725
01:39:42.370 --> 01:39:47.140
80,000 people have died under the u s is the war on terror and Pakistan alone.

1726
01:39:47.710 --> 01:39:51.460
And we've never send ground troops in there.
We've only been using drones,

1727
01:39:51.490 --> 01:39:53.440
80,000 people to dissect drones.

1728
01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:57.370
I don't know if it's directly from drones or if it's a result from whatever the

1729
01:39:57.371 --> 01:39:58.360
hell the u s has been doing.

1730
01:39:58.361 --> 01:40:01.330
I'm sure there's like a lot of covert operations going on as well,

1731
01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:05.020
but it shows you the numbers that were being given are completely wrong.

1732
01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:06.740
And this is from what,
what year?

1733
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:11.690
This is since two thousand three thousand people.
That's a lot of fun.

1734
01:40:11.691 --> 01:40:15.940
A lot of people hopes dreams,
shattered lives.
And that's just not them.

1735
01:40:15.941 --> 01:40:18.040
It's like you were saying,
it's the widows,
it's,

1736
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:20.120
<v 3>you know.
Yeah.
And how about Brian?</v>

1737
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:22.890
How about when you find out about the military suicide rate?

1738
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.390
That's where it gets really bizarre.

1739
01:40:25.391 --> 01:40:28.140
Where more people have actually committed suicide that have died in Iraq.

1740
01:40:28.210 --> 01:40:33.210
<v 2>There's one every 65 minutes a veteran commits suicide every 65 minutes.</v>

1741
01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.710
<v 3>Wow.
Well,
it's,
if it's timed like that,</v>

1742
01:40:35.711 --> 01:40:39.460
can't someone just get there 54 minutes and take the gun away from it now?

1743
01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:42.270
Stupid.
Sorry.
Hey does,

1744
01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:47.280
it does seem like it's a different thing than has ever existed before.

1745
01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:51.040
I mean,
when Smedley Butler wrote that famous,
uh,

1746
01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.400
peace war is a racket back in 1933.

1747
01:40:54.401 --> 01:40:59.020
You could read that and apply it today too.
And smelly Butler was,
uh,

1748
01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:01.420
what was his position?
There's something in the marine corps,

1749
01:41:01.421 --> 01:41:05.200
very highly ranked in the marine curl sergeant general or some shit.
I remember,

1750
01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.470
I forget what his actual title was in the Marine Corps,

1751
01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:12.430
but what he said back then,
it applies today.

1752
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.690
And if you read it and you're reading something about the 1930s this guy thought

1753
01:41:16.691 --> 01:41:18.400
that he was going over there,
saving the world,

1754
01:41:18.401 --> 01:41:20.920
and really was making it safe for bankers are safer.

1755
01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.500
Oil people are safe for this or save for that.

1756
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:25.780
It's exactly the same shit that's going on today.

1757
01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:30.520
And when guys are involved in that and they have the going with this ideal,

1758
01:41:30.521 --> 01:41:33.100
they really are in their mind.
They want to be heroes.

1759
01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:35.080
They want to stand up for their country.
They believe in it,

1760
01:41:35.081 --> 01:41:36.850
they believe in justice and they want to be a hero.

1761
01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.850
And they go over there and they realize,
oh,
I'm just a hit man.

1762
01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:44.560
I'm a hit man for this creepy fucking corporation that wants to keep sucking the

1763
01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:45.760
oil out of the ground over here.

1764
01:41:46.090 --> 01:41:48.250
And it doesn't want to deal with all these people that want it to stop.

1765
01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.210
That's gotta be a very sobering point of view.

1766
01:41:52.330 --> 01:41:54.400
A very sobering perspective.

1767
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:58.960
<v 2>No,
I think that does play a lot into it in the military is not seen as something</v>

1768
01:41:58.961 --> 01:41:59.794
that's um,

1769
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.340
good anymore to a lot of people and I think a lot of soldiers who get in just

1770
01:42:03.341 --> 01:42:06.400
out of desperation and then they realize that what the fuck are we doing over

1771
01:42:06.401 --> 01:42:08.020
here?
What are we doing?

1772
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:12.040
What an interesting aspect of that statistic though is that the majority is over

1773
01:42:12.041 --> 01:42:17.041
60 who are committing suicide over 60 which means that this is like World War

1774
01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:21.400
II,
Vietnam and Korean War era.

1775
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:26.390
<v 3>The majority are over 60 wow.
Yeah.
Oh,
I didn't know that.</v>

1776
01:42:26.690 --> 01:42:27.471
That's interesting.

1777
01:42:27.471 --> 01:42:31.130
And they factor that in when they talk about v because when they talk about

1778
01:42:31.131 --> 01:42:32.810
veterans committing suicide,

1779
01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:37.070
I think what they were talking about is currently active veterans that were

1780
01:42:37.071 --> 01:42:38.740
committing suicide.
If you add in,

1781
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:43.700
that's probably where the 65 minute thing comes from.
Is it?
I check it out.
Yeah.

1782
01:42:43.701 --> 01:42:47.090
I think that probably makes sense because what they were talking about when they

1783
01:42:47.091 --> 01:42:48.890
were saying that more people have committed suicide.

1784
01:42:48.891 --> 01:42:51.320
I think they were talking about active military right now.

1785
01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:54.560
Then if died in combat in combat,
which is insane.

1786
01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.860
That's hard to believe,
right.
Then what you want.

1787
01:42:58.010 --> 01:43:01.610
Is there any more evidence that your fucking system doesn't work then the people

1788
01:43:01.611 --> 01:43:04.520
that are doing it commit suicide?
Fuck.

1789
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:09.980
Did you ever see American sniper?
I did not.
Yeah.
You know,

1790
01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:10.993
everybody was,

1791
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:15.740
I had friends that liked it and I had friends at Haiti that Duncan had a really

1792
01:43:15.741 --> 01:43:19.100
funny thing about it.
Yeah,
Dunkin hated it.
Ari Shaffir hated it.

1793
01:43:19.130 --> 01:43:23.900
Tom's girl really liked it.
I didn't say it.
I didn't have a desire to see it.

1794
01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.760
Right.
You know,
I think the story itself,

1795
01:43:25.761 --> 01:43:29.900
the actual real story is very fascinating.
I think Chris Kyle,

1796
01:43:29.901 --> 01:43:33.470
as an individual,
it's a very,
very complex case.

1797
01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:37.160
It's a very complex thing to discuss,

1798
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:40.380
but if you even talk about him,
um,

1799
01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:44.540
you're a coward and Chris Kyle was a hero and a,

1800
01:43:44.541 --> 01:43:49.460
you just sit there realizing that your freedom that you have is because of a guy

1801
01:43:49.461 --> 01:43:52.130
like Chris Kyle.
What?
Huh?

1802
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.480
<v 2>Yeah.
I'm sorry.</v>

1803
01:43:53.710 --> 01:43:58.160
Is sniping like heroic because to me that's like super fucking pussy dude.

1804
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:59.900
I'm gonna fucking snipe someone.

1805
01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:02.720
How dare you go with fucking nunchucks or a knife.

1806
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:04.990
You want to where you want to fucking fight someone.
Gotcha.

1807
01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:09.550
<v 1>Dumb numb chucks or a knife is a really dumb way by the way.</v>

1808
01:44:09.570 --> 01:44:10.430
You got to snipe them.

1809
01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:15.100
<v 2>No,
that's bullshit.
And ambassadors snipes like a fucking hundred and 50 people.</v>

1810
01:44:15.101 --> 01:44:17.050
How has that heroic,
how is that a road?

1811
01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:21.090
<v 1>If those hundred 50 people,
we're going to kill Americans or eagles.</v>

1812
01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:23.230
I hate nationalism.
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
the,

1813
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:26.030
if they're going to keep the ego from soaring,
like she's never saw it before.

1814
01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:29.093
You never know.

1815
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:32.630
<v 2>And another problem,
I mean,
the people who did see it in American sniper,</v>

1816
01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:36.170
Clint Eastwood actually inserted things that weren't in the book at all.

1817
01:44:36.171 --> 01:44:40.120
Like the Human Shield myth that we talked extensively about before that that

1818
01:44:40.130 --> 01:44:44.780
they use to justify all these mass casualties in an in Gaza saying that

1819
01:44:44.781 --> 01:44:46.040
everyone's used as a human shield.

1820
01:44:46.190 --> 01:44:50.600
They showed like a human shield myth playing out in the movie that never
existed.

1821
01:44:50.630 --> 01:44:53.900
It showed like a woman being guarded by her son and the holding like a grenade

1822
01:44:53.901 --> 01:44:58.100
or whatever.
And in the book,
when you read excerpts of Chris Kyle's book,

1823
01:44:58.101 --> 01:45:00.290
he talks about how these people were barbaric.

1824
01:45:00.291 --> 01:45:03.770
It was almost like Christopher Columbus in Howard Zinn's people's history of the

1825
01:45:03.771 --> 01:45:06.320
United States.
You can read Christopher Columbus is like journal entries.

1826
01:45:06.321 --> 01:45:09.230
When he first came here,
he was saying that everyone should just be killed,
raped,

1827
01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.660
and they were all like barbaric animals.
And that's what Chris Kyle talked about.

1828
01:45:14.661 --> 01:45:18.980
Iraqis as he said that he hated them with a vengeance so strong that it was like

1829
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:22.370
in human.
Like they,
there were any human,
he didn't kill enough.

1830
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:24.770
His only regret is that he didn't kill more people.

1831
01:45:26.110 --> 01:45:31.000
He said that he would beat animals just for fun.
Like,
he's a sick bastard man.

1832
01:45:31.290 --> 01:45:33.670
And you know what?
And he went out and such

1833
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:39.620
<v 1>perfect way killed band talking by Solo.
Yeah.
With Ptsd.
Yup.</v>

1834
01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:43.940
Well,
you know,
I don't know what happened there.
I wasn't there.

1835
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:47.330
I don't know if it was perfect.
It seems to me like a fucked up way to go.

1836
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:50.840
He was working to try to help people with PTSD.
I don't know the dude,

1837
01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:54.620
you know also there's a,
an issue I have,
what does it,
national estimate,

1838
01:45:54.650 --> 01:45:56.930
what is it?
What are you pulling up,
Jamie?
In the middle of a conversation.
Okay.

1839
01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:00.260
Oh that veterans suicide veterans.
Okay.
And what does it say?

1840
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:02.780
National estimate based on department of veteran affairs,

1841
01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:07.340
analysis of death records from 21 states though it is usually cited older

1842
01:46:07.341 --> 01:46:10.460
veterans.
Yeah.
Most of the suicides involved.

1843
01:46:10.461 --> 01:46:14.180
Older veterans who account for the vast majority of the nation's 22 million

1844
01:46:14.181 --> 01:46:17.540
former service members among veterans.
In the current study,

1845
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:22.230
there's one suicide a day.
So I'm confused.

1846
01:46:22.231 --> 01:46:26.190
So there's one suicide a day of active nepote seems as soldiers.
Okay.

1847
01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:29.850
That's not as nearly as much as 365 a year.
But that's insane.

1848
01:46:29.851 --> 01:46:34.851
So that means that there's that many more like 23 older veterans committing

1849
01:46:35.341 --> 01:46:38.540
suicide everyday.
Yeah,
that's a lot.
Wow.

1850
01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:43.470
2020 veterans take their lives each day.
22 every day.

1851
01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:47.490
Only one active.
Hmm.
That's bizarre.

1852
01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:50.310
You know of the,
one of the things about

1853
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:55.290
<v 3>the Chris Kyle thing that I think if you look at it fairly,
um,</v>

1854
01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:00.560
you have to take into consideration the fact that this guy was a mean.

1855
01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:06.510
He's a navy seal and he's out there doing this incredibly difficult,

1856
01:47:06.511 --> 01:47:08.250
very dangerous job that again,

1857
01:47:08.251 --> 01:47:12.930
I don't think any anybody is qualified for just like a cop,

1858
01:47:12.931 --> 01:47:17.070
just like there's no perfect human being five miles away and it's super

1859
01:47:17.071 --> 01:47:21.220
dangerous.
That kind of,
let's not exactly all he did.
Just checking.
I,
I'm,

1860
01:47:21.230 --> 01:47:23.520
I'm with you.
I mean I'm not,
I'm not taking a side here,

1861
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:26.310
but what I'm saying is you got to think that this guy gets out.

1862
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.310
He's got virtually no financial future.

1863
01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:33.330
If you look at like what those guys get paid as far as like what's there,

1864
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:36.600
what's the salary that they receive once they retire?
It's nothing.

1865
01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:38.910
You can barely live off it.
You barely survived,

1866
01:47:38.911 --> 01:47:42.000
which is if we're going to have military,

1867
01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:44.950
you've got to fucking take care of them.
You know,
the,

1868
01:47:44.951 --> 01:47:47.630
the UFC donates in a large way.

1869
01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:50.370
We hold these events every year for the intrepid,

1870
01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:54.030
a institute for traumatic brain injuries.
And uh,

1871
01:47:54.090 --> 01:47:55.970
when you find out that they,

1872
01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:01.020
they're dependent upon outside sources to fund them and that these people that

1873
01:48:02.251 --> 01:48:05.040
are veterans that get blown up and they have all sorts of head traumas,

1874
01:48:05.041 --> 01:48:09.370
all these injuries,
they don't get any help unless someone else donates.

1875
01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:11.513
It's incredible.

1876
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:16.080
It's incredible the amount of money that is involved in the war as far as the

1877
01:48:16.081 --> 01:48:18.420
amount of money that they give defense contractors,

1878
01:48:18.421 --> 01:48:22.920
the amount of money that's spent on,
you know,
various operations is staggering.

1879
01:48:23.130 --> 01:48:25.950
The amount of money that's spent on taking care of the soldiers once they get

1880
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:26.910
out is very small.

1881
01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:31.990
So you're left with this guy who is a navy seal who's been involved in,
I mean,

1882
01:48:31.991 --> 01:48:35.560
what PTSD to the fucking Gil's.
I mean,
how could you not?

1883
01:48:35.561 --> 01:48:38.790
You're shooting people from a distance watching heads explode.

1884
01:48:38.791 --> 01:48:41.010
Your friends are dying.
People are dying all around you.

1885
01:48:41.011 --> 01:48:45.090
You're in a death business and you come out and you've got this book to write

1886
01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:48.150
and you know there's a lot of the stuff that he said in the book that's turned

1887
01:48:48.151 --> 01:48:52.410
out to not be factual.
But if I was trying to sell fucking book,

1888
01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.740
okay,
and I was in that sort of a desperate situation,

1889
01:48:55.770 --> 01:48:58.740
I would put a bunch of shit in there.
That's not factual too.
I'm like,

1890
01:48:58.741 --> 01:49:01.200
what do I want to do?
I want to sell a book.
He said that he killed,

1891
01:49:01.690 --> 01:49:04.740
he was killing black people are,
and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,

1892
01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:09.510
like killing looters has essentially run the house.
Yeah,
yeah.

1893
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:14.020
Well it turned out to not be true.
Right.
That was one of the things that,
again,

1894
01:49:14.050 --> 01:49:18.360
you've got to look at it.
I mean you don't have to,
but I try to,

1895
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:22.410
whenever I'm looking at any sort of a,
a story like that,

1896
01:49:22.411 --> 01:49:25.830
a very complex story involving a hired killer,

1897
01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.590
you give someone a license to go kill people.

1898
01:49:28.710 --> 01:49:31.560
You say this is what you're supposed to do,
this is what you're doing.

1899
01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:34.110
And then you give him a bunch of metals for doing that.

1900
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:36.210
And then so you have this culture of support.

1901
01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.660
You have all these people thank you for your service.
You know,

1902
01:49:38.661 --> 01:49:40.290
you know there's people that salute you.

1903
01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:44.790
There's this enabling aspect of this that goes along.

1904
01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.010
And then you have this bizarre conundrum.

1905
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:51.190
This guy is forced into this life where he's not going to have any fucking
money.

1906
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:52.960
I mean,
he's going to be this,

1907
01:49:52.961 --> 01:49:57.400
this guy who is struggling to make ends meet with all sorts of psychological

1908
01:49:57.401 --> 01:50:01.100
issues.
I'm sure all sorts of physical health issues as well.
I mean,

1909
01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:03.980
<v 2>I think Chris Kyle is a disgusting scum bag and I hate him,</v>

1910
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:08.510
but I understand that this is the stomach of just like a very large problem.

1911
01:50:08.511 --> 01:50:10.040
Like there's a problem of empire.

1912
01:50:10.041 --> 01:50:13.850
And when you have a government whose actually judicially assassinating brown

1913
01:50:13.851 --> 01:50:14.960
people around the world,

1914
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:18.680
we should not be such a surprise that this militarism bleeds in.

1915
01:50:18.681 --> 01:50:22.070
And we have like a culture of empire babies where you have cops going around and

1916
01:50:22.071 --> 01:50:24.110
killing black people.
You have,
you know,

1917
01:50:24.111 --> 01:50:26.900
military people thinking that they have a license to fucking do whatever they

1918
01:50:26.901 --> 01:50:31.830
want and people themselves going and just shooting a bunch of people on the,

1919
01:50:31.850 --> 01:50:35.870
in a movie the year or you know,
taking down a bunch of people with them.
It,

1920
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:40.610
I really do think it all bleeds from the same problem with American culture.

1921
01:50:41.090 --> 01:50:42.100
When you have like a,

1922
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:47.090
a global empire and a shit load of guns and people who have American

1923
01:50:47.091 --> 01:50:49.490
exceptionalism and think that they're the best country in the world that can do

1924
01:50:49.491 --> 01:50:51.620
no wrong and that they're better than everyone else.

1925
01:50:51.650 --> 01:50:54.080
What does that do to a society?

1926
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:56.750
<v 3>Well,
it definitely gives us a society,</v>

1927
01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:00.530
a sense of entitlement and some sort of a weird,

1928
01:51:00.531 --> 01:51:05.390
bizarre way where you ignore all the faults of the people that are on your team

1929
01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:08.840
and you highlight all the faults of the people on the other team,

1930
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:12.710
even if they are lesser or equal.
Um,

1931
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:17.450
you,
whenever you have a team,
whenever we have this team mentality,

1932
01:51:17.451 --> 01:51:22.100
whether it's the Democrats versus the Republicans,
US versus them,
east coast,

1933
01:51:22.101 --> 01:51:26.480
west coast,
you get this stupid idea that we're not all one,

1934
01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:29.900
that we're not all one super organism sharing the earth,

1935
01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:34.760
which is what human beings are.
And that tactic that,
that philosophy,

1936
01:51:34.761 --> 01:51:38.840
that way of viewing the world is exactly what keeps wars going.

1937
01:51:39.230 --> 01:51:43.940
You have to have this team mentality if you have this abundant resource

1938
01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:47.600
mentality that really,
hey,
there's plenty for everybody.

1939
01:51:47.601 --> 01:51:51.050
The problem is the vast majority of what we're,

1940
01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:56.210
we're taking out of the earth as being sucked up by a very limited few people

1941
01:51:56.330 --> 01:52:01.330
that have control of the overwhelming majority of the resources and the world.

1942
01:52:02.690 --> 01:52:05.090
And they're the ones who are instigating wars.

1943
01:52:05.091 --> 01:52:10.091
They're the ones who are funding and actively campaigning to get these things

1944
01:52:10.311 --> 01:52:12.050
going.
And to make sure that,

1945
01:52:12.051 --> 01:52:13.940
just like we were talking about with private prisons,

1946
01:52:14.210 --> 01:52:17.000
they want to keep the business of war booming.

1947
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:21.500
The business of war does not want to taper off the business of war wants to grow

1948
01:52:21.501 --> 01:52:22.710
like every other business.
Right.

1949
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:27.910
And when you have business and profit involved in going to places and shooting

1950
01:52:28.101 --> 01:52:30.380
things and taking their stuff.
I mean,

1951
01:52:30.381 --> 01:52:34.070
the most egregious example was when Halliburton,

1952
01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:38.390
which fucking Dick Cheney was the CEO of Halliburton.
He leaves,

1953
01:52:38.391 --> 01:52:42.080
Halliburton becomes a vice president and then Halliburton gives these no bid

1954
01:52:42.081 --> 01:52:47.060
contracts to repair places that Cheney as an following up instigating these,

1955
01:52:47.490 --> 01:52:51.830
I mean,
what the fuck man?
I mean it can't get any more transparent than that.

1956
01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:56.690
That is,
that is the business of war inaction,
the business of this,

1957
01:52:56.990 --> 01:53:01.990
this funnel that has figured out how to draw money out of an area and how to

1958
01:53:02.301 --> 01:53:06.320
filter it into the coffers of all these people that are responsible for all

1959
01:53:06.321 --> 01:53:09.230
these companies that sell things to the government,
that,

1960
01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:12.200
that are involved in Bor and he's just,
this is a lot,

1961
01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:13.430
there's a lot going on there.

1962
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:17.240
There's a lot of moving pieces and that's where a guy look Obama steps in,

1963
01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:17.900
you know,

1964
01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:22.900
in 2012 you know this guy steps in or 2008 this guy steps in and you get to see

1965
01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:26.541
this,

1966
01:53:26.541 --> 01:53:31.541
this scenario play out where this new entity steps into this machine that's

1967
01:53:32.301 --> 01:53:33.470
already been established.

1968
01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:38.660
He has all these ideas in his head about what he's going to do and then once he

1969
01:53:38.661 --> 01:53:41.600
actually gets in there,
you see what he's really doing.
It's just very little,

1970
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:44.360
very little.
I mean,
very little different.
It's really,

1971
01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:49.420
a lot of it is business as usual and it almost seems like untangling that

1972
01:53:49.971 --> 01:53:53.600
gigantic profit machine is extremely difficult.

1973
01:53:53.601 --> 01:53:58.250
And whenever ideals that he might have had as a young man or as a guy who was

1974
01:53:58.251 --> 01:54:00.740
campaigning to be president with these unique ideas,

1975
01:54:00.741 --> 01:54:02.140
I'm going to close Guantanamo Bay.

1976
01:54:02.410 --> 01:54:05.930
I'm going to pull us out of Iraq and Afghanistan now that happened,
man.

1977
01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.930
None of that happened.
None of it happened.
And even talking about pulling out,

1978
01:54:08.931 --> 01:54:10.190
they're not really gonna pull out.

1979
01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:13.460
They're going to pull out lead behind thousands of troops.
Yeah.
Like,

1980
01:54:13.461 --> 01:54:16.910
how was it pulling out?
Right?
Like that's not pulling out,
pray on his no troops,

1981
01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:20.300
zero,
zero basis,
zero trips like gun.
Yeah.

1982
01:54:20.301 --> 01:54:23.500
That's like saying I'm going to pull out when you're having sex,
but you still

1983
01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:26.720
<v 2>common sides on one.
They're like,
well I pulled out sort of,</v>

1984
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:30.620
I only had left a tip.
You got to pull out all the way.

1985
01:54:30.650 --> 01:54:32.080
The whole idea is ridiculous.

1986
01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:34.820
Another problem with the way things are going now is like,

1987
01:54:34.821 --> 01:54:37.940
I think under the Bush administration it was so blatant and in your face and

1988
01:54:37.941 --> 01:54:41.420
obtuse and now Obama,
you know,
there's all this covert warfare going on.

1989
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:46.280
The general of Africom,
which is like,
who knew that we were at war with Africa?

1990
01:54:46.281 --> 01:54:46.580
Right?

1991
01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:50.450
Well apparently there's military operations going on every single day across

1992
01:54:50.451 --> 01:54:53.690
Africa.
The United States.
Yes.
Yes.

1993
01:54:53.691 --> 01:54:56.010
And they've told like a room full of defense contractors.

1994
01:54:56.030 --> 01:55:00.530
Like we are literally at war with Africa and uh,
this is African Africa.

1995
01:55:00.531 --> 01:55:03.620
The continent were the whole continent or where would the fucking gun and is

1996
01:55:03.621 --> 01:55:06.290
that a first?
That's the first cause we usually just pick a country.

1997
01:55:07.730 --> 01:55:09.950
This country sucks.
And amazingly,

1998
01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:13.310
it all like it's all goes together too.

1999
01:55:13.311 --> 01:55:15.710
When you look at like the global empire and how it all works,

2000
01:55:15.711 --> 01:55:18.560
like the extraction of resources and all these countries working together in

2001
01:55:18.561 --> 01:55:22.130
terms of Saudi Arabia and Israel.
And when you look at the drone wars,

2002
01:55:22.190 --> 01:55:26.600
cobalt is a mineral that's really a central for the military industrial complex

2003
01:55:26.601 --> 01:55:31.070
to build machinery and weaponry.
And cobalt comes from the Congo.

2004
01:55:31.130 --> 01:55:36.130
And when you look at the Congo for the last decade or so or more than that,

2005
01:55:36.321 --> 01:55:38.420
there's been like 6 million people who have died there.

2006
01:55:38.421 --> 01:55:40.700
There's a basically a genocide going into the Congo,

2007
01:55:40.701 --> 01:55:45.701
facilitated and protected by the u s government in State Department documents in

2008
01:55:45.961 --> 01:55:49.920
the late nineties or mid two thousands they've said that they need to keep Congo

2009
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.510
like unstable.

2010
01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:55.230
Basically they need to keep this civil war going so that we can secure the

2011
01:55:55.231 --> 01:55:59.770
cobalt extraction.
It's all fucked man.
And it all stems back from Rwanda,

2012
01:55:59.910 --> 01:56:04.890
the genocide there and they,
you know,
the invasion of the Congo,

2013
01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:08.070
it's used,
I don't know.
I don't exactly know.

2014
01:56:08.071 --> 01:56:12.390
But I know primarily something in drones.
It's a component in drones,

2015
01:56:12.391 --> 01:56:15.180
but it just shows you how complicated it is.
Right?

2016
01:56:15.181 --> 01:56:18.210
And how many things are tied together with the military industrial complex.

2017
01:56:18.211 --> 01:56:21.810
And I really do think it's like an autonomous machine that if,
you know,

2018
01:56:21.930 --> 01:56:23.580
if a bunch of these people died,

2019
01:56:23.581 --> 01:56:27.570
the machine would still thrive on it would still live on because there's so many

2020
01:56:27.571 --> 01:56:31.980
components and everyone's compartmentalize and how to keep the machine going.

2021
01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:33.930
And so it's like they don't even know.

2022
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:37.380
It's just weapons and bombing are the only solutions that they know cause that's

2023
01:56:37.381 --> 01:56:38.460
all that they do know.

2024
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:42.750
It's like of course building schools and hospitals would actually be way better

2025
01:56:42.751 --> 01:56:46.230
in the longterm for Afghans.
Um,
education.

2026
01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:50.850
If we're going to prop up that that girl Malala or whatever for the Taliban,

2027
01:56:50.851 --> 01:56:54.660
almost killing her for wanting to get educated.
That should be our focus.

2028
01:56:54.661 --> 01:56:58.900
If we really want like an educated world and society and build up pieces to

2029
01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:02.640
building the Middle East schools and hospitals and really investing in the

2030
01:57:02.641 --> 01:57:07.140
people instead of just continuously bombing them into the stone ages and then

2031
01:57:07.141 --> 01:57:10.470
being like,
why are you guys so barbaric?
We had to bomb the shit out of you more.

2032
01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:11.730
Why is Isis here?

2033
01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.240
I don't know me because you bomb the shit out of all of these different

2034
01:57:15.241 --> 01:57:19.530
religious sects that Saddam was actually had a stranglehold on because at that

2035
01:57:19.531 --> 01:57:22.170
point in time,
the political evolution and climate of that society,

2036
01:57:22.171 --> 01:57:26.550
they needed a dictator and like some sort of dictatorial rule to keep those

2037
01:57:26.551 --> 01:57:28.890
factions in line.
That's how the society was functioning.

2038
01:57:29.190 --> 01:57:33.060
So to just bomb them into oblivion and just be like,
we've democratized you.

2039
01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:34.770
Why is Isis here now?

2040
01:57:34.771 --> 01:57:39.060
Like any logical human being would look at that region and say,

2041
01:57:39.061 --> 01:57:40.620
well of course that's what's going to happen.

2042
01:57:40.650 --> 01:57:45.330
Even Cheney back in 2000 or 1994 he was giving this interview about the invasion

2043
01:57:45.331 --> 01:57:47.190
of Iraq because of course Bush senior,

2044
01:57:47.191 --> 01:57:49.650
we know he wanted to go in and do a rock too and he was saying,

2045
01:57:49.651 --> 01:57:53.840
we'd never do that because pieces of Iraq would fly off and he was like,

2046
01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:54.990
it'd be a total disaster.

2047
01:57:54.991 --> 01:57:58.140
He basically laid out exactly what happened when we did go in there.

2048
01:57:58.650 --> 01:58:00.030
These people aren't dumb.
Um,

2049
01:58:00.031 --> 01:58:02.730
it's almost like isis is just an excuse to keep it going.

2050
01:58:04.890 --> 01:58:08.180
Jesus.
Yeah,
it's pretty insane.
Okay.

2051
01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:11.850
You're really good at pointing out all these things that are fucked up in the

2052
01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:16.530
world,
but do you have any ideas about how it could be fixed?

2053
01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:18.750
I think that the,

2054
01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:23.250
everything that you said about how we're one human family living on one
organism,

2055
01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:27.310
we have the technological capabilities in front of us.
Um,

2056
01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:28.500
that's why I love what Peter,

2057
01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:32.070
Joseph and [inaudible] are doing because they point out the possibilities and

2058
01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:34.830
the capabilities that we have,
the hydroponics,

2059
01:58:34.831 --> 01:58:38.100
the open source ecology and all of these different movements,
you know,

2060
01:58:38.101 --> 01:58:42.850
decentralized tools online or bitcoin or this is all happening.

2061
01:58:42.851 --> 01:58:45.010
People are starting the revolution on their own.

2062
01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:50.040
But I think that as long as we are ingesting media that makes us scared and

2063
01:58:50.621 --> 01:58:54.340
keeps pitting us in camps against each other and keeps a reinforcing American

2064
01:58:54.341 --> 01:58:56.260
exceptionalism and also these identities,

2065
01:58:56.261 --> 01:59:00.400
these false identities and nationalistic tendencies that makes us not have

2066
01:59:00.401 --> 01:59:01.234
empathy,

2067
01:59:01.330 --> 01:59:05.200
not extend our empathy from our brothers and sisters in Gaza are brothers and

2068
01:59:05.201 --> 01:59:06.310
sisters in Iraq.

2069
01:59:06.730 --> 01:59:11.020
That needs to be stripped down first and foremost because if we keep reinforcing

2070
01:59:11.021 --> 01:59:13.840
the fact that we're different because we're American and were white and then we

2071
01:59:13.841 --> 01:59:16.480
were born,
we just happen to be born within this nation,

2072
01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.780
we're going to have a really long road ahead of us in terms of how we can really

2073
01:59:19.781 --> 01:59:22.120
change this because if the system has globalized,

2074
01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:25.150
the struggle needs to be globalized and so does the consciousness.

2075
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:29.920
<v 3>That's a good point.
That's a good way to phrase it.
I agree.</v>

2076
01:59:29.921 --> 01:59:33.010
I think blind nationalism,
blind to anything,
it's just unhealthy.

2077
01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:37.030
It's just not right and that's the type of shit that you're going to receive and

2078
01:59:37.031 --> 01:59:39.690
hate tweets cause all the shit you said about Chris Kyle

2079
01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:43.350
<v 2>fucking so much.
Hey,
last time I came on,</v>

2080
01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:47.310
but what a lot of people I know that you had done,
Sam Harris also,

2081
01:59:47.311 --> 01:59:51.680
who kind of responded to my whole argument about,
you know,
Islam and,
and,
um,

2082
01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:55.800
how these things have happened and why,
you know,
why Palestine is the way it is.

2083
01:59:55.801 --> 01:59:59.720
And Sam Harris,
his whole thing is why he doesn't criticize Israel.
Um,

2084
01:59:59.721 --> 02:00:01.980
I got a lot of hate from people who said that.
I just,

2085
02:00:01.981 --> 02:00:04.680
they just didn't agree with me.
Um,
because it's controversial,

2086
02:00:04.710 --> 02:00:08.340
but I totally disagree with the Sam Harrison,
this new atheism movement.

2087
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.380
I'm reinforcing the American exceptionalism in the empire and imperialism.

2088
02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:13.951
I mean,

2089
02:00:13.951 --> 02:00:18.540
it's unbelievable that someone like him and Richard Dawkins can get out there

2090
02:00:18.541 --> 02:00:22.860
and say all that matters is your pure moral intentions.

2091
02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:28.200
Islam is so fucked up that even if Islam kills a million people and the u s

2092
02:00:28.201 --> 02:00:31.890
government and Western imperialism kills a billion,

2093
02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:35.070
Islam is still worse because our intentions were pure.

2094
02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:38.040
We have the moral and position.
I don't think he's saying that.

2095
02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:41.490
I literally heard him say that in response to something about Noam Chomsky.

2096
02:00:41.610 --> 02:00:42.443
Maybe he didn't mean it.

2097
02:00:42.450 --> 02:00:44.520
Maybe I didn't hear like the full context of what he was saying,

2098
02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:46.650
but it sounded really just completely,

2099
02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:49.620
<v 3>he's a very,
very measured guy and uh,</v>

2100
02:00:49.650 --> 02:00:53.760
he's a friend and one of his takes on religion is simply that,

2101
02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:58.890
if I could speak for him the way he looks at Islam,

2102
02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:03.980
the real underlying issue with any overwhelming philosophy or ideology is what,

2103
02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:09.840
what,
what are their core principles?

2104
02:01:09.841 --> 02:01:14.040
And one of the core principles of Islam is if you leave,

2105
02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:17.100
you're supposed to be killed of your pasta.
You're supposed to be killed.
If you,

2106
02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.460
you,
you're committed adultery,
if you commit homosexuality,

2107
02:01:20.610 --> 02:01:24.510
if you look at these things like in the,
the religious doctrine,

2108
02:01:24.511 --> 02:01:26.220
like in the Koran or like how,

2109
02:01:26.221 --> 02:01:31.221
how it's addressed and the fundamental rules of this ideology,

2110
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:37.470
it's,
it's very divisive and it's very strong and it's very,

2111
02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:39.910
very clearly stated.
And

2112
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:42.710
<v 2>really how come so many more billings of people are not getting killed?</v>

2113
02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.960
What do you mean?
There's a billion and a half?

2114
02:01:44.961 --> 02:01:48.200
I think it was like one sixth or one fifth of the world's population is Muslim.

2115
02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:53.500
So shouldn't we be seen a lot more just completely like barbarism and terrorism

2116
02:01:53.631 --> 02:01:56.300
and death and destruction from Muslims,

2117
02:01:56.301 --> 02:01:59.390
if that's really what the entire Muslim religion is about.

2118
02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:00.241
<v 3>Well he's the,</v>

2119
02:02:00.241 --> 02:02:03.560
I'm not even saying that he's saying the entire religion is about that or

2120
02:02:03.561 --> 02:02:07.460
denying even that there are some moderate factions of the religion.

2121
02:02:07.730 --> 02:02:10.160
But I think as a neuroscientist,

2122
02:02:10.161 --> 02:02:15.161
his point of view is on ideologies and cult thinking and dangerous philosophical

2123
02:02:17.451 --> 02:02:22.330
trends,
like dangerous trends of behavior like Jihad.

2124
02:02:22.331 --> 02:02:26.090
It's like things like isis,
like things along those lines.

2125
02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:31.420
Not Denying the origins of the reason why they're so upset in the first place.

2126
02:02:32.091 --> 02:02:35.550
The,
the conflict that's brought them to this position or even the fact that I,

2127
02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.940
they may have been funded.
I don't ever hear him talk.

2128
02:02:37.941 --> 02:02:41.390
You don't have to have a conversation with him specifically about it,

2129
02:02:41.391 --> 02:02:42.320
like in a debate,

2130
02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:45.620
which should be kind of interesting cause you're a very fiery young lady.
Okay.

2131
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:49.700
It'd be interesting
what he's,

2132
02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:52.570
he's played some pretty fascinating videos.
Uh,

2133
02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:56.560
he put one of them up on a site about this guy.
Um,
and they were,

2134
02:02:56.561 --> 02:03:00.700
they were speaking from this large group of Muslims and one of the things that

2135
02:03:00.701 --> 02:03:05.180
he was saying was that everyone wants to say this is radical Islam.

2136
02:03:05.181 --> 02:03:06.620
These ideas are radical Islam.

2137
02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:11.920
But he said this guy in this video was talking about if someone says that

2138
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:15.650
whatever,

2139
02:03:15.651 --> 02:03:20.210
whatever a punishment that should be deemed out for any,

2140
02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.073
anything,

2141
02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:27.100
whatever the punishment it is in the Quran is the best possible punishment

2142
02:03:27.710 --> 02:03:31.730
because it is from a law.
And do you guys agree with this?
And they would say yes,

2143
02:03:31.731 --> 02:03:33.560
like the way they treat homosexuals,

2144
02:03:33.561 --> 02:03:38.480
this radical Islam or is this Islam and they,
they would all agree with it.

2145
02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:39.450
Or like if,
if,

2146
02:03:39.451 --> 02:03:44.000
if this is deemed by a law that you should be stoned to death for adultery,

2147
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:46.910
there cannot be a better way to deal with this.

2148
02:03:46.911 --> 02:03:50.180
And I think when you get down to the core philosophy,

2149
02:03:50.181 --> 02:03:54.590
could you imagine if we were seeing that spread across the country with

2150
02:03:54.591 --> 02:03:57.920
Christianity?
I mean there are certainly some radical forms of Christianity.

2151
02:03:57.921 --> 02:03:58.370
I mean,

2152
02:03:58.370 --> 02:04:03.350
let's like we're labeling things just all ideologies cross the board,

2153
02:04:03.351 --> 02:04:08.351
whether it's Catholicism or baptism or Scientology or any pattern that you are

2154
02:04:09.051 --> 02:04:13.730
expected to follow very rigorously and very,
very strictly.

2155
02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:14.900
Um,

2156
02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:19.900
when you start applying those patterns to the real world and inside those

2157
02:04:20.451 --> 02:04:24.050
patterns,
it includes death for things like adultery,

2158
02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:27.050
death for things like homosexuality,
very strict,

2159
02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:31.500
rigid rules like you were describing.
There's a hobby.
Yeah.

2160
02:04:32.570 --> 02:04:37.340
<v 2>Here's the missing element of that whole argument is that religions</v>

2161
02:04:38.850 --> 02:04:42.810
and when you have bombed the shit out of the Middle East into literally like

2162
02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:44.580
stripped their evolution,

2163
02:04:44.581 --> 02:04:48.600
I mean you can look at the Shah of Iran to the funding of the Mujahideen in

2164
02:04:48.601 --> 02:04:52.650
Afghanistan and how warped and twisted and backwards like women's rights,

2165
02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:55.110
let's say.
It'd be common in the last 50 years in those countries.

2166
02:04:55.111 --> 02:04:57.750
And a lot of it has to do with this demean and stifling from Western

2167
02:04:57.751 --> 02:05:02.160
intervention religions evolve.
What did Christianity,

2168
02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:04.890
did we use a stone people three burned people to say,

2169
02:05:04.891 --> 02:05:08.040
I mean all of these religions have evolved over the millennia.

2170
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:09.660
And I think when you're looking at Islam,

2171
02:05:09.661 --> 02:05:12.270
we have to give it room to grow and evolve without,

2172
02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:17.300
and it's really hard to look with such harsh judgment and single out Islam in

2173
02:05:17.761 --> 02:05:21.450
terms of the rest of the religions when there's been so much military

2174
02:05:21.451 --> 02:05:23.790
intervention in this region of the world.

2175
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:28.620
And that has reinforced religion because a lot of times people,
you know,

2176
02:05:28.650 --> 02:05:30.660
people in Gaza or Iraq or Syria,

2177
02:05:30.661 --> 02:05:34.740
I mean their prayer is the only thing that they have to keep them going when you

2178
02:05:34.741 --> 02:05:39.100
have fucking nothing.
Right.
So it's a little bit hard.
Um,

2179
02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:41.970
I didn't mean to come down on Sam Harris,
I just disagree with him and,

2180
02:05:41.971 --> 02:05:46.890
and a lot of people for some reason were like telling me that I needed to get

2181
02:05:46.891 --> 02:05:47.724
schooled.

2182
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:50.870
<v 3>You can just find a hole by Sam Harris.
Well,
you know,</v>

2183
02:05:50.871 --> 02:05:54.290
I don't think either one of you are wrong.
You know,
I think your,

2184
02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:56.150
your point of view in his point of view,

2185
02:05:56.390 --> 02:06:00.200
although they're very different having a conversation like this in that third

2186
02:06:00.201 --> 02:06:02.760
party form or not even having a conversation but decision agreeing or

2187
02:06:02.810 --> 02:06:06.230
disagreeing on points like that,
you really have to sit down with someone.

2188
02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:10.430
And really there's a lot of people that have gotten into disagreements with

2189
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:14.360
whether it's online or in reality or in real life.
Um,

2190
02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:18.860
where I think if you had the time to discuss and sit down and talk about like,

2191
02:06:18.861 --> 02:06:21.020
what do you think about this and why do you think about that?

2192
02:06:21.230 --> 02:06:24.500
And it's a long form conversation.
I mean that's a long conversation.

2193
02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:28.470
It's not something to be like sniped back and forth from blog entry and blogs or

2194
02:06:28.471 --> 02:06:31.490
chat or Twitter is the worst example.
I'm at 140 characters.

2195
02:06:31.491 --> 02:06:32.690
Like good fucking luck.
Right?

2196
02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:38.260
I think there's a lot of middle ground there and a lot of ways to look at his

2197
02:06:38.901 --> 02:06:41.510
point of view and a lot of ways certainly to look at your point of view,

2198
02:06:41.511 --> 02:06:45.990
which I very much respect.
It's just,
I think,
um,
there's both there,

2199
02:06:45.991 --> 02:06:50.991
there's certainly a lot of legitimate arguments to the fact that we have fucked

2200
02:06:51.201 --> 02:06:54.230
up the Middle East almost unfixable.

2201
02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:59.740
We have like ruined lives to the point where you're talking about if the new

2202
02:06:59.811 --> 02:07:03.890
figures of 2 million people in Iraq and Afghanistan,
that's the new figure.

2203
02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:07.010
I mean that's,
that's just the people that are dead man.

2204
02:07:07.011 --> 02:07:09.770
What about their families?
What about the people that knew them and loved them?

2205
02:07:09.771 --> 02:07:11.720
What about their friends?
What about their neighbors?

2206
02:07:12.050 --> 02:07:16.280
You're talking about just generation after generation after generation of,

2207
02:07:16.281 --> 02:07:19.640
of hate and,
and pain and suffering.

2208
02:07:19.700 --> 02:07:23.690
And I don't know how you engineer that away.
I don't think it's possible.

2209
02:07:23.691 --> 02:07:27.870
Even with philanthropic,
uh,
missions and,

2210
02:07:27.871 --> 02:07:31.610
and building schools and,
and,
and,
and helping people.

2211
02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:35.530
You're not going to take away the sting of someone's baby getting up by a

2212
02:07:35.531 --> 02:07:36.400
fucking drone.

2213
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:38.050
<v 1>I mean,
I just don't know how you</v>

2214
02:07:38.210 --> 02:07:41.680
<v 2>race.
I think it needs to start with stopping,
stopping all the time.</v>

2215
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000
And this is what I asked that Saudi scholar,
I was like,
how can we,

2216
02:07:45.001 --> 02:07:46.350
and I always come from this angle,

2217
02:07:46.351 --> 02:07:50.220
like how can we help the people and their sovereignty without like supporting

2218
02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:53.910
disaster as military intervention,
who was like,
we don't need your help.

2219
02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:57.450
Here's like,
this is what you guys,
you don't understand.
We do not need your help.

2220
02:07:57.451 --> 02:08:02.100
What we need you to do is stop supporting oppressive monarchies and dictators.

2221
02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:04.590
That's what we need you to do.
Yeah.

2222
02:08:04.650 --> 02:08:08.100
We don't need you to help us because freedom cannot be given and liberty cannot

2223
02:08:08.101 --> 02:08:10.680
be given.
It can only be one and we need to do that for ourselves.

2224
02:08:11.190 --> 02:08:15.120
But we can't do it with you.
You're backing of these like crazy,

2225
02:08:15.690 --> 02:08:17.010
oppressive systems.

2226
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:19.390
<v 1>I think it's also,
um,</v>

2227
02:08:19.570 --> 02:08:24.570
there's a philosophy of keep throwing bombs at the problem until it's fixed.

2228
02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.040
Like,

2229
02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:31.450
like you bomb people and then the people that are angry that you bombed and then

2230
02:08:31.451 --> 02:08:34.990
they come after you got to just bomb more.
You've got to shoot more people.

2231
02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:37.210
So the angry people are dead.

2232
02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:41.410
So all the people who lost family because of this as well,
they're dead too.

2233
02:08:41.411 --> 02:08:44.650
So there's no one left that has any connection to it.

2234
02:08:44.651 --> 02:08:48.700
And those are the people that'll be the new citizens of the new Iraq.
It's like,

2235
02:08:48.850 --> 02:08:51.550
it's a really,
it's like state sanction,
genocide.

2236
02:08:51.551 --> 02:08:54.480
And a lot of ways if you look at it that way and is,

2237
02:08:54.630 --> 02:08:58.760
it's hard to not just,
it's,

2238
02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:02.710
it's hard to rationalize in any other way.

2239
02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:07.030
The idea of killing a million people.
How else did it get done?
I mean,

2240
02:09:07.031 --> 02:09:09.850
if that's not what you're doing,
if you're not killing the,

2241
02:09:10.130 --> 02:09:14.410
was there a million army people?
No.
So how has a million people getting killed?

2242
02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:18.190
Well,
the,
you're killing people and when you killing extra people,

2243
02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:21.160
and then there's people that are mad that you killed those extra people and

2244
02:09:21.161 --> 02:09:22.660
they're coming after you and you're killing them too.

2245
02:09:22.810 --> 02:09:24.550
And then it just keeps going on and on and on and on.

2246
02:09:24.551 --> 02:09:27.190
And it becomes this vicious cycle.
Especially when you're invading,

2247
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:29.080
you're invading foreign countries.

2248
02:09:29.081 --> 02:09:31.000
You mean you're managing the fucking shit storm.

2249
02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:36.210
If someone tried to park boats off of our shore and invade the motherland,

2250
02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:40.840
the soil that Chris Kyle protected.
I mean,

2251
02:09:40.841 --> 02:09:44.680
could you imagine Chris Kyle,
by the way,
get ready for some Chris Crowl tweets.

2252
02:09:44.850 --> 02:09:46.720
Adam Martin can't.
They're coming away.

2253
02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:51.010
People got mad at me and I didn't say anything about them other than the fact

2254
02:09:51.011 --> 02:09:54.010
that what he said in his book wasn't truthful.

2255
02:09:54.130 --> 02:09:57.190
Never said a negative word about the guy,
didn't see the movie,

2256
02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:00.460
don't know much about him other than the numbers of people that he killed and

2257
02:10:00.461 --> 02:10:04.230
people were so mad at me,
especially in the hunting community.

2258
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:09.370
Community is blind.
Reverend Chris Cox,
they do well.
I don't,
I don't,

2259
02:10:09.371 --> 02:10:12.580
I'm not impressed with the people who just snipe a bunch of innocent people so,

2260
02:10:12.670 --> 02:10:15.660
well,
what are you going to do?
They might not have been innocent.
I don't know.

2261
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:16.481
I don't know.
I don't know.

2262
02:10:16.481 --> 02:10:19.810
I don't have a direct account of all the people that he shot in the head with

2263
02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:23.440
his dogs.
He'd beat.
We're,
we're guilty of something to there.
Bad dogs.
Sorry.

2264
02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:26.950
I had those dogs hated America.
He beat dogs.

2265
02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:30.310
<v 2>Yeah.
He like brags about beating animals.
So people want to defend.</v>

2266
02:10:30.311 --> 02:10:31.390
Chris called me.
That's fine.

2267
02:10:31.391 --> 02:10:34.310
You should just sit and look in a mirror and ask yourself why?

2268
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:39.270
Because that should be a shirt.
Because America,
yeah,

2269
02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:40.850
it's just the same people who look at me,
they're like,

2270
02:10:40.851 --> 02:10:44.690
you're a Russian propaganda is,
it's like I can't even,
uh,
where do we start?

2271
02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:47.450
I mean,
do we want to really honor your time here?

2272
02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:50.640
Are you a leftist or you lefty?
I know you,

2273
02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:52.550
you're talking about capitalism earlier.

2274
02:10:52.551 --> 02:10:55.850
Like I think you just said right away you're going to argue.
Yeah,

2275
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:58.310
but I'm not really a righty.

2276
02:10:58.610 --> 02:11:03.500
Capitalism has completely failed us and the corporate corporatism I mean,

2277
02:11:03.530 --> 02:11:06.050
but then you have all these people who are like,
this is not true capitalism.

2278
02:11:06.051 --> 02:11:07.340
Right.
And we can do better.

2279
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:11.630
Well to me this is what the beast of capitalism turns into.

2280
02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:15.890
This is like the inevitable outcome of capitalism when you leave it on hinge and

2281
02:11:15.891 --> 02:11:18.320
people say we need less government.
To me that doesn't make sense.

2282
02:11:18.321 --> 02:11:21.740
Cause that's how we got here in the first place is like letting down all these

2283
02:11:21.741 --> 02:11:26.741
barriers and having this incestual relationship between the industry and

2284
02:11:26.871 --> 02:11:29.990
government sector.
So I don't,
I don't know.
Um,

2285
02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:32.990
I don't endorse any sort of like alternative economic system.

2286
02:11:32.991 --> 02:11:36.980
I just think that we can do a shitload better and we have to,

2287
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:41.090
otherwise we're going to die.
I'm sorry to sound like Chris Hedges here,

2288
02:11:41.091 --> 02:11:43.790
but I mean we need some sort of massive shift.

2289
02:11:43.791 --> 02:11:47.780
I think everyone knows deep down that that unfettered capitalism cannot and will

2290
02:11:47.781 --> 02:11:50.150
not last and every empire falls.

2291
02:11:50.210 --> 02:11:54.850
And if we don't do something fast to save the planet,
um,

2292
02:11:55.130 --> 02:11:58.130
then we're going to be kind of screwed.
What's the alternative to capitalism?

2293
02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:02.240
The problem is it's like I don't like when people put you in a box and say like,

2294
02:12:02.241 --> 02:12:06.590
you need to explain to me a complete alternative.
Otherwise like we just can't.

2295
02:12:06.591 --> 02:12:09.440
And I there,
there's no discussion.
I think that we can do better.

2296
02:12:09.441 --> 02:12:11.810
We have the brains,
we have the mind power,

2297
02:12:11.811 --> 02:12:13.340
we have the smartest people in the world.

2298
02:12:13.341 --> 02:12:16.370
They're going to do a fucking like head transplant for God's sake.

2299
02:12:16.371 --> 02:12:17.300
That's where we're at now.
Like

2300
02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:23.900
Elon Musk like wants to create an Internet in space that will provide free

2301
02:12:23.901 --> 02:12:27.680
Internet for everyone on the planet and every remote corner of the earth.

2302
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:30.530
These are the things that we can do.
We can mind Mars,

2303
02:12:30.531 --> 02:12:32.930
like we can do these things now,

2304
02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:37.070
so don't tell me that capitalism in the form that it is now is like the best

2305
02:12:37.071 --> 02:12:39.220
that we can do.
I don't know.
Kind of lead the draw man,

2306
02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:40.400
because no one is saying that.

2307
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:44.510
No one's saying the capitalism capitalism is the best could do.

2308
02:12:44.511 --> 02:12:48.680
They're saying that capitalism is the best and that we just need to fix it.
Oh,

2309
02:12:48.681 --> 02:12:50.780
but I'm not a,
I'm not arguing with you with that.

2310
02:12:50.781 --> 02:12:54.560
I'm just saying like what do you think can be done?

2311
02:12:54.590 --> 02:12:56.960
I'm not saying that you have to have a solution,

2312
02:12:57.230 --> 02:13:01.550
but I'm saying if you have an argument that you think capitalism is inherently

2313
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:04.640
unfixable,
broken,
evil,
fill in the blank,

2314
02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:09.590
what could be done?
What could be done differently?
Well,

2315
02:13:09.591 --> 02:13:14.591
I think that we need some sort of actual democratic kind of cooperative

2316
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:20.360
governance locally where people are actually invested in like a cooperative

2317
02:13:20.361 --> 02:13:22.940
level,
which is actually what democracy should be.

2318
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:26.780
That is actual democracy in its truest form.
Um,
and,

2319
02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:30.020
and a lot of what Marx wrote,
his is like that unfortunately,

2320
02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:33.060
I hate that we're putting these two camps where it's like either you're a

2321
02:13:33.061 --> 02:13:36.090
communist or your capitals.
No,
I see good in both.

2322
02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:39.480
And I think that a lot of European countries have done it right where they

2323
02:13:39.481 --> 02:13:44.010
incorporate a lot of social aspects into their society and people who want to

2324
02:13:44.011 --> 02:13:47.640
shit all over like socialism.
I mean we have libraries,
fireman,

2325
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:52.110
like these are all socialists aspects of our country right now.
Um,
schools,

2326
02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:53.430
public education.

2327
02:13:53.730 --> 02:13:57.420
So I think that it's been as scary and vilified word for no reason.

2328
02:13:57.421 --> 02:14:00.060
And I think that we need to really grow up in and understand how we can

2329
02:14:00.061 --> 02:14:04.500
incorporate aspects of both to really benefit society until we can figure out

2330
02:14:04.501 --> 02:14:09.330
maybe what's next.
But right now,
um,
we have a country where people applaud,

2331
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:13.140
like politicians who say that we're not going to give you a health care that we

2332
02:14:13.141 --> 02:14:16.380
want like no government,
that we want to give more power to the market.

2333
02:14:16.381 --> 02:14:18.890
I just see a lot of problems with that because um,

2334
02:14:19.170 --> 02:14:22.860
I just feel like that's why we have a lot of the issues that we have today and a

2335
02:14:22.861 --> 02:14:26.190
lot of European countries have free healthcare and college and I totally support

2336
02:14:26.191 --> 02:14:29.340
that because being unemployed for the little time that I have,

2337
02:14:29.341 --> 02:14:33.030
and I looked into Obamacare thinking that it was going to be like really cheap.

2338
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:38.010
It's $250 is the cheapest plan.
I can't even afford that right now.
$250 a month.

2339
02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:41.130
Yeah.
That's the cheapest plan.
That's the cheapest plan.

2340
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:47.480
So I thought it was supposed to be free.
That's what I know.
What costs money?

2341
02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:50.850
Yes.
We got fucked.
Right?
Well we got fuck without Obamacare shit.
Huh?

2342
02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:54.450
I don't know a single person that really likes it.
No,
it's awful.
It's like,

2343
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:57.330
it just,
the insurance company is just wrote a bill basically.

2344
02:14:57.331 --> 02:14:59.820
And now we have to buy health care.

2345
02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:02.590
<v 3>Yeah.
It's like instead of giving everyone free healthcare,</v>

2346
02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:05.510
you have to buy health care.
That's what it seems to be the same.

2347
02:15:05.530 --> 02:15:06.700
That's what it is.
That's exactly.

2348
02:15:06.701 --> 02:15:10.060
Never heard anybody argue successfully that it's a good plan or I've heard

2349
02:15:10.061 --> 02:15:13.720
people argue that,
well,
it needs to evolve and change and it's uh,

2350
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:16.180
it's good in principle,
you know,
what's good in principle,

2351
02:15:16.630 --> 02:15:20.380
socialized Madison at least as a,

2352
02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:25.480
an available thing for everyone.
I mean,
if you want like elective procedures,

2353
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:28.450
you know,
if you want a boob job or something like that,
yeah,
you should be,

2354
02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:33.210
you should be able to buy that.
If you have a doctor that has,
you know,
uh,

2355
02:15:33.250 --> 02:15:37.690
some extreme ability to fix knees or something like that and it costs a lot of

2356
02:15:37.691 --> 02:15:41.620
money to do his stuff and insurance doesn't cover it,
but he charges more money.

2357
02:15:41.621 --> 02:15:42.400
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2358
02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:47.400
But the idea that you could go into debt because you get hurt or sick and you

2359
02:15:47.471 --> 02:15:49.780
might not ever be able to come out of that.
And then our,

2360
02:15:49.870 --> 02:15:54.870
our government doesn't look at that as being one of the primary objectives of,

2361
02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:56.800
uh,
government of,
of,
of,

2362
02:15:56.801 --> 02:16:01.630
of a leading group of human beings that are supposed to be in charge of

2363
02:16:01.631 --> 02:16:05.620
allocating resources,
taking care of education and taking care of health.

2364
02:16:05.621 --> 02:16:08.470
Those are the two primaries.
Food,
education,

2365
02:16:08.590 --> 02:16:12.910
health dose should be the primaries of course fire man,
of course,

2366
02:16:12.911 --> 02:16:14.140
all the things that are police,

2367
02:16:14.141 --> 02:16:17.860
all the things that are already established as being things that we pay for that

2368
02:16:17.861 --> 02:16:20.710
the state pays for.
Those things should be there as well.

2369
02:16:20.711 --> 02:16:25.660
But the idea that healthcare wouldn't be in that group,
it seems barbaric.

2370
02:16:25.870 --> 02:16:30.550
It seems,
it seems rude.
It seems also incredibly

2371
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:32.170
<v 0>debilitating to poor people.</v>

2372
02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:34.300
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
and that's exactly who it affects.</v>

2373
02:16:34.301 --> 02:16:36.820
And I'm not going to sit here and praise Cuba,

2374
02:16:36.821 --> 02:16:41.440
but I did go there and did a bunch of reports about Cuba and yes,

2375
02:16:41.441 --> 02:16:42.350
it's Communist.
Yes,

2376
02:16:42.351 --> 02:16:45.520
it has a lot of problems and they don't claim to be the best system,

2377
02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:50.410
but their healthcare and they're all truism in terms of like fighting,
um,

2378
02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:52.300
like epidemics worldwide.

2379
02:16:52.301 --> 02:16:55.060
Cuba was on the front lines of after the Haiti earthquake,

2380
02:16:55.061 --> 02:16:57.340
they sent the largest contingent of doctors to Haiti.

2381
02:16:57.610 --> 02:17:01.780
They sent the largest contingent of doctors to Liberia to fight a bola.

2382
02:17:02.410 --> 02:17:06.100
They have put,
their values are different.

2383
02:17:06.101 --> 02:17:10.510
I mean their values are to take care of like healthcare is a human right and

2384
02:17:10.511 --> 02:17:11.590
shelters a human rate.

2385
02:17:11.591 --> 02:17:14.770
And so that's why you have like such low crime rates and Cuba too.

2386
02:17:14.771 --> 02:17:19.270
Because when everyone has basic needs,
shelter,
healthcare,

2387
02:17:19.330 --> 02:17:22.510
I mean what does that do to a society?
There's a lot of problems in Cuba.

2388
02:17:22.511 --> 02:17:23.650
I'm not saying that's the answer,

2389
02:17:23.651 --> 02:17:27.370
I'm just saying it's interesting to see countries do it differently and see how

2390
02:17:27.371 --> 02:17:32.140
it affects other people and you know,
and then you have America,
this agenda,

2391
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:37.210
this hegemonic force that basically thrives on making money off killing people.

2392
02:17:37.630 --> 02:17:42.280
And Cuba,
you know,
sells doctors.
That's,
that's their biggest export as doctors.

2393
02:17:42.281 --> 02:17:43.300
Ours,
our guns.

2394
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:48.800
<v 0>That's our biggest export.
Really?
Yup.
I thought it was like corn.
Nope.</v>

2395
02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:53.290
You would think so.
Really?
We sell,
send more guns,
southern places in anything.

2396
02:17:53.330 --> 02:17:57.860
The biggest exporter of arms in the world.
Again,
because America shirt,

2397
02:17:59.030 --> 02:18:03.350
biggest export of arms in the world because America is amazing.
I mean,

2398
02:18:03.351 --> 02:18:07.040
if Cuba can do this,
being economically crippled under blockade,
what can we do?

2399
02:18:07.041 --> 02:18:08.540
What can the richest country in the world do?

2400
02:18:08.570 --> 02:18:12.050
Not only for our people but for the world instead of just killing people.

2401
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:16.400
It's unbelievable.
Well,
talking about it helps,
right?
I mean doesn't it?

2402
02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:21.470
Enlightened young people stimulate ideas,
get people thinking about the problems.

2403
02:18:22.290 --> 02:18:23.090
There's this,
there's,

2404
02:18:23.090 --> 02:18:28.090
there's a benefit to this type of conversation that people oftentimes criticized

2405
02:18:28.311 --> 02:18:30.320
but you guys aren't doing anything.
You're just talking about it.

2406
02:18:30.350 --> 02:18:33.260
It won't you to do something about it.
Now that you're not at our tea,

2407
02:18:33.261 --> 02:18:37.190
what are you going to do?
So I'm doing work for media roots,
which is my website.

2408
02:18:37.191 --> 02:18:40.700
I'm in talks with uh,
two different show ideas right now.

2409
02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:44.030
A lot of great things on the horizon.
By September,

2410
02:18:44.031 --> 02:18:46.580
I should have another show up and running and for a network that I won't say

2411
02:18:46.581 --> 02:18:49.940
anything yet because in case it doesn't happen,
I don't want to,
you know,

2412
02:18:49.970 --> 02:18:53.720
make any declarations,
but definitely not going away.
And media roots thing.

2413
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:56.330
What do you do at media roads?
So media roots was a,
it's a

2414
02:18:56.430 --> 02:18:59.700
<v 2>citizen journalism project that I started and that's what our Archie found me</v>

2415
02:18:59.701 --> 02:19:00.960
through occupy Oakland coverage.

2416
02:19:00.961 --> 02:19:05.100
But it just a multimedia forum that I have as a hub of censored information that

2417
02:19:05.101 --> 02:19:08.910
I've collected over the years.
And now I'm doing podcasts on there.

2418
02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:11.580
The Abby Martin experience now.
Just kidding.
Um,

2419
02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:15.740
<v 0>why not name it was biting you?
Um,
yeah.</v>

2420
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:17.460
You want to just call it fuck Chris.
Kyle.

2421
02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:26.070
Imagine if you had a podcast and you call it that.
Holy Shit.

2422
02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:27.900
Talk about Click Bait.
Yeah,

2423
02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:33.250
<v 4>I'm definitely leave a comment section,
right.
I never got,
yeah.</v>

2424
02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:36.950
Chris fans or
people who,

2425
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:40.700
when I've made fun of Bill Cosby,
people get really pissed off.
It's Bill Cosby,

2426
02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:41.600
Cosby,

2427
02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:46.600
Chris Kyle fans get real upset more as much as Chris Kyle or less.

2428
02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:52.280
Less,
but still very like upset for some reason.

2429
02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:55.430
You never made fun of Chris Kyle on this podcast before though.
This is,

2430
02:19:55.431 --> 02:19:59.210
can I get an open it?
Yeah.
This is going to open up that camp.
We'll pass.
Yeah.

2431
02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:04.400
Get oldest leftist girl and let her know what I think.

2432
02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:08.630
<v 2>I think we need to get rid of these,
uh,
divisive labels left,
right?
Democrat,</v>

2433
02:20:08.631 --> 02:20:10.520
Republican.
Do not put yourself in a camp.

2434
02:20:10.521 --> 02:20:13.550
Do not capitulate your values to endorse people that you don't,

2435
02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:16.220
don't wholeheartedly agree with.
We have other parties.

2436
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:20.060
We have a local referendums.
That's where things are happening on a local level.

2437
02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:23.720
So as much as there's this like fascist takeover on the federal level,

2438
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:26.630
people get it.
They're voting for same sex marriage,

2439
02:20:26.631 --> 02:20:28.130
they're voting for marijuana legalization,

2440
02:20:28.131 --> 02:20:30.830
they're voting to repeal shit like civil asset forfeiture.

2441
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:33.260
All of these things will only happen locally.

2442
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:37.190
And if the DOJ or federal government wants to,
you know,
usurp peoples' rights,

2443
02:20:37.191 --> 02:20:39.530
then at least it will be really obvious where they have to say like,

2444
02:20:39.531 --> 02:20:41.540
we don't care what you voted for.
We're going to do this anyway.

2445
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:44.570
Then at least I'll be like completely obvious that there's like a coup that

2446
02:20:44.571 --> 02:20:45.404
happened.

2447
02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.740
But right now we can do all these things on a local level and it's also the

2448
02:20:48.741 --> 02:20:53.630
seismic sustainable shifts agriculturally.
Like all of these things.

2449
02:20:53.631 --> 02:20:58.070
I'm the organics residence,
sons' labeling.
These things can all be done locally.

2450
02:20:58.071 --> 02:21:00.980
Unfortunately.
If the transpacific partnership passes,

2451
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:06.610
then corporations will have the right to sue actual nations and overturned laws

2452
02:21:07.041 --> 02:21:08.870
that we pass.
Did you hear about this?

2453
02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:13.820
So there's a another trade deal coming and Obama's trying to fast track it

2454
02:21:13.821 --> 02:21:17.030
through Congress,
which is like he's going to bypass the congressional vote.

2455
02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:22.330
So we know how fucked up Nafta and CAFTA and all this shit was like a disastrous

2456
02:21:22.460 --> 02:21:26.300
right.
Has it just exacerbated poverty and crime across across the borders.

2457
02:21:26.301 --> 02:21:27.710
So now the transpacific partnership,

2458
02:21:27.711 --> 02:21:32.711
it's like this Asian Pacific trade deal between 12 Pacific island nations,

2459
02:21:33.501 --> 02:21:34.580
including the United States.

2460
02:21:34.581 --> 02:21:38.810
And what it's going to do is create an international court tribunals full of

2461
02:21:38.811 --> 02:21:41.870
lawyers and corporate CEOs and lobbyists.

2462
02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:46.220
The public has not had any sort of,
like they,
we have not seen the text,

2463
02:21:46.221 --> 02:21:48.830
the only text that has been released as through wikileaks of people leaking

2464
02:21:48.831 --> 02:21:50.390
these documents.
And it looks really bad.

2465
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:54.950
And what the court tribunals going to do is basically give corporations the

2466
02:21:54.951 --> 02:21:56.320
right to sue governments.
Like,

2467
02:21:56.330 --> 02:22:00.560
so let's say the United States finally passes a labeling law and we just like

2468
02:22:00.561 --> 02:22:02.360
want to label GMOs or something,

2469
02:22:02.390 --> 02:22:06.200
something to do with food or some sort of like intellectual property rights law.

2470
02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:08.900
They can just say,
you know,
you're hurting our profits.

2471
02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:11.520
Monsanto's profits are being hurt by the labeling laws,

2472
02:22:11.521 --> 02:22:13.160
so we're going to go ahead and overturn that.

2473
02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:17.510
And a lot of people are calling it a corporate coup d'etat because it's done

2474
02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:19.010
with completely no oversight.

2475
02:22:19.011 --> 02:22:23.390
There's no public input to this and Obama is trying to pass it through and every

2476
02:22:23.391 --> 02:22:24.440
time he gives a speech about it,

2477
02:22:24.441 --> 02:22:27.960
he just very briefly mentioned is like this trade deal and you're like,

2478
02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:31.830
this is probably the biggest thing going on right now that no one is talking

2479
02:22:31.831 --> 02:22:32.130
about.

2480
02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:35.760
And it goes back to the corporate media structure because why would they want to

2481
02:22:35.761 --> 02:22:39.630
talk about something that all of their benefactors are involved in?

2482
02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:42.990
It's really scary shit.
That's crazy.
Yeah,

2483
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:47.960
it's really as simple as that.
That is crazy.
Yeah.
One of the whole chapters,

2484
02:22:47.970 --> 02:22:50.530
and it's going to be like,
it's going to send more American jobs overseas.

2485
02:22:50.531 --> 02:22:52.320
It's going to make medicine costs higher.

2486
02:22:52.321 --> 02:22:55.260
It's like every single thing is going to be fucked up through this bill.

2487
02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:59.550
Intellectual property rights members Sopa the stop online piracy actors like

2488
02:22:59.551 --> 02:23:02.790
this huge thing.
Aaron Swartz before he died was just like,
this is terrible.

2489
02:23:02.791 --> 02:23:04.260
He was on the front front lines to feed it.

2490
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:09.150
TPP has a whole chapter on intellectual property rights that basically would

2491
02:23:09.151 --> 02:23:13.020
employ the worst aspects of Sopa.
Just blanketly.
So now Hollywood,

2492
02:23:13.050 --> 02:23:16.320
the industries are getting behind TPP wanting to pass it through because of that

2493
02:23:16.321 --> 02:23:21.090
chapter.
It's a mess and there's no debate like no one knows about this.

2494
02:23:21.450 --> 02:23:21.990
It's awful.

2495
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:26.430
When is this supposed to be fast track through like when it's like going to get

2496
02:23:26.431 --> 02:23:30.270
fast track through soon.
Yeah.
Trans Pacific partnership.

2497
02:23:31.050 --> 02:23:35.670
Largest trade agreement in American history.
Jesus Christ.
It's bad.

2498
02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:39.510
Oh Wow.
Look at an example.
Is the OP.
Oh,
I thought it was a Chris Christie.

2499
02:23:39.511 --> 02:23:43.200
I was like going back full circle.
Chris Christie's role.

2500
02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.650
He's a fast track and donuts to his fat face.

2501
02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:53.580
Yeah,
look,
the biggest problem,
the public doesn't know what's in the TVB.

2502
02:23:53.581 --> 02:23:55.920
The texts negotiated in secret hasn't been released.

2503
02:23:55.921 --> 02:23:59.790
If wiki leaks provided a sample,
it's unbelievable.
I mean,
it just like,
it just,

2504
02:23:59.940 --> 02:24:03.610
it just takes globalization to a whole new level.
Abby Martin,
I headed,

2505
02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:08.130
sorry to end on a bummer.
Oh,
I'm so sorry.
Are we over man?
I mean positive.

2506
02:24:08.131 --> 02:24:12.890
We can talk about before you leave.
Yeah,
I'm having to an art show this Friday.

2507
02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:16.260
Art Show inventory are shown.
Ventura.

2508
02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:23.290
Oh,
awesome.
People can get a zoom in on that.
Accused zoom.

2509
02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:26.140
I Jamie,
hold on.
So good.

2510
02:24:26.930 --> 02:24:31.380
Something that Martin gave me free.
Check it out.
It's at a place called the lab.

2511
02:24:31.470 --> 02:24:32.650
Um,
check it out in Ventura.

2512
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:37.700
I think that the positive takeaway is that there's so many people who are

2513
02:24:37.861 --> 02:24:41.790
likeminded out there and,
and we just got to free our minds,

2514
02:24:41.791 --> 02:24:46.020
open our consciousness,
do art,
do music,
get creative.
Put your voice out there.

2515
02:24:46.021 --> 02:24:48.030
Don't live in fear of the NSA.

2516
02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:51.090
Stop getting disillusioned and disempowered from the federal government's

2517
02:24:51.091 --> 02:24:55.590
ineptitude and like criminality and just live true.
Be True.

2518
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:58.950
Find like minds in your area because they're out there and it empowers you.

2519
02:24:58.951 --> 02:25:03.120
And it also motivates you to do shit locally.
That's at least how I feel.

2520
02:25:03.121 --> 02:25:06.420
I feel like we're so detached from each other and are like,
you know,

2521
02:25:06.421 --> 02:25:08.370
in our technological society,
everyone's on their phones.

2522
02:25:08.371 --> 02:25:10.740
No one talks to each other at the market.
But I think that if you did,

2523
02:25:10.741 --> 02:25:15.330
you'd find out that a lot of people think like you,
you can get on the same page,

2524
02:25:15.331 --> 02:25:16.800
you can make shit happen.
Man.

2525
02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:21.720
I think a lot of us feel like we're kind of trapped in this big gigantic system

2526
02:25:21.721 --> 02:25:24.340
that we don't really have a voice.
We don't really have a say.

2527
02:25:24.670 --> 02:25:28.180
<v 3>But when enough likeminded people get together,
then you do have a say.</v>

2528
02:25:28.330 --> 02:25:31.360
And that never been more evident than today.

2529
02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:34.030
Never been more evident as far as like the impact.

2530
02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:37.840
Like you remember when we were going to go into Syria and then Obama had that

2531
02:25:37.841 --> 02:25:39.510
big speech and you know,
gone to,

2532
02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:44.520
it was essentially like it's on and then the entire country went fuck that.

2533
02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:47.440
And then it stopped the all the rumbling stopped.

2534
02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:51.970
And coincidentally that's when the isis activity picked up right afterwards.

2535
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:52.771
And then all the sudden this is,

2536
02:25:52.771 --> 02:25:57.610
we have this real issue with Isis that was also involved in Syria and see we

2537
02:25:57.611 --> 02:25:59.080
told you these guys are bad.

2538
02:25:59.620 --> 02:26:04.620
I think what you're saying is like total hippy talk and a lot of people are

2539
02:26:05.001 --> 02:26:07.750
going to get really mad at you for it,
but you're right.
You know a lot of ways,

2540
02:26:07.751 --> 02:26:11.860
I mean this is just life.
It doesn't last that long and we're,

2541
02:26:11.861 --> 02:26:16.630
we're caught up in the lives of millions of people that have been lived before

2542
02:26:16.631 --> 02:26:21.631
us and the momentum of all the shitty decisions and all these bad choices and

2543
02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:27.000
and really corrupt ideas that have sort of facilitated the,

2544
02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:28.960
the system that's in place right now.

2545
02:26:28.990 --> 02:26:32.770
It's almost like we're born into this system that we don't have any control
over.

2546
02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:36.070
You just got to hone in on your passion and what speaks most to you and you

2547
02:26:36.071 --> 02:26:36.490
can't,

2548
02:26:36.490 --> 02:26:40.690
I mean you can't just live in constant misery of just how depressing the world

2549
02:26:40.691 --> 02:26:44.470
is and how fucked up everything is because we are winning the information war.

2550
02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:49.150
There is a global consciousness shift going on that is completely obvious and

2551
02:26:49.151 --> 02:26:51.400
you're either a part of it or you're not.
You know,

2552
02:26:51.401 --> 02:26:53.680
I wonder sometimes when I think about America,

2553
02:26:53.681 --> 02:26:56.590
because America has been around for just such a blip.

2554
02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:58.030
When you think about human history,

2555
02:26:58.210 --> 02:27:01.210
human history has been around for a blip in terms of world history,

2556
02:27:01.450 --> 02:27:04.270
but the United States is the real blip.
I mean,

2557
02:27:04.271 --> 02:27:08.080
1776 it's a fucking joke.
That's a couple hundred years ago.

2558
02:27:08.081 --> 02:27:09.640
That ain't shit right.
I mean,

2559
02:27:09.641 --> 02:27:14.641
that's amazing how short of a time that is and in that time and entirely new

2560
02:27:15.461 --> 02:27:17.650
nation has arisen.
And I always wonder like,

2561
02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:21.040
is there ever going to come a point in time where people were like,

2562
02:27:21.041 --> 02:27:22.660
fuck this place.

2563
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:27.400
And they do it in mass the same way they came to the new world.
You know,

2564
02:27:27.401 --> 02:27:31.060
I wonder if like my family all came from immigrants.

2565
02:27:31.061 --> 02:27:35.110
My grandparents on both sides came from other countries.
Yeah,
mostly Italy,

2566
02:27:35.111 --> 02:27:36.310
but a little bit Ireland too.

2567
02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:39.280
And it's because it sucked over there and they just,

2568
02:27:39.281 --> 02:27:44.140
they took a chance and moving to another fucking land.
And I always wonder,

2569
02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:48.460
like is it,
is it possible that in our lifetime or several lifetimes from now,

2570
02:27:48.461 --> 02:27:52.060
whenever it is that we find a spot and we all get together and go,
you know what,

2571
02:27:52.061 --> 02:27:56.820
fuck this.
Like you can't keep living like this.
And maybe if we do it,

2572
02:27:57.400 --> 02:27:59.230
we are,
they,
the people do.

2573
02:27:59.620 --> 02:28:03.400
It's going to be the same thing that happened when the British tried to take

2574
02:28:03.401 --> 02:28:06.670
back America.
And when we had the revolutionary war.
I mean

2575
02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:13.120
it almost seems like that's the only way things are ever going to change in

2576
02:28:13.121 --> 02:28:18.010
terms of like the way America was so radically different than the countries that

2577
02:28:18.011 --> 02:28:18.940
we departed from.

2578
02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:23.000
The countries that people immigrated from and came to America and the founding

2579
02:28:23.001 --> 02:28:26.660
fathers of our country.
Taja tried to establish this ideal environment,

2580
02:28:26.930 --> 02:28:28.610
wrote the constitution,
the bill of rights,

2581
02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:33.290
tried to make laws and rules that made sense,

2582
02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:38.530
that taking into account all the errors of the past and all of the shit that

2583
02:28:39.291 --> 02:28:41.510
they didn't want to deal with with Europe and with England,

2584
02:28:42.350 --> 02:28:45.380
create some sort of a new establishment,

2585
02:28:45.381 --> 02:28:48.430
some sort of a new nation.
And I,

2586
02:28:48.431 --> 02:28:50.720
I wonder if it's too late to do that again.

2587
02:28:51.010 --> 02:28:51.880
<v 2>I don't think it is.</v>

2588
02:28:51.881 --> 02:28:55.730
And I think that it's unfortunate that you have politicians now,
you know,

2589
02:28:55.900 --> 02:29:00.580
on the backs of the ashes of the monarchy that we rose out of now you have these

2590
02:29:00.581 --> 02:29:03.700
politicians protecting the last bastion of absolute monarchies in the world,

2591
02:29:03.701 --> 02:29:04.810
which is these Gulf states.

2592
02:29:05.230 --> 02:29:10.150
I think that once we realize that money is not what really makes us happy,

2593
02:29:10.690 --> 02:29:13.030
um,
and,
and unfortunately,

2594
02:29:13.031 --> 02:29:16.930
I just think a lot of people still don't understand that.
Um,
it's,

2595
02:29:16.931 --> 02:29:19.840
it's really drilled into us with a materialistic society that we live in.

2596
02:29:19.841 --> 02:29:23.890
But if people would understand that happiness comes from something much deeper,

2597
02:29:23.891 --> 02:29:28.630
and that's why you people on absolute destitute poverty can be happier than the

2598
02:29:28.631 --> 02:29:29.830
richest person in the world.

2599
02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:33.580
<v 3>Well,
they say Mexico.
It's one of the happiest countries in the world,</v>

2600
02:29:33.970 --> 02:29:37.780
but yet one of the poorest countries in the world.
And if you go to Mexico,

2601
02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:40.870
so it's just such a laid back sort of invite.
I mean,

2602
02:29:40.871 --> 02:29:44.740
everybody has this idea of Mexico based on the border states and the border

2603
02:29:44.741 --> 02:29:47.680
cities and the drug war,
which is because,

2604
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:54.120
<v 4>and she goes,
well,
I'm fucking insatiable desire.
Whoa.
Oh,</v>

2605
02:29:54.330 --> 02:29:58.890
they already have a shirt because America,
that's incredible.
That's amazing.

2606
02:29:58.891 --> 02:30:00.030
The shirt already exists.

2607
02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:03.240
<v 3>Hmm.
Of course.
Of course exist.
Why would I think,
yeah,</v>

2608
02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:05.630
<v 2>didn't exactly.
Yep.
Absolutely.
There's probably one that says,</v>

2609
02:30:05.631 --> 02:30:08.900
because Chris Kyle America,
that's the way to,
well that's coming.

2610
02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:11.780
It's going to be your,
your face on it.
Um,

2611
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:14.570
I wanted to talk more about [inaudible] about this cold war stuff that we'll

2612
02:30:14.571 --> 02:30:15.590
have to do that next time.

2613
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:19.220
Hopefully we can hold off on going to war with Russia in the meantime.

2614
02:30:19.370 --> 02:30:21.250
Do you think we will?
Do you really think we are there?

2615
02:30:21.260 --> 02:30:24.890
We're in danger of going to war with Russia.
I think that you have a lot of,
uh,

2616
02:30:25.130 --> 02:30:29.360
Warhawks that are on that side of the aisle who now want to shift the

2617
02:30:29.390 --> 02:30:34.350
conversation to really aggressive posturing with Russia.
It's very obvious.
Um,

2618
02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:37.640
the Middle East has already destroyed and now Russia and China are the next big

2619
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:39.760
prizes.
Um,
I think that they're,

2620
02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:42.750
they're very threatened by Russia even though I don't know why,
cause we're,

2621
02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:45.110
Russia is not a really big,
strong economic force,

2622
02:30:45.350 --> 02:30:48.800
but I think it also perpetuates that enemy,
right?
To have an enemy,

2623
02:30:48.801 --> 02:30:50.300
to keep the military industrial complex,

2624
02:30:50.301 --> 02:30:53.750
turning to keep this kind of like cold war bullshit going.

2625
02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:57.320
So people live in fear and there's nothing the establishment fears more than a

2626
02:30:57.321 --> 02:30:59.890
populace not living in fear.
Powerful left,

2627

Thank you.
Abby is always awesome talking to you.
I really appreciate it.

2636
02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:37.630
Let's do it more often now that you're free from the Russian shackles.
All right,

2637
02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:42.360
well we'll be back at six o'clock with Jim Norton and,

Bye,
bye.
