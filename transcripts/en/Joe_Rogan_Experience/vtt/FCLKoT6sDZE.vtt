49
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>A couple of incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a great idea man,</v>

50
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.163
<v Speaker 1>and in the future as things like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kidding on vice.com or these </v>

51
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 1>youtube pages that people just can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do your own show like that.</v>

52
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can,</v>

53
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>it can get gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like again,</v>

54
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.243
<v Speaker 1>it can get almost bigger than I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever get on tv because you can download </v>

55
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:30.904
<v Speaker 1>it and watch it anytime you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the issue I'm having right </v>

56
00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:33.574
<v Speaker 1>now because we've become such a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that we're now on vices television </v>

57
00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>network that is about to start on March </v>
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>

58
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean on February 29th called Viceland </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have some,</v>

59
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.233
<v Speaker 1>some quarrels about it to say the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's only going to be in North </v>

60
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.183
<v Speaker 1>America and I mean people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get what they want so obviously they're </v>

61
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:57.520
<v Speaker 1>going to download a touring or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do,</v>

62
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's necessary for it to be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube as stressed.</v>

63
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

64
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>necessary to be on youtube because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone needs access to it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We don't have to go to the TV,</v>

68
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.980
<v Speaker 1>see what time it comes on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but still it's the fucking process </v>

70
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.573
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:28.120

<v Speaker 1>like sit down bench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going to wait until he </v>

118
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.753
<v Speaker 1>trapped you playing automatically like </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing for you and Youtube does that </v>

119
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now things related,</v>

120
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>things that are slightly related you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would discuss.</v>

121
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean just from me to make music using </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube has become a pleasure.</v>

122
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.263
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a new age of digging in the </v>

123
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>crates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to search pages for rare shit</v>

124
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>and see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure no one,</v>

125
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.170
<v Speaker 1>no one else has used it and it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>never ending a catalog of musical talent</v>

126
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:14.050
<v Speaker 1>from all over the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now from blue,</v>

127
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>from the early opera singers shift from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can listen to anything from any.</v>

128
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.070
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

129
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 1>from the early 19 hundreds of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording somehow.</v>

130
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.750
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>

131
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane to think that they figured </v>

132
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:29.564
<v Speaker 1>out how to put sound on a black plastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>disk that made it so awesome and they </v>

133
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to do that when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>apes,</v>

134
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

135
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.660
<v Speaker 1>people were like in comparison to today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the amount of technology they had.</v>

136
00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Then it was like the early 18 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of figured out how to do that.</v>

137
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

138
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.363
<v Speaker 1>what year was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They invented the phonograph record </v>

139
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:50.744
<v Speaker 1>player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember they used to have that big </v>

140
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>hoop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you the hook,</v>

141
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.793
<v Speaker 1>the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tube and you have to look into </v>

142
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.893
<v Speaker 1>fucking churned it and he would sit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and the sound would come off the </v>

143
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.044
<v Speaker 1>record through that.</v>

144
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.480
<v Speaker 2>The thing before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking up right now in 18,</v>

145
00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:04.314
<v Speaker 2>77,</v>
<v Speaker 2>edison had this thing that the recorded </v>

146
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:07.960
<v Speaker 2>on tin foil shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks slow.</v>

147
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.893
<v Speaker 2>So when eight cylinders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a video from like tech tv where </v>

148
00:07:13.981 --> 00:07:17.790
<v Speaker 2>some guy drops one and it's like an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>viral video from the early wow.</v>

149
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He dropped it.</v>

150
00:07:19.921 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 2>And broke it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

151
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 2>fuck head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

152
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Coronet Solo.</v>

153
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that was done today,</v>

154
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd want my fucking money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

155
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.083
<v Speaker 1>you shitty audio engineer you foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you keep your phone in your </v>

156
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>pocket from there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but listening to that.</v>

157
00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:49.300
<v Speaker 1>It sounds good when you consider the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

158
00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:52.050
<v Speaker 1>It sounds amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the first phonograph?</v>

159
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.893
<v Speaker 1>What year was that invented?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't feel like it was the 18 </v>

160
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:57.250
<v Speaker 1>hundreds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I wrong?</v>

161
00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:58.084
<v Speaker 1>Or is it like way earlier than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was at the end of the 18 </v>

162
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.180
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end of it,</v>

163
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.920
<v Speaker 1>they used to use look so wild with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>big tube thing that came out of it,</v>

164
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.073
<v Speaker 1>but they haven't really figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it sound better than the record </v>

165
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:14.140
<v Speaker 1>does know what has the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>because some people say it's bullshit.</v>

166
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:14.974
<v Speaker 1>Some people say it's just fetishism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people who are real audio file </v>

167
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 1>type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

168
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.070
<v Speaker 1>they're all kind of agreed as like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kind of sound.</v>

169
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Well it's what everyone explains to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I understand there's a warmth.</v>

170
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a warmth to it every,</v>

171
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:31.394
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier on the ear then say the </v>

172
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:36.730
<v Speaker 1>electronic music in the digital should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have today,</v>

173
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.983
<v Speaker 1>so a little bit more harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest stuff was toned better and I </v>

174
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:43.090
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just the plastic.</v>

175
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:45.930
<v Speaker 1>The vinyl does something something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

176
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.870
<v Speaker 1>The page like audio freaks all seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree on that,</v>

177
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:50.704
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

178
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.693
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about tape </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording directly to two inch tape </v>

179
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.513
<v Speaker 1>using this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big machine nowadays we just go </v>

180
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:02.130
<v Speaker 1>right into the computer through </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

181
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like m box or so what?</v>

182
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>What Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

183
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.813
<v Speaker 1>You're one of the people that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it makes that much of a </v>

184
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

185
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Right now it's just up to what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At this point it's what you're hearing.</v>

186
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:14.394
<v Speaker 2>So like people today are trained to hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>things off of [inaudible] funds and </v>

187
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 2>itunes where it lists like mp3s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that compression.</v>

188
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 2>We're used to hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So being told that something else sounds</v>

189
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:24.534
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're trying to tell them </v>

190
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 2>they don't lean on the compression.</v>

191
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.223
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compression makes everything sound </v>

192
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.463
<v Speaker 1>smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is it possible that it's a more </v>

193
00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:35.410
<v Speaker 1>familiar sound?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that why?</v>

194
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.251
<v Speaker 2>SORTA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

195
00:09:36.251 --> 00:09:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Like they're even mixing things now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see it's mastered for itunes.</v>

196
00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It's mastered to be heard through those </v>
<v Speaker 2>little two ear buds,</v>

197
00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:44.260
<v Speaker 2>not through a giant's sound system at </v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

198
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Have giant speakers with subwoofers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely correct.</v>

199
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting personal.</v>

200
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.143
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one ever drives down the street </v>

201
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:53.431
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blessed.</v>

202
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:57.880
<v Speaker 1>And the music fuck happened to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

203
00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.353
<v Speaker 1>used to go when you got the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to have to go and buy the </v>

204
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 1>humongous speakers to put it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

205
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I think people start going deaf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

206
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.693
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're driving around with earplugs </v>

207
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 1>on and you're blasting music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a Douche move,</v>

208
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's so bad,</v>

209
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 1>it hurts your ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to put ear plugs in his.</v>

210
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 1>This guy in my neighborhood that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives around every Sunday in a piece of</v>

212

<v Speaker 1>the loudest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the loudest volume that could possibly </v>

<v Speaker 1>Those people that go crazy with the sub </v>

219
00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:48.810
<v Speaker 1>woofers to the point where you feel it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the air around you.</v>

223
00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:59.130
<v Speaker 1>ship?</v>

224
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.700
<v Speaker 1>If you sit in the back seat with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Subwoofer is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Especially if you play like dipset of </v>

228

<v Speaker 1>something like some sort of a,</v>

<v Speaker 3>nobody wishes that on somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're a driver and you're</v>

350
00:16:58.201 --> 00:16:59.560
<v Speaker 3>like me.</v>

351
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.200
<v Speaker 3>pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would've never happened if I was at</v>

352
00:17:01.201 --> 00:17:01.740
<v Speaker 3>the wheel.</v>

<v Speaker 3>of drives.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's his page and I don't feel so good</v>

401
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.370
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was holding on.</v>

402
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.130
<v Speaker 3>The blood was thick ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy.</v>

403
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.173
<v Speaker 3>He's got with one arm and he's hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>with one arm and he's like a mile in </v>

404
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:22.320
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

405
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.273
<v Speaker 3>stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's.</v>

406
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

407
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.343
<v Speaker 3>Cut it off.</v>

408
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:29.690
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>

409
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

410
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.100
<v Speaker 3>Flint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My God.</v>

411
00:19:36.101 --> 00:19:38.890
<v Speaker 3>He just jumped from one building to </v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

412
00:19:38.891 --> 00:19:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not even a running start.</v>

413
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.950
<v Speaker 3>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>

414
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.820
<v Speaker 3>How does he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would splatter.</v>

415
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.250
<v Speaker 3>I would never make it that far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's he making it that far?</v>

416
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.333
<v Speaker 3>He has some good thrust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The momentum than the thrust and that </v>

417
00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 3>seems like an insane amount of distance </v>
<v Speaker 3>to travel,</v>

418
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:05.060
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck does he judge that?</v>

419
00:20:05.061 --> 00:20:09.340
<v Speaker 3>How does he jump and land like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a crazy one.</v>

420
00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Look at Jamie's face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

421
00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.170
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

422
00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:19.171
<v Speaker 3>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just jumps across a building.</v>

423
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.240
<v Speaker 3>How is that possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

424
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.350
<v Speaker 3>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of his favorite jumps in</v>

425
00:20:30.351 --> 00:20:35.351
<v Speaker 3>the city apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on son.</v>

426
00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 3>And you know like this doesn't make any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't make any sense.</v>

427
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

428
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.610
<v Speaker 3>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I could,</v>

429
00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When skateboarding,</v>

430
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:51.010
<v Speaker 3>like once Tony Hawk does the 900,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you see it done,</v>

431
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 3>everyone else can just start doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just looked.</v>

432
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm shocked by the distance he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>covering I guess.</v>

433
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.270
<v Speaker 3>I guess what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

434
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.400
<v Speaker 6>the distance of one building.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

435
00:21:02.401 --> 00:21:03.840
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's far away,</v>

436
00:21:03.841 --> 00:21:04.674
<v Speaker 6>but it's also higher.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So in his leap if he get a good </v>

437
00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:10.680
<v Speaker 6>spraying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his arc will carry him over,</v>

438
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.850
<v Speaker 6>but he's got a judge that perfectly like</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to you.</v>

439
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.960
<v Speaker 6>There's no room for error whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is what it looks like sideways.</v>

440
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.210
<v Speaker 6>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To look out far.</v>

441
00:21:21.211 --> 00:21:22.050
<v Speaker 6>He's jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

442
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:22.913
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's an insane amount of space he's </v>

443
00:21:25.411 --> 00:21:27.510
<v Speaker 6>covering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When it lands on that edge,</v>

444
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.080
<v Speaker 6>like that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he must be like.</v>

445
00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how much you ways,</v>

446
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.073
<v Speaker 6>but he must be insanely strong for his </v>
<v Speaker 6>weight and he can just throw his body </v>

447
00:21:37.831 --> 00:21:38.664
<v Speaker 6>through the air like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He must have just ridiculous explosion </v>

448
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.890
<v Speaker 6>out of his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Land so lightly.</v>

449
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.133
<v Speaker 6>That's freakish shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess it's those things like if you </v>

450
00:21:49.171 --> 00:21:54.060
<v Speaker 6>just concentrate on only doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can do it in a way that doesn't make</v>

451
00:21:54.061 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 6>sense to someone like you or me or.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

452
00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 3>I can't even ice skate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skate at all.</v>

453
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.080
<v Speaker 3>Well fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

454
00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.490

<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking again.</v>

455

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

456
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Good day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

457
00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:14.624
<v Speaker 3>I can't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoot when I don't have my own ice </v>

458
00:22:16.341 --> 00:22:17.174
<v Speaker 3>skates so I have to rent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ice Skates is for the same reason why I </v>

459
00:22:19.461 --> 00:22:20.210
<v Speaker 3>couldn't answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

460
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.940
<v Speaker 3>For years I can rent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are fucking shitty.</v>

461
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.430
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not even just that my feet are</v>
<v Speaker 3>too wide,</v>

462
00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.620
<v Speaker 3>so if I had a regular size 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my feet,</v>

463
00:22:27.621 --> 00:22:28.454

<v Speaker 3>monkey when it was fucking big foot one </v>

464
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.453
<v Speaker 3>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you shouldn't be able to fuck </v>

465

<v Speaker 3>monkeys anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone just went back in for one more </v>

466
00:22:38.601 --> 00:22:41.210
<v Speaker 3>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked them monkey guaranteed.</v>

467
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:46.270
<v Speaker 3>It was like the last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like last call evolution last car in one</v>

468
00:22:46.671 --> 00:22:49.700
<v Speaker 3>of my ancestors just snuck back in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut one more nut off.</v>

469
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my feet are just too wide,</v>

470
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.953
<v Speaker 3>so I get in those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just in agony and I just never </v>

471
00:22:55.851 --> 00:22:56.684
<v Speaker 3>learned how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not gonna I'm not interesting </v>

472
00:22:58.491 --> 00:23:00.200
<v Speaker 3>enough for me to go out and buy ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>skates,</v>

473
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.060
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like this is it.</v>

474
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.923
<v Speaker 3>It's just something I have to conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I would have to learn how to ice </v>

475
00:23:05.661 --> 00:23:08.000
<v Speaker 3>skate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was much more exciting as a youth.</v>

476
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking roller.</v>

477
00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.383
<v Speaker 3>Not Roller blading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking ice skating to green day shit </v>

478
00:23:14.781 --> 00:23:15.950
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

479
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.100
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They play loud music and you spin around</v>

480
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.140
<v Speaker 3>the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

481
00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.270
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess hockey would be the reason to do</v>

482
00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:27.104
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you wanted to learn how to play </v>

483
00:23:27.741 --> 00:23:28.574
<v Speaker 3>hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say you pretend you're doing hockey </v>

484
00:23:30.261 --> 00:23:31.094
<v Speaker 3>moves and like you're on the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snowing when you stop and you throw the </v>

485
00:23:35.121 --> 00:23:38.900
<v Speaker 3>snow of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that that's a cool move.</v>

486
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:39.651
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

487
00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:40.484
<v Speaker 3>So you were the hockey skates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely don't where the figure </v>

488
00:23:42.981 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 3>skating ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No chance.</v>

489
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

490
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.510
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

491
00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:50.650
<v Speaker 3>they had the spikes in the front so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do the triple toe Lutz.</v>

492
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.023
<v Speaker 3>You know anybody what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want anybody seeing your </v>

493
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 3>spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna.</v>

494
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.073
<v Speaker 3>When you go straight you have to lift a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit and you're going to fall on </v>

495
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 3>your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hockey is a little curvature,</v>

496
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 3>like a running shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just allows you to maneuver,</v>

497
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:09.230
<v Speaker 3>to dice so it allows you to maneuver </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

498
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:11.360
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't allow you to do tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't do.</v>

499
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:16.370
<v Speaker 3>You can't do a stop and then tripled </v>
<v Speaker 3>toilets or like Scott Hamilton flip.</v>

500
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.360
<v Speaker 3>So were they doing flips and when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>do those spins on the ice?</v>

501
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 3>They doing them with like special </v>
<v Speaker 3>skates?</v>

502
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Is that what the deal is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show a Brian Boitano.</v>

516
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.310

<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 92.</v>

00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:34.520
<v Speaker 3>I didn't move here until [inaudible] 94.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know that I got it.</v>

527
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.623
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was living in Encino because I </v>

528
00:25:36.861 --> 00:25:38.810
<v Speaker 3>remember popping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when a friend came over,</v>

529
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.860
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had a ball.</v>

530
00:25:42.861 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 3>He hit a lend you the tape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody gave it to me.</v>

531
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:46.064
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember how I got the tape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember somebody gave it to me </v>

532
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:48.980
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta watch this.</v>

533
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:50.203
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I remember popping into VCR for my </v>

534
00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:55.580
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so ridiculous.</v>

535
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 3>It was super funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really crude.</v>

536
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.510
<v Speaker 3>I almost wish he would go back to doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it this way,</v>

537
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:03.853
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was so obvious that it was </v>

538
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.740
<v Speaker 3>just really shitty animation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

539
00:26:09.741 --> 00:26:12.080
<v Speaker 3>look at the mouth movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more,</v>

540
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.540
<v Speaker 3>it's still shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's more sophisticated now.</v>

541
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just did shitty.</v>

542
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a,</v>

543
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I bet the amount of time it took to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

544
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.630
<v Speaker 3>It's probably ridiculous though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

545
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:24.543
<v Speaker 3>like the team America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he said he would never do a one </v>

546
00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:31.340
<v Speaker 3>of those movies again because it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just way too time consuming.</v>

547
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was a pretty incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking movie.</v>

548
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.060
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my favorites ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

549
00:26:37.061 --> 00:26:37.894
<v Speaker 3>That's one of my all time favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about like movies that </v>

550
00:26:41.241 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 3>are funnier than tropic thunder and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

551
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:44.663
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

552
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.150
<v Speaker 1>probably none are funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in moments I,</v>

553
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 1>it's as funny as a movie gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's other really funny movies to</v>

554
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 1>teach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the funniest of all time.</v>

555
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.320
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the funniest.</v>

556
00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.660
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid funny movie team America to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zulu lenders.</v>

557
00:27:04.171 --> 00:27:05.610

<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

593
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.660
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was like 18,</v>

594
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.513
<v Speaker 1>I went to culinary school and fucked off</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that for about a year and a half </v>

595
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.900
<v Speaker 1>or two and had a child and went back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the kitchen and started working and</v>

596
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.513
<v Speaker 1>that was just said I thought I was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a fucking short order cook </v>

597
00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:02.580
<v Speaker 1>or chef or whatever for the rest of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life out of nowhere.</v>

<v Speaker 1>exhibition with Mario Vitale,</v>

624
00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 1>but he was in no condition to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything with me that day.</v>

625
00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up just hanging out pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much at the beach the whole time.</v>

626
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.653
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mario and he got fucked up pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

628
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:30.403
<v Speaker 1>I was hanging out with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we were just sitting at the bar </v>

629
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:33.760
<v Speaker 1>hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing well.</v>

631
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.370
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't feel like doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just wanted to hang out.</v>

632
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:41.080
<v Speaker 1>The weather was too good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

633
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.690

<v Speaker 1>The weather was just too beautiful.</v>

634
00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 1>So he just didn't want to participate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a show,</v>

635
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.160
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

00:31:19.511 --> 00:31:21.510
<v Speaker 1>fucking kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to cook the shit out.</v>

647
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.353

<v Speaker 1>He's like a fucking superstar.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy to world.</v>

652
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.230
<v Speaker 1>The world of chefs is a very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

653
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:39.640
<v Speaker 1>And when I was younger I didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it like as an art form.</v>

654
00:31:39.641 --> 00:31:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I think I just thought it was almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like a,</v>

655
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

656
00:31:47.441 --> 00:31:49.390
<v Speaker 1>to make really good food because you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to that restaurant,</v>

657
00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:53.470
<v Speaker 1>you can get it there and didn't think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who is the creator of that food and</v>

658
00:31:53.471 --> 00:31:55.330
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that an art form?</v>

659
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it definitely is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

669

<v Speaker 1>guy with a handkerchief around his neck </v>

670
00:32:25.601 --> 00:32:26.434
<v Speaker 1>and a big hat.</v>

673
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:33.694

<v Speaker 1>Bourdain's show that definitely become </v>

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:13.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they do now,</v>

814
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 3>but back in the day none of them were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about how they did steroids.</v>

815
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 3>You're right there all dancing around </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

816
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.240
<v Speaker 3>but they were also talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

817
00:39:22.241 --> 00:39:23.074
<v Speaker 3>I take creatine muscled Dick hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation and let's a team is </v>

818
00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:29.374
<v Speaker 3>guaranteed to pack on 30 pounds a mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were all like pretending that </v>

819
00:39:33.401 --> 00:39:37.030
<v Speaker 3>they got all that muscle from some stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

820
00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like barely works.</v>

821
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Like creatine works a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you get to the Paul delay levels,</v>

822
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't look like that as like a human</v>

823
00:39:47.021 --> 00:39:48.280
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't look like that.</v>

824
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:50.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

825
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.363
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think I understand why the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck they used to not talk about it </v>

826
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.520
<v Speaker 3>while I was just so taboo because it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>

827
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 3>It was legal and everyone knows what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>

828
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like more out in the open now with </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the baseball shit and this.</v>

829
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that it's wrong.</v>

830
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Every baseball player he looks like now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

831
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks like a meme that you know,</v>

832
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.450
<v Speaker 3>that looks like something on the Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

833
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.200
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it say above that,</v>

834
00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:21.034
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He already experienced some atrophy in </v>

835
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:25.780
<v Speaker 3>his arms and back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>

836
00:40:25.781 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 3>What had happened to him says he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly off anabolics and stuff.</v>

837
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

838
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

839
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that guy,</v>

840
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:38.283
<v Speaker 3>when he was as big as he was at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had to be on just staggering amounts </v>

841
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:44.344
<v Speaker 3>of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people don't understand </v>

842
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.890
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You even if you.</v>

843
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I do know one dude though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to be honest.</v>

844
00:40:50.441 --> 00:40:54.610
<v Speaker 3>I know one dude that I know who never </v>
<v Speaker 3>took anything.</v>

845
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I know he didn't because he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't even eat vitamins.</v>

846
00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.193
<v Speaker 3>I eat all his vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very smart guy and he got really </v>

847
00:41:01.271 --> 00:41:03.010
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like ridiculous.</v>

848
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:05.020
<v Speaker 3>He was my friend Brian Frazier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a writer.</v>

849
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.453
<v Speaker 3>He's a comic out of Boston and at one </v>
<v Speaker 3>point in time he was fucking enormous </v>

850
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:13.090
<v Speaker 3>and I know all he did was work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all he did.</v>

851
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.133
<v Speaker 3>He was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dedicated bodybuilder dedicated to </v>

852
00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 3>lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was fucking gigantic.</v>

853
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.540
<v Speaker 3>And so he was cleaning out those </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetics,</v>

854
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.590
<v Speaker 3>but he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

855
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.710
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just dedicated,</v>

856
00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 3>just dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just dedicated hard work.</v>

857
00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:29.750
<v Speaker 3>And he got it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read it,</v>

858
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.710
<v Speaker 3>read it while I was entering </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitions.</v>

859
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.580
<v Speaker 3>He was ridiculously</v>

860
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.430
<v Speaker 1>swoll so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that one time you went up on stage,</v>

861
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.080
<v Speaker 1>he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

862
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.003
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a golf shirt on like an alligator </v>

863
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:44.180
<v Speaker 1>shirt and he came off stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pulled him aside and said,</v>

864
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:44.920
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to me.</v>

865
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't go on or short sleeve shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

866
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:48.540
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

867
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.130
<v Speaker 1>your arms are way too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Too distracting me.</v>

868
00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm your friend and that distracted me.</v>

869
00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're up there like,</v>

870
00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:58.660
<v Speaker 1>you're so intimidating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crazy because he's,</v>

871
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 1>he was so swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

872
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:01.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't go on stage like that.</v>

873
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's how I wanted to be at</v>

874
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 1>one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's what I wanted.</v>

875
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's this.</v>

876
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the height thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to be wired that way and because</v>

877
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:12.134
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know a little bit shorter than the </v>

878
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.780
<v Speaker 1>normal men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be.</v>

879
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't go north south,</v>

880
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.830
<v Speaker 1>but I think that if you really wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it though,</v>

881
00:42:24.831 --> 00:42:26.090
<v Speaker 1>you would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

882
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you would be dedicated to it and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to do it.</v>

883
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:29.234
<v Speaker 1>You get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those things where you </v>

884
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:31.784
<v Speaker 1>want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also like a guy who really </v>

885
00:42:33.471 --> 00:42:37.900
<v Speaker 1>enjoys life and there's too many things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have to be dedicated to math.</v>

886
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.823
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not to be dedicated to music to </v>

887
00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:42.131
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

888
00:42:42.131 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking everybody family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

889
00:42:44.721 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how many more things I have to.</v>

890
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.450
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you do decide to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

891
00:42:50.451 --> 00:42:51.284
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really the true thing that a lot of </v>

892
00:42:54.021 --> 00:42:54.854
<v Speaker 1>people that we're trying to avoid when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to losing weight or changing </v>

893
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.333
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have to be dedicated to </v>

894
00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:00.590
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

895
00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.240
<v Speaker 1>It can't be something to do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

896
00:43:02.241 --> 00:43:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm dedicated to my music.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I'm out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

900
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:12.920
<v Speaker 1>you have to be dead gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has to be your main goal in life is</v>

901
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:15.140
<v Speaker 1>to be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to focus on that.</v>

902
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Pissed to one of them are going to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to change your chemistry and when people</v>

903

<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking impressive.</v>

904
00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:22.183
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people have you met that have </v>

905
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 1>lost like a hundred pounds and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to just shake their hand and go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's one truck and a bad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>My fluctuation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

910
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.130

<v Speaker 1>I mean I know you love food,</v>

911
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:44.180
<v Speaker 1>but if you ever thought about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing the kinds of foods you eat.</v>

912
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's the defined foods that I eat.</v>

915
00:43:49.431 --> 00:43:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the refined sugars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting shit that I decided to eat.</v>

916
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.150

<v Speaker 1>My friend Aubrey has the best way of </v>

928
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:27.464
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about it and he was </v>

929
00:44:28.641 --> 00:44:29.474
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy that just just a few </v>

930
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:32.034
<v Speaker 1>moments of mouth pleasure is worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking up your entire body like your </v>

931
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:37.134
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that carries you around in </v>

932
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:39.294
<v Speaker 1>this light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you need more than </v>

933
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 1>anything and just for a few moments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

934
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long,</v>

935
00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.440
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

936
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.290
<v Speaker 1>and then you feel in your whole body </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

937
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:53.360
<v Speaker 1>what did you just throw in here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And have us deal with you ass crazy.</v>

938
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking nuts.</v>

939
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:58.950
<v Speaker 1>What a cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick,</v>

940
00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.873
<v Speaker 1>fucked up joke nature has played on us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the things that are the most </v>

941
00:45:03.391 --> 00:45:07.150
<v Speaker 1>delicious going down the worst for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body out.</v>

942
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:08.243
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I want our current nature is they </v>

943
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 1>just dirty guts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a bitch you imagine man,</v>

944
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:21.231
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're eating fried chicken with</v>

945
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:23.120
<v Speaker 1>waffles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

946
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:24.143
<v Speaker 1>Fried chicken with waffles is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most fucking bang up meals America's </v>

947
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:28.044
<v Speaker 1>ever created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a good solid to put butter on the </v>

948
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:34.110
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course like Roscoe's Roscoe's chicken</v>

949
00:45:34.111 --> 00:45:34.944
<v Speaker 1>and waffles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the sheer amount of sugar you are </v>

950
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:38.424
<v Speaker 1>taken in with the want drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to have a diet </v>

951
00:45:44.581 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 1>coke.</v>

952
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.760
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get the fucking the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Koolaid.</v>

953
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:54.990
<v Speaker 1>What is sense it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an orange drink.</v>

954
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Red Drink and yellow drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mixed is throw them all together.</v>

955
00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:01.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking stupid.</v>

956
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.113
<v Speaker 1>But then if you want to get nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you throw butter on the fried </v>

957
00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 1>chicken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maple Syrup definitely.</v>

958
00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.340
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to have the grits as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well that has made butter in it.</v>

959
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.553
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

960
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.513
<v Speaker 1>it's like when does it end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the issue is the sheer grams of </v>

961
00:46:19.891 --> 00:46:24.690
<v Speaker 1>sugar you're taking in from the waffle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Maple Syrup alone,</v>

962
00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 1>you must be taking in an ungodly amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sugar.</v>

963
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straight off that stuff.</v>

964
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I drench those things to the way</v>

965
00:46:33.751 --> 00:46:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if I'm having some maple syrup</v>

966
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Be covered.</v>

967
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I went in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

968
00:46:38.611 --> 00:46:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to drizzle it and go.</v>

969
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I wish I would've had a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>maple syrup,</v>

970
00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:43.380
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sensible enough.</v>

971
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

972
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.133
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating Roscoe's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it probably already made some </v>

973
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.470
<v Speaker 1>critical errors and you're doing a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>dire right now.</v>

974
00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

975
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:55.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

976
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:57.690
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even have a cheat day.</v>

977
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to.</v>

978
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I had a beer yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

979
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Like it's supposed to have beer but </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

980
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.540
<v Speaker 1>See you didn't go all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a cheat day,</v>

981
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.560
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

982
00:47:07.561 --> 00:47:08.394
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gone all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just decided to try it for 60 days </v>

983
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.980
<v Speaker 1>and you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

984
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to just see what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

985
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you really evaluate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've,</v>

986
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.553
<v Speaker 1>I've been eating pretty healthy but one </v>
<v Speaker 1>way my whole life and I took some time </v>

987
00:47:23.251 --> 00:47:26.010
<v Speaker 1>off of gluten for awhile and I liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

988
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.590
<v Speaker 1>but what I liked about it was that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like really what was going on was I</v>

989
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>was just taking</v>

990
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.130
<v Speaker 6>in way less sugar by not having pastas </v>
<v Speaker 6>and breads,</v>

991
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:33.964
<v Speaker 6>which I really love.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just taking them way less sugar </v>

992
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.500
<v Speaker 6>and I lost weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My face got thinner and I was like,</v>

993
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:41.980
<v Speaker 6>this is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like how much of what I'm taking in</v>

994
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:42.843
<v Speaker 6>is sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I went back to occasionally eating </v>

995
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:50.551
<v Speaker 6>bread and just trying to avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then from the last 15 or maybe 16,</v>

996
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 6>15 days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that,</v>

997
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.600
<v Speaker 6>I've been doing this where I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>

998
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.760
<v Speaker 6>No grains,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no pasta,</v>

999
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 6>no bread,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no sugar,</v>

1000
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's just nothing other than plants,</v>

1001
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:05.290
<v Speaker 6>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fats,</v>

1002
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.300
<v Speaker 6>coconut oil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit like that and meet.</v>

1003
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.280
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's Kinda like that.</v>

1004
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of like the Atkins died from </v>
<v Speaker 6>back in the day,</v>

1005
00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:13.930
<v Speaker 6>right where you just sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But more fats,</v>

1006
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.930
<v Speaker 6>fats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fats even than proteins.</v>

1007
00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:17.764
<v Speaker 6>It's actually what the Diet is saying is</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we use too much protein and that </v>

1008
00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:23.243
<v Speaker 6>like if you want to do some extreme </v>
<v Speaker 6>power lifting and you want to get to be </v>

1009
00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:29.710
<v Speaker 6>the size of Paul dillet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>delay,</v>

1010
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.200
<v Speaker 6>delay those Arnold Schwartzenegger.</v>

1011
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 6>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You gotta you know you have to eat a lot</v>

1012
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:38.200
<v Speaker 6>more than the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but for the average person,</v>

1013
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:40.210
<v Speaker 6>the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like reasonably athletic.</v>

1014
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:41.103
<v Speaker 6>You'll probably doesn't really want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>process all that extra protein and what </v>

1015
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.273
<v Speaker 6>it really needs to burn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fats and so your body will convert </v>

1016
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:50.913
<v Speaker 6>anything in the energy that you put.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you live off of a carbohydrate based </v>

1017
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:55.804
<v Speaker 6>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their argument is you know you're </v>

1018
00:48:56.981 --> 00:49:00.670
<v Speaker 6>subject to more fluctuations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're your levels,</v>

1019
00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:01.504
<v Speaker 6>rise and fall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when you crash after you eat and </v>

1020
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:06.310
<v Speaker 6>when you know you haven't eaten in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>while,</v>

1021
00:49:06.311 --> 00:49:07.144
<v Speaker 6>you're starving and a lot of that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think is also related to gut bacteria </v>

1022
00:49:10.361 --> 00:49:12.100
<v Speaker 6>and I'm starting to learn more about </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1023
00:49:12.101 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 6>but not enough really where I can talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>probiotic stuff,</v>

1024
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:16.720
<v Speaker 6>probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gut bacteria,</v>

1025
00:49:16.721 --> 00:49:19.510
<v Speaker 6>and just the amount of different things </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you eat,</v>

1026
00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.830
<v Speaker 6>like what?</v>

1027
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:26.480
<v Speaker 6>There's certain types of gut bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 6>that thrive off of unhealthy food and if</v>

1028
00:49:26.681 --> 00:49:27.514
<v Speaker 6>you're eating a lot of sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently what they're saying is that </v>

1029
00:49:30.101 --> 00:49:30.934
<v Speaker 6>there's different types of gut bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 6>that crave that sugar and so when you </v>

1030
00:49:35.081 --> 00:49:37.020
<v Speaker 6>haven't had in awhile that gut back to </v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1031
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:40.990
<v Speaker 6>even if you're full,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might have like pot roast and mashed</v>

1032
00:49:40.991 --> 00:49:43.450
<v Speaker 6>potatoes and vegetables and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>

1033
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 6>Nothing fucked up at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1034
00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:47.050
<v Speaker 6>You eat that and your body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey asshole,</v>

1035
00:49:47.051 --> 00:49:48.490
<v Speaker 6>where's the sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Come on,</v>

1036
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:50.620
<v Speaker 6>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because they're craving craving it.</v>

1037
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:54.280
<v Speaker 6>Like those rumbles that you would get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I don't know what.</v>

1038
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:58.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if that's the case with me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I'm just giving it 60 hold days,</v>

1039
00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 6>see what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1040
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:04.150
<v Speaker 6>And if I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I like how I'm feeling after 60 days,</v>

1041
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.790
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you right now though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just a couple of weeks in.</v>

1042
00:50:06.791 --> 00:50:08.260
<v Speaker 6>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel great.</v>

1043
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.140
<v Speaker 6>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1044
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.480
<v Speaker 6>I feel I don't feel very hungry in </v>
<v Speaker 6>between meals,</v>

1045
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:14.314
<v Speaker 6>which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So go eat and then I guess once you get </v>

1046
00:50:18.041 --> 00:50:20.860
<v Speaker 6>fat adapted you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just don't have as many crashes.</v>

1047
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:24.430
<v Speaker 6>I just don't know if it's like what I </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to do sustainably because it's hard</v>

1048
00:50:24.431 --> 00:50:26.590
<v Speaker 6>when you go to a restaurant or something</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

1049
00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:28.000
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to tell them he</v>

1050
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:29.223
<v Speaker 1>can't even have rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of delicious deep </v>

1051
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.963
<v Speaker 1>dishes that come with Rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't even have rice with a </v>

1052
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:36.590
<v Speaker 1>meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that seems so extreme.</v>

1053
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.230
<v Speaker 1>So unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so far so good.</v>

1054
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Every time have attempted to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

1055
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 1>It was like I did that Atkins Diet back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the day,</v>

1056
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:45.554
<v Speaker 1>but it felt like I'm eating eggs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sausage and all this nasty shit and </v>

1057
00:50:50.271 --> 00:50:51.770
<v Speaker 1>still losing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1058
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:53.143
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I fucking ate a piece of bread and </v>

1059
00:50:55.611 --> 00:50:56.444
<v Speaker 1>it would be over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put five pounds on [inaudible] not </v>

1060
00:50:58.761 --> 00:50:59.470
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

1061
00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:00.303
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you feel shittier than you did </v>

1062
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.220
<v Speaker 1>because you gain all that weight and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ate all that disgusting stuff that's got</v>

1063
00:51:06.221 --> 00:51:07.670
<v Speaker 1>to be sticking to somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1064
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:09.283
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just hard for your body to process </v>

1065
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:11.063
<v Speaker 1>exact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become sugar and not fucking makes you </v>

1066
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.090
<v Speaker 1>shit really badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really badly rich.</v>

1067
00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't leave the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to run to the fucking bad.</v>

1068
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.630
<v Speaker 1>But the Atkins is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1069
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:24.643
<v Speaker 1>a little bit different than this start </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm doing and that this guy just </v>

1070
00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 1>has more fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you still go into that same thing,</v>

1071
00:51:30.231 --> 00:51:31.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To ketosis.</v>

1072
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:35.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what they want you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the point of these guides.</v>

1073
00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1074
00:51:37.221 --> 00:51:41.040
<v Speaker 1>So your body starts burning fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's fascinating.</v>

1075
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 1>The most fascinating thing about it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing people argue it from both sides.</v>

1076
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Seeing people argue that this is bad for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your health and you're,</v>

1077
00:51:48.691 --> 00:51:50.060

<v Speaker 1>you're fucking up.</v>

1078
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:52.340
<v Speaker 1>And don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people get upset,</v>

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.590
<v Speaker 1>like they get upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to try and Satanism,</v>

<v Speaker 1>At least a little bit of salt with me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Bad citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't say that to her.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've reasonable believe my client has </v>

1221
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:13.450
<v Speaker 3>sustained a head injury earlier in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and virtually never recovered.</v>

1222
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:17.770
<v Speaker 3>What he needs is our care when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't need is our judgment.</v>

1223
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.023
<v Speaker 3>I'm like Vincent Gigante,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he only feels going around like I'm </v>

1224
00:58:21.661 --> 00:58:22.494
<v Speaker 3>local.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He only feels normal when he gets </v>

1225
00:58:23.561 --> 00:58:27.130
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms in him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when therapeutic use of mushrooms</v>

1226
00:58:27.131 --> 00:58:28.150
<v Speaker 3>is on its way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>

1227
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:31.090
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should have happened a long time ago.</v>

1228
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 3>It'd be better for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My girl and studying that.</v>

1229
00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.320
<v Speaker 3>So is she?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:58:34.321 --> 00:58:37.660
<v Speaker 3>She's into like holistic medicine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>healing through psychedelics.</v>

1231
00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.880
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in that now,</v>

1232
00:58:39.881 --> 00:58:41.320
<v Speaker 3>including maps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1233
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:42.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

1234
00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Multidisciplinary Association,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something Psychedelic Studies,</v>

1235
00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.110
<v Speaker 3>but these are acknowledging it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1236
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:51.023
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've made some massive strides in </v>

1237
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:54.303
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to get therapeutic use of a Mtma </v>

1238
00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:01.180
<v Speaker 3>for soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

1239
00:59:01.181 --> 00:59:02.014
<v Speaker 3>and other people suffering from ptsd and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're showing all these applied uses </v>

1240
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.043
<v Speaker 3>of like really excellent compounds that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been demonized and and because </v>

1241
00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:17.710
<v Speaker 3>they've been deemed my demonize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that could really use them,</v>

1242
00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.380
<v Speaker 3>aren't getting them like can you abuse </v>
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

1243
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:22.214
<v Speaker 3>But I think we've already established </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a dumb argument because you can </v>

1244
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:25.694
<v Speaker 3>abuse anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go to a store and buy a hammer </v>

1245
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.490
<v Speaker 3>and you can build houses or you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit yourself in the Dick.</v>

1246
00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:34.550
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do whatever you want.</v>

1247
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't.</v>

1248
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.333
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good argument that someone </v>

1249
00:59:39.021 --> 00:59:40.790
<v Speaker 3>could abuse it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it shouldn't be legal.</v>

1250
00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.180
<v Speaker 3>There's massive amounts of shit to abuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over us all the time.</v>

1251
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:47.240
<v Speaker 3>So stop cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get anything?</v>

1252
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Bikes you can abuse everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the use of them,</v>

1253
00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.073
<v Speaker 3>their magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why we call magic </v>

1254
00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:56.810
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely fucking magic.</v>

1255
00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:57.973
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have incredible experiences on </v>

1256
00:59:59.361 --> 01:00:02.090
<v Speaker 3>them and the fact that we are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to.</v>

1257
01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Then we have to worry about someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>locking us in a cage for doing some shit</v>

1258
01:00:05.751 --> 01:00:07.850
<v Speaker 3>that's not hurting anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even hurting you.</v>

1259
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:09.223
<v Speaker 3>Like mushrooms don't hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to take some insane amount of </v>

1260
01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:14.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it to be like the ld 50 rate.</v>

1261
01:00:14.391 --> 01:00:16.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to take pounds of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1262
01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:17.923
<v Speaker 3>What's The ld?</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 from micro from a psychedelic </v>

1263
01:00:20.001 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms or psilocybin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really high.</v>

1264
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like something stupid like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>

1265
01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:30.490
<v Speaker 3>you almost can't even eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many pounds you have to eat.</v>

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.150

<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You killed mice with mushrooms.</v>

1268
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1269
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.280
<v Speaker 3>that's what they go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And have it.</v>

1270
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Here's something fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scroll up,</v>

1271
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:52.000
<v Speaker 3>scroll down again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scroll up again rather.</v>

1272
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:54.100
<v Speaker 3>So I could see this study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1273
01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:57.110
<v Speaker 3>the name of the study was the name of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the study at the top.</v>

1274
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:58.303
<v Speaker 3>How many dried mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I have to eat to die from an </v>

1275
01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:01.470
<v Speaker 3>overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silicide.</v>

1276
01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.460
<v Speaker 3>What is this on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What website is this shrew?</v>

1277
01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:09.461
<v Speaker 3>Marie Marie is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How fucking crazy is that?</v>

1278
01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:13.280
<v Speaker 3>The dude asks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he asks,</v>

1279
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.640
<v Speaker 3>how many mushrooms do I have to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>before overdose?</v>

1280
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.333
<v Speaker 3>Using the data for rats and accepting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>medium of a median of one percent </v>

1281
01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:24.134
<v Speaker 3>potency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would require the consumption of </v>

1282
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.600
<v Speaker 3>1,680 grams of mushrooms to reach the ld</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 for a 60 kilogram rat.</v>

1283
01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:35.143
<v Speaker 3>You have to eat a lot.</v>

1284
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.733
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

1285
01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:39.660
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of grams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1286
01:01:39.661 --> 01:01:44.661
<v Speaker 3>but rats are tougher than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rats can eat rats and they don't die.</v>

1287
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.713
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same each other mckinney even go off </v>

1310
01:02:52.191 --> 01:02:53.024

<v Speaker 1>I started hitting the ceiling with a </v>

1311
01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>broom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1312
01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started hitting the closets,</v>

1313
01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>like trying to scare them and then</v>

1314
01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.000
<v Speaker 3>eventually the motherfucker eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the wall.</v>

1315
01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:10.220
<v Speaker 3>One day I was laying on the couch and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just suddenly opened my eyes and look up</v>

1316
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>and he's just fucking looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make eye contact and it's like,</v>

1317
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a of,</v>

1318
01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:21.440
<v Speaker 1>is about to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1319
01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>like a Mexican shootout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

1320
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.640
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then my,</v>

1321
01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

1322
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Then my Greek landlord decided to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>traps out and I think that he</v>

1323
01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.910
<v Speaker 3>literally slaughtered about 60 of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the neighborhood.</v>

1324
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not his fault.</v>

1325
01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in the trap,</v>

1326
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.430
<v Speaker 3>the trap or listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did bad things to the neighborhood.</v>

1327
01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.640
<v Speaker 3>They would eat through lines grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gives a fuck about rats.</v>

1328
01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.393
<v Speaker 3>If he killed 60 rats who had been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good kill 60,000 and I now feel bad </v>

1329
01:04:01.031 --> 01:04:03.640
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't feel better because why is it?</v>

1330
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Why is it if you kill squirrels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get bummed out.</v>

1331
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.520
<v Speaker 3>But if he killed rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were like,</v>

1332
01:04:09.521 --> 01:04:10.354
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go kill him shit and fucking kill </v>

1333
01:04:11.261 --> 01:04:13.330
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the end of the day shit happens.</v>

1334
01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:14.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're,</v>

1335
01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:17.740
<v Speaker 3>if you're killing something with a trap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're definitely trying to kill it.</v>

1336
01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1337
01:04:18.641 --> 01:04:23.170
<v Speaker 3>I had no involvement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just wondering why we so readily</v>

1338
01:04:23.171 --> 01:04:25.180
<v Speaker 3>accept killing rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not squirrels.</v>

1339
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Like how to rats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's viewed as vermin.</v>

1340
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.600
<v Speaker 3>I feel like squirrels have viewed as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people.</v>

1341
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's the case.</v>

1342
01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Like an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a big federal hug.</v>

1343
01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Same Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In certain parts of the world,</v>

1344
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:45.430
<v Speaker 3>they're considered just as much of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuisance as a rhet.</v>

1345
01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1346
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Where certain islands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamaica as rats,</v>

1347
01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.900
<v Speaker 3>what they think of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like rats.</v>

1348
01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:56.410
<v Speaker 3>I feel like squirrels like in just in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>

1349
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.680
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people just fucking scared of </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirrels will do.</v>

1350
01:04:59.681 --> 01:05:01.690
<v Speaker 3>You know the difference between like </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree squirrels,</v>

1351
01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:04.360
<v Speaker 3>those cute ones that everybody likes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>those ground squirrels.</v>

1352
01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Ground squirrels are fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ground squirrels.</v>

1353
01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:15.280
<v Speaker 3>I was on this ranch in California and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a ground squirrels problem and</v>

1354
01:05:15.281 --> 01:05:18.340

<v Speaker 3>driving down this road.</v>

1355
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:19.443
<v Speaker 3>You're watching these little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures pop their head out of the </v>

1356
01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:25.090
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run across and jump into another whole.</v>

1357
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.620
<v Speaker 3>There's holes all over the place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>craps over there.</v>

1358
01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:32.140
<v Speaker 3>They would try a bunch of different shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that grow in there.</v>

1359
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.983
<v Speaker 3>They have have cattle that are grazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a bunch of different things </v>

1360
01:05:35.921 --> 01:05:36.754
<v Speaker 3>going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do anything about these </v>

1361
01:05:39.011 --> 01:05:40.030
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of them.</v>

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.103
<v Speaker 3>They say there's so many ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirrels that the biomass of these </v>

1363
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:48.430
<v Speaker 3>things is like a biomass of like a giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>herd of cattle or something like that.</v>

1364
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:52.120
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a 100 cows,</v>

1365
01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.233
<v Speaker 3>like that's how many of these little </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking ground squirrels just running </v>

1366

1367
01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.733
<v Speaker 3>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that they do these like where it </v>

1368
01:05:59.411 --> 01:06:00.244
<v Speaker 3>gives them a shock.</v>

<v Speaker 3>food in and it kills them humanely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They shocks him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they know,</v>

1371
01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.753
<v Speaker 3>like if you're driving down the road and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just keep seeing these little heads </v>

1390
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:01.600
<v Speaker 3>Heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these little ground squirrels,</v>

1391
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:03.640
<v Speaker 3>they're a little cuter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly cuter,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a domesticated animal and it</v>

1398
01:07:28.301 --> 01:07:31.270

<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other animals have such a way better </v>

01:10:47.931 --> 01:10:52.931
<v Speaker 3>shot athletically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even chimps.</v>

1467
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Chimps are so much stronger than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a way better shot at surviving</v>

1468
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.600
<v Speaker 3>and Capitec fucking swinging from trees </v>

<v Speaker 3>those big giant chimps in the Congo that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they nest on the ground,</v>

1471
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:06.080

<v Speaker 3>gorillas,</v>

1472
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:08.330
<v Speaker 3>nest in the ground because nobody wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fuck with the gorilla.</v>

1473
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 3>Cats don't want to fuck with the grill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like too much work.</v>

1474
01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.450
<v Speaker 3>You can easily get your jaw broke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your leg broke.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might be able to catch a baby,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the one is always in all those movies,</v>

1497
01:12:03.481 --> 01:12:06.450
<v Speaker 3>the Weirdo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which guys are fucking weird guy.</v>

1498
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:10.940
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flavors,</v>

1499
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.630
<v Speaker 3>the guide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was terrible.</v>

1500
01:12:12.631 --> 01:12:14.660
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the,</v>

1501
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:15.880
<v Speaker 3>you'll see his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

1502
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.620
<v Speaker 3>fuck you guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just not a,</v>

1503
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:19.860
<v Speaker 3>not a very good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>

1504
01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:21.570
<v Speaker 3>that's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's on him.</v>

1505
01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.790
<v Speaker 3>But that was after the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the doctor,</v>

1506
01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:25.610
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

1507
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.670
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another one,</v>

1508
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:29.240
<v Speaker 3>the one who was looking for all areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1509
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he is.</v>

1510
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:32.243
<v Speaker 5>Timothy,</v>

1511
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:35.270
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've seen them.</v>

1512
01:12:35.271 --> 01:12:38.120
<v Speaker 3>But that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy from rocky horror picture</v>

1513
01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:38.954
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1514
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.070
<v Speaker 3>As slugging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1515
01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:47.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like him.</v>

1517
01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the movie dealt with.</v>

1518
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:50.913
<v Speaker 3>See that monkey up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one picture that's supposedly what </v>

1519
01:12:54.311 --> 01:12:55.144
<v Speaker 3>these giant chimps look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the movie they were these </v>

1520
01:13:00.431 --> 01:13:03.790
<v Speaker 3>fictional animals that will look super </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart and they were really big,</v>

1521
01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:09.250
<v Speaker 3>but it is based on this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real one.</v>

1522
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real one that uh,</v>

1523
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:14.230
<v Speaker 3>someone had killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at the turn of the century,</v>

1524
01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.400
<v Speaker 3>that's one that they shot in an airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1525
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:18.243
<v Speaker 3>in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the size of that thing in </v>

1526
01:13:19.871 --> 01:13:20.704
<v Speaker 3>comparison to those men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a chimp that could </v>

1527
01:13:23.081 --> 01:13:26.320
<v Speaker 3>get to be like 400 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are enormous.</v>

1528
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:28.140
<v Speaker 3>It is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they,</v>

1529
01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.330
<v Speaker 3>they sleep on the ground just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>gorillas do.</v>

1530
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:34.510
<v Speaker 3>And there's a small population of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just recently found them.</v>

1531
01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a Swiss,</v>

1532
01:13:36.431 --> 01:13:37.264
<v Speaker 3>I think for Swiss wildlife photographer </v>
<v Speaker 3>named Carl or mom and he took some </v>

1533
01:13:40.991 --> 01:13:45.760
<v Speaker 3>photos of them with a camera trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put up a photo camera trap.</v>

1534
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:47.020
<v Speaker 3>Bondo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ape.</v>

1535
01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm saying his name right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carl Armaun.</v>

1536
01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.790
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1537
01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:53.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the upper left.</v>

1538
01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.320
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Th.</v>

1539
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Those photos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1540
01:13:56.531 --> 01:13:57.880
<v Speaker 3>that's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1541
01:13:57.881 --> 01:14:00.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it say,</v>

1542
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Carl?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's also in,</v>

1543
01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.470
<v Speaker 3>just for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1544
01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:07.450
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carl K,</v>

1545
01:14:07.451 --> 01:14:08.284
<v Speaker 3>a r l a m m a n n and he got these </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera trap photos of them walking </v>

1546
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.673
<v Speaker 3>upright</v>

1547
01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.433
<v Speaker 3>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the most fucked up thing about </v>

1548
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:18.180
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1549
01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even realize what I was looking</v>

1550
01:14:20.011 --> 01:14:21.720
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A six foot,</v>

1551
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.440
<v Speaker 3>that's a six foot tall chimp that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking upright.</v>

1552
01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:28.463
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're really big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're way bigger than a regular champ </v>

1553
01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.453
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a crest in their head like </v>

1554
01:14:33.601 --> 01:14:35.430
<v Speaker 3>gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know gorillas?</v>

1555
01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:37.890
<v Speaker 3>Gorillas are one of the few primates it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has.</v>

1556
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:38.783
<v Speaker 3>If you look at it skull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a crest in the skull where </v>

1557
01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:43.524
<v Speaker 3>these massive chewing muscles fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles all sort of congregate on their </v>

1558
01:14:48.481 --> 01:14:49.314
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have these huge jaw muscles and </v>

1559
01:14:51.751 --> 01:14:52.584
<v Speaker 3>these huge clampdown muscles and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have this cleft in the top of their </v>

1560
01:14:56.101 --> 01:14:58.800
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pull up Bondo,</v>

1561
01:14:58.801 --> 01:15:02.460
<v Speaker 3>ape skull and they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a.</v>

1562
01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.730
<v Speaker 3>They found the skulls of these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and at first they were like,</v>

1563
01:15:05.731 --> 01:15:07.200
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this a hybrid?</v>

1564
01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Like what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See it,</v>

1565
01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:12.810
<v Speaker 3>see how it has like crest at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the head.</v>

1566
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:15.990
<v Speaker 3>So now that they know that it's a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>

1567
01:15:15.991 --> 01:15:16.451
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1568
01:15:16.451 --> 01:15:19.730
<v Speaker 3>this is the first chimp they've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>found that has a crest like this looking</v>

1569
01:15:19.731 --> 01:15:20.010
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>

1570
01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:22.380
<v Speaker 3>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1571
01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:24.570
<v Speaker 3>they were thinking that it was some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a hybrid.</v>

1572
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:29.550
<v Speaker 3>They were thinking like maybe it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was parked gorilla part champ.</v>

1573
01:15:29.551 --> 01:15:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the,</v>

1574
01:15:31.411 --> 01:15:32.244
<v Speaker 3>the genetics we have gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think from stool samples and some </v>

1575
01:15:36.391 --> 01:15:38.910
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some other methods of acquiring them.</v>

1576
01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:40.110
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1577
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.943
<v Speaker 3>they think that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's own kind of chimp just to breed </v>

1578
01:15:45.071 --> 01:15:48.990
<v Speaker 3>that only exist in this one area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty fucking crazy.</v>

1579
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:54.380
<v Speaker 3>You think about it like they've only had</v>
<v Speaker 3>photos of this thing since the,</v>

1580
01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:57.450
<v Speaker 3>this Guy Carl Amman in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1581
01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.400
<v Speaker 3>I think the nineties he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1582
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.433
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four is when he first got the photos on </v>

1583
01:16:04.691 --> 01:16:05.524
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's apparently have been like </v>

1584
01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:10.120
<v Speaker 3>legend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Congo is giant man.</v>

1585
01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:12.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's huge.</v>

1586
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.770
<v Speaker 3>Like the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rain forest,</v>

1587
01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:17.270
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it on a map in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1588
01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they'll take like a,</v>

1589
01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:19.613
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual size of the u s and put it </v>

1590
01:16:21.170 --> 01:16:23.220
<v Speaker 3>like in the Congo and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1591
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.410
<v Speaker 3>well in the Congo you almost can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty close.</v>

1592
01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:27.723
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically the size of the United </v>

1593
01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.630
<v Speaker 3>States give or take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1594
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:32.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it was half the size,</v>

1595
01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:34.470
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the hell knows what's in there?</v>

1596
01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:35.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1597
01:16:35.571 --> 01:16:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Like can never find everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1598
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:41.520
<v Speaker 3>But this one area where this thing lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

1599
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:42.573
<v Speaker 3>of course they're probably like making </v>
<v Speaker 3>cell phones out of there or something </v>

1600
01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:49.510
<v Speaker 3>like that and pulling minerals out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground that they need for,</v>

1601
01:16:49.511 --> 01:16:50.344
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1602
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 3>the Iwatch or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who knows,</v>

1603
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:58.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is how big it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two thirds the size of western Europe,</v>

1604
01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:03.280
<v Speaker 3>two thirds the size of western Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1605
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:06.490
<v Speaker 3>What does it look like in comparison to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States?</v>

1606
01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 7>Had a picture</v>

1607
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.160
<v Speaker 3>of it and covered about half of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was the demand,</v>

1608
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:14.203
<v Speaker 3>the Dr of the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not sure if it's a different </v>

1609
01:17:18.561 --> 01:17:21.050
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fucking pretty heavy duty piece</v>

1610
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:22.520
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1611
01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Midwest.</v>

1612
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:29.690

<v Speaker 3>but it's still unbelievably huge.</v>

1613
01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.353

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1615
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:40.880
<v Speaker 3>but only I would say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a third of the size.</v>

1616
01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Slightly bigger than Alaska maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

1617
01:17:43.551 --> 01:17:46.470
<v Speaker 3>The last one is pretty big too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about how much is it?</v>

1618
01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.433
<v Speaker 3>It's not really half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't really have to me it looks more </v>

1619
01:17:49.071 --> 01:17:49.904
<v Speaker 3>like a third.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like scroll down a little so we could </v>

01:17:52.821 --> 01:17:54.740
<v Speaker 3>see it better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1624
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:05.660
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 40 percent or something like that.</v>

1625
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.393
<v Speaker 3>And almost 80 percent of people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>aids really sort of says 80 percent of </v>

1626
01:18:13.551 --> 01:18:18.551
<v Speaker 3>the people in the Congo have aids more </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely are likely to have HIV aids.</v>

<v Speaker 3>someone is if you look into their eyes,</v>

1661
01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.550
<v Speaker 3>but I do believe you can see when </v>

<v Speaker 3>but you can definitely tell.</v>

1664
01:20:24.871 --> 01:20:27.360
<v Speaker 3>Looking at that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot going on.</v>

1665
01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.690

<v Speaker 3>looking dude.</v>

1669
01:20:43.281 --> 01:20:45.710

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:46.913
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that lets him out of a lab in </v>

1671
01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida University lab and they get out,</v>

1672
01:20:52.041 --> 01:20:54.890
<v Speaker 3>they start breeding and they start </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to each other.</v>

1673
01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.030
<v Speaker 3>That looks like one of those angry birds</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the things from the game,</v>

1674
01:20:59.031 --> 01:21:01.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use one of those.</v>

1677
01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Those eyes are the reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking creepy.</v>

1679
01:21:13.511 --> 01:21:16.970
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we have houses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons was houses.</v>

1680
01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.720
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we figured out fire and </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication,</v>

1681
01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:22.780
<v Speaker 3>it's we had to figure out how to knock </v>
<v Speaker 3>it eaten,</v>

1682
01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:25.600
<v Speaker 3>eaten by shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing.</v>

1683
01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:26.463
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now imagine that this is in the same </v>

1684
01:21:30.281 --> 01:21:33.820
<v Speaker 3>sort of vein as far as animals go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that Tara Byrd,</v>

1685
01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.953
<v Speaker 3>except it's considerably smaller where </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Tara Byrd was like seven feet tall </v>

1686
01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.520
<v Speaker 3>and lived in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived in North America while people were</v>

1687
01:21:42.521 --> 01:21:46.270
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things were gi,</v>

1688
01:21:46.271 --> 01:21:48.600
<v Speaker 3>ent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were running around like,</v>

1689
01:21:48.601 --> 01:21:51.750
<v Speaker 3>look at the photo of the soldier there.</v>

1693
01:21:59.821 --> 01:22:00.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gwen?</v>

1697
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:20.430
<v Speaker 3>giant fucking bird man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when did the thing live?</v>

1698
01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.420
<v Speaker 3>One point 5 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it says?</v>

1699
01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:29.030
<v Speaker 3>That's not that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it say what's this say Jamie?</v>

1700
01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen or one point five.</v>

1701
01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Two point 5 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two point 5 million years ago.</v>

1702
01:22:34.991 --> 01:22:35.591
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1703
01:22:35.591 --> 01:22:38.380
<v Speaker 3>so that's definitely not people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone was there.</v>

1704
01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Someone was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some silly monkeys.</v>

1705
01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.180
<v Speaker 3>Something was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what?</v>

1706
01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:44.163
<v Speaker 3>What year do you think monkey started </v>
<v Speaker 3>figuring out how to start using weapons </v>

1707
01:22:48.671 --> 01:22:49.504
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what year was it that they figured </v>

1708
01:22:51.371 --> 01:22:52.204
<v Speaker 3>out how?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the very first sub human hominid </v>

1709
01:22:56.441 --> 01:23:00.070
<v Speaker 3>that was smart as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was figuring out how to like make a</v>

1710
01:23:00.071 --> 01:23:00.904
<v Speaker 3>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to have been picking up </v>

1711
01:23:03.341 --> 01:23:06.310
<v Speaker 3>some sort of branch or some sort of rock</v>
<v Speaker 3>and throwing</v>

1712
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:07.143
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's the first thought of using </v>

1713
01:23:08.801 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 6>a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No rock.</v>

1714
01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.793
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I would wonder if it would be that</v>
<v Speaker 6>or a stick to beat something with a </v>

1715
01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:19.960
<v Speaker 6>stick or to throw a rock like which </v>
<v Speaker 6>would be the first one they figured out.</v>

1716
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:22.480
<v Speaker 6>But what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What year do you think?</v>

1717
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:23.383
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder how long it was ago that our </v>

1718
01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:28.570
<v Speaker 6>ancestors first started developing a </v>
<v Speaker 6>weapon,</v>

1719
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:33.400
<v Speaker 6>like something to you to kill something </v>
<v Speaker 6>to eat or something defend themselves.</v>

1720
01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:34.273
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking a little farther.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some reports and from Uruguay </v>

1721
01:23:36.891 --> 01:23:41.891
<v Speaker 2>saying that these might be dated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>450,000 or 17,000 years ago.</v>

1722
01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.740
<v Speaker 6>Seventeen thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Still being debated.</v>

1723
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:49.340
<v Speaker 6>That's what I entered the realm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I had heard it was.</v>

1724
01:23:49.341 --> 01:23:50.174
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1725
01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.620
<v Speaker 6>I think I had heard it was like 35,000 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

1726
01:23:54.621 --> 01:23:57.200
<v Speaker 6>They think that some of them were living</v>
<v Speaker 6>in North America.</v>

1727
01:23:58.670 --> 01:24:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's written in Spanish or something.</v>

1728
01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I can't get through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1729
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.313
<v Speaker 6>it was all pre ice age either way </v>
<v Speaker 6>because the ice age was 10,000 years </v>

1730
01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:09.754
<v Speaker 6>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This whole motherfucker was just frozen </v>

1731
01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:13.690
<v Speaker 6>solid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's hard.</v>

1732
01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:16.930
<v Speaker 6>That's hard to imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>

1733
01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I questioned everything.</v>

1734
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.110
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows what's happening,</v>

1735
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:28.720
<v Speaker 6>but I like watching ancient aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do too.</v>

1736
01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:31.810
<v Speaker 6>I wish it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish it was all real.</v>

1737
01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:32.733
<v Speaker 6>I wish it was to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hope they're right about a lot of </v>

1738
01:24:34.841 --> 01:24:35.674
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would be so much more fun if aliens </v>

1739
01:24:38.891 --> 01:24:42.730
<v Speaker 6>had been here and contradict,</v>
<v Speaker 6>contacted us and left information.</v>

1740
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:43.623
<v Speaker 6>It would be so much more fun to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>incredible then to actually be alive to </v>

1741
01:24:48.101 --> 01:24:50.770
<v Speaker 6>find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's.</v>

1742
01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:51.813
<v Speaker 6>It's totally possible that something </v>
<v Speaker 6>could get waste smarter than us and can </v>

1743
01:24:55.481 --> 01:24:56.314
<v Speaker 6>travel from some other place is also </v>
<v Speaker 6>totally possible that it's never </v>

1744
01:24:59.711 --> 01:25:00.544
<v Speaker 6>happened yet.</v>

1745
01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:04.240
<v Speaker 6>It's totally possible that people were </v>
<v Speaker 6>just full of shit.</v>

1746
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:09.040
<v Speaker 6>It's also totally possible that our </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience on earth has been broken up a</v>

1747
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:09.874
<v Speaker 6>bunch of times by huge disasters and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think that this is one of the things </v>

1748
01:25:14.021 --> 01:25:18.520
<v Speaker 6>that this Guy Graham Hancock is trying </v>
<v Speaker 6>to prove and is doing a fantastic job.</v>

1749
01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.393
<v Speaker 6>Sort of documenting what the way he </v>
<v Speaker 6>describes it that were a civilization </v>

1750
01:25:22.601 --> 01:25:25.660
<v Speaker 6>with amnesia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really interesting stuff,</v>

1751
01:25:25.661 --> 01:25:26.494
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he's.</v>

1752
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:27.633
<v Speaker 6>He's saying essentially what probably </v>
<v Speaker 6>happened was human beings invented a </v>

1753
01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:35.110
<v Speaker 6>bunch of really cool shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>developed a bunch of great technology,</v>

1754
01:25:35.111 --> 01:25:37.840
<v Speaker 6>had made sophisticated societies and </v>
<v Speaker 6>cultures,</v>

1755
01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 6>and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a fucking rock from this guy comes down,</v>

1756
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:43.690
<v Speaker 6>start over,</v>
<v Speaker 6>flattens everything,</v>

1757
01:25:43.691 --> 01:25:47.920
<v Speaker 6>kills a giant chunk of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucks up all the infrastructure,</v>

1758
01:25:47.921 --> 01:25:51.700
<v Speaker 6>chaos disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then things are fine for another few</v>

1759
01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:52.533
<v Speaker 6>hundred years and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a new one hits and they're all </v>

1760
01:25:54.851 --> 01:25:55.684
<v Speaker 6>throughout Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They've proven it now that this is </v>

1761
01:25:57.970 --> 01:26:01.710
<v Speaker 6>nuclear glass shit all throughout Europe</v>
<v Speaker 6>and in Asia as well.</v>

1762
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.910
<v Speaker 6>Gentrification and it's all around </v>
<v Speaker 6>10,000 years ago.</v>

1763
01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:06.740
<v Speaker 6>Crazy is that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's unexplainable.</v>

1764
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:08.413
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They think that that's what happened </v>

1765
01:26:10.161 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 6>that to 10 to 12,000 years ago they </v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1766
01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:15.560
<v Speaker 6>all of Europe was like pelted with </v>
<v Speaker 6>rocks.</v>

1767
01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:18.133
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking nuts and that people had to</v>
<v Speaker 6>start over after that and that all of </v>

1768
01:26:22.491 --> 01:26:27.491
<v Speaker 6>our stories about cataclysms and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dough in the arc and all that shit about</v>

1769
01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 6>keeping,</v>
<v Speaker 6>keeping societies alive,</v>

1770
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:31.244
<v Speaker 6>whether it's like the epic of Gilgamesh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all these different stories that are </v>

1771
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:36.290
<v Speaker 6>real similar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>real similar tale of someone like trying</v>

1772
01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:40.550
<v Speaker 6>to keep humanity alive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Face of this chaotic disaster.</v>

1773
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:41.443
<v Speaker 6>All of those represent the same stories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All those represents the things that </v>

1774
01:26:44.301 --> 01:26:48.650
<v Speaker 6>ended the fucking ice age rocks from </v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy 10,000 years ago.</v>

1775
01:26:48.651 --> 01:26:49.484
<v Speaker 6>Jamie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we can't keep going.</v>

1780
01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.510
<v Speaker 1>We'll forget what we already talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about when we repeat ourselves.</v>

1781
01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.240
<v Speaker 1>We are a society with Amnesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>definitely wouldn't smoke in this kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1783
01:27:09.621 --> 01:27:14.450

<v Speaker 1>He says fire to know that about them.</v>

1784
01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:17.060
<v Speaker 1>So when you go in on these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1785
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:17.983
<v Speaker 1>these trips,</v>

1786
01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you want to eat and he bases trips on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your already tour in there and you say,</v>

01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:46.380
<v Speaker 1>He could be a nickelback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could be in a.</v>

01:29:53.791 --> 01:29:54.950
<v Speaker 1>smashmouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>shirt to the right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually,</v>

1850
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.863
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get crazy while he was taking these </v>

1851
01:30:17.821 --> 01:30:20.850
<v Speaker 1>pictures and he did that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

1852
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:26.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just hilarious in time that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got such a crafted thing going on.</v>

1853
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:31.290
<v Speaker 1>He's a Rockstar Rockstar Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1854
01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.393
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think tega night sky that ain't </v>

1855
01:30:34.691 --> 01:30:35.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1856
01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:37.130
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this is a shtick?</v>

1857
01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Like he's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decided to like make himself look.</v>

1858
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:42.773
<v Speaker 1>You look at a guy like Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows that he has this crazy </v>

1859
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:47.274
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that Donald trump could </v>

1860
01:30:48.391 --> 01:30:49.440
<v Speaker 1>get a better haircut?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1861
01:30:49.450 --> 01:30:51.760
<v Speaker 1>He plays into it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's ridiculous.</v>

1862
01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:52.623
<v Speaker 1>It's part of his flair as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pulling it off with this goofy </v>

1863
01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.113
<v Speaker 1>haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got billions of dollars and he's </v>

1864
01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:01.800
<v Speaker 1>got this hair helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same with Don King.</v>

1865
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:04.630
<v Speaker 1>So legendary here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don King Man.</v>

1866
01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:06.690
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They looked.</v>

1867
01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:09.720
<v Speaker 1>They had like sort of a wacky look on </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

1868
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought of this yesterday.</v>

1869
01:31:12.271 --> 01:31:13.104
<v Speaker 1>Is there a chance donald trump's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trolling and some sort of performance </v>

1870
01:31:15.181 --> 01:31:18.190
<v Speaker 1>piece for like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's definitely.</v>

1871
01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:20.003
<v Speaker 1>I think Donald trump is a guy who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>full belief in his ability to run this </v>

1872
01:31:25.591 --> 01:31:26.424
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not he can actually run the </v>

1873
01:31:28.981 --> 01:31:30.990
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's an enact.</v>

1874
01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I think he has full belief that he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1875
01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.980
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is bizarre city because it's a.</v>

1876
01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:38.933
<v Speaker 1>it's freaking people out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think one of the more fascinating </v>

1877
01:31:41.161 --> 01:31:44.430
<v Speaker 1>things about this election is how people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so freaked out that he's.</v>

1878
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:48.300
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty much in command right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thoughts,</v>

1879
01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:52.530
<v Speaker 1>there's like panic that he could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a possibility.</v>

1880
01:31:52.531 --> 01:31:53.760
<v Speaker 1>It could be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1881
01:31:53.761 --> 01:31:57.150
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely if you think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's very likely.</v>

1882
01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:58.013
<v Speaker 1>I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things keep going the way they're </v>

1883
01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:04.150
<v Speaker 1>going right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks to me like he's going to be the</v>

1884
01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:07.240
<v Speaker 1>president or the others putting their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking foot in their mouth.</v>

1885
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:09.670
<v Speaker 1>What is the issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is he shining?</v>

1886
01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the Internet age?</v>

1887
01:32:12.311 --> 01:32:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Is that the social media age that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>making this guy into this figure?</v>

1888
01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Almost like the Jordan face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jordan,</v>

1889
01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.310
<v Speaker 1>the meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an iconic thing.</v>

1890
01:32:24.311 --> 01:32:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about to pull up the Jordan?</v>

1891
01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is becoming the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan face man.</v>

1892
01:32:30.521 --> 01:32:32.200
<v Speaker 1>The crying Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1893
01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.213
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people looked for someone to be </v>

1894
01:32:34.871 --> 01:32:36.880
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's rational or not,</v>

1895
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:37.953
<v Speaker 1>they look towards someone who they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be a leader of the crying </v>

1896
01:32:42.521 --> 01:32:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Jordan face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:32:43.471 --> 01:32:44.610
<v Speaker 1>That's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1898
01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:48.250
<v Speaker 1>they put it on everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fuck up,</v>

1899
01:32:48.251 --> 01:32:49.084
<v Speaker 1>you get to crying Jordan face people </v>
<v Speaker 1>look towards someone that they want to </v>

1900
01:32:52.421 --> 01:32:53.254
<v Speaker 1>be a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with Donald trump is </v>

1901
01:32:56.861 --> 01:33:01.861
<v Speaker 1>that he said a bunch of ridiculous stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like Mexicans and in some,</v>

1902
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:07.410
<v Speaker 1>some stuff that like not measured stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Muslims coming into this country,</v>

1903
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:11.350
<v Speaker 1>not measured and rational and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1904
01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:16.560
<v Speaker 1>it was way too showbizzy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1905
01:33:16.721 --> 01:33:20.740
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy with the Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will shut the country down.</v>

1906
01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Restaurants will be closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be over.</v>

1907
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1908
01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Things will be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1909
01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:30.220
<v Speaker 1>very likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus they're nice.</v>

1910
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:31.623
<v Speaker 1>They're great people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not having a lot of problems with </v>

1911
01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this idea that Mexicans are causing</v>

1912
01:33:37.181 --> 01:33:38.014
<v Speaker 1>all these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they were really causing them any </v>

1913
01:33:39.011 --> 01:33:39.844
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have a lot more problems </v>

1914
01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:43.960
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of Mexicans all </v>
<v Speaker 1>they ever do,</v>

1915
01:33:43.961 --> 01:33:44.794
<v Speaker 1>they just want to come over to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country so they can make money to send </v>

1916
01:33:47.291 --> 01:33:48.124
<v Speaker 1>home to their family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked with guys that literally slept </v>

1917
01:33:51.071 --> 01:33:53.860
<v Speaker 1>and Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold rooms just so they could send their</v>

1918
01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:58.040
<v Speaker 1>salary that $300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$400 from washing dishes or fucking week</v>

1919
01:33:58.810 --> 01:33:59.643
<v Speaker 1>back home for their family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives of the people that you want </v>

1920
01:34:02.501 --> 01:34:04.570
<v Speaker 1>to keep out of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

1921
01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the honest,</v>

1922
01:34:06.131 --> 01:34:06.964
<v Speaker 1>the working men riding his bike back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth to work every day in the fucking </v>

1923
01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:12.970
<v Speaker 1>snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rain,</v>

1924
01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.073
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1925
01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:15.363
<v Speaker 1>It's upsetting.</v>

1926
01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I worked close with these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1927
01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you kitchens right,</v>

1928
01:34:18.521 --> 01:34:19.380
<v Speaker 1>and kitchens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1929
01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:20.793
<v Speaker 1>Mexican guys want to pee and chefs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible ones too and know that you </v>

1930
01:34:25.001 --> 01:34:29.330
<v Speaker 1>could teach them any cuisine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just um,</v>

1931
01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:30.723
<v Speaker 1>it's just unfortunate that he would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that and that people will </v>

1932
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:37.600
<v Speaker 1>respond the way they responded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1933
01:34:37.601 --> 01:34:40.870
<v Speaker 1>people got kind of excited that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>is filing a close the wall,</v>

1934
01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:42.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close the borders and just fucking snow </v>

1935
01:34:44.181 --> 01:34:47.350
<v Speaker 1>people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all come out when you know,</v>

1936
01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:48.980
<v Speaker 1>the freaks come out at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1937
01:34:48.981 --> 01:34:49.814
<v Speaker 1>it's just this bad people in every group</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every group and the idea that these </v>

1938
01:34:56.261 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there</v>

1939
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.510
<v Speaker 3>are more poor and because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got stuck in this one spot,</v>

1940
01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.373
<v Speaker 3>they should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should be trapped there forever </v>

1941
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:07.670
<v Speaker 3>even though it's connected to us by </v>
<v Speaker 3>dirt.</v>

1942
01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:12.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's like a clear path between</v>
<v Speaker 3>us and Mexico right there and we have to</v>

1943
01:35:12.591 --> 01:35:15.710
<v Speaker 3>stop people from walking across to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs.</v>

1944
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:16.783
<v Speaker 3>Like imagine if Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you made them walk across the desert </v>

1945
01:35:20.091 --> 01:35:21.440
<v Speaker 3>to get jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1946
01:35:21.441 --> 01:35:22.274
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How few of us would be employed if you </v>

1947
01:35:25.371 --> 01:35:27.980
<v Speaker 3>had a walk across the yard to get in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>river.</v>

1948
01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:31.000
<v Speaker 3>He had a fucking way to cross the river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd get to the other side,</v>

1949
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:34.720
<v Speaker 3>holding your baby over the rapids and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then once you get to the side you got to</v>

1950
01:35:34.721 --> 01:35:35.554
<v Speaker 3>climb a wall and then you've got to walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>across the desert and then you gotta </v>

1951
01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.010
<v Speaker 3>find a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1958
01:35:51.710 --> 01:35:52.543

<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>

1959
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:54.560

<v Speaker 3>No American do it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

1966
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:19.830
<v Speaker 8>The president of Mexico yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or the experts prize,</v>

1967
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:21.550

1968
01:36:21.551 --> 01:36:23.710
<v Speaker 8>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

1969
01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:27.100
<v Speaker 8>we will not even consider paying for the</v>
<v Speaker 8>wall.</v>

1970
01:36:27.101 --> 01:36:29.350
<v Speaker 8>You have to understand because.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 9>Who?</v>

1973
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:41.310
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a hundred percent.</v>

1974
01:36:42.250 --> 01:36:46.300
<v Speaker 8>So I get a call from one of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>reporters yesterday and they said,</v>

1975
01:36:46.690 --> 01:36:47.523
<v Speaker 8>the president of Mexico said they will </v>
<v Speaker 8>not under any circumstances pay for the </v>

1976
01:36:52.091 --> 01:36:53.680
<v Speaker 8>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They said to me,</v>

1977
01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.630
<v Speaker 8>what is your comment?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

1978
01:36:55.690 --> 01:36:58.090
<v Speaker 8>the wall just got 10 feet higher.</v>

1979
01:36:58.690 --> 01:37:00.400
<v Speaker 9>True,</v>
<v Speaker 9>true.</v>

1980
01:37:03.090 --> 01:37:04.560
<v Speaker 3>He fucked it up with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1981
01:37:04.561 --> 01:37:06.300
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should have laid back on that.</v>

1982
01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Had a strong delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

1983
01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:09.513
<v Speaker 3>He had a strong delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just panics while I was getting the </v>

1984
01:37:11.101 --> 01:37:13.140
<v Speaker 3>chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got hired.</v>

1985
01:37:13.141 --> 01:37:17.310
<v Speaker 3>That's how you can tell he's a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not presented prime for the spot.</v>

1986
01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:19.620
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your hype right there.</v>

1987
01:37:19.621 --> 01:37:20.454
<v Speaker 3>When he heard the collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy that a guy can say </v>

1988
01:37:22.651 --> 01:37:24.870
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is so not measured.</v>

1989
01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1990
01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.310
<v Speaker 2>please clap moment with Jeb Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1991
01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.500
<v Speaker 2>And it pretty much ruined him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>now out of the race.</v>

1992
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show it to you.</v>

1993
01:37:33.281 --> 01:37:35.080
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's given a speech somewhere and,</v>

1994
01:37:35.081 --> 01:37:35.914
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets this real riled up moment and </v>

1995
01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:39.700
<v Speaker 2>he's waiting for an applause break and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't come.</v>

1996
01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.100
<v Speaker 2>So he literally says to the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please clap.</v>

1997
01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1998
01:37:44.611 --> 01:37:49.611
<v Speaker 3>the poor bastard gracious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

1999
01:37:50.401 --> 01:37:51.960
<v Speaker 3>He's probably so happy to be out of it.</v>

2000
01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:55.800
<v Speaker 8>Have the back the military.</v>

2001
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.963
<v Speaker 10>I won't trash talk.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I won't be a divider in chief or an </v>

2002
01:37:59.971 --> 01:38:02.340
<v Speaker 10>agitator in chief.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I won't be out there.</v>

2003
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:05.970
<v Speaker 10>Blow harden talking to big,</v>
<v Speaker 10>big game without backing it up.</v>

2004
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.310
<v Speaker 10>I think the next president needs to be a</v>
<v Speaker 10>lot quieter,</v>

2005
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:09.263
<v Speaker 10>but send a signal that we're prepared to</v>
<v Speaker 10>act in the national security interests </v>

2006
01:38:12.421 --> 01:38:13.254
<v Speaker 10>of this country to get back in the </v>
<v Speaker 10>business of creating a more peaceful </v>

2007
01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:18.270
<v Speaker 10>world.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Please clap.</v>

2008
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was humorous.</v>

2009
01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:26.450
<v Speaker 3>I actually thought that was humorous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't terrible.</v>

2010
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was humorous when the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did that,</v>

2011
01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:32.420
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awkward.</v>

2012
01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:36.800
<v Speaker 3>I saw an older guy in a Yamaka,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a bunch of really old people there.</v>

2013
01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:39.050
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they just didn't catch it at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2014
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2015
01:38:41.151 --> 01:38:42.790
<v Speaker 3>I would think that that would be a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to end it.</v>

2016
01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.270
<v Speaker 3>You say please clap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2017
01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:49.040
<v Speaker 3>but maybe I'm just optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely not the guy.</v>

2018
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:52.220
<v Speaker 3>You just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't talk like that and be the guy.</v>

2019
01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.080
<v Speaker 3>You know what focus is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2020
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:56.780
<v Speaker 3>That seemed like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably saw what happened to</v>

2021
01:38:56.781 --> 01:38:57.614
<v Speaker 3>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw what happened to his dad and he was </v>

2022
01:38:59.031 --> 01:38:59.511
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2023
01:38:59.511 --> 01:39:01.310
<v Speaker 3>this will be different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're trying to put.</v>

2024
01:39:01.311 --> 01:39:02.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're trying to push them into</v>

2025
01:39:02.691 --> 01:39:03.800
<v Speaker 3>a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really want.</v>

2026
01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he really wanted to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

2027
01:39:06.670 --> 01:39:07.503
<v Speaker 3>Just didn't seem like it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to be a carpenter like Bernie </v>

2028
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Sanders seems to want to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it.</v>

2029
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:16.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm convinced Hillary Clinton wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be president.</v>

2030
01:39:16.730 --> 01:39:19.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm convinced trump wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>president for sure.</v>

2031
01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:21.590
<v Speaker 3>How about that Rubio guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he want to be president.</v>

2032
01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:25.460
<v Speaker 3>Chris Christie didn't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

2033
01:39:25.461 --> 01:39:26.940
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No fucking way.</v>

2034
01:39:27.130 --> 01:39:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking scumbag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is He?</v>

2035
01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:29.953
<v Speaker 3>How dare you,</v>

2036
01:39:31.410 --> 01:39:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Izzy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really sure.</v>

2037
01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:37.800
<v Speaker 3>This is what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know politics.</v>

2038
01:39:37.801 --> 01:39:39.450
<v Speaker 3>This is what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2039
01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:43.440
<v Speaker 3>that's all I need to know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The judge judges spoken.</v>

2040
01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know.</v>

2041
01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:48.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going to happen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country.</v>

2042
01:39:48.601 --> 01:39:51.150
<v Speaker 3>If that guy wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be very weird.</v>

2043
01:39:51.630 --> 01:39:52.463
<v Speaker 3>If that guy wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone who could say shit like </v>

2044
01:39:53.731 --> 01:39:55.500
<v Speaker 3>that winds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2045
01:39:55.890 --> 01:39:56.723
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2046
01:39:57.030 --> 01:40:01.440
<v Speaker 3>What would happen if he got into office </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then immediately gave like a calm,</v>

2047
01:40:01.441 --> 01:40:06.000
<v Speaker 3>sober presentation and explained that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>did what he had to do to win,</v>

2048
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:08.370
<v Speaker 3>but he's absolutely serious about being </v>
<v Speaker 3>the president</v>

2049
01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:10.550
<v Speaker 3>whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever,</v>

2050
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:13.100
<v Speaker 3>if that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>America is pretty liberal.</v>

2051
01:40:13.101 --> 01:40:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give him a shot.</v>

2052
01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:16.970
<v Speaker 3>He hit the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just got 10 foot higher.</v>

2053
01:40:16.971 --> 01:40:18.580
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2054
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:21.710
<v Speaker 3>Is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>An episode of a movie as of a movie.</v>

2055
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:25.070
<v Speaker 3>He's a sick fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2056
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:26.750
<v Speaker 3>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a sick fuck.</v>

2057
01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:32.140
<v Speaker 3>He says anything you sick like 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

2058
01:40:32.661 --> 01:40:34.670
<v Speaker 3>He has one of the littlest dicks in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2059
01:40:34.671 --> 01:40:35.504
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe what I'm hearing and </v>

2060
01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.210
<v Speaker 3>tell how he's talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2061
01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:44.060
<v Speaker 3>say allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly.</v>

2062
01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:47.960
<v Speaker 3>He has one of the tiniest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Piney is a micro penis.</v>

2063
01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet he's got a giant hog.</v>

2064
01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

2065
01:40:51.561 --> 01:40:53.060
<v Speaker 3>It's shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he's so confident.</v>

2066
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I bet he pulls it out and when he bought</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2128
01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:44.930
<v Speaker 3>less than a year,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but then I was right back at it.</v>

2133
01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:01.340

<v Speaker 1>good for reducing inflammation.</v>

2134
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Causes coughing is no good when you was </v>

2490
02:01:37.851 --> 02:01:41.960
<v Speaker 3>style of their own and to think that all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that was taking place over the last,</v>

2491
02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:44.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 or so years,</v>

2492
02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:46.153
<v Speaker 3>just 90 miles away from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had no idea and on top of that </v>

2493
02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:52.390
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we weren't even allowed to visit for for</v>

2494
02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:53.233
<v Speaker 3>50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were kept from going to a spot and </v>

2495
02:01:56.031 --> 02:01:56.864
<v Speaker 3>with no reason that makes any sense were</v>
<v Speaker 3>kept from going where you could get in </v>

2496
02:02:00.021 --> 02:02:00.854
<v Speaker 3>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2497
02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.380
<v Speaker 3>Like in the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you traveled to Cuba,</v>

2498
02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:04.273
<v Speaker 3>you could get in fucking trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big daddy government told you where </v>

2499
02:02:07.431 --> 02:02:09.110
<v Speaker 3>you could visit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about that.</v>

2500
02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:12.410
<v Speaker 3>You could go to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to the Congo,</v>

2501
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:15.350
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't give you a hard time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you go to Cuba,</v>

2502
02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:18.830
<v Speaker 3>they could lock you up just for </v>
<v Speaker 3>visiting.</v>

2503
02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what it's like over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see some people not allowed.</v>

2504
02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:25.820

<v Speaker 3>That's the most ridiculous thing ever.</v>

2505

<v Speaker 3>There's no reason like you,</v>

2506
02:02:28.990 --> 02:02:29.823
<v Speaker 3>it's not for your own safety because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some super dangerous spots you </v>

2507
02:02:32.121 --> 02:02:33.940
<v Speaker 3>can go visit right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

<v Speaker 3>no one's going to stop you from flying </v>

2509
02:02:35.841 --> 02:02:37.430

<v Speaker 3>to a lot of places in this world that </v>

2511
02:02:41.391 --> 02:02:46.391

<v Speaker 1>Seven,</v>

2563
02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:21.630
<v Speaker 1>that seven months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven months,</v>

2564
02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:24.210
<v Speaker 1>not 70 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a premature child.</v>

2565
02:05:24.211 --> 02:05:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't want believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to believe it.</v>

2566
02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the temperature?</v>

2567
02:05:29.251 --> 02:05:31.590
<v Speaker 1>They put it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucking grill it.</v>

2568
02:05:31.630 --> 02:05:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hot.</v>

2569
02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to keep it to aging.</v>

2570
02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>The aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

2571
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't tell you exactly,</v>

2572
02:05:38.401 --> 02:05:42.210
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine it's in between in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the forties,</v>

2573
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:47.390
<v Speaker 1>really 30 to 40 has it not turned into </v>
<v Speaker 1>just rot because there's so much fat cap</v>

2574
02:05:48.901 --> 02:05:53.901
<v Speaker 1>on it that the fat protects it and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat just rots inside and all that fatty</v>

2575
02:05:57.571 --> 02:05:58.404
<v Speaker 1>tissue breaks down and just becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutty and unbelievably fucking </v>

2576
02:06:03.061 --> 02:06:03.930
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2577
02:06:03.931 --> 02:06:04.764
<v Speaker 1>and deep and incredible depth of flavor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and developing all this earthiness and </v>

2578
02:06:11.401 --> 02:06:14.640
<v Speaker 1>it's this Umami flavor you can't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain,</v>

2579
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:17.040
<v Speaker 1>but when you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just melts and it's like,</v>

2580
02:06:17.041 --> 02:06:19.710
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2581
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven months of rot.</v>

2582
02:06:23.610 --> 02:06:24.443
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that wasn't real and we found out </v>

2583
02:06:27.121 --> 02:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>that the Romans used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2584
02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:29.850
<v Speaker 1>they didn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

2585
02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:31.500
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not with refrigeration.</v>

2586
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:33.300
<v Speaker 1>If we just found out that they used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

2587
02:06:33.301 --> 02:06:34.134
<v Speaker 1>we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck are these assholes </v>

2588
02:06:35.730 --> 02:06:36.563
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would let them meet rot away for </v>

2589
02:06:37.741 --> 02:06:38.574
<v Speaker 1>seven months so that they could slice a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sliver off the inside and presented and </v>

2590
02:06:43.351 --> 02:06:44.240
<v Speaker 1>present that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2591
02:06:44.241 --> 02:06:45.074
<v Speaker 1>how much meat goes to waste when lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of waste in like what </v>

2592
02:06:47.881 --> 02:06:48.714
<v Speaker 1>percentage you think maybe 30 to 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the product because the bone </v>

2593
02:06:53.911 --> 02:06:56.670
<v Speaker 1>is huge and then the meat is just meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like this.</v>

2594
02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:57.953
<v Speaker 1>That's how much missed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About five inches long and paused and </v>

2595
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:08.510
<v Speaker 1>three inches wide out of the whole cow </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the Ribeye.</v>

2596
02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:12.180
<v Speaker 1>That's that rebuts the fucking read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has the big ass bone.</v>

2597
02:07:12.181 --> 02:07:16.880
<v Speaker 1>It has that thick as fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to cut off so they must lose a</v>

2598
02:07:16.881 --> 02:07:17.714
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit is like a fucking $200 an </v>

2599
02:07:20.911 --> 02:07:21.570
<v Speaker 1>inch.</v>

2600
02:07:21.570 --> 02:07:22.403
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like the worst ecofriendly </v>

2601
02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:30.090
<v Speaker 1>meet ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's sublime.</v>

2602
02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Sublime tasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>

2603
02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:34.853
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre how far people will go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their way to try to like rig the </v>

2604
02:07:39.101 --> 02:07:42.010
<v Speaker 1>perfect steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like this where you're letting</v>

2605
02:07:42.011 --> 02:07:42.844
<v Speaker 1>some meat sit for seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means they had to take it up until </v>

2606
02:07:44.681 --> 02:07:47.560
<v Speaker 1>like a year and then they back off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't eat this shit.</v>

2607
02:07:47.590 --> 02:07:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Now there's this 12 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is 12 month men.</v>

2608
02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:54.370
<v Speaker 1>How big is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They serve it to you.</v>

2609
02:07:54.371 --> 02:07:55.204
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2610
02:07:55.330 --> 02:07:55.840
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2611
02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:57.580
<v Speaker 1>It's about the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little.</v>

2612
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:58.743
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit smaller than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the last remaining cells that </v>

2613
02:08:01.241 --> 02:08:06.241
<v Speaker 1>haven't turned to total shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact area and the new aids runs rampant</v>

2614
02:08:06.341 --> 02:08:11.341
<v Speaker 1>through your cooler and that is the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious bite of food on the planet.</v>

2615
02:08:11.951 --> 02:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2616
02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:14.373
<v Speaker 1>according to these motherfuckers and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just had that the seven month there's </v>

2617
02:08:18.150 --> 02:08:18.983
<v Speaker 1>like food like you can't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a big difference between </v>

2618
02:08:21.851 --> 02:08:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seven month and five months later.</v>

2619
02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:25.690
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent are you fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>kidding me?</v>

2620
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:32.980
<v Speaker 1>How much better is the one that's a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to try it.</v>

2621
02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I haven't tried that one yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel that it's going to be very.</v>

2622
02:08:35.801 --> 02:08:40.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't have too much to the size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a flip phone portion.</v>

2623
02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Not the smaller one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smaller one.</v>

2624
02:08:45.490 --> 02:08:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller iphone.</v>

2625
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:49.150
<v Speaker 1>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to give you like a quarter</v>

2626
02:08:49.150 --> 02:08:51.580
<v Speaker 1>inch or half finished piece because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>too old.</v>

2627
02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:54.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like eating a whole thing of blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese.</v>

2628
02:08:54.670 --> 02:08:56.620
<v Speaker 1>White in one bite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2629
02:08:56.630 --> 02:08:58.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like the amount of bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2630
02:08:58.751 --> 02:08:59.920
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like the taste.</v>

2631
02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I love blue cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost.</v>

2632
02:09:01.631 --> 02:09:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Tastes like you're eating silver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2633
02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:07.060
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's fucking fungus.</v>

2634
02:09:07.090 --> 02:09:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2635
02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:10.750
<v Speaker 1>and I love that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

2636
02:09:10.751 --> 02:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I love Funky Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheese.</v>

2637
02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:17.950

<v Speaker 1>three year old,</v>

2638
02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:21.510
<v Speaker 1>eight year old cheeses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy She used.</v>

2644
02:09:35.681 --> 02:09:39.790
<v Speaker 1>ingredients we used to use on fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor to make things smell worse.</v>

2645
02:09:39.850 --> 02:09:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive cheese.</v>

2646
02:09:41.530 --> 02:09:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2647
02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:46.420
<v Speaker 1>They would go to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go to like a place in beverly</v>

2648
02:09:46.421 --> 02:09:47.254
<v Speaker 1>hills where they have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a giant selection of the grossest </v>

2649
02:09:54.491 --> 02:09:58.900
<v Speaker 1>rankest fucking funkiest cheeses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We opened the cart and you're like,</v>

2650
02:09:59.770 --> 02:10:03.130
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's super expensive and that stuff,</v>

2651
02:10:03.131 --> 02:10:03.964
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would throw that stuff in the </v>

2652
02:10:05.081 --> 02:10:07.450
<v Speaker 1>blenders to make like bugs smell worse.</v>

2653
02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:14.800
<v Speaker 1>No wonder they fucking threw up all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tabs there and just start throwing up.</v>

2654
02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bugs itself was not nearly as bad as</v>

2655
02:10:17.531 --> 02:10:21.600
<v Speaker 1>bugs blended in with cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a funky ass cheeks.</v>

2656
02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:22.673
<v Speaker 1>The smell was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you didn't know what </v>

2657
02:10:24.131 --> 02:10:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you smell certain cheeses,</v>

2658
02:10:27.130 --> 02:10:28.870
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't know what you were eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
