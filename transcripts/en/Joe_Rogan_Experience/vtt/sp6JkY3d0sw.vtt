54
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>now I don't feel sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I need to chill out and</v>

55
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>that's why I need the new mood because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more of like a,</v>

56
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that has tryptophan in it and it makes </v>

<v Speaker 1>you feel relaxed and it also makes you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit happier every day.</v>

63
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I think if you take take it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really take it.</v>

64
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I take Alpha brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't take the other ones.</v>

<v Speaker 1>brand and I take the immune shit.</v>

66
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What all this stuff is there.</v>

67
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Nootropics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this</v>

68
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 2>is my advice to you if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about,</v>

69
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 2>don't buy anything please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just Google nootropics.</v>

70
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot of really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles about the subject and it's </v>

71
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.700
<v Speaker 2>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been,</v>

72
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.850
<v Speaker 2>I've been experimenting with them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and I enjoy them and not just the </v>

73
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 2>ones that we sell have used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

74
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 2>there was a football player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his name is Roman,</v>

75
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.700
<v Speaker 2>asking pretty sure he has a company </v>
<v Speaker 2>called neuro one and apparently he had </v>

76
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 2>dealt with some concussions and stuff so</v>
<v Speaker 2>he created his own formula,</v>

77
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 2>like a neutral but formula to enhance </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way his mind worked and it was </v>

78
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 2>really interesting and I enjoy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

79
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I have no vested interest in whether you</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy it or don't buy it.</v>

80
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 2>I if you feel like you don't want to buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>it or you feel like it's too expensive,</v>

81
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I encourage people to steal the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingredients,</v>

82
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 2>copy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make your own like by,</v>

83
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 2>by the stuff in bulk and make your own.</v>

84
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

85
00:03:56.231 --> 00:04:01.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing is if you try and </v>

86
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:01.231
<v Speaker 2>you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you get 100 percent money back.</v>

87
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:05.460
<v Speaker 2>So we can't make it any easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't make it any nicer.</v>

88
00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 2>And what's most important to me is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody feels ripped off,</v>

89
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 2>that nobody wants to fucking blindly </v>
<v Speaker 2>buy.</v>

90
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't go to wikipedia.</v>

<v Speaker 2>jungle.</v>

118
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't really remember what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

119
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had taken some trip to hang out with</v>

120
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 2>some indigenous people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they give you?</v>

121
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 2>It was the Mirena Indians and they gave </v>
<v Speaker 2>me a.</v>

122
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually didn't give it to me.</v>

123
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 2>It was sort of a complicated trip to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find them,</v>

124
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:49.970
<v Speaker 2>but they traditionally use the venom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this frog cold fuel,</v>

125
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.990
<v Speaker 2>limited use of by color that produces a </v>
<v Speaker 2>denim that's written all of these </v>

126
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 2>different psychoactive peptides and </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically contains this</v>

127
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 4>substance called der Morphin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a super potent opioid,</v>

128
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.210
<v Speaker 4>but they kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

129
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't have any sort of like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>classical opioid effect,</v>

130
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.821
<v Speaker 4>like it's not really a sedative and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people claim that it gives them </v>

131
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.760
<v Speaker 4>everlasting energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're able to hunt for days without </v>

132
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.521
<v Speaker 4>sleep and to go days without eating and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of supernatural feats.</v>

133
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 4>You have a great voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>

134
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:31.511
<v Speaker 4>Can we just say that you're very </v>
<v Speaker 4>mysterious voice and it's very </v>

135
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should do cool shit if you know.</v>

136
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Cool Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have a voice like that dude.</v>

137
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Amazing plays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

138
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.570
<v Speaker 4>So what is the effect this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

139
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

140
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:48.041
<v Speaker 4>that's what I had been told that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would go days without requiring sleep </v>

141
00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:53.021
<v Speaker 4>and I'd be able to hunt all night for </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals in the jungle with these </v>

142
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:53.021
<v Speaker 4>Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

143
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:57.730
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was expecting more of a stimulant </v>

144
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.730
<v Speaker 4>type effect.</v>

145
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.170
<v Speaker 4>But then there's chemical warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>morphine,</v>

146
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 4>there's no real reason you should expect</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to be a stimulant.</v>

147
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:04.670
<v Speaker 4>It's an opioid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There used to be a theory of autism that</v>

148
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 4>was based on them detecting derm orphan </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the urine of autistic children.</v>

149
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.740
<v Speaker 4>So they thought that there was some kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of bacterial organism in the intestine </v>

150
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 4>of these children that was naturally </v>
<v Speaker 4>producing the Dir morphin.</v>

151
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.070
<v Speaker 4>And so they thought autism with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of opioid mediated pathology,</v>

152
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

153
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.460
<v Speaker 4>In the same way that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about endogenous dmt and how that can </v>

154
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 4>cause a psychedelic experience without </v>
<v Speaker 4>ingesting a drug.</v>

155
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:37.091
<v Speaker 4>This was the idea is that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>endogenous intestinal opioid bacteria </v>

156
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.580
<v Speaker 4>that produces derma orphan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's ever been demonstrated anyway.</v>

157
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 4>So I it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never been demonstrated.</v>

158
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 4>So had they come to this conclusion as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sounds so fascinating.</v>

159
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.330
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

160
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 4>I never heard that theory before.</v>

161
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 4>There's all kinds of psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 4>substances that have been detected in </v>

162
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 4>the urine of people with different sorts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of mental illnesses.</v>

163
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:03.251
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's five mod dmt detected in the </v>

164
00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:05.501
<v Speaker 4>urine of schizophrenia and Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally makes sense.</v>

165
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally makes sense.</v>

166
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 4>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we all have bodies,</v>

167
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 4>like people's bodies go haywire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

168
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.280
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things go running.</v>

169
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 4>I have egos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have spots on my hand where my pigment</v>

170
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:25.061
<v Speaker 4>doesn't grow anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like weird shit happens to </v>

171
00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 4>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We easily could happen to your bodies,</v>

172
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 4>your brain's ability to produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic chemicals.</v>

173
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if every day was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>tripping all day long?</v>

174
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.550
<v Speaker 4>Like you couldn't get out of tripping </v>
<v Speaker 4>Steph,</v>

175
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:42.551
<v Speaker 4>licking frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're licking this guy and paying him </v>

176
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:45.101
<v Speaker 4>$20 just to get off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you're doing with your</v>

177
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:49.420
<v Speaker 4>body was producing a drug like a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

178
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.670
<v Speaker 4>and the that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

179
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>

180
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 4>His body's now</v>

181
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.070
<v Speaker 2>producing a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's ingesting his body's producing a </v>

182
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.070
<v Speaker 2>drug internally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You silly boy,</v>

183
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.050
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if they secreted it?</v>

184
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck you're secreting the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

185
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:11.270
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were producing the drug inside </v>

186
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.981
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're urinating secretion frog,</v>

187
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.760
<v Speaker 2>how do they get it from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do they actually get five Mao from </v>

188
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:18.760
<v Speaker 2>frogs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can they do that?</v>

189
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

190
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

191
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 2>That's really some toads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

192
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.340
<v Speaker 2>and how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

193
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:31.341
<v Speaker 2>there's different techniques for doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice to know a guy that raised goofball </v>

194
00:09:31.341 --> 00:09:34.250
<v Speaker 2>various and she lives in Boston and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>glands that I just squirted out pretty </v>

195
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:40.941
<v Speaker 2>much collected at least for two on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck and on the legs and he would grab </v>

196
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 2>it by the scruff of its neck and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a cat and show it.</v>

197
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 2>The cat is terrified of cats and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that causes it to secrete the venom.</v>

198
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 2>And then he would pinch all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>glands onto a glass sheet and dry it.</v>

199
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell you the secrets.</v>

200
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Cat Joe in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything seems cat.</v>

201
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 2>We've been talking about feral cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These cats making drugs.</v>

202
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

203
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just scrape it up and smoke it?</v>

204
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just buy them Yo dmt.</v>

205
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.380
<v Speaker 2>There's also apparently some quantity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bufo Tinian and also a bunch of other </v>

206
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:21.321
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's not really safe to eat </v>

207
00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:21.321
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

208
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 2>The things people were risked to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

209
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually worth checking out.</v>

210
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Really actually used to shop where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd heard that before in the podcast.</v>

211
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a lot of research and buying</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in mass quantities when I lived in </v>

212
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Ohio I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

213
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:41.170
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe invest in a few frogs and </v>

214
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 2>cultivate a relationship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

215
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 2>is it illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be illegal.</v>

216
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Five immuno DMT was recently scheduled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

217
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.960
<v Speaker 2>it uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to be you could get in five mel </v>

218
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 2>dmt like on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

219
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

220
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just didn't know.</v>

221
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it really poses that much </v>

222
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.341
<v Speaker 2>of a risk in terms of a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very many dmt hospitalizations </v>

223
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 2>compared to even things like lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just such a rare thing and it lasts</v>

224
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 2>for such a short period of time.</v>

225
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.700
<v Speaker 2>You can just make it like a frog kissing</v>
<v Speaker 2>booth to get around the law,</v>

226
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just say like,</v>

227
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 2>don't say like this is to lick and error</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the drug off of weight.</v>

228
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want this drug and you encase it,</v>

229
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.660
<v Speaker 2>bring you to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bring it to.</v>

230
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 2>You're going to bring you to a doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's gonna.</v>

231
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.740
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find out what the fuck is wrong with </v>

232
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:33.740
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went too deep in the rabbit hole.</v>

233
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:38.820
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a guest like Hamilton Morris is </v>

234
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see where you,</v>

235
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:41.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a little carried away.</v>

236
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.170
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wanted to,</v>

237
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to perform on his level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

238
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

239
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I just want to go where he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stoner is playing around too much.</v>

240
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.260
<v Speaker 2>You already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even a professional stoner.</v>

241
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>You're like a professional,</v>

242
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 5>a psychoactive expert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like one of those dudes.</v>

243
00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 5>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

244
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 5>what is it about that lotus flower?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you can go,</v>

245
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well the ludas flower and you'll explain</v>

246
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:10.081
<v Speaker 5>it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you know so much about all this </v>

247
00:12:10.081 --> 00:12:10.081
<v Speaker 5>stuff?</v>

248
00:12:10.081 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've studied it in school for years.</v>

249
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:13.410
<v Speaker 4>I started out studying neuroscience and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>

250
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.010
<v Speaker 5>where'd you go to school at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>University of Chicago.</v>

251
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.280
<v Speaker 5>So this was something that was just </v>
<v Speaker 5>always pulling at you,</v>

252
00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:22.300
<v Speaker 5>like how the mind works and various </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemicals.</v>

253
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

254
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily with the drug </v>

255
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.571
<v Speaker 4>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was always interested in science </v>

256
00:12:30.571 --> 00:12:32.370
<v Speaker 4>and neuroscience and then once you </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that area,</v>

257
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes even more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then also medicinal chemistry,</v>

258
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.540
<v Speaker 4>pharmacology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all interrelated.</v>

259
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.560
<v Speaker 5>And now how did you start putting </v>
<v Speaker 5>together these videos online?</v>

260
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.370
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I left Chicago and moved to New </v>

261
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.930
<v Speaker 4>York and a friend of a friend worked at </v>
<v Speaker 4>vice magazine and told the editor that I</v>

262
00:12:51.931 --> 00:12:56.931
<v Speaker 4>had been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was interested both academically and </v>

263
00:12:56.931 --> 00:12:58.740
<v Speaker 4>in terms of writing about all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic drugs and they want us to do</v>

264
00:12:58.741 --> 00:13:02.670
<v Speaker 4>more informed drug related content for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the magazine.</v>

265
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.700
<v Speaker 4>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they asked me to start writing a </v>

266
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:12.771
<v Speaker 4>monthly column,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but vice used to have a totally </v>

267
00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:13.430
<v Speaker 4>different attitude towards drugs in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of uh,</v>

268
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:20.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd give someone like an ounce of </v>

269
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.330
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms and put them in a hotel room </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just record everything.</v>

270
00:13:21.331 --> 00:13:26.331
<v Speaker 4>They did what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't really interested in the </v>

271
00:13:26.331 --> 00:13:26.331
<v Speaker 4>science of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that that's a bad thing.</v>

272
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Speaker 5>So they used to have that attitude,</v>

273
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.900
<v Speaker 4>used to have that attitude and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're more open minded to discussing </v>

274
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.190
<v Speaker 4>the scientific aspects.</v>

275
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.780
<v Speaker 5>So do you think the scientific aspects </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the longest time where it was it </v>

276
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.861
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like maybe a hunter s </v>

277
00:13:42.861 --> 00:13:44.791
<v Speaker 5>Thompson that maybe fucked a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people up because his thing was just </v>

278
00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 5>sort of tag on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blast off and enjoy the ride of it,</v>

279
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that you were kind of a fool to try </v>

280
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:54.920
<v Speaker 5>to quantify it and package it all </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

281
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that that kind of like set </v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of mindset?</v>

282
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:04.201
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes that means that it's a fun </v>
<v Speaker 5>mindset when you talk about like eating </v>

283
00:14:04.201 --> 00:14:05.260
<v Speaker 5>some mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to a football game.</v>

284
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean some people who like looked down </v>
<v Speaker 5>upon that,</v>

285
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.040
<v Speaker 5>but there's other people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I actually enjoy doing something </v>

286
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the spiritual thing.</v>

287
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 5>It's not the full blown psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection that you can make.</v>

288
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I certainly do.</v>

289
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 5>It's fun to write</v>

290
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.430
<v Speaker 4>down on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

291
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.460
<v Speaker 4>I think any way that anyone chooses to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it is perfectly fine as long as they </v>

292
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.131
<v Speaker 4>benefit from it and don't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't like stab people in the process </v>

293
00:14:32.131 --> 00:14:32.910
<v Speaker 4>or kill a dog or something.</v>

294
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.290
<v Speaker 5>If it was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be great because then you would</v>

295
00:14:36.291 --> 00:14:41.291
<v Speaker 5>know like what everything was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be the best way to deal with </v>

296
00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:45.971
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You the the idea that you just buying </v>

297
00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:49.661
<v Speaker 5>stuff from people you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so hard to cultivate a friendship.</v>

298
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.320
<v Speaker 5>You know where you're trusting someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>to sell you something they're not </v>

299
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:56.320
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be selling you</v>

300
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.120
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get into a tricky situation.</v>

301
00:14:58.121 --> 00:15:00.100
<v Speaker 4>They don't both parties to the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

302
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:05.130
<v Speaker 4>Especially with something like lsd where</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows where it actually comes from </v>

303
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.621
<v Speaker 4>with something like mushrooms and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're one degree of separation away </v>

304
00:15:08.621 --> 00:15:09.180
<v Speaker 4>from the source.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's producing the material and.</v>

305
00:15:09.181 --> 00:15:12.820
<v Speaker 4>But with Lsd it could be 20 degrees of </v>
<v Speaker 4>separation.</v>

306
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.070
<v Speaker 4>You don't even know what it is.</v>

307
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.590
<v Speaker 5>You got to be bold as fuck to eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms in the wild</v>

308
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.020
<v Speaker 4>because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because just to be sure it is.</v>

309
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are there few psychedelic mushrooms?</v>

310
00:15:24.881 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 4>It looked like really similar to things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are like super poisonous.</v>

311
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.970
<v Speaker 4>Definitely Gallery Ryan and margin Ada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of the gala rhina mushrooms look</v>

312
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.770
<v Speaker 4>a lot like the slow subbies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>massively poisonous.</v>

313
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 4>Do you imagine how many people have died</v>
<v Speaker 4>from that?</v>

314
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's terrifying,</v>

315
00:15:44.231 --> 00:15:46.230
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on camera.</v>

316
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.200
<v Speaker 4>You're in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

317
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.210
<v Speaker 5>You can just observe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just too weird.</v>

318
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.060
<v Speaker 5>Have a seat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

319
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.800
<v Speaker 5>Have a seat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sit Down with us.</v>

320
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.020
<v Speaker 5>We got to include your camera guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise it doesn't feel organic or </v>

321
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.990
<v Speaker 5>feels stared at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is Matt.</v>

322
00:16:00.991 --> 00:16:05.991
<v Speaker 5>Everybody mad at the camera guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's here as well because I'm Hamilton </v>

323
00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:11.331
<v Speaker 5>is doing something on isolation tanks </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we're going to check out the float </v>

324
00:16:11.701 --> 00:16:16.701
<v Speaker 5>lab tomorrow in Venice where a crash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friend Craig a crash is a mad genius </v>

325
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.680
<v Speaker 5>putting together the baddest float tanks</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>

326
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.670
<v Speaker 5>We're going to go check out his stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>and his crazy cellular influence device.</v>

327
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.700
<v Speaker 4>When did you first learn about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>flotation tanks?</v>

328
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Is this something that you knew for </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile or did?</v>

329
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

330
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

331
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.890
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What gave you the idea to,</v>

332
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.850
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make do this project?</v>

333
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.080
<v Speaker 4>I've always found them interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're pretty fascinating for </v>

334
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.660
<v Speaker 4>anyone that's studied the history of </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic drugs,</v>

335
00:16:45.661 --> 00:16:50.661
<v Speaker 4>just because John Lilly use them in such</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting ways and also at the very </v>

336
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:55.311
<v Speaker 4>beginning of psychedelic research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were always these attempts to try </v>

337
00:16:55.311 --> 00:16:58.491
<v Speaker 4>and isolate the experience from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment in some way when they were </v>

338
00:16:58.491 --> 00:17:02.061
<v Speaker 4>trying to quantify or qualify the </v>
<v Speaker 4>different effects of new drugs in the </v>

339
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:06.470
<v Speaker 4>sixties and because it's a class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so much based on the environment </v>

340
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to try and figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to remove subjects from the environment </v>

341
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.020
<v Speaker 4>and test them in some kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbiased setting.</v>

342
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:18.290
<v Speaker 4>And the two ways they had were sensory </v>
<v Speaker 4>deprivation tanks in these Ganzfeld </v>

343
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:18.660
<v Speaker 4>devices.</v>

344
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.530
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

345
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.660
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

346
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.800
<v Speaker 5>you sit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about it earlier.</v>

347
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:29.801
<v Speaker 5>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've only had one century and it was </v>

348
00:17:29.801 --> 00:17:33.841
<v Speaker 5>quite awhile ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sucks that it's not more readily </v>

349
00:17:33.841 --> 00:17:34.020
<v Speaker 5>available,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

350
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.460
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

351
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.480
<v Speaker 5>if you could just get into it for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit,</v>

352
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you get into like a regular thing,</v>

353
00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:42.010
<v Speaker 5>like even just once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's great man.</v>

354
00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:43.390
<v Speaker 5>If you could find a place that has it</v>

355
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.650
<v Speaker 4>and it's like a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet like I just recently got my first </v>

356
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 4>massage and I always kind of went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shunted off just because it seemed</v>

357
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.280
<v Speaker 5>weird to me and I got my first one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I get it,</v>

358
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just nice relaxation,</v>

359
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not that expensive.</v>

360
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.040
<v Speaker 5>It's really good for you too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's really good to have someone</v>

361
00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:02.160
<v Speaker 5>that be affectionate to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's just,</v>

362
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's just,</v>

363
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone rubbing you with their fingers,</v>

364
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 5>like that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really intimate.</v>

365
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:12.170
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're pretending that it's not sexual </v>

366
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.920
<v Speaker 5>because it's not touching your growing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when some big fat,</v>

367
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:18.921
<v Speaker 5>sweaty woman who really knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>rubberneck when she's getting in there </v>

368
00:18:18.921 --> 00:18:23.031
<v Speaker 5>with lotion and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ladies fucking giving you affection,</v>

369
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:28.101
<v Speaker 5>they're giving you affection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rubbing your legs when someone's </v>

370
00:18:28.101 --> 00:18:28.101
<v Speaker 5>rubbing your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

371
00:18:28.101 --> 00:18:32.150
<v Speaker 5>They might as well be blowing you when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're getting their heel into the </v>

372
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 5>little children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>little children,</v>

373
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 5>to leave the genitals out of the picture</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's the person who's doing.</v>

374
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.880
<v Speaker 5>They're being affectionate to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're paying them to be ultimately </v>

375
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 5>affection to you because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it works the muscles.</v>

376
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.590
<v Speaker 5>And yet increases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

377
00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 5>a blood flow and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it breaks up scar tissue.</v>

378
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:52.850
<v Speaker 5>It's great therapeutically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also great because it's </v>

379
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:52.850
<v Speaker 5>affection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if they finished it off with like,</v>

380
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.820
<v Speaker 5>like rocking you in a chair where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>held you for like 20 minutes at the end </v>

381
00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.520
<v Speaker 5>and they were just like playing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their hair at the very end,</v>

382
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 5>like a baby or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how that would work.</v>

383
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.850
<v Speaker 5>This is like that extra $10 they'll do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

384
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:13.420
<v Speaker 5>They said to do the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember there was a place I used to </v>

385
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 5>go to and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

386
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 5>they arrested one of the dudes there </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he was a,</v>

387
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.550
<v Speaker 5>he was given dudes massages and blow </v>
<v Speaker 5>jobs.</v>

388
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.090
<v Speaker 5>He was like blowing a lot of the gang </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>

389
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.520
<v Speaker 5>And so they caught him the win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

390
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:31.521
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just trying to make his customers </v>

391
00:19:31.521 --> 00:19:31.521
<v Speaker 5>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

392
00:19:31.521 --> 00:19:32.370
<v Speaker 5>What is customer one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

393
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is what the guy wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wanted to do it too.</v>

394
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.610
<v Speaker 5>Who got hurt there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They should have that for everything.</v>

395
00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as it's really clear that that's</v>

396
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:41.290
<v Speaker 5>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

397
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.380
<v Speaker 5>Because if you're like a straight guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all of a sudden he's blowing you and</v>

398
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:44.070
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

399
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 5>wrong signal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

400
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.970
<v Speaker 5>but if you're a gay guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

401
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We try to stop that.</v>

402
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.520
<v Speaker 5>Why we try to stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hamilton Morris in 2012.</v>

403
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.190
<v Speaker 5>Why math?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The camera man.</v>

404
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.860
<v Speaker 5>Matt the camera man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can talk,</v>

405
00:19:58.861 --> 00:20:01.260
<v Speaker 5>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to talk.</v>

406
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.620
<v Speaker 5>So it's crazy seeing the internet all </v>
<v Speaker 5>blacked out today.</v>

407
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.510
<v Speaker 5>Like say Google and Reddit and a tedious</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hamilton.</v>

408
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I noticed it.</v>

409
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 5>What did you think about the soap?</v>

410
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.490
<v Speaker 5>A thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't read enough about it.</v>

411
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:19.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's horrifying if it is what I </v>

412
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.071
<v Speaker 5>think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'd like to do a little more </v>

413
00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:24.950
<v Speaker 5>research.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can even read about wikipedia was </v>

414
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:25.380
<v Speaker 5>blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It represents a trend.</v>

415
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.620
<v Speaker 5>It represents an attempt in whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is it's trying to control or having the </v>

416
00:20:30.841 --> 00:20:34.830
<v Speaker 5>ability to control the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but reality is they can do that.</v>

417
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:37.320
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the government wanted to step in,</v>

418
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 5>like if you had some crazy al Qaeda kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of website up,</v>

419
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.200
<v Speaker 5>they can shut you down and trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not gonna do anything but create an</v>

420
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:48.930
<v Speaker 5>underground tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all going to use and it's going to</v>

421
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.900
<v Speaker 5>be really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just,</v>

422
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.100
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't lose.</v>

423
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 5>You're going to lose against the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet if you tried to do this anyway.</v>

424
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:59.161
<v Speaker 5>If you tried to start banning websites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you tried to like start monitoring </v>

425
00:20:59.161 --> 00:20:59.161
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're.</v>

426
00:20:59.161 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 5>The Internet will find a hack for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like they do every single iphone </v>

427
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:04.100
<v Speaker 5>that day before it's released.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

428
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.530
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>

429
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who is they?</v>

430
00:21:06.911 --> 00:21:07.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's been,</v>

431
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.800
<v Speaker 5>who's ultimately going to be in control </v>
<v Speaker 5>of it and what you know is it,</v>

432
00:21:10.801 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 5>is it really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what's going on?</v>

433
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:17.671
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's a vague.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what's what's happening is </v>

434
00:21:17.671 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 5>people were realizing as more people get</v>
<v Speaker 5>more access to information,</v>

435
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.910
<v Speaker 5>that they're not buying the bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore and the only way to stop that is</v>

436
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.580
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to limit their </v>
<v Speaker 5>access to information.</v>

437
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>control them.</v>

438
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow another box them up.</v>

439
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:36.230
<v Speaker 5>You gonna have to be able somehow to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The trend is giving information freely </v>

440
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.591
<v Speaker 5>through these fucking cell phones and </v>
<v Speaker 5>wireless Internet connections and </v>

441
00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:44.580
<v Speaker 5>they're coordinating meetings and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are setting things up and they </v>

442
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:44.580
<v Speaker 5>can't stop it.</v>

443
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.520
<v Speaker 5>They can't control it and that's driving</v>
<v Speaker 5>them crazy,</v>

444
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.290
<v Speaker 5>but they can also work through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

445
00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:52.291
<v Speaker 5>Like when you think about how many </v>
<v Speaker 5>wikipedia entries are written by the </v>

446
00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical companies that are the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

447
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:55.590
<v Speaker 5>how much wikipedia material is actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>advertising in one way.</v>

448
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

449
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:57.850
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if anyone can edit it,</v>

450
00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.580
<v Speaker 5>who wouldn't take advantage of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible resource?</v>

451
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine.</v>

452
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not all good.</v>

453
00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:05.350
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not perfect,</v>

454
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:10.770
<v Speaker 5>but it's the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best way is let the Internet sorted </v>

455
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.131
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best way is not the government </v>

456
00:22:14.131 --> 00:22:14.131
<v Speaker 5>controls the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the worst way.</v>

457
00:22:14.131 --> 00:22:18.300
<v Speaker 5>That's the worst way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of people are willing to go to </v>

458
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:18.490
<v Speaker 5>war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get to control the Internet.</v>

459
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:20.170
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

460
00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:21.670
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

461
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.940
<v Speaker 5>You fucking resource hogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can control the Internet to Jesus </v>

462
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you'd steel in minerals in </v>

463
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.470
<v Speaker 5>Africa and stealing oil in the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 5>East and trying to jack the Internet.</v>

464
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 5>It's the same motherfuckers got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Damn it Brian.</v>

465
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:40.920
<v Speaker 5>I blacked out my website today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you really?</v>

466
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to do it.</v>

467
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it didn't really poorly and quick.</v>

468
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.760
<v Speaker 5>I just changed the logo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Made all the texts gray,</v>

469
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.810
<v Speaker 5>dark gray.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like you're a part of the </v>

470
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:52.660
<v Speaker 5>movement now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel a little left out.</v>

471
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 5>I feel left out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

472
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.800
<v Speaker 5>NBC would probably be pissed off at you </v>
<v Speaker 5>if he did that.</v>

473
00:22:56.801 --> 00:22:58.930
<v Speaker 5>Probably if I blacked out my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

474
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 5>because I mean the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>asking Sofa is all the big media giants.</v>

475
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:06.300
<v Speaker 5>You know all that Darlin's that want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Google's not back.</v>

476
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.790
<v Speaker 5>Wikipedia is not entertainment studios </v>
<v Speaker 5>like Disney.</v>

477
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.720
<v Speaker 5>NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

478
00:23:13.721 --> 00:23:18.721
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they will be the ones who could </v>

479
00:23:18.721 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 5>benefit from a crackdown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to think about how much money</v>

480
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.240
<v Speaker 5>has been lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now there's my question.</v>

481
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.660
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people have gotten things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't deserve because they kind of</v>

482
00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.940
<v Speaker 5>download them illegally maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how much money was lost was really </v>

483
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:40.351
<v Speaker 5>any money lost of wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if like I wonder if it didn't </v>

484
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:42.580
<v Speaker 5>exist with those people have gone out </v>
<v Speaker 5>and bought it.</v>

485
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:47.581
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or would you say maybe they just </v>

486
00:23:47.581 --> 00:23:47.581
<v Speaker 5>downloaded it</v>

487
00:23:47.581 --> 00:23:48.920
<v Speaker 1>on a whim and maybe if they like it they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might tell somebody else,</v>

488
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:49.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My buyer.</v>

489
00:23:49.991 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Like it's possible that it's not causing</v>
<v Speaker 1>any loss,</v>

490
00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.450
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

491
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a lot seminar.</v>

492
00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.000
<v Speaker 1>If you look at go to a movie theater </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays.</v>

493
00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are downloading shit.</v>

494
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 1>You think that's what's going on for </v>
<v Speaker 1>real?</v>

495
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

496
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I hate to admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do it.</v>

497
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:10.151
<v Speaker 1>I used to know I downloaded every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie allegedly that came out that </v>

498
00:24:10.151 --> 00:24:11.530
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>

499
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean I might be a character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idiot.</v>

500
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared to like a typical guy on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

501
00:24:19.851 --> 00:24:20.990
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

502
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

503
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't now I don't do that shit.</v>

504
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if,</v>

505
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:32.170
<v Speaker 1>if the movie theaters are empty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because of the economy a and </v>

506
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.060
<v Speaker 1>because of the movie is suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of movies suck.</v>

507
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.640
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find good movies and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

508
00:24:37.641 --> 00:24:42.641
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird going to the movies nowadays </v>

509
00:24:42.641 --> 00:24:42.950
<v Speaker 1>and taking a girl on a date and spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>$80,</v>

510
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

511
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:48.521
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to like $6 movie tickets </v>

512
00:24:48.521 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 1>instead of $20 movie to cause inflation </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

513
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of the reasons.</v>

514
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:56.951
<v Speaker 1>There's a movie theater that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasadena by the ice house w that we </v>

515
00:24:56.951 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 1>walked by and yet the movies were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two weeks old.</v>

516
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.800
<v Speaker 1>They weren't first week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they weren't old yet and they were</v>

517
00:25:00.801 --> 00:25:01.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think $3 tickets.</v>

518
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 1>That place is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the name of that place?</v>

519
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's off of Colorado.</v>

520
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I love when you find a place like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

521
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:13.100
<v Speaker 1>it does something cool like that place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just slightly old movies.</v>

522
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Really cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super cheap.</v>

523
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.130
<v Speaker 1>That's how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

524
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I can wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll wait.</v>

525
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll support your cool business and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a retro movie theater.</v>

526
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not new at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's old school,</v>

527
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:25.310
<v Speaker 1>what you remember in the eighties when </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] came out and you're like,</v>

528
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coolest movie experience Evermann we </v>

529
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.420
<v Speaker 1>were playing at the Houston livestock </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

530
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.860
<v Speaker 1>who is that stupid movie that they made </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

531
00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:37.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kids in the woods and it was like a</v>

532
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.430
<v Speaker 1>witch Blair way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blair witch project,</v>

533
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that it?</v>

534
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.750
<v Speaker 1>That it was like a fake documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>style,</v>

535
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.960
<v Speaker 1>which we wanted me and Chris Mcguire </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch that.</v>

536
00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:52.961
<v Speaker 1>These guys came down to the show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then afterwards one of them worked at a </v>

537
00:25:52.961 --> 00:25:56.951
<v Speaker 1>movie theater and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys want to go see the Blair witch </v>

538
00:25:56.951 --> 00:25:56.951
<v Speaker 1>project?</v>

539
00:25:56.951 --> 00:25:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Like right now just to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

540
00:25:57.081 --> 00:25:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was me and him,</v>

541
00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:04.860
<v Speaker 1>my buddy Chris and a couple of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and we just alone in the </v>

542
00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He turned the thing on,</v>

543
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:09.200
<v Speaker 1>like he literally had the keys and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched the Blair witch project alone.</v>

544
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was fucking awesome.</v>

545
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:16.300
<v Speaker 1>So the only way to watch that thing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the perfect way to watch that </v>

546
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.780
<v Speaker 1>movie and I tried to watch it again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking terrible.</v>

547
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Second thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was terrible.</v>

548
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I tried to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

549
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.440
<v Speaker 1>recreate the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear that Mcdonald's has to now </v>

550
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.240
<v Speaker 1>put up signs saying that their French </v>
<v Speaker 1>fries cause cancer that there.</v>

551
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in,</v>

552
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's in French fries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potato chips,</v>

553
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:36.260
<v Speaker 1>coffee cigarettes at the chemical was </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced through the browning process.</v>

554
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:41.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they put the fries in the </v>

555
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Fryer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it causes cancer.</v>

556
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Like that Browning Browning of what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

557
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.640
<v Speaker 5>the oils that are in it or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

558
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 5>so they have to put up signs and I guess</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's ways around it,</v>

559
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 5>like they don't have to use do it the </v>
<v Speaker 5>browning process or they could do it the</v>

560
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.120
<v Speaker 5>baking process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that of course would take long.</v>

561
00:26:57.121 --> 00:26:59.940
<v Speaker 5>The thing with fries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it probably makes it super clear.</v>

562
00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.160
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the browning process and it kind</v>

563
00:27:02.161 --> 00:27:07.161
<v Speaker 5>of makes sense because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they say that if you eat meat and you </v>

564
00:27:07.161 --> 00:27:07.161
<v Speaker 5>eat it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

565
00:27:07.161 --> 00:27:08.120
<v Speaker 5>well done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the carbon,</v>

566
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.500
<v Speaker 5>the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like really not good.</v>

567
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 5>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

568
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.700
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the black shit that people love the </v>

569
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.310
<v Speaker 5>crispy outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like really bad for you.</v>

570
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the worst part,</v>

571
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.780
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it is a fucking weird people,</v>

572
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:23.490
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they're so delicious.</v>

573
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 5>That's the most taste,</v>
<v Speaker 5>best tasting cancer ever.</v>

574
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:27.570
<v Speaker 5>What did you say that's the best tasting</v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer.</v>

575
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.380
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

576
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people got mad at us because of</v>
<v Speaker 5>this last podcast.</v>

577
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:35.280
<v Speaker 5>I had a fucking bunch of annoyed people </v>
<v Speaker 5>with me on twitter.</v>

578
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.320
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

579
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:41.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a couple of people that are </v>

580
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 5>annoyed that we're vegans and one guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>might have overreacted to because I just</v>

581
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:45.170
<v Speaker 5>get tired of people in their Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm Vegan,</v>

582
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.220
<v Speaker 5>like they say something and then go </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegan.</v>

583
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.640
<v Speaker 5>And he was a saint because we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about um,</v>

584
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals getting killed in processing </v>

585
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:56.360
<v Speaker 5>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does happen,</v>

586
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>groundhogs,</v>

587
00:27:57.271 --> 00:28:02.160
<v Speaker 5>all kinds of animals die know it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you buy plants from a store.</v>

588
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:07.161
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you're a grow your own organic </v>

589
00:28:07.161 --> 00:28:09.441
<v Speaker 5>setup and you're doing it all yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chances are in the harvesting of the </v>

590
00:28:09.441 --> 00:28:09.441
<v Speaker 5>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some animals are going to die,</v>

591
00:28:09.441 --> 00:28:11.900
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately even more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

592
00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.220
<v Speaker 5>Maybe even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's different.</v>

593
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.360
<v Speaker 5>It's like mice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

594
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.460
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

595
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:22.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the area is going to be devastated </v>

596
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.450
<v Speaker 5>unless you have some like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really good setup or it's like,</v>

597
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great composting.</v>

598
00:28:27.431 --> 00:28:32.431
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you're doing it all yourself for </v>

599
00:28:32.431 --> 00:28:32.431
<v Speaker 5>your own food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're doing it all yourself for your</v>

600
00:28:32.431 --> 00:28:32.730
<v Speaker 5>own food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one thing.</v>

601
00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:35.310
<v Speaker 5>But if you're buying some shit from </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole foods or from wherever it's coming</v>

602
00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:37.800
<v Speaker 5>from a farm somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's organically grown,</v>

603
00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 5>you don't think some animals are getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>jacked.</v>

604
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.660
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was an article about doe in </v>

605
00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:45.840
<v Speaker 5>Australia at least it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a greater total loss of life,</v>

606
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:50.841
<v Speaker 5>but it's a different type of life if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a vegetarian than if you're an </v>

607
00:28:50.841 --> 00:28:50.841
<v Speaker 5>omnivore because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

608
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:56.030
<v Speaker 5>because of all the mice that are killed </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the process of harvesting Greens.</v>

609
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.370
<v Speaker 5>But I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't totally make sense.</v>

610
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.860
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

611
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't think this is where they're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>

612
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.330
<v Speaker 5>They're sensitive people and I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand that.</v>

613
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.740
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can understand that,</v>

614
00:29:10.741 --> 00:29:11.670
<v Speaker 5>appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

615
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:12.990
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

616
00:29:12.991 --> 00:29:17.991
<v Speaker 5>it gets annoying that I'm Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's this self self righteous </v>

617
00:29:17.991 --> 00:29:21.840
<v Speaker 5>air to it and there's a weird thing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's okay to live,</v>

618
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.230
<v Speaker 5>to eat some living things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's okay to kill trees.</v>

619
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.790
<v Speaker 5>It's okay to kill plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's okay to kill fruit and vegetables.</v>

620
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.610
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To kill that.</v>

621
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.880
<v Speaker 5>You can kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could chop that fucking let us read </v>

622
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 5>out of the ground and it's debt and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you eat it.</v>

623
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.580
<v Speaker 5>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not okay to kill an animal </v>

624
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:40.580
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

625
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.140
<v Speaker 5>when do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when do you draw a line?</v>

626
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 5>Is there any distinction that would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If the animal was just meet,</v>

627
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.410
<v Speaker 5>it was just meet with a heartbeat and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't think and it just sat there.</v>

628
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.700
<v Speaker 5>If it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you didn't need it,</v>

629
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:49.480
<v Speaker 5>somebody else would.</v>

630
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.870
<v Speaker 5>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>At what point is it okay to eat an </v>

631
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:58.681
<v Speaker 5>animal and other life form?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it only stuff that can't move </v>

632
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 5>already?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're sensitive people.</v>

633
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.950
<v Speaker 5>What you should be asking for the like </v>
<v Speaker 5>even responding to that because who </v>

634
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:06.300
<v Speaker 5>cares what other people eat and what </v>
<v Speaker 5>their views on.</v>

635
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:11.710
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's certain cruelty </v>

636
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.620
<v Speaker 5>associated with factory farming and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with this gross.</v>

637
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.420
<v Speaker 5>It's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

638
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:21.140
<v Speaker 5>I try to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try to avoid cheeseburgers except in </v>

639
00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:21.550
<v Speaker 5>and out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in and out.</v>

640
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty fucking spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five guys burgers.</v>

641
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:28.240
<v Speaker 5>I hope those cows were treated well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I had known they were treated well,</v>

642
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:33.270
<v Speaker 5>I feel much better about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the reality of you by Kentucky Fried</v>

643
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 5>Chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you by any sort of meat product,</v>

644
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:41.041
<v Speaker 5>from any fast food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything you're buying something that </v>

645
00:30:41.041 --> 00:30:44.101
<v Speaker 5>did not live a happy life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know it's going to be the cheapest </v>

646
00:30:44.101 --> 00:30:44.101
<v Speaker 5>meat they can possibly get you.</v>

647
00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.240
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

648
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.810
<v Speaker 5>isn't it right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Africans fiberglass,</v>

649
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.920
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

650
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.620
<v Speaker 5>look at Taco Bell's meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want,</v>

651
00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think vegans are silly.</v>

652
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.480
<v Speaker 5>I just don't agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't agree with it.</v>

653
00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:03.481
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think we should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we should be treating </v>

654
00:31:03.701 --> 00:31:08.701
<v Speaker 5>animals the way we treat people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we should be kind to everything </v>

655
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:10.780
<v Speaker 5>we can be kind to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely think factory farming.</v>

656
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:13.450
<v Speaker 5>It's fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think regular farming,</v>

657
00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:15.330
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty goddamn natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

658
00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:16.810
<v Speaker 5>it's what people have been doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>forever.</v>

659
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:21.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you're not abusing the </v>

660
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:21.890
<v Speaker 5>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

661
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:22.570
<v Speaker 5>it's what people have been doing for </v>
<v Speaker 5>forever and those animals.</v>

662
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's to say that you're not supposed to</v>

663
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 5>take out cows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's silly to me.</v>

664
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 5>Someone's going to take them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it a Jaguar?</v>

665
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.070
<v Speaker 5>The Jaguar is and take them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can people take the cow out?</v>

666
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.550
<v Speaker 5>We can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about extremeness though,</v>

667
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.560
<v Speaker 5>unlike most people don't believe that </v>
<v Speaker 5>even even most like normal anti cruelty </v>

668
00:31:40.561 --> 00:31:44.100
<v Speaker 5>animal companies or whatever they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>called charities,</v>

669
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even them,</v>

670
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.270
<v Speaker 5>they still believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

671
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.440
<v Speaker 5>humane killing of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

672
00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:51.750
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're talking about is people that</v>

673
00:31:51.751 --> 00:31:52.920
<v Speaker 5>are just like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

674
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:53.790
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

675
00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:55.020
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely grades,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

676
00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:55.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

677
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.000
<v Speaker 5>And that's only a small amount of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people at Joe's,</v>

678
00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.030
<v Speaker 5>like you're talking about like the three</v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter,</v>

679
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.160
<v Speaker 5>twitter followers or whatever is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

680
00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:07.161
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a significant chunk of the </v>

681
00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:07.161
<v Speaker 5>population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of people that are</v>

682
00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:10.311
<v Speaker 5>like really upset at any idea of any </v>
<v Speaker 5>cruel to whatsoever the animals and you </v>

683
00:32:10.311 --> 00:32:10.860
<v Speaker 5>know what man is because they love their</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>

684
00:32:10.861 --> 00:32:15.861
<v Speaker 5>I totally get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did love their animals and I totally </v>

685
00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:17.760
<v Speaker 5>get loving wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

686
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:21.030
<v Speaker 5>the idea that they're going to live </v>
<v Speaker 5>forever if you don't eat them.</v>

687
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.380
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck's happening here?</v>

688
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.090
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't eat animals ever.</v>

689
00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:26.040
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's going to eat them?</v>

690
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 5>Then block them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fuck's gonna happen.</v>

691
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.060
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna.</v>

692
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:34.070
<v Speaker 5>Go around and gelding them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta to make sure that these elk </v>

693
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.360
<v Speaker 5>don't fuck because otherwise they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be everywhere you ever go to.</v>

694
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 5>There's a town in Colorado called </v>
<v Speaker 5>Evergreen,</v>

695
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 5>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful place.</v>

696
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's up in the mountains and it's,</v>

697
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:45.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

698
00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

699
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 5>there's a certain part of town where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't go anywhere,</v>

700
00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:50.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at a,</v>

701
00:32:50.321 --> 00:32:55.321
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>during certain migrations because the </v>

702
00:32:55.321 --> 00:32:56.210
<v Speaker 5>elks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll just walk down the main street.</v>

703
00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like a hundred elk.</v>

704
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.740
<v Speaker 5>There's a photo of them and there's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a herd of them and they're walking down </v>

705
00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 5>the middle of the street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

706
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.040
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a crazy place where you live,</v>

707
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A herd of elk,</v>

708
00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:13.470
<v Speaker 5>just Walkman.</v>

709
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:14.440
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

710
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.050
<v Speaker 5>if it wasn't for people shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those elk herd would be 200.</v>

711
00:33:18.051 --> 00:33:20.330
<v Speaker 5>The next year it'd be 300.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not enough predators.</v>

712
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.730
<v Speaker 5>Like unless you want more mountain </v>
<v Speaker 5>lions,</v>

713
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Speaker 5>unless you want to start bringing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain lions in your daily equation,</v>

714
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.450
<v Speaker 5>you've got to do something to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 5>those elk.</v>

715
00:33:27.451 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to shoot those fucking things.</v>

716
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:34.950
<v Speaker 5>We want to live there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to shoot a deer or </v>

717
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.991
<v Speaker 5>fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you've ever been in a place where </v>

718
00:33:37.991 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 5>deer are like super plentiful and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't drive safe now Ohio,</v>

719
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.980
<v Speaker 5>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's deer flying all over the place </v>

720
00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:44.980
<v Speaker 5>and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wake up.</v>

721
00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.940
<v Speaker 5>Normally I would wake up at my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at my dad's house when I lived at my </v>

722
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:48.940
<v Speaker 5>dad's house and see a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

723
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.660
<v Speaker 5>like every week I would see a couple in </v>
<v Speaker 5>my backyard.</v>

724
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you're driving home at night,</v>

725
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:55.610
<v Speaker 5>that's the main streets are right next </v>
<v Speaker 5>to my dad's neighborhood.</v>

726
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 5>So I mean obviously that's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

727
00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 5>Somebody is going to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to eat more of those.</v>

728
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never actually had deer.</v>

729
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.200
<v Speaker 5>I've never had any of that craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've never now I sending you're </v>

730
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:08.870
<v Speaker 5>vegetarian or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

731
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.860
<v Speaker 5>How long have you been a vegetarian?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Since 2009.</v>

732
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.990
<v Speaker 5>But occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it a um,</v>

733
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 5>health choice or is it a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

734
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.620
<v Speaker 5>I think it's just generally encourages </v>
<v Speaker 5>me to be more conscious of what I'm </v>

735
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 5>eating because otherwise I'm more </v>
<v Speaker 5>inclined to eat,</v>

736
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.320
<v Speaker 5>just gross fast food and things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

737
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:33.970
<v Speaker 5>And I think my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's improved enormously since I became </v>

738
00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:33.970
<v Speaker 5>a vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

739
00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:36.910
<v Speaker 5>The more plant matter you can get in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like you just feel better,</v>

740
00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.950
<v Speaker 5>feel healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But goddamn need is delicious.</v>

741
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 5>I eat what ash occasionally do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No red meat or anything along those </v>

742
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.360
<v Speaker 5>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have my theory that the,</v>

743
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:48.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>said it before,</v>

744
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.680
<v Speaker 5>that the stuff that's the quickest is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the best for you.</v>

745
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Like deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deer is really good for you because </v>

746
00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.351
<v Speaker 5>they're hard to get those motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 5>they run because they got like really </v>

747
00:34:59.351 --> 00:35:01.570
<v Speaker 5>good meat cows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty good mate.</v>

748
00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:06.660
<v Speaker 5>What's tastes like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know because it has to be the </v>

749
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:06.660
<v Speaker 5>best.</v>

750
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.500
<v Speaker 5>Get a Cheetah Burger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Damn.</v>

751
00:35:09.501 --> 00:35:10.460
<v Speaker 5>People will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

752
00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:12.230
<v Speaker 5>don't eat a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

753
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.120
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet you,</v>

754
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:19.150
<v Speaker 5>but nobody wants you to eat a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't go hunting tigers and eat the </v>

755
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.450
<v Speaker 5>tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tiger meat was fucking delicious.</v>

756
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:25.630
<v Speaker 5>People will like you dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile that tiger would hunt you </v>

757
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:29.550
<v Speaker 5>dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying tiger should be extinct.</v>

758
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:33.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying if I lived in India I would </v>
<v Speaker 5>think tiger should be extinct.</v>

759
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.990
<v Speaker 5>Not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but definitely if I lived in the.</v>

760
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.160
<v Speaker 5>I say they've canceled alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about big ones?</v>

761
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:41.830
<v Speaker 5>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

762
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Speaker 5>Leave him alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucked up bro.</v>

763
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.160
<v Speaker 5>You ever see a real one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just have like a cat thing that you </v>

764
00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:49.440
<v Speaker 5>would have to do at tiger about to </v>
<v Speaker 5>attack.</v>

765
00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:54.441
<v Speaker 5>You just throw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a piece of paper the other </v>

766
00:35:54.441 --> 00:35:54.441
<v Speaker 5>direction and run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

767
00:35:54.441 --> 00:35:54.441
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That will work.</v>

768
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.320
<v Speaker 5>It probably does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's probably like,</v>

769
00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 5>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in their instinct that they will do </v>

770
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

771
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:01.800
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if there's like any people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>has ever tried that.</v>

772
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:06.910
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't even believe you're asking that </v>

773
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.910
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be DNA stuff.</v>

774
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.460
<v Speaker 5>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to high before the show,</v>

775
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.350
<v Speaker 5>just a red ball when clients come in and</v>
<v Speaker 5>see what happened at Hamilton Morris.</v>

776
00:36:13.351 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 5>This is a ridiculous show I brought you </v>
<v Speaker 5>onto.</v>

777
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.020
<v Speaker 5>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then again,</v>

778
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:21.070
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fun.</v>

779
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

780
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.620
<v Speaker 5>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've been doing this a vice.com</v>

781
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:31.730
<v Speaker 5>thing for how long now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Since about 2000.</v>

782
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.910
<v Speaker 5>Seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two thousand eight.</v>

783
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.200
<v Speaker 5>Is that full time your thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

784
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:40.280
<v Speaker 5>I worked for other magazines as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like writing stuff,</v>

785
00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.520
<v Speaker 5>writing for Harper's as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But vice is the main.</v>

786
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.180
<v Speaker 5>What was it like when you sat down with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that a shogun character?</v>

787
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 5>What is that guy's name?</v>

788
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.670
<v Speaker 5>Alexander Shogun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

789
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:58.200
<v Speaker 5>And he's like some crazy super chemist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's really brilliant.</v>

790
00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:58.730
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

791
00:36:58.731 --> 00:37:02.880
<v Speaker 5>That was an amazing interview and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was really different,</v>

792
00:37:02.881 --> 00:37:04.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people kept writing me saying,</v>

793
00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:05.220
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're so lucky.</v>

794
00:37:05.221 --> 00:37:10.221
<v Speaker 5>You're so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was incredibly difficult to get </v>

795
00:37:10.221 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 5>that interview with them and it took.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it wasn't like a luck thing.</v>

796
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:12.180
<v Speaker 5>Like I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

797
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:13.920
<v Speaker 5>we found a Kooky guy for you to </v>
<v Speaker 5>interview.</v>

798
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.390
<v Speaker 5>Go visit him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to,</v>

799
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 5>had actually been to his house a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>times beforehand and I had to be vetted </v>

800
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.970
<v Speaker 5>by his family and all of these things </v>
<v Speaker 5>because a lot of people don't understand</v>

801
00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:27.930
<v Speaker 5>what he does and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's harassed by people.</v>

802
00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:32.931
<v Speaker 5>There's this ridiculous idea that </v>
<v Speaker 5>inventors are somehow responsible for </v>

803
00:37:32.931 --> 00:37:36.570
<v Speaker 5>what is done with their creations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So people think that if somebody dies of</v>

804
00:37:36.571 --> 00:37:37.740
<v Speaker 5>an MDM,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a overdose,</v>

805
00:37:37.741 --> 00:37:41.460
<v Speaker 5>that he is somehow responsible for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is of course totally ridiculous.</v>

806
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.100
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know that mentality.</v>

807
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:49.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is that mentality which is pretty </v>

808
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.561
<v Speaker 5>silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The legalization of any of this stuff </v>

809
00:37:51.561 --> 00:37:54.441
<v Speaker 5>would require people to go over dosages </v>
<v Speaker 5>and be scientific about it.</v>

810
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:55.010
<v Speaker 5>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

811
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 5>if any of this stuff was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was legal.</v>

812
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:01.140
<v Speaker 5>If you could just be prescribed for </v>
<v Speaker 5>being prescribed,</v>

813
00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 5>if you could have a doctor that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

814
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:03.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're pretty sane.</v>

815
00:38:03.631 --> 00:38:07.200
<v Speaker 5>I think you could handle ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he prescribes you a little ecstasy.</v>

816
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.780
<v Speaker 5>Go have a party this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

817
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:15.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think using it as an adjunct to </v>

818
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 5>psychotherapy is not that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

819
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:21.310
<v Speaker 5>you think so you really think they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>gonna accept that there are certainly </v>

820
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:21.630
<v Speaker 5>trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The organization maps,</v>

821
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.410
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty much what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

822
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:28.430
<v Speaker 5>I'd read that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've made great strides with people </v>

823
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.430
<v Speaker 5>as well with posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 5>disorder,</v>

824
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:33.410
<v Speaker 5>which is not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think a lot of this stuff that </v>

825
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.410
<v Speaker 5>maps does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just proving these things that most</v>

826
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:37.431
<v Speaker 5>people understand intuitively,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it has to be demonstrated in a </v>

827
00:38:37.431 --> 00:38:39.840
<v Speaker 5>rigorous scientific fashion before and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the regulatory authorities will accept.</v>

828
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 6>That would really help a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No doubt about it.</v>

829
00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:48.670
<v Speaker 6>They would restructure society if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if people would allow.</v>

830
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:53.080
<v Speaker 6>We're allowed free use of psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everyone looks at it as such a frivolous</v>

831
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 6>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like so silly,</v>

832
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like why,</v>

833
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 6>why,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why and concentrate on such things.</v>

834
00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 6>What a tiny do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Trying to get high.</v>

835
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.680
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you talk to most people about </v>

836
00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.001
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you feel like you're stuck in the 19 </v>

837
00:39:06.001 --> 00:39:07.741
<v Speaker 6>fifties movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you trying to do with your </v>

838
00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:07.741
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kid?</v>

839
00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:07.741
<v Speaker 6>What do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mess with those mushrooms.</v>

840
00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:10.090
<v Speaker 6>Put that stuff down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get yourself square,</v>

841
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 6>get on the straight and narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the mushrooms down boy,</v>

842
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 6>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

843
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 6>doesn't that seem like that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a.</v>

844
00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 6>it's not a subject that's easy to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>approached.</v>

845
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:26.611
<v Speaker 6>Seriously with adults.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's not a lot of them that will </v>

846
00:39:26.611 --> 00:39:27.310
<v Speaker 6>engage you in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In the regular world.</v>

847
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:32.550
<v Speaker 6>You want to talk seriously about </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics and seriously about </v>

848
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.930
<v Speaker 6>positive effects of them and mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 6>and know who wants to talk</v>

849
00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.200
<v Speaker 5>to you about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

850
00:39:36.201 --> 00:39:39.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean now most of it has to be shrouded</v>
<v Speaker 5>in scientific research.</v>

851
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.670
<v Speaker 5>What if you were working for an </v>
<v Speaker 5>insurance</v>

852
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.250
<v Speaker 6>and you were like one of their top sales</v>
<v Speaker 6>guys,</v>

853
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:47.130
<v Speaker 6>but you're running around the office </v>
<v Speaker 6>telling everybody that got to do acid.</v>

854
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:48.500
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

855
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.990
<v Speaker 5>I guess I don't even really know what </v>
<v Speaker 5>public perceptions.</v>

856
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean I have an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's so hard for me to go into like </v>

857
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.701
<v Speaker 5>to really understand what it would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like in middle America or something if </v>

858
00:40:01.701 --> 00:40:01.830
<v Speaker 5>you worked at an insurance office.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

859
00:40:01.831 --> 00:40:04.980
<v Speaker 5>I think it's different now everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the Internet.</v>

860
00:40:04.981 --> 00:40:09.981
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there is necessarily a </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle America that's the same middle </v>

861
00:40:09.981 --> 00:40:10.210
<v Speaker 5>America there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

862
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:14.400
<v Speaker 5>there were some innocent parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country or countries where things were a</v>

863
00:40:14.401 --> 00:40:15.900
<v Speaker 5>little quieter or slower.</v>

864
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.390
<v Speaker 6>But I think because the access to </v>
<v Speaker 6>information that people have today,</v>

865
00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:23.010
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kids can learn a lot of shit online.</v>

866
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.320
<v Speaker 6>Even if their environments socks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can develop and be engulfed and </v>

867
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.160
<v Speaker 6>whole communities online and they can </v>
<v Speaker 6>evolve so much quicker.</v>

868
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:37.550
<v Speaker 6>So this is like groups of people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>evolved like in small towns now that </v>

869
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:41.361
<v Speaker 6>would have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they wouldn't have existed to three </v>

870
00:40:41.361 --> 00:40:41.361
<v Speaker 6>decades before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

871
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:47.210
<v Speaker 6>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's one of the big differences </v>

872
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:51.351
<v Speaker 6>between now and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I try to think about what it must have </v>

873
00:40:51.351 --> 00:40:53.460
<v Speaker 6>been like to be my parents to grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

874
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.150
<v Speaker 6>the Internet doesn't come along until </v>
<v Speaker 6>you like</v>

875
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:58.450
<v Speaker 5>way too old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>barely getting into it.</v>

876
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:03.690
<v Speaker 5>You just go on CNN.com</v>
<v Speaker 5>and check things and whether the big </v>

877
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:07.411
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember going to the library all the </v>

878
00:41:07.411 --> 00:41:07.411
<v Speaker 5>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that was like the cool thing to do.</v>

879
00:41:07.411 --> 00:41:09.040
<v Speaker 5>Random movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go get a book.</v>

880
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.710
<v Speaker 5>Libraries must be fucking hurting right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

881
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:18.960
<v Speaker 5>They're not doing as well as they've </v>
<v Speaker 5>been doing before and why libraries are </v>

882
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.300
<v Speaker 5>doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so really?</v>

883
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:27.590
<v Speaker 5>I would just think that it's easier to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get information without going to the </v>

884
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:27.590
<v Speaker 5>library and now my mom doesn't even go </v>
<v Speaker 5>to a library morning.</v>

885
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:30.040
<v Speaker 5>She would go like multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people have access to a computer.</v>

886
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:35.270
<v Speaker 5>Then there's all these subscription </v>
<v Speaker 5>services that are too expensive for </v>

887
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.270
<v Speaker 5>people</v>

888
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.980
<v Speaker 4>that are individuals to use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like if you want to use factiva </v>

889
00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.270
<v Speaker 4>or scifinder or lexus nexus or any of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these databases,</v>

890
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:46.330
<v Speaker 4>scientific databases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to go to a library or awakened </v>

891
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:46.330
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

892
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:46.330
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

893
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:47.210
<v Speaker 4>So if they're always going to exist in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some form,</v>

894
00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 4>it would be too expensive.</v>

895
00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:52.980
<v Speaker 5>There's reading books is a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience than reading a kindle.</v>

896
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why I'm mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why.</v>

897
00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.900
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of better.</v>

898
00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:01.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why I like turning pages,</v>

899
00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.910
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why.</v>

900
00:42:02.911 --> 00:42:05.040
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I've actually thought it </v>
<v Speaker 5>with me.</v>

901
00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.590
<v Speaker 5>I think it's softer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think once the technology gets up,</v>

902
00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:12.591
<v Speaker 5>which is already here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but went to get the technology because </v>

903
00:42:12.591 --> 00:42:15.240
<v Speaker 5>we can kind of feel like a cottony feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>or I use a kindle,</v>

904
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.740
<v Speaker 5>I use a kindle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

905
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean I do have one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I had to choose between that,</v>

906
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:22.890
<v Speaker 5>like if I had the book and it was on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>kindle,</v>

907
00:42:22.891 --> 00:42:27.891
<v Speaker 5>I would take the book with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you smell your books before you read </v>

908
00:42:27.891 --> 00:42:27.891
<v Speaker 5>them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

909
00:42:27.891 --> 00:42:29.680
<v Speaker 5>You'd never seen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never smell your book before.</v>

910
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever smell your book?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no books before.</v>

911
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:38.360
<v Speaker 5>I like that little muskie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't say I've never smelled like </v>

912
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.590
<v Speaker 5>smell when I'm reading.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have.</v>

913
00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:46.010
<v Speaker 5>It's cool until kindle has that ability </v>
<v Speaker 5>to like holding your hand in it.</v>

914
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.930
<v Speaker 5>It's its own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that book was great and it smells a</v>

915
00:42:48.931 --> 00:42:53.931
<v Speaker 5>little weird until it has that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>real feeling to it because right now </v>

916
00:42:53.931 --> 00:42:54.090
<v Speaker 5>it's just like you're looking at a piece</v>
<v Speaker 5>of glass,</v>

917
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:55.710
<v Speaker 5>like a words on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a screen.</v>

918
00:42:55.711 --> 00:42:57.420
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's you disconnect from that.</v>

919
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.740
<v Speaker 5>The last used book that I bought was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sacred mushroom and the cross is the</v>

920
00:43:01.741 --> 00:43:06.741
<v Speaker 5>only way to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You was used until young Ervin just </v>

921
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:07.930
<v Speaker 5>rereleased it and data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you.</v>

922
00:43:07.931 --> 00:43:09.520
<v Speaker 5>You've read that right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

923
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:14.800
<v Speaker 4>familiar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read part of it and read it cover </v>

924
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.871
<v Speaker 4>to cover and I've read part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>second book as well was at the end of </v>

925
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:18.680
<v Speaker 4>the road or something like that.</v>

926
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:23.890
<v Speaker 5>It was a sacred mushroom in the cross </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there was the other one was </v>

927
00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:23.890
<v Speaker 5>goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Turn back time.</v>

928
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:28.110
<v Speaker 5>Something in the Sea Scrolls and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christian myth.</v>

929
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:29.020
<v Speaker 5>Something along road.</v>

930
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

931
00:43:29.651 --> 00:43:32.120
<v Speaker 4>I do home care before a sacred mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the cross.</v>

932
00:43:32.121 --> 00:43:33.140
<v Speaker 4>Is it just A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

933
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.520
<v Speaker 4>it's Bible scholar.</v>

934
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>

935
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.030
<v Speaker 5>that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he,</v>

936
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:40.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was the only one who believed that it</v>

937
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 5>was all about mushrooms that the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Christian religion,</v>

938
00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:48.320
<v Speaker 5>like a big part of it was about </v>
<v Speaker 5>fertility.</v>

939
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:50.180
<v Speaker 5>Rituals and mushrooms.</v>

940
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even that you,</v>

941
00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:52.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you're familiar with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>

942
00:43:52.741 --> 00:43:56.750
<v Speaker 4>shroom by Andy Lead her or letting her </v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

943
00:43:56.751 --> 00:43:57.230
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

944
00:43:57.231 --> 00:43:58.560
<v Speaker 4>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should definitely check it out.</v>

945
00:43:58.561 --> 00:44:02.130
<v Speaker 4>It's really a pretty impressive piece of</v>
<v Speaker 4>research,</v>

946
00:44:02.131 --> 00:44:07.131
<v Speaker 4>but he in the book and then he goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>through all of these different mushroom </v>

947
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:10.341
<v Speaker 4>myths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he talks about a sacred mushroom in </v>

948
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:10.580
<v Speaker 4>the cross and claims it allegro never </v>
<v Speaker 4>even believed that,</v>

949
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:15.610
<v Speaker 4>that that he was just so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hated Christianity so much at that </v>

950
00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:19.311
<v Speaker 4>point in his career that he just was </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for some way to disprove it or </v>

951
00:44:19.311 --> 00:44:21.690
<v Speaker 4>dismiss it or make it look ridiculous in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the public eye.</v>

952
00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:23.830
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>

953
00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:26.020
<v Speaker 5>If that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

954
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 5>Damn for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of me doesn't want it to be true </v>

955
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 5>because it's such a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really.</v>

956
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 5>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look dude,</v>

957
00:44:32.341 --> 00:44:36.150
<v Speaker 5>the Bible was about Dude's tripping on </v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms and I really wish it could say</v>

958
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:38.790
<v Speaker 5>that and that's what Rick Strassman is </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to do now with,</v>

959
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.820
<v Speaker 5>at least with the Old Testament in dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're really.</v>

960
00:44:41.821 --> 00:44:45.600
<v Speaker 5>What is he saying in psalms speak </v>
<v Speaker 5>relatively recently,</v>

961
00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 5>and he said that he has a new career </v>
<v Speaker 5>goal,</v>

962
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:53.241
<v Speaker 5>is to go through all of the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>testament looking for instances of </v>

963
00:44:53.241 --> 00:44:56.870
<v Speaker 5>altered states of consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 5>might be indicative of some kind of a </v>

964
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:58.530
<v Speaker 5>dmt type experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

965
00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.950
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

966
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.510
<v Speaker 5>There were some recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was some guy.</v>

967
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:08.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm a scholar from Jerusalem that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>proposing that about Moses and he was a.</v>

968
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 5>The Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his encounter with the burning Bush </v>

969
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.450
<v Speaker 5>might've been some reference to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Acacia Bush,</v>

970
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.300
<v Speaker 5>which is very high dmt content.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

971
00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:21.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

972
00:45:21.681 --> 00:45:23.400
<v Speaker 5>that's how he saw God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

973
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 5>I've already got a legit scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget the gentleman's name,</v>

974
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:32.300
<v Speaker 5>but he was a legit scholar who is </v>
<v Speaker 5>bringing up this connection to possibly </v>

975
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:36.510
<v Speaker 5>know psychedelic experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I've also heard a theory that </v>

976
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.860
<v Speaker 5>the ark of the covenant was a Meth Lab.</v>

977
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.670
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a fucking great quote.</v>

978
00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 5>That's a kind of quote you here and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

979
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:47.790
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I wrote that.</v>

980
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:53.470
<v Speaker 5>Your architect covenants a meth lab.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever hear those people that </v>

981
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.411
<v Speaker 5>believe the Ark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Ark of the covenant actually exists </v>

982
00:45:57.411 --> 00:45:57.411
<v Speaker 5>and it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

983
00:45:57.411 --> 00:45:58.470
<v Speaker 5>what part of Africa is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

984
00:45:58.471 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 5>I only know about it through Indiana </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jones.</v>

985
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.190
<v Speaker 5>I've seen the photo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That template.</v>

986
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ethiopia,</v>

987
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.030
<v Speaker 5>Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

988
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.950
<v Speaker 5>Graham Hancock was one of the guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

989
00:46:08.951 --> 00:46:12.140
<v Speaker 5>that's what got him interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

990
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.160
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

991
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.300
<v Speaker 5>alternative views of history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Zeros,</v>

992
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:20.301
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they have this area that's guarded </v>

993
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:21.050
<v Speaker 5>and these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

994
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.900
<v Speaker 5>these monks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's guard that they have like a 20 year</v>

995
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.110
<v Speaker 5>lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So powerful.</v>

996
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.500
<v Speaker 5>It's so sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really.</v>

997
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.570
<v Speaker 5>Shit was true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

998
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:33.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

999
00:46:33.721 --> 00:46:38.721
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to anybody to disprove </v>

1000
00:46:38.721 --> 00:46:38.721
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1001
00:46:38.721 --> 00:46:39.990
<v Speaker 5>I think it's been investigated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the discovery channel or someone</v>

1002
00:46:39.991 --> 00:46:41.130
<v Speaker 5>did a special.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really haven't.</v>

1003
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:46.131
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to do it thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What Hancock had said was that no one </v>

1004
00:46:46.131 --> 00:46:47.520
<v Speaker 5>was ever allowed to get anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even close.</v>

1005
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.170
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's politics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what he said.</v>

1006
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:51.900
<v Speaker 5>But here's the map of it on Indiana </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jones to,</v>

1007
00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.730
<v Speaker 5>during one of the cutaway scenes where </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like that,</v>

1008
00:46:53.731 --> 00:46:55.800
<v Speaker 5>that plane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a dotted line,</v>

1009
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.980
<v Speaker 5>just find it through there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it works that way.</v>

1010
00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:02.520
<v Speaker 5>Could you just completely interrupted my</v>
<v Speaker 5>train of thought?</v>

1011
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:04.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where I'm going now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

1012
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:07.050
<v Speaker 5>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you ever heard of [inaudible] Lane?</v>

1013
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:12.140
<v Speaker 5>What is he?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's that America's oldest brewery </v>

1014
00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.460
<v Speaker 5>and it's in Pennsylvania and it's used </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be this beer that living in Ohio.</v>

1015
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:19.200
<v Speaker 5>People I know would go to and stock up </v>
<v Speaker 5>with truck folds just so they could have</v>

1016
00:47:19.201 --> 00:47:20.680
<v Speaker 5>it for like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1017
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.870
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's,</v>

1018
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:22.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really good.</v>

1019
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.500
<v Speaker 5>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's older than Budweiser.</v>

1020
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.380
<v Speaker 5>Budweiser came out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>supposedly stole their Eagle Logo.</v>

1021
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:29.560
<v Speaker 5>Is this a new sponsor?</v>

1022
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Worked in doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even buy it here in </v>

1023
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:37.111
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they stole the Eagle and Budweiser </v>

1024
00:47:37.111 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 1>stole the Eagle and used it in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>logo.</v>

1025
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And now you decided to come to Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1027
00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 1>like ipod style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they had to build a whole new thing</v>

1028
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:52.531
<v Speaker 1>on their factory just for Ohio now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had an everywhere you went </v>

1030
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else was drinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the craziest thing seeing in</v>

1031
00:47:57.281 --> 00:48:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Ohio when he went back home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was drinking this beer and </v>

1032
00:48:02.281 --> 00:48:02.410

<v Speaker 1>But everybody was drinking.</v>

1034
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:08.140
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad Ohio sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get excited about some shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and they band together to support some </v>

1036

<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beer Budweiser's hurting from it.</v>

1037
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:15.330

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1041
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.970
<v Speaker 1>you probably can't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Sam Adams.</v>

1042

<v Speaker 1>they have lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have.</v>

1046
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really good to work for them.</v>

1047
00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Place the oldest brewery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be the best.</v>

1048
00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:32.660
<v Speaker 1>They're going to fucking like the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1049
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's.</v>

1050
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I think he's broken into an impromptu </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial note.</v>

1051
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:39.130
<v Speaker 1>You'd like it trial if you ever get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

1052
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:44.240
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pennsylvania for finals is a impromptu </v>

1053
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.020
<v Speaker 5>commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only do I swear to God,</v>

1054
00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:47.870
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

1055
00:48:47.871 --> 00:48:50.550
<v Speaker 5>Don't play anything from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1056
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:53.870
<v Speaker 5>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How dare you never heard of it.</v>

1057
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I know either did I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beard.</v>

1058
00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.280
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the budweiser story was really </v>

1059
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:02.500
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought like how they took the logo or</v>

1060
00:49:02.501 --> 00:49:02.700
<v Speaker 1>the mascot.</v>

1061
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:03.400
<v Speaker 5>Eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

1062
00:49:03.401 --> 00:49:05.470
<v Speaker 5>Everybody wants an American Eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about goodyear tires?</v>

1063
00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 5>Will they have an American Eagle too?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was not an American Eagle in there </v>

1064
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.100
<v Speaker 5>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about the same as.</v>

1065
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.570
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty close.</v>

1066
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.110
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1067
00:49:17.111 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 5>there's a slight difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Budweiser is the led Zeppelin a beer.</v>

1068
00:49:19.691 --> 00:49:22.810
<v Speaker 5>So that's what you're trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they stole it from Budweiser,</v>

1069
00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:23.530
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1070
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.150
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've had it longest subtle who?</v>

1071
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:27.400
<v Speaker 5>There wasn't even a company when it came</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

1072
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.680
<v Speaker 5>Settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Son Hamilton.</v>

1073
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.590

<v Speaker 5>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1076
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:38.350
<v Speaker 5>strange ride.</v>

1077
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:41.800
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1078
00:49:41.801 --> 00:49:42.880
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1079
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing about isolation tanks?</v>

1080
00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:46.300
<v Speaker 5>What's your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1081
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.890
<v Speaker 5>your goal when you try and get out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>

1082
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to use one of the tanks myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to try specifically those tanks </v>

1083
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.740
<v Speaker 5>that you were talking about earlier that</v>
<v Speaker 5>have some kind of an auditory and visual</v>

1084
00:49:56.741 --> 00:49:57.970
<v Speaker 5>component.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.560
<v Speaker 5>He's got that all set up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1086
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.040
<v Speaker 5>He's got it set up where he's got videos</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

1087
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 5>Were they using the sound and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>playing like music and you could see the</v>

1088
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 5>waves in the water because the speakers </v>
<v Speaker 5>were actually like floating in the water</v>

1089
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:13.210
<v Speaker 5>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like set up right by your head.</v>

1090
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:18.600
<v Speaker 5>And the waves are like making the water </v>
<v Speaker 5>splash and jump and wiggle.</v>

1091
00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:20.500
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty fucking tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1092
00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:21.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:25.240
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty trippy thing that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be also affecting your body while you're</v>

1094
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:25.720
<v Speaker 5>in there.</v>

1095
00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.090
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to feel sound on your skin.</v>

1096
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>

1097
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:32.780
<v Speaker 5>You will get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1098
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 5>You're going to hear it in your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your ears and you're going to feel it</v>

1099
00:50:35.211 --> 00:50:40.211
<v Speaker 5>on your skin because it's like moving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's moving through the all the water </v>

1100
00:50:40.211 --> 00:50:43.901
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is rippling while </v>

1101
00:50:43.901 --> 00:50:43.901
<v Speaker 5>they're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really pretty one.</v>

1102
00:50:43.901 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 5>Wait until you hear it because your ears</v>
<v Speaker 5>are under the water.</v>

1103
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:49.130
<v Speaker 5>Here's the under the water and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>distorted by the water.</v>

1104
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could be on big notes as possible.</v>

1105
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:55.150
<v Speaker 5>Things like really splash around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1106
00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 5>what does that feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's to feel nutty.</v>

1107
00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:50:58.491 --> 00:51:00.470
<v Speaker 5>His idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scott crashes,</v>

1109
00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 5>idea is that he's going to develop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1110
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:09.580
<v Speaker 5>like how to tutorials for sports and for</v>
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of different things.</v>

1111
00:51:10.551 --> 00:51:12.380
<v Speaker 5>Music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>language.</v>

1112
00:51:12.381 --> 00:51:17.381
<v Speaker 5>They'll be able to teach people language</v>
<v Speaker 5>is much quicker and that in the sensory </v>

1113
00:51:17.381 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 5>deprivation environment with the lack of</v>
<v Speaker 5>external stimuli,</v>

1114
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 5>your brain will be more focused.</v>

1115
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 5>So it sounds like it does sound like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>lawnmower man.</v>

1116
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:26.240
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does.</v>

1117
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:30.380
<v Speaker 5>Does he do these nootropic injections </v>
<v Speaker 5>beforehand or something like that?</v>

1118
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:31.640
<v Speaker 5>That's what he should do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1119
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.280
<v Speaker 5>We've got to give them some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>nuclear shit.</v>

1120
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:39.110
<v Speaker 5>It's like an x men type situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:39.970
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1122
00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.190
<v Speaker 5>the idea behind it is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1123
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:47.230
<v Speaker 5>the idea that you can program the mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>better inside the sensory deprivation </v>

1124
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:51.881
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really makes a lot of sense and it </v>

1125
00:51:51.881 --> 00:51:52.550
<v Speaker 5>seems like it would work that way if you</v>
<v Speaker 5>really get someone really knew what they</v>

1126
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:56.480
<v Speaker 5>were doing to design some cool programs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1127
00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 5>we think that would be like the best way</v>
<v Speaker 5>to learn ever.</v>

1128
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:00.740
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you learned something </v>
<v Speaker 5>cool,</v>

1129
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.290
<v Speaker 5>but it'll be a would be distracting your</v>
<v Speaker 5>concentration and the campaign.</v>

1130
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.160
<v Speaker 5>That's what I would think if you got </v>
<v Speaker 5>comfortable with it.</v>

1131
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.490
<v Speaker 5>See the thing about the tank is once you</v>
<v Speaker 5>do it for a long time,</v>

1132
00:52:10.491 --> 00:52:13.160
<v Speaker 5>you know you do it a couple times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like four or five times.</v>

1133
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:14.630
<v Speaker 5>Once you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once you do it,</v>

1134
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:19.660
<v Speaker 5>he know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can just settle right in and once </v>

1135
00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:20.030
<v Speaker 5>you settle right in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then stock it distracting at all.</v>

1136
00:52:20.031 --> 00:52:22.670
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be wild as fuck floating </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1137
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:27.850
<v Speaker 5>watching some just image appear right in</v>
<v Speaker 5>front of you because you can't really </v>

1138
00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:31.790
<v Speaker 5>see that the light is so dim that all </v>
<v Speaker 5>that comes through is the actual image.</v>

1139
00:52:31.791 --> 00:52:35.630
<v Speaker 5>You can't see the outline of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever been to one of those group</v>

1140
00:52:35.631 --> 00:52:40.631
<v Speaker 5>massages where there's a shitload of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in one room and then they're </v>

1141
00:52:40.631 --> 00:52:40.631
<v Speaker 5>playing like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a movie that's on loop,</v>

1142
00:52:40.631 --> 00:52:42.730
<v Speaker 5>like on the wall of like a house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1143
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.810
<v Speaker 5>in Asia somewhere like a bird's flying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1144
00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.000
<v Speaker 5>I find that annoying and distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it was pitch dark,</v>

1145
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.180
<v Speaker 5>I think I would be better for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's how like when you're </v>

1146
00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.330
<v Speaker 5>relaxing and one of these isolation </v>
<v Speaker 5>takes any kind of,</v>

1147
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sound or anything like that,</v>

1148
00:52:59.351 --> 00:53:00.500
<v Speaker 5>that seems like it'd be distracting.</v>

1149
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 5>You're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be.</v>

1150
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:07.780
<v Speaker 5>And I have never gotten into the video </v>
<v Speaker 5>or audio thing that's scarred crashes </v>

1151
00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:14.231
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to go in and just chill on my </v>

1152
00:53:14.231 --> 00:53:14.231
<v Speaker 5>own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think it's fascinating.</v>

1153
00:53:14.231 --> 00:53:16.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm not opposed to trying it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds really nuts.</v>

1154
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:21.350
<v Speaker 5>And if he could ever figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>really hook it up and do it right,</v>

1155
00:53:21.351 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean what a great way to like learn a </v>
<v Speaker 5>language or something.</v>

1156
00:53:23.361 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 5>And what a great way to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1157
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:29.770
<v Speaker 5>could you imagine if you took,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you found out that you could </v>

1158
00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:31.290
<v Speaker 5>develop a course specifically for use </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside the isolation tank,</v>

1159
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:36.291
<v Speaker 5>like the optimum way to learn things and</v>
<v Speaker 5>memorize things and put them to use and </v>

1160
00:53:36.291 --> 00:53:38.850
<v Speaker 5>you show that you could make people </v>
<v Speaker 5>learn Spanish 10 times quicker,</v>

1161
00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:42.990
<v Speaker 5>something fucking nutty like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you wolves on loop at night,</v>

1162
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 5>like walking slowly just to go against </v>
<v Speaker 5>your fears and stuff like that.</v>

1163
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:55.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you could really get it to the point </v>

1164
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 5>where it becomes a Hologram,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be the ultimate entertainment</v>

1165
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

1166
00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:02.810
<v Speaker 5>You're living in a hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get in the isolation tank and they </v>

1167
00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:03.530
<v Speaker 5>put whatever Hologram you want on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's do the Amazon jungle.</v>

1169
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:08.250
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be wild.</v>

1170
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:10.820
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't be wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you get to watch like a movie.</v>

1171
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.010
<v Speaker 5>Get to watch a life take place in front </v>
<v Speaker 5>of you,</v>

1172
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:17.180
<v Speaker 5>sister,</v>
<v Speaker 5>act to someone to about you.</v>

1173
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.780
<v Speaker 5>Don't even paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what reality is going to be.</v>

1174
00:54:21.781 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 5>Eventually it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1175
00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:27.310
<v Speaker 5>opera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you're going to have options to</v>

1176
00:54:27.311 --> 00:54:29.250
<v Speaker 5>be able to choose where you want to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>

1177
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:35.540
<v Speaker 5>Give me an eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got to get to a point where we can </v>

1178
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:35.540
<v Speaker 5>construct reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1179
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.840
<v Speaker 5>I know that they've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've devised artificial realities for</v>

1180
00:54:36.841 --> 00:54:38.640
<v Speaker 5>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They looked pretty fucking spiffy.</v>

1181
00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:40.470
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're watching a good video game,</v>

1182
00:54:40.471 --> 00:54:42.950
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what is it like metal of honor,</v>

1183
00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:44.820
<v Speaker 5>one of those games that were there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the name of it.</v>

1184
00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:48.270
<v Speaker 5>It's one of them called call of duty in </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy.</v>

1185
00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:53.330
<v Speaker 5>You watch those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those video games like that's the </v>

1186
00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:53.330
<v Speaker 5>graphics are fucking absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible out.</v>

1187
00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:56.640
<v Speaker 5>How long is it before they can project </v>
<v Speaker 5>that into your head?</v>

1188
00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:02.210
<v Speaker 5>How long is it before?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead of looking at that amazing </v>

1189
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:05.991
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone figures out how to projected </v>

1190
00:55:05.991 --> 00:55:06.840
<v Speaker 5>into your head that's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 5>and when that happens,</v>

1191
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:11.870
<v Speaker 5>that's going to be an alternate reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be able to program it </v>

1192
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:12.510
<v Speaker 5>alternate reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you,</v>

1193
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:17.570
<v Speaker 5>if your consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they can figure out a way to lock </v>

1194
00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:18.690
<v Speaker 5>your consciousness onto that alternate </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality,</v>

1195
00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like putting you in another </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1196
00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:23.700
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like putting you in another </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimension.</v>

1197
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that possible?</v>

1198
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:27.080
<v Speaker 5>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.150
<v Speaker 5>That seems like what's gonna Happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1200
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:31.980
<v Speaker 5>Primitive forms of it are already </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible and things like that.</v>

1201
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:37.060
<v Speaker 5>Those implants for blind people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>allow them to see what the camera and </v>

1202
00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:37.060
<v Speaker 5>the go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1203
00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.570
<v Speaker 5>I've heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Into their brain.</v>

1204
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:43.730
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can input visual stimuli instead </v>

1205
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:45.020
<v Speaker 5>still probably far away to everyone can </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it like xbox seven,</v>

1206
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.850
<v Speaker 5>$7,200.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1207
00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:51.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like how we look at like the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>cowboy style photographer dude who had </v>

1208
00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 5>to throw that thing over his head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>remember and he had the big torch on his</v>

1209
00:55:55.441 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 5>hand and it would go off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that?</v>

1210
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:02.811
<v Speaker 5>Like when like all the wild west movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy would like have to get under a </v>

1211
00:56:02.811 --> 00:56:04.590
<v Speaker 5>tarp and shit to take a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember all that?</v>

1212
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:07.640
<v Speaker 5>And think about what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was like,</v>

1213
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:09.810
<v Speaker 5>there was no fucking movies like shut </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

1214
00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:12.870
<v Speaker 5>They could barely get an image.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody at a stand still,</v>

1215
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had to like really wait,</v>

1216
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 5>like how long did it take to take that </v>
<v Speaker 5>picture?</v>

1217
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:17.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>took a little time,</v>

1218
00:56:17.731 --> 00:56:18.240
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1219
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't just move around and wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>like instant.</v>

1220
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Think about that was only 200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1221
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.580
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking incredible.</v>

1222
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.610
<v Speaker 5>That is 200 years ago and now we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>complaining.</v>

1223
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if all the shenanigans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

1224
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:37.950
<v Speaker 1>like having to sit there with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and then like one of the kids </v>

1225
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:40.531
<v Speaker 1>would fart and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was probably all these little </v>

1226
00:56:40.531 --> 00:56:41.920
<v Speaker 1>things that always happened during those</v>
<v Speaker 1>photos.</v>

1227
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:46.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still there was probably some humor </v>

1228
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:49.111
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was lost and that we went after to </v>

1229
00:56:49.111 --> 00:56:51.480
<v Speaker 1>that anymore to hold their face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1230
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I liked a lot of blurry pictures from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1231
00:56:53.711 --> 00:56:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually the kids.</v>

1232
00:56:55.211 --> 00:57:00.211
<v Speaker 1>That's why the kids are always the </v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria post photos is that his people </v>

1233
00:57:00.941 --> 00:57:03.760
<v Speaker 1>would walk in and out of the frame and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you made nothing.</v>

1234
00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Drives me crazier than fucking ghost TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

1235
00:57:06.911 --> 00:57:10.330
<v Speaker 1>When I watched those ghosts TV shows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just go,</v>

1236
00:57:10.331 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna find anything while you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking with me.</v>

1237
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Never find anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a bigger cock tease.</v>

1238
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Then the ghost reality genre and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>on like season three or something like </v>

1239
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.230
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1240
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1241
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 1>can you see this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>ECTOPLASMIC enters the room.</v>

1242
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:26.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like a speck on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like this.</v>

1243
00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.780
<v Speaker 1>This is where the ectoplasm enters the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

1244
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 1>This is where the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did you say?</v>

1245
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they have a fucking ghost ghost</v>

1246
00:57:36.251 --> 00:57:37.870
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fighting shit.</v>

1247
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking shows.</v>

1248
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:45.270
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people in a dark room </v>

1249
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.440
<v Speaker 1>watching something through night vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone goes,</v>

1250
00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:50.450
<v Speaker 1>what was that noise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they go to commercial and then </v>

1251
00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:51.940
<v Speaker 1>they come back and it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

1252
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:54.370
<v Speaker 1>My mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got back from Ohio.</v>

1253
00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:55.040
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my home,</v>

1254
00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:57.370
<v Speaker 1>my mom's house is supposedly haunted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1255
00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:02.420
<v Speaker 1>like my sister used to always talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then my mom is now talking about </v>

1256
00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:02.420
<v Speaker 1>it and my Stepdad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1257
00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.990
<v Speaker 1>he owned the architect firm and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart guy,</v>

1258
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:07.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge corporation this guy had.</v>

1259
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And then he retired and he's a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1260
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:14.880
<v Speaker 1>he's just a very intelligent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said he saw it the other day and </v>

1261
00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.010
<v Speaker 1>then so it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1262
00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid fucking gas leak or a mining leak</v>

00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:23.770
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that's giving you likely he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking your mom.</v>

1264
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what if you came to me.</v>

1265
00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if there was like a sour well near </v>

1266
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:33.530
<v Speaker 1>my mom's house farm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here man?</v>

1267
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:34.030

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1268
00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:36.830
<v Speaker 1>she's probably a little wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there must be something,</v>

1269
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:38.830
<v Speaker 1>some kind of feelings going along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Radon gone bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The might be man.</v>

1271
00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:46.620
<v Speaker 1>You know you grew up at a desktop radon </v>
<v Speaker 1>radon test in your basement.</v>

1272
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the shit that was on apple's.</v>

1273
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

1274
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 1>That was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that chemical.</v>

1275
00:58:54.101 --> 00:58:56.530
<v Speaker 1>They use the spray that fertilizer on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're talking about?</v>

1276
00:58:56.531 --> 00:58:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a something</v>

1277
00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:00.370
<v Speaker 5>that was on apples that were saying was </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous for it.</v>

1278
00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.380
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1279
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:04.030
<v Speaker 5>Fuck Shit.</v>

1280
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:10.200
<v Speaker 5>And I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what the fucking </v>

1281
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.971
<v Speaker 5>chemical was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure twitter will let me know on </v>

1283
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.760

<v Speaker 5>another.</v>

1284
00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all something you remember,</v>

1285
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:23.710
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know exactly what you're talking </v>

1286
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.710
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wherever</v>

1287
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:27.280
<v Speaker 1>my dad actually has a patent to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>radon out of your basement that he used </v>

1288
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.281
<v Speaker 1>to build these machines for rich guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like only you these so like maybe </v>

1289
00:59:30.281 --> 00:59:31.660
<v Speaker 1>50 of them is totally legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1290
00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.710
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is legit.</v>

1291
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely an element.</v>

1292
00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hidden in people's homes.</v>

1293
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Is it a health issue</v>

1294
00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.500
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really have to worry about.</v>

1295
00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:47.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1296
00:59:47.521 --> 00:59:50.730
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard of anyone I knew dying </v>
<v Speaker 4>of radon poisoning,</v>

1297
00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:54.150
<v Speaker 4>but how did they get brought up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>

1298
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.110
<v Speaker 4>How did it become an issue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess some people died somewhere.</v>

1299
00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Well at some point they must have and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>does exist.</v>

1300
01:00:01.261 --> 01:00:06.261
<v Speaker 4>It is a element that leaks out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth and news that you've radioactive </v>

1301
01:00:06.261 --> 01:00:06.261
<v Speaker 4>gas that's nasty.</v>

1302
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a natural part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1303
01:00:09.021 --> 01:00:14.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a result of nuclear testing or </v>

1304
01:00:14.021 --> 01:00:14.021
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally natural way.</v>

1305
01:00:14.021 --> 01:00:18.880
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that people died because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just some areas where it would </v>

1306
01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>just come through and heavy doses and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one anticipated it?</v>

1307
01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's heavier than oxygen,</v>

1308
01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:28.631
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly in sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>settles on in basements and your floors </v>

1309
01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>and people sleep impulse of it and just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can get radon poisoning,</v>

1310
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts in your respiratory system and</v>

1311
01:00:35.721 --> 01:00:39.110
<v Speaker 1>then you just start like wheezing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coughing a lot and shit like that.</v>

1312
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>It's actually pretty crazy that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>so popular,</v>

1313
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>but then it just died off like they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>still probably getting this.</v>

1314
01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they find something new?</v>

1315
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Like oh by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1316
01:00:48.231 --> 01:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm poisoning is actually just now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about outside.</v>

1317
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.040
<v Speaker 5>All it takes is like one death somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then all of a sudden everybody </v>

1319
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.901
<v Speaker 5>starts chasing after him and he could </v>
<v Speaker 5>have been one extreme example that was </v>

1320
01:01:03.901 --> 01:01:07.891
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very rare and then everybody started </v>

1321
01:01:07.891 --> 01:01:09.790
<v Speaker 5>chasing it and it's sensational stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have one good story about someone</v>

1322
01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:13.540
<v Speaker 5>dying from some invisible chemical or </v>
<v Speaker 5>even a drug or there you go.</v>

1323
01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:14.040
<v Speaker 5>He's going to drug</v>

1324
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I won Pennsylvania to highest lauren's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where their beer.</v>

1325
01:01:16.771 --> 01:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>So good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1326
01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.150
<v Speaker 5>He's men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you,</v>

1327
01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:24.180
<v Speaker 5>when you stop and think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many of the different things that </v>

1328
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.780
<v Speaker 5>you've talked about are not illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1329
01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.320
<v Speaker 5>different psychoactive substances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you were talking to a Shogun </v>

1330
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.821
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all the different things that he </v>

1331
01:01:35.821 --> 01:01:37.561
<v Speaker 5>was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the different tryptamines and how many </v>

1332
01:01:37.561 --> 01:01:37.561
<v Speaker 5>of them are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them are</v>

1333
01:01:37.561 --> 01:01:38.380
<v Speaker 4>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five mud,</v>

1334
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.530
<v Speaker 4>apt DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lot of them are maybe 11 or 12 of them,</v>

1335
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.360
<v Speaker 4>maybe more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably about a dozen.</v>

1336
01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Tryptamines are illegal schedule one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1337
01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:48.140
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1338
01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:53.141
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of them never had any real </v>

1339
01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:55.040
<v Speaker 4>popularity in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drugs like doe tea or something,</v>

1340
01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:58.670
<v Speaker 4>or tma two were never particularly </v>
<v Speaker 4>popular substances.</v>

1341
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine if something like five</v>
<v Speaker 5>Meo dmt killed as many people year </v>

1342
01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.380
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes does?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't that be amazing?</v>

1343
01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:10.350
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine how people would </v>
<v Speaker 5>react?</v>

1344
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:13.770
<v Speaker 5>What a crisis they would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got to get this off the streets.</v>

1345
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.170
<v Speaker 5>Did you imagine with me one on one </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes,</v>

1346
01:02:16.171 --> 01:02:16.950
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1347
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.990
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't have been.</v>

1348
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1349
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 6>whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoops.</v>

1350
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1351
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:25.800
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if nicotine would be legal if </v>
<v Speaker 6>it were a recently discovered substance.</v>

1352
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 6>Probably the nicotine is not as much of </v>
<v Speaker 6>an issue.</v>

1353
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.520
<v Speaker 6>I think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of is all the other shit </v>

1354
01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:34.520
<v Speaker 6>they put in them to make it even more </v>
<v Speaker 6>addictive.</v>

1355
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:38.860
<v Speaker 6>They say that if you smoke cigars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know people that smoke cigars,</v>

1356
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:40.230
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not inhaling it,</v>

1357
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:43.800
<v Speaker 6>but you're getting like a real pure type</v>
<v Speaker 6>of tobacco.</v>

1358
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:49.030
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have chemicals on it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be not nearly as bad for </v>

1359
01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:49.030
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not great for you.</v>

1360
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:54.080
<v Speaker 6>It's not the best thing for your sucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>on a crazy fucking plant that gives you </v>

1361
01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.760
<v Speaker 6>nicotine all day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what it is is a better,</v>

1362
01:02:56.761 --> 01:03:01.761
<v Speaker 6>healthier version of that tobacco and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the 599 different additives that </v>

1363
01:03:01.761 --> 01:03:06.501
<v Speaker 6>the food and drug administration allows </v>
<v Speaker 6>cigarette companies to pump in a </v>

1364
01:03:06.501 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes to just to make a mostly make</v>
<v Speaker 6>them more addictive.</v>

1365
01:03:07.591 --> 01:03:09.690
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Believe that movie with.</v>

1366
01:03:09.691 --> 01:03:11.190
<v Speaker 6>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's homeboy's name?</v>

1367
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 6>Fucking gladiator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude was so crowded,</v>

1368
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:19.131
<v Speaker 6>so grow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember that movie played a dude who </v>

1369
01:03:19.131 --> 01:03:20.010
<v Speaker 6>was like the scientist who knew too much</v>
<v Speaker 6>about cigarettes,</v>

1370
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.470
<v Speaker 6>used in a real story that was terrifying</v>
<v Speaker 6>if any of that stuff,</v>

1371
01:03:22.471 --> 01:03:24.210
<v Speaker 6>and I moved,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't even remember the movie,</v>

1372
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.520
<v Speaker 6>the movie's name or the actor's name,</v>

1373
01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.880
<v Speaker 4>but they don't even need to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean nicotine is incredibly addictive </v>

1374
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:31.880
<v Speaker 4>without any kind of mysterious </v>
<v Speaker 4>additives,</v>

1375
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.560
<v Speaker 4>but then there's also the Beta car </v>
<v Speaker 4>booleans in tobacco that may give it an </v>

1376
01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.930
<v Speaker 4>additional addictive component because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they may improve mood.</v>

1377
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.700
<v Speaker 6>When that movie he was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>

1378
01:03:42.701 --> 01:03:44.320
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how much that movie's </v>
<v Speaker 6>dramatically.</v>

1379
01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:45.730
<v Speaker 6>I think it's based on a real story </v>
<v Speaker 6>though,</v>

1380
01:03:45.731 --> 01:03:48.030
<v Speaker 6>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to him.</v>

1381
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:53.050
<v Speaker 6>I remember I remember it being based on </v>
<v Speaker 6>it or something like that.</v>

1382
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.800
<v Speaker 6>It was terrifying to think that a </v>
<v Speaker 6>company would be so evil that they would</v>

1383
01:03:56.801 --> 01:04:01.801
<v Speaker 6>go out of their way to try to use </v>
<v Speaker 6>chemists to make their shit more </v>

1384
01:04:01.801 --> 01:04:02.770
<v Speaker 6>addictive and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>

1385
01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.840
<v Speaker 6>Like that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a really nutty choice.</v>

1386
01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:10.020
<v Speaker 6>Five hundred and 99 is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you find out they have 599 </v>

1387
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.080
<v Speaker 6>different chemicals they add to </v>
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes.</v>

1388
01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:13.740
<v Speaker 4>We're at one of the editors don't really</v>
<v Speaker 4>even make sense.</v>

1389
01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:18.741
<v Speaker 4>I've looked through the list that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really stand wind eight shoes like what </v>

1390
01:04:18.741 --> 01:04:19.320
<v Speaker 4>dean or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1391
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:21.180
<v Speaker 4>purity and would be an example </v>
<v Speaker 4>disappeared.</v>

1392
01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:26.181
<v Speaker 4>Then it's an aromatic six membered ring </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the nitrogen in it that that is </v>

1393
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:33.410
<v Speaker 4>just smells really bad and you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that it would have any maybe to </v>

1394
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:34.950
<v Speaker 4>counterbalance just tons of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like all these different.</v>

1395
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.940
<v Speaker 4>Just bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all it does as far as I know.</v>

1396
01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.590
<v Speaker 4>And the quantities that they would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>using it.</v>

1397
01:04:40.591 --> 01:04:42.180
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe it's like a in a really,</v>

1398
01:04:42.181 --> 01:04:47.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the same way that like Indole and </v>

1399
01:04:47.181 --> 01:04:47.181
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1400
01:04:47.181 --> 01:04:47.181
<v Speaker 4>very small quantities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smells like jasmine,</v>

1401
01:04:47.181 --> 01:04:49.020
<v Speaker 4>but then in large quantity smells like </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1402
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.730
<v Speaker 4>So some of these things that smelled </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>

1403
01:04:50.731 --> 01:04:53.670
<v Speaker 4>it's probably used for smell to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to sell a cigarette.</v>

1404
01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.670
<v Speaker 4>Smoker doesn't smoke and they smell a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarette.</v>

1405
01:04:56.671 --> 01:04:58.350
<v Speaker 4>You want a cigarette?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bad.</v>

1406
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:00.720
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

1407
01:05:00.721 --> 01:05:03.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like having an apple pie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Apple Pie comes out of the oven and</v>

1408
01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.350
<v Speaker 4>you smell apple pie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1409
01:05:04.351 --> 01:05:05.310
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want that Apple Pie.</v>

1410
01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.650
<v Speaker 4>Same reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're probably making a smell,</v>

1411
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if they're making it so </v>

1412
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.261
<v Speaker 6>attractive to people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they'd probably making it more </v>

1413
01:05:14.261 --> 01:05:14.261
<v Speaker 6>attractive to the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>smoking it.</v>

1414
01:05:14.261 --> 01:05:15.590
<v Speaker 6>It's weird that it'd be a stinky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You say a stinky thing.</v>

1415
01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 6>It's probably a mixture of different of </v>
<v Speaker 6>stinky things that</v>

1416
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.890
<v Speaker 2>make the semester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were just smells and so who</v>

1417
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>the fuck knows know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1418
01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:25.540
<v Speaker 2>according to the Russell Crowe movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can't even remember the title.</v>

1419
01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like done some deep research on </v>

1420
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:32.710
<v Speaker 2>hooking people and deeper and deeper </v>
<v Speaker 2>with all these different 599 chemicals.</v>

1421
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.750
<v Speaker 2>It's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too many.</v>

1422
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.330
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very complicated.</v>

1423
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:42.390
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when you're looking at the </v>

1424
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.390
<v Speaker 2>interaction of two chemicals and once it</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes incredibly complicated,</v>

1425
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:43.810
<v Speaker 2>think they constructed that lead me </v>
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>

1426
01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 2>You understand that field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did they do that?</v>

1427
01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to look through the list of all</v>

1428
01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:49.300
<v Speaker 2>the additives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

1429
01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could just be,</v>

1430
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:55.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even things like any candy that any </v>

1431
01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.070
<v Speaker 2>child eats probably has an equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of different chemicals in it.</v>

1432
01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1433
01:05:58.181 --> 01:06:01.390
<v Speaker 2>people that the word chemical always </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds bad,</v>

1434
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:03.850
<v Speaker 2>but it was 599 chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a guarantee,</v>

1435
01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.190
<v Speaker 2>599 chemicals in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in everything,</v>

1436
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 2>in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it depends on how you want to phrase </v>

1437
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1438
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the majority of those chemicals</v>
<v Speaker 2>are benign,</v>

1439
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:16.260
<v Speaker 2>but maybe 11 of them do have some level </v>
<v Speaker 2>of function.</v>

1440
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:22.120
<v Speaker 2>The are based on some tobacco industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan to addict people,</v>

1441
01:06:22.121 --> 01:06:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but I really do think that nicotine in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of itself would be enough.</v>

1442
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I think those are the people that smoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>those natural cigarettes,</v>

1443
01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:35.251
<v Speaker 2>those like in what do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they experience less addiction?</v>

1444
01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1445
01:06:37.481 --> 01:06:39.760
<v Speaker 1>actually I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where he hit me harder.</v>

1446
01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Like I wake up spitting up like buckets </v>
<v Speaker 1>at boobs,</v>

1447
01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:47.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just like having roommates hooks </v>

1448
01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:47.970
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is it just a major film producer?</v>

1449
01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe some chemicals that cigarettes </v>

1450
01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:53.010
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it so that Burns easier.</v>

1451
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1452
01:06:53.981 --> 01:06:58.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what most people smoke I would say </v>

1453
01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:01.621
<v Speaker 1>is Marlboro lights or camera lights or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>light cigarette and it's more like </v>

1454
01:07:01.621 --> 01:07:02.110
<v Speaker 1>having a diet coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

1455
01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:07.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want a little taste of the </v>

1456
01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:07.111
<v Speaker 1>chemical and a little smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not.</v>

1457
01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:07.300
<v Speaker 1>But then you get these guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like smoking.</v>

1458
01:07:07.301 --> 01:07:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Marlboro reds were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a little cigars,</v>

1459
01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:10.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harsh.</v>

1460
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:10.660
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1461
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the wonderful whites </v>
<v Speaker 2>of West Virginia?</v>

1462
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've never seen it?</v>

1463
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:20.710
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy documentary that uh,</v>

1464
01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.720
<v Speaker 2>they did all these people that live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>West Virginia that have been notorious </v>

1465
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.631
<v Speaker 2>family of outlaws and wild people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a woman and her name was </v>

1466
01:07:30.941 --> 01:07:34.780
<v Speaker 2>sue Bob and I swear to God that was her </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice has always been a sex.</v>

1467
01:07:34.781 --> 01:07:38.320
<v Speaker 2>He wanted a family and just go and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just stop and think about that.</v>

1468
01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:43.060
<v Speaker 2>So lifted cigarettes do to her man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did cigarettes do to her?</v>

1469
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Nobody sounds like that when they were a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman without cigarettes.</v>

1470
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Like it's only cigarettes that they give</v>
<v Speaker 2>you that.</v>

1471
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe some crazy exotic disease,</v>

1472
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:55.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's what she sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1473
01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.530
<v Speaker 2>If you've never seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1474
01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:58.510
<v Speaker 2>if you just want something silly to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>

1475
01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:01.450
<v Speaker 2>it's so well made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful documentary.</v>

1476
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Knoxville's production company </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it together.</v>

1477
01:08:03.911 --> 01:08:06.490
<v Speaker 2>It's really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about this family.</v>

1478
01:08:06.491 --> 01:08:08.680
<v Speaker 2>They're just awesome characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1479
01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:13.890
<v Speaker 2>They just live in West Virginia and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell pills and they're just always </v>

1480
01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:14.650
<v Speaker 2>getting arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just wild,</v>

1481
01:08:14.651 --> 01:08:16.370
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy</v>

1482
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.600
<v Speaker 5>to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really,</v>

1483
01:08:17.601 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 5>really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But cigarettes.</v>

1484
01:08:20.961 --> 01:08:23.530
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that chick's voice up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did.</v>

1485
01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:25.660
<v Speaker 5>We didn't talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy that.</v>

1486
01:08:25.661 --> 01:08:26.810
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's his mic?</v>

1487
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:27.980
<v Speaker 5>Fannie Mae,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fannie,</v>

1488
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 5>whatever that guy's name is that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>running for president in the marijuana.</v>

1489
01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:35.790
<v Speaker 5>A Mitt Romney,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mitt Romney man.</v>

1490
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:37.630
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1491
01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:42.650
<v Speaker 5>That about him in the marijuana patient.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We remember we were going to talk about </v>

1492
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.650
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1493
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:43.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

1494
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.100
<v Speaker 5>I talked to you about it before we even </v>
<v Speaker 5>did the show.</v>

1495
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.800
<v Speaker 5>It was so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so sad to watch someone.</v>

1496
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.280
<v Speaker 5>It could be so callous about his ideas </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that when some,</v>

1497
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.170
<v Speaker 5>if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mitt Romney,</v>

1498
01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:55.970
<v Speaker 5>guys running for president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>

1499
01:08:55.971 --> 01:09:00.770
<v Speaker 5>very wealthy man standing in front of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this dude in a wheelchair.</v>

1500
01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:03.170
<v Speaker 5>Guys like 80 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1501
01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 5>I think he said he had muscular </v>
<v Speaker 5>dystrophy.</v>

1502
01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.660
<v Speaker 5>I apologize if I'm wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1503
01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:14.020
<v Speaker 5>he said to Mitt Romney that he needs </v>
<v Speaker 5>medical marijuana and that medical </v>

1504
01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:17.780
<v Speaker 5>marijuana is the only thing that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>helps him.</v>

1505
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 5>And Mitt Romney said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you tried the synthetic form?</v>

1506
01:09:21.561 --> 01:09:26.561
<v Speaker 5>And he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes me vomit and marijuana is the </v>

1507
01:09:26.561 --> 01:09:29.981
<v Speaker 5>only thing that helps me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you put me in jail if you became </v>

1508
01:09:29.981 --> 01:09:31.400
<v Speaker 5>president?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1509
01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 5>Let's play it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's see if it sounds good.</v>

1510
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.340
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's see if it sounds good.</v>

1511
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.930
<v Speaker 5>It's really depressed and old video that</v>
<v Speaker 5>just really just became popular.</v>

1512
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.830
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1513
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:41.230
<v Speaker 5>It's so good.</v>

1514
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:56.390
<v Speaker 7>I have all my life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my doctor saying that I want to that </v>

1515
01:09:57.570 --> 01:10:02.570
<v Speaker 7>medical marijuana for everyone and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>have synthetic marijuana that's </v>

1516
01:10:05.521 --> 01:10:09.810
<v Speaker 7>available and other that I have tried it</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it makes me throw up.</v>

1517
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:15.100
<v Speaker 7>I have tried all the makeup and all the </v>
<v Speaker 7>forms that come in after high </v>

1518
01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:15.620
<v Speaker 7>stimulator.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The steroids.</v>

1519
01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.050
<v Speaker 7>I have muscular dystrophy that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>completely against my DNA.</v>

1520
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:24.370
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My question for you is will you arrest </v>

1521
01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:28.071
<v Speaker 7>me and my doctor's medical marijuana?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not in favor of medical marijuana.</v>

1522
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:32.320
<v Speaker 7>How are you?</v>

1523
01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 8>She just turned away from the </v>
<v Speaker 8>politician.</v>

1524
01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:36.850
<v Speaker 8>Smile.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hi,</v>

1525
01:10:36.851 --> 01:10:41.851
<v Speaker 8>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 8>He asked if you were going to arrest </v>

1526
01:10:41.851 --> 01:10:41.851
<v Speaker 8>patients like him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Governor,</v>

1527
01:10:41.851 --> 01:10:43.720
<v Speaker 8>you're going to just ignore a person in </v>
<v Speaker 8>a wheelchair.</v>

1528
01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:47.080
<v Speaker 8>I spoke to them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he didn't answer his question.</v>

1529
01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.100
<v Speaker 8>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well this is good.</v>

1530
01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.640
<v Speaker 5>So disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what we're doing.</v>

1531
01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:56.820
<v Speaker 5>Hamilton Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you got a good voice and you </v>

1532
01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:56.820
<v Speaker 5>should run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1533
01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure you could pull this off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>

1534
01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:02.050
<v Speaker 5>All right to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's enthusiastic.</v>

1535
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:06.640
<v Speaker 5>Not Patronized.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's shocking though,</v>

1536
01:11:06.641 --> 01:11:11.641
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That a person like that could be like </v>

1537
01:11:11.641 --> 01:11:13.321
<v Speaker 5>even close,</v>
<v Speaker 5>remotely close to being able to run </v>

1538
01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 5>things the bit that you would be so</v>

1539
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.350
<v Speaker 6>cold hearted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just walk away from that dude like that.</v>

1540
01:11:16.351 --> 01:11:17.850
<v Speaker 6>That's like a serious issue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1541
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.670
<v Speaker 6>You got to address that issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy's telling you there's something</v>

1542
01:11:20.671 --> 01:11:22.980
<v Speaker 6>that helps him and he's obviously in </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrible,</v>

1543
01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.110
<v Speaker 6>terrible straights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The guys fucked up,</v>

1544
01:11:25.111 --> 01:11:26.880
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He can't move,</v>

1545
01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:29.690
<v Speaker 6>his body is in a God damn wheelchair and</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's telling you this.</v>

1546
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:33.040
<v Speaker 6>Something happened against this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>against his will.</v>

1547
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.880
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is something that he's saying helps</v>

1548
01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 6>them make them feel happy against his </v>
<v Speaker 6>pain,</v>

1549
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:40.800
<v Speaker 6>and he even said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not for legalizing it for anybody.</v>

1550
01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:42.540
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not for everybody,</v>

1551
01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:44.880
<v Speaker 6>but for people that you can use it for </v>
<v Speaker 6>medical purposes.</v>

1552
01:11:44.881 --> 01:11:49.881
<v Speaker 6>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's you just walk away from God like </v>

1553
01:11:49.881 --> 01:11:50.330
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1554
01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:56.580
<v Speaker 6>It's just disturbing that anybody would </v>
<v Speaker 6>be so flippant with the idea that it's,</v>

1555
01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.150
<v Speaker 6>it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so preposterous.</v>

1556
01:12:00.151 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 6>It's so gross to them for some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>reason.</v>

1557
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:08.720
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the idea of altering your </v>

1558
01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.671
<v Speaker 6>consciousness anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>other than the sanctioned ways that </v>

1559
01:12:10.671 --> 01:12:11.790
<v Speaker 6>we've prescribed to for the last several</v>
<v Speaker 6>decades,</v>

1560
01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:14.100
<v Speaker 6>anything that steps outside of that </v>
<v Speaker 6>becomes a danger.</v>

1561
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.660
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1562
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 6>why you told me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1563
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not a majority view.</v>

1564
01:12:22.831 --> 01:12:27.831
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it had to do with a few people </v>

1565
01:12:27.831 --> 01:12:27.831
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1566
01:12:27.831 --> 01:12:29.970
<v Speaker 4>when you think about it only takes a few</v>
<v Speaker 4>people to make these enormous changes in</v>

1567
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.360
<v Speaker 4>drug policy and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know all that much about the </v>

1568
01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.080
<v Speaker 4>history of marijuana specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like that one guy primarily.</v>

1569
01:12:37.081 --> 01:12:39.140
<v Speaker 4>And then with the psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same kind of deal.</v>

1570
01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 4>It takes one person to die at the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and you know,</v>

1571
01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:45.900
<v Speaker 4>one person dies after smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Salvia,</v>

1572
01:12:45.901 --> 01:12:46.940
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brett cit,</v>

1573
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.860
<v Speaker 4>esther,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it's illegal over 10 states.</v>

1574
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Dude died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke itself,</v>

1575
01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't even die.</v>

1576
01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:52.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1577
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:57.270
<v Speaker 4>there was a teenager named Brett cit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>esther who wrote in his diary,</v>

1578
01:12:57.271 --> 01:13:00.000
<v Speaker 4>I love Salvia it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1579
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:03.210
<v Speaker 4>but I also understand that life has no </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning now or something like that.</v>

1580
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:08.210
<v Speaker 4>And then a few days later he killed </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself and his mother looked in his </v>

1581
01:13:08.210 --> 01:13:08.210
<v Speaker 4>diary and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1582
01:13:08.210 --> 01:13:12.581
<v Speaker 4>it was the Salvia than even suicidal and</v>
<v Speaker 4>went on this crusade to have it band in </v>

1583
01:13:12.581 --> 01:13:17.391
<v Speaker 4>every state that she could and was </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful in something like a dozen </v>

1584
01:13:17.391 --> 01:13:18.340
<v Speaker 4>states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called Brett's law.</v>

1585
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's the way it always is.</v>

1586
01:13:21.331 --> 01:13:26.331
<v Speaker 4>It's always one person that there's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the that act based on the person that </v>

1587
01:13:26.331 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 4>bought morphine on the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>overdosed.</v>

1588
01:13:26.821 --> 01:13:31.821
<v Speaker 4>It just takes one promising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the mushrooms and the Netherlands </v>

1589
01:13:31.821 --> 01:13:34.680
<v Speaker 4>are now illegal because of care off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl that jumped off the bridge.</v>

1590
01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:39.820
<v Speaker 4>Just one promising person whose photo </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks good on the news dies.</v>

1591
01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:42.810
<v Speaker 4>And that's the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what did she do?</v>

1592
01:13:42.811 --> 01:13:44.720
<v Speaker 4>She got mushroomed up and jumped off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bridge.</v>

1593
01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.280
<v Speaker 4>It's unclear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was the,</v>

1594
01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:50.010
<v Speaker 4>the official idea that was written in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the news.</v>

1595
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:53.910
<v Speaker 4>But then when I was in Holland recently </v>
<v Speaker 4>working on this new project for VBS,</v>

1596
01:13:53.911 --> 01:13:56.760
<v Speaker 4>we were at this place called magic </v>
<v Speaker 4>truffles,</v>

1597
01:13:56.761 --> 01:14:00.420
<v Speaker 4>which is the largest mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or was largest mushroom farm in Holland.</v>

1598
01:14:00.421 --> 01:14:03.810
<v Speaker 4>They make metric tons of mushrooms in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this factory.</v>

1599
01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:09.020
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then mushrooms became illegal so </v>

1600
01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:09.020
<v Speaker 4>they converted their entire operation to</v>
<v Speaker 4>producing psychedelics.</v>

1601
01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Clarissa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they say the whole thing is a scam.</v>

1602
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:12.930
<v Speaker 4>They think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1603
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:16.330
<v Speaker 4>that she wasn't even on mushrooms at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire thing is based on a friend seeing</v>

1604
01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:21.331
<v Speaker 4>her with a box of mushrooms in her hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But on the day of the death and then </v>

1605
01:14:21.331 --> 01:14:26.041
<v Speaker 4>they put two and two together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided that she must have been on </v>

1606
01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:26.041
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which he died.</v>

1607
01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:27.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she could have just been depressed.</v>

1608
01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:32.251
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there are any toxicology </v>

1609
01:14:32.251 --> 01:14:33.520
<v Speaker 4>reports that confirmed she was under the</v>
<v Speaker 4>influence of any psilocybin at the time.</v>

1610
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.040
<v Speaker 6>I can get not wanting to give it to </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody.</v>

1611
01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.430
<v Speaker 6>I just think there should be places </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you can get at where someone could</v>

1612
01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.560
<v Speaker 6>walk you through it and you should be </v>
<v Speaker 6>able to make an educated choice.</v>

1613
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.800
<v Speaker 6>There's just so many people shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 6>denied the experience because I think </v>

1614
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.680
<v Speaker 6>the experience makes people more aware </v>
<v Speaker 6>and more sensitive and that.</v>

1615
01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:56.690
<v Speaker 6>I only think that that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the world can use a lot more </v>

1616
01:14:56.690 --> 01:14:58.800
<v Speaker 6>aware and more sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So why aren't there centers set up?</v>

1617
01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:02.070
<v Speaker 6>Why is it still illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's where it gets completely,</v>

1618
01:15:02.071 --> 01:15:04.520
<v Speaker 6>totally ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gets to the point where you're.</v>

1619
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:09.570
<v Speaker 6>You're keeping something that might be </v>
<v Speaker 6>beneficial to a lot of people because </v>

1620
01:15:09.841 --> 01:15:13.950
<v Speaker 6>some people might fuck it up because </v>
<v Speaker 6>some people might fuck with it.</v>

1621
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:15.000
<v Speaker 6>Do something crazy.</v>

1622
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:18.510
<v Speaker 4>It also has to do with fashion in </v>
<v Speaker 4>science and medicine,</v>

1623
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:23.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it became very unfashionable in the </v>

1624
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:23.670
<v Speaker 4>eighties to do psychedelic psychotherapy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1625
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.760
<v Speaker 4>and there were only a number even in </v>
<v Speaker 4>places like there certain parts of </v>

1626
01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.600
<v Speaker 4>Germany where any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any psychiatrists that wanted to could,</v>

1627
01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.840
<v Speaker 4>and they chose not to just because most </v>
<v Speaker 4>people weren't interested in it for </v>

1628
01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:39.351
<v Speaker 4>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought it had limited potential </v>

1629
01:15:39.351 --> 01:15:39.351
<v Speaker 4>and now I think the potential is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1630
01:15:39.351 --> 01:15:41.880
<v Speaker 4>there's the renewal evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychedelic research,</v>

1631
01:15:41.881 --> 01:15:46.881
<v Speaker 4>but in the eighties people didn't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was even people that were pro </v>

1632
01:15:46.881 --> 01:15:48.250
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just didn't have,</v>

1633
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:53.330
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them didn't necessarily think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was a viable road to producing </v>

1634
01:15:53.461 --> 01:15:58.110
<v Speaker 4>important neuroscientific research or in</v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of psychotherapeutic drugs.</v>

1635
01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:04.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I recall hearing a Mckenna interview </v>

1636
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:07.781
<v Speaker 6>where he was talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>about how scientists were often like </v>

1637
01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:09.980
<v Speaker 6>discouraged from going down those paths </v>
<v Speaker 6>because people would say like,</v>

1638
01:16:09.981 --> 01:16:14.981
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's not really nothing there for </v>

1639
01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:14.981
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

1640
01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:14.981
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1641
01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:14.981
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to.</v>

1642
01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:17.210
<v Speaker 4>It's difficult to quantify the benefits </v>
<v Speaker 4>of psychedelic drugs like a lot.</v>

1643
01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:22.211
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of anecdotal evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have lasting effects on people's </v>

1644
01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:25.571
<v Speaker 4>lives and that they have relief from </v>
<v Speaker 4>depression or alcoholism or things like </v>

1645
01:16:25.571 --> 01:16:27.230
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it comes down to really,</v>

1646
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:32.500
<v Speaker 4>really putting it down on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been difficult and an often it's </v>

1647
01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:37.821
<v Speaker 4>things like the Johns Hopkins study </v>
<v Speaker 4>where silicide been occasions long </v>

1648
01:16:37.821 --> 01:16:39.950
<v Speaker 4>lasting mystical experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That famous paper,</v>

1649
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.780
<v Speaker 4>a really recent one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1650
01:16:41.781 --> 01:16:43.220
<v Speaker 4>The reason why it's getting a huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of press,</v>

1651
01:16:43.221 --> 01:16:44.600
<v Speaker 4>but it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1652
01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.120
<v Speaker 4>because they said that it improved their</v>
<v Speaker 4>personalities.</v>

1653
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:52.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even that is kind of slippery when </v>

1654
01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:54.390
<v Speaker 4>it's a mystical experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these terms are slippery and if you,</v>

1655
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:59.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at a nootropic that was </v>

1656
01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.180
<v Speaker 4>very defined studies of how something </v>
<v Speaker 4>does it aid road into navigating amaze,</v>

1657
01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:06.670
<v Speaker 4>does it allow them to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it allow a human,</v>

1658
01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:08.990
<v Speaker 4>does it prevent the formation of certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>types?</v>

1659
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Disease or proteins in the brain are </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that that are indicative of </v>

1660
01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:19.691
<v Speaker 2>neurodegenerative diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't anything like that for </v>

1661
01:17:19.691 --> 01:17:23.501
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no single benefit that can be </v>

1662
01:17:23.501 --> 01:17:24.460
<v Speaker 2>quantified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1663
01:17:24.461 --> 01:17:27.420
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's one reason that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult for researchers is.</v>

1664
01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:32.780
<v Speaker 2>And then there's ways around it with now</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people try to emphasize the </v>

1665
01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:33.770
<v Speaker 2>positive effects that are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily psychoactive,</v>

1666
01:17:33.771 --> 01:17:38.771
<v Speaker 2>so maybe they have some kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>immunosuppressant effect that would be </v>

1667
01:17:38.771 --> 01:17:38.950
<v Speaker 2>useful for our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1668
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:44.050
<v Speaker 2>for arthritis or some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory disease or something like </v>

1669
01:17:44.241 --> 01:17:45.140
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the,</v>

1670
01:17:45.141 --> 01:17:48.140
<v Speaker 2>you said that because there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something I was reading just a couple of</v>

1671
01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:53.140
<v Speaker 2>days ago about people juicing cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't have any psychoactive </v>

1672
01:17:53.631 --> 01:17:58.631
<v Speaker 2>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of great health </v>

1673
01:17:58.631 --> 01:17:58.631
<v Speaker 2>benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1674
01:17:58.631 --> 01:18:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Using it in cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the non psychoactive Terpene,</v>

1675
01:18:00.921 --> 01:18:05.210
<v Speaker 2>one of thc and cbd are the two main </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals in.</v>

1676
01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 2>So would you juice it like a smoothie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like blended up?</v>

1677
01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about.</v>

1678
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:11.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about this specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique,</v>

1679
01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:15.950
<v Speaker 2>but cbd is not psychoactive and has all </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of a medicinal effects.</v>

1680
01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Like it's currently undergoing clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>trials as a treatment for schizophrenia.</v>

1681
01:18:19.671 --> 01:18:22.720
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in addition to the psychedelic effect,</v>

1682
01:18:22.721 --> 01:18:24.700
<v Speaker 2>there may be all kinds of things we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1683
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:28.610
<v Speaker 2>maybe neuro regenerative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe synaptic Magenic,</v>

1684
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe all sorts of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The marijuana one is the biggest trip </v>

1685
01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.720
<v Speaker 2>because it's got so many excellent </v>
<v Speaker 2>properties yet it's illegal.</v>

1686
01:18:35.721 --> 01:18:38.950
<v Speaker 2>It makes the best paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes the best clothes,</v>

1687
01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.730
<v Speaker 2>like the fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>

1688
01:18:40.731 --> 01:18:45.731
<v Speaker 2>You can make like wall board out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like four times stronger than </v>

1689
01:18:45.731 --> 01:18:49.421
<v Speaker 2>plywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a really incredible plan </v>

1690
01:18:49.421 --> 01:18:50.660
<v Speaker 2>because it's super strong like have you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever picked up a hemp stalk?</v>

1691
01:18:50.690 --> 01:18:51.860
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1692
01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:55.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like from another planet because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really fucking strong,</v>

1693
01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:55.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's light.</v>

1694
01:18:55.630 --> 01:19:00.630
<v Speaker 2>It's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you pick it up and it's like this </v>

1695
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:03.191
<v Speaker 2>is a weird kind of wood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it seems strange and it has so much </v>

1696
01:19:03.191 --> 01:19:08.081
<v Speaker 2>fucking potential as far as like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could like you can grow like a massive </v>

1697
01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:13.331
<v Speaker 2>forest full of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chop it all down and then have another </v>

1698
01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:16.350
<v Speaker 2>massive forest like six months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year later when it's renewable,</v>

1699
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:20.270
<v Speaker 2>you could do it over and over again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the health benefits,</v>

1700
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:22.100
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's from another planet.</v>

1701
01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.950
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about all the good things</v>

1702
01:19:24.951 --> 01:19:26.320
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great and it had.</v>

1703
01:19:26.321 --> 01:19:30.530
<v Speaker 2>The seeds are awesome source of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has all the essential amino acids.</v>

1704
01:19:30.531 --> 01:19:32.360
<v Speaker 2>It's actually good for you if you juice </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1705
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:33.500
<v Speaker 2>if you smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get high,</v>

1706
01:19:33.501 --> 01:19:38.501
<v Speaker 2>you feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it couldn't do any more for </v>

1707
01:19:38.501 --> 01:19:38.501
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>

1708
01:19:38.501 --> 01:19:40.190
<v Speaker 2>You can make paper out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to make clothes out of me dude,</v>

1709
01:19:40.191 --> 01:19:42.470
<v Speaker 2>you can eat my oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My oil is really good for you.</v>

1710
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:47.790
<v Speaker 2>It can power cars too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm renewable every six </v>

1711
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:51.101
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like it couldn't be any </v>

1712
01:19:51.101 --> 01:19:52.781
<v Speaker 2>nicer to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't be any more of a productive </v>

1713
01:19:52.781 --> 01:19:56.480
<v Speaker 2>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know as far as like society just uses as</v>

1714
01:19:57.370 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a quantity,</v>

1715
01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:02.360
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uses as a something that you could sell.</v>

1716
01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing with mushrooms </v>

1717
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.460
<v Speaker 2>as well and if so many benefits beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>just being</v>

1718
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:11.190
<v Speaker 4>vessels for carrying these psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>

1719
01:20:11.191 --> 01:20:16.191
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Paul stamets did a lot of </v>

1720
01:20:16.191 --> 01:20:18.320
<v Speaker 4>experiments with the Defense Department </v>
<v Speaker 4>using either a p scion essence or as </v>

1721
01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:21.260
<v Speaker 4>their essence and using them to d </v>
<v Speaker 4>phosphorolate,</v>

1722
01:20:21.261 --> 01:20:26.261
<v Speaker 4>seren to break breakdown nerve gases </v>
<v Speaker 4>because in the same way that all of </v>

1723
01:20:26.261 --> 01:20:30.861
<v Speaker 4>these enzymes in the mycelium that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to break down the cellular </v>

1724
01:20:31.291 --> 01:20:36.291
<v Speaker 4>components of the substrate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's wood or grass or some kind </v>

1725
01:20:36.291 --> 01:20:41.271
<v Speaker 4>of seed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's able to break it down and extract </v>

1726
01:20:41.271 --> 01:20:41.970
<v Speaker 4>all of these amino acids and then bios </v>
<v Speaker 4>synthesize chemicals out of it,</v>

1727
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:47.150
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it can also break down all other </v>

1728
01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:50.091
<v Speaker 4>kinds of substrates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's all this bio remediation </v>

1729
01:20:50.091 --> 01:20:53.091
<v Speaker 4>where they use mushrooms to clean up oil</v>
<v Speaker 4>spills because the mushroom mycelium is </v>

1730
01:20:53.091 --> 01:20:56.511
<v Speaker 4>able to break down the aromatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>hydrocarbons in the oil and to totally </v>

1731
01:20:56.511 --> 01:21:01.371
<v Speaker 4>detoxify.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can even eat the mushrooms </v>

1732
01:21:01.371 --> 01:21:01.371
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1733
01:21:01.371 --> 01:21:01.371
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd heard of it</v>

1734
01:21:01.371 --> 01:21:05.660
<v Speaker 6>about something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they use things like that in </v>

1735
01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:05.660
<v Speaker 6>Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that what they experienced?</v>

1736
01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:09.531
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where that was the before the Gulf </v>

1737
01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:09.531
<v Speaker 6>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was like the last big,</v>

1738
01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:09.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:21:09.911 --> 01:21:14.911
<v Speaker 4>They tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to do it in Japan as well </v>

1740
01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:17.131
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to clean up radioactive waste because </v>

1741
01:21:17.131 --> 01:21:18.721
<v Speaker 4>you realized the mushrooms to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bioaccumulate radioactive fallout and </v>

1742
01:21:18.721 --> 01:21:21.970
<v Speaker 4>then pick the mushrooms and slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>decontaminate and area.</v>

1743
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's an extremely slow way to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1744
01:21:23.741 --> 01:21:26.020
<v Speaker 4>but it also effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1745
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:28.030
<v Speaker 4>It would take hundreds of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1746
01:21:28.031 --> 01:21:30.610
<v Speaker 4>what other options are there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the thing.</v>

1747
01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:36.380
<v Speaker 6>Imagine that's the best way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then once you get the mushrooms to </v>

1748
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:38.190
<v Speaker 6>eat it and then you have to pick up the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mushrooms.</v>

1749
01:21:38.191 --> 01:21:39.780
<v Speaker 6>The mushrooms are still radioactive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1750
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:44.950
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For how long until the decay of the </v>

1751
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:47.650
<v Speaker 4>radioactive atoms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds of thousands of years.</v>

1752
01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's essentially just moving the </v>

1753
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:52.880
<v Speaker 4>problem to another area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1754
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:56.501
<v Speaker 4>but at least you're concentrating it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better to have like a 20 drums of </v>

1755
01:21:56.501 --> 01:21:59.810
<v Speaker 4>radioactive mushrooms in a concrete </v>
<v Speaker 4>vault somewhere than to have it covering</v>

1756
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:01.370
<v Speaker 4>100 miles of land</v>

1757
01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:04.280
<v Speaker 6>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Panting is so terrifying to me because I</v>

1758
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:08.060
<v Speaker 6>have no understanding whatsoever how </v>
<v Speaker 6>nuclear power works.</v>

1759
01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:10.940
<v Speaker 6>I just always took it for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You never even thought about it.</v>

1760
01:22:10.941 --> 01:22:15.941
<v Speaker 6>I never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I just recently found out that </v>

1761
01:22:15.941 --> 01:22:17.490
<v Speaker 6>it's about making steam.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's about like somehow or another loop,</v>

1762
01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:22.540
<v Speaker 6>the nuclear thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like the power comes from Steve </v>

1763
01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:22.540
<v Speaker 6>Powers things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>steam turbines,</v>

1764
01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:23.450
<v Speaker 6>steam turbines.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1765
01:22:23.451 --> 01:22:25.670
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That seems like so old school,</v>

1766
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:26.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

1767
01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.900
<v Speaker 6>they're using this super powerful fire </v>
<v Speaker 6>to boil water.</v>

1768
01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.850
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds ridiculous.</v>

1769
01:22:31.851 --> 01:22:32.360
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

1770
01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.220
<v Speaker 6>my simplification of it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous,</v>

1771
01:22:34.221 --> 01:22:39.221
<v Speaker 6>but when you find out that their spots </v>
<v Speaker 6>now where there's just no one's ever </v>

1772
01:22:39.221 --> 01:22:40.850
<v Speaker 6>going to be able to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then when you can't go there,</v>

1773
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:44.120
<v Speaker 6>you can't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's fucked for forever for.</v>

1774
01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:47.260
<v Speaker 6>We probably won't even be people anymore</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you know,</v>

1775
01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.460
<v Speaker 6>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago we weren't even this,</v>

1776
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:51.530
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were like barely this as a,</v>

1777
01:22:51.531 --> 01:22:56.531
<v Speaker 6>as an organism where we're essentially a</v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit more of a monkey than we are </v>

1778
01:22:56.531 --> 01:22:59.210
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the time that shit's done,</v>

1779
01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:04.690
<v Speaker 6>what are people going to be like?</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the time that's not radioactive </v>

1780
01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:06.790
<v Speaker 6>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're not even going to be people </v>

1781
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.790
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll probably be some new shit.</v>

1782
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.790
<v Speaker 6>We all have autism</v>

1783
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:09.460
<v Speaker 2>and it will probably be just like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grays dude,</v>

1784
01:23:09.461 --> 01:23:11.740
<v Speaker 2>just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that to the graded trip.</v>

1785
01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:16.741
<v Speaker 2>He's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be assimilated with the </v>

1786
01:23:16.741 --> 01:23:16.741
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1787
01:23:16.741 --> 01:23:16.741
<v Speaker 2>that's my conclusion.</v>

1788
01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:18.050
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1789
01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Assimilated with the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think's going to happen?</v>

1790
01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Something's going on.</v>

1791
01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:25.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1792
01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

1793
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I do think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

1794
01:23:30.051 --> 01:23:31.910
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult if anything seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1795
01:23:31.911 --> 01:23:36.911
<v Speaker 2>It's just like with any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any issue where it seems as if it could </v>

1796
01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:37.760
<v Speaker 2>go one way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly am a pessimist ultimately,</v>

1797
01:23:37.761 --> 01:23:42.761
<v Speaker 2>and I'd like to be an optimist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you a pessimist as far as the </v>

1798
01:23:42.761 --> 01:23:46.271
<v Speaker 2>potential that the human race can reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>or as you put about the possible </v>

1799
01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:50.561
<v Speaker 2>outcomes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you a pessimist about people in </v>

1800
01:23:50.561 --> 01:23:50.561
<v Speaker 2>general?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1801
01:23:50.561 --> 01:23:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I got into an argument with a Daniel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinchbeck recently about,</v>

1802
01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:55.130
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about aliens,</v>

1803
01:23:55.131 --> 01:23:57.280
<v Speaker 2>and he has this very optimistic idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if aliens.</v>

1804
01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:59.090
<v Speaker 2>He told me he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely exists.</v>

1805
01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.920
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believes a lot of things that I </v>

1806
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:04.920
<v Speaker 2>definitely said he's very open.</v>

1807
01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed talking about before we say </v>

1808
01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:11.620
<v Speaker 2>anything further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1809
01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:12.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed talking to him.</v>

1810
01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just playing.</v>

1811
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:14.750
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1812
01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.210
<v Speaker 2>so what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens.</v>

1813
01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:21.240
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about Stephen Hawking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Stephen Hawking has this idea that </v>

1814
01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:25.301
<v Speaker 2>if we ever do make contact with aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best move would be to ignore them </v>

1815
01:24:25.301 --> 01:24:27.110
<v Speaker 2>because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they ever come to our planet,</v>

1816
01:24:27.111 --> 01:24:30.080
<v Speaker 2>the chances are they're not only going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to exploit us but destroy us.</v>

1817
01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:35.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't say exactly those words </v>

1818
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:35.260
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He generally has a,</v>

1819
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.860
<v Speaker 2>a pessimistic view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's a well informed </v>

1820
01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:40.811
<v Speaker 2>intelligent view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to have an optimistic </v>

1821
01:24:40.811 --> 01:24:43.601
<v Speaker 2>view about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Daniel Pinchbeck seems to have this </v>

1822
01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:43.601
<v Speaker 2>idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1823
01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:43.601
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1824
01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.000
<v Speaker 2>touristic Gilliam friends and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink sweet.</v>

1825
01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.700
<v Speaker 2>So sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1826
01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

1827
01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:55.070
<v Speaker 2>if you look at every single organism </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can observe on this earth,</v>

1828
01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:56.990
<v Speaker 2>it takes advantage of the week or </v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms,</v>

1829
01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.520
<v Speaker 2>including the most intelligent.</v>

1830
01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:00.020
<v Speaker 2>We take advantage of dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put them.</v>

1831
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I was saying.</v>

1832
01:25:01.341 --> 01:25:04.040
<v Speaker 2>As we look into killer whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't give a fuck.</v>

1833
01:25:04.041 --> 01:25:09.041
<v Speaker 2>We put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we locked them up in tanks and we know </v>

1834
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:09.041
<v Speaker 2>they're intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just can't understand them,</v>

1835
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:10.270
<v Speaker 2>and so we forced him into slavery that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not mentioned humans to humans,</v>

1836
01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.280
<v Speaker 2>the keys to the doors and we we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with animals that we don't </v>

1837
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:15.800
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent animals,</v>

1838
01:25:15.801 --> 01:25:20.801
<v Speaker 2>we understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We regularly enslave them for people's </v>

1839
01:25:20.801 --> 01:25:23.981
<v Speaker 2>enjoyment to watch on television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we believe somehow or another </v>

1840
01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:27.641
<v Speaker 2>that some super intelligent organism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to show different behavior than </v>

1841
01:25:27.641 --> 01:25:29.660
<v Speaker 2>what every single organism on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>

1842
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:32.330
<v Speaker 2>including the highest us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most aware us.</v>

1843
01:25:32.331 --> 01:25:35.570
<v Speaker 2>We do it worse than any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do it worse than dolphins.</v>

1844
01:25:35.571 --> 01:25:37.820
<v Speaker 2>We do it worse than killer whales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have chimps.</v>

1845
01:25:37.821 --> 01:25:39.560
<v Speaker 2>We locked chimps up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't give a fuck.</v>

1846
01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:44.610
<v Speaker 2>You make humane people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that love to still keep them in </v>

1847
01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:44.610
<v Speaker 2>or people that love champs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep them in cages.</v>

1848
01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:49.541
<v Speaker 2>People's love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dolphins keep them in tanks not </v>

1849
01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:51.131
<v Speaker 2>literally kept himself into the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so even if they were trying to be nice </v>

1850
01:25:51.131 --> 01:25:55.241
<v Speaker 2>to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's to say that it wouldn't be some </v>

1851
01:25:55.241 --> 01:25:55.241
<v Speaker 2>nightmarish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hell for that dolphin,</v>

1852
01:25:55.241 --> 01:25:56.210
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be hell.</v>

1853
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:57.410
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're intelligent.</v>

1854
01:25:57.411 --> 01:26:02.411
<v Speaker 2>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just can't change their </v>

1855
01:26:02.411 --> 01:26:02.411
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know they have dialects and they have</v>

1856
01:26:02.411 --> 01:26:04.050
<v Speaker 2>crazy Alexis societal and you</v>

1857
01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:05.920
<v Speaker 6>know dolphins have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's this,</v>

1858
01:26:06.190 --> 01:26:11.190
<v Speaker 6>they have a huge attachment to their </v>
<v Speaker 6>family and their loved ones to just </v>

1859
01:26:11.190 --> 01:26:11.900
<v Speaker 6>snatch one up and stick it in a fish </v>
<v Speaker 6>tank.</v>

1860
01:26:11.901 --> 01:26:13.910
<v Speaker 6>It's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we do it.</v>

1861
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 6>Why would we think that aliens wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>do that to us?</v>

1862
01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.820
<v Speaker 6>We are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could you imagine if you came down here </v>

1863
01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:24.791
<v Speaker 6>and you watch all these little pink </v>
<v Speaker 6>monkeys with their fucking bank stigs </v>

1864
01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:28.331
<v Speaker 6>and nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You found out that people had nuclear </v>

1865
01:26:28.331 --> 01:26:28.331
<v Speaker 6>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1866
01:26:28.331 --> 01:26:28.331
<v Speaker 6>you see him at home,</v>
<v Speaker 6>slack,</v>

1867
01:26:28.331 --> 01:26:30.740
<v Speaker 6>jawed watching the Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have nuclear weapons,</v>

1868
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:35.950
<v Speaker 6>the same animal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know the same animal and it's all </v>

1869
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.950
<v Speaker 6>going on right now.</v>

1870
01:26:36.610 --> 01:26:41.610
<v Speaker 6>Imitate aliens who is probably cute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Want to shut this whole fucking show </v>

1871
01:26:41.741 --> 01:26:42.580
<v Speaker 6>down?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd be like,</v>

1872
01:26:42.581 --> 01:26:45.190
<v Speaker 6>you're going to ruin this whole planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You stupid fucks.</v>

1873
01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:47.650
<v Speaker 6>You would want to come as we would for </v>
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

1874
01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:52.740
<v Speaker 6>Shut this planet down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we came into an area and there was a </v>

1875
01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:56.701
<v Speaker 6>budget champs and the chimps had machine</v>
<v Speaker 6>guns and tanks and we would shut that </v>

1876
01:26:56.701 --> 01:27:01.621
<v Speaker 6>fucking place down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no way we're going to let some </v>

1877
01:27:01.621 --> 01:27:01.630
<v Speaker 6>chimps start running shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We would take all their weapons.</v>

1878
01:27:01.631 --> 01:27:04.750
<v Speaker 6>We'd go Jesus Christ who gave chimps </v>
<v Speaker 6>these fucking tanks,</v>

1879
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:07.120
<v Speaker 6>what chimps do and flying around in </v>
<v Speaker 6>jets.</v>

1880
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:12.270
<v Speaker 6>We would totally steal their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who would never allow that image of </v>

1881
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:13.660
<v Speaker 6>chimps started coming into our towns and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stealing our cars and shit.</v>

1882
01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:17.710
<v Speaker 6>There'll be a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We wouldn't allow that.</v>

1883
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:24.270
<v Speaker 6>We would take our shit take from those </v>
<v Speaker 6>dumb monkeys and that's what they would </v>

1884
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.270
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

1885
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:28.740
<v Speaker 6>They would come down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would steal our cars or iphone.</v>

1886
01:27:29.921 --> 01:27:30.520
<v Speaker 6>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That.</v>

1887
01:27:30.521 --> 01:27:32.290
<v Speaker 6>How'd you figure this out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You fucking dummy.</v>

1888
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:33.840
<v Speaker 6>They would take your iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1889
01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:35.230
<v Speaker 6>check you out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look what you did.</v>

1890
01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:38.770
<v Speaker 6>Did you figure this out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think about the average person.</v>

1891
01:27:38.771 --> 01:27:40.630
<v Speaker 6>How stupid there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they have an iphone in their pocket.</v>

1892
01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:42.820
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they don't know how to use it.</v>

1893
01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:45.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so pinchbeck thinks so they would all go</v>

1894
01:27:45.461 --> 01:27:47.150
<v Speaker 6>IOWASCA style.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1895
01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:49.870
<v Speaker 6>They would have a song prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hello humans,</v>

1896
01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:51.670
<v Speaker 6>we want to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We prepared this for you.</v>

1897
01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:56.740
<v Speaker 6>We will eat at the buffet is the day the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Earth stood still the other day?</v>

1898
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:59.530
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have been since I was a child.</v>

1899
01:28:00.090 --> 01:28:01.330
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was amazing.</v>

1900
01:28:01.570 --> 01:28:05.050
<v Speaker 6>It was like I was watching a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was Kinda cool.</v>

1901
01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.310
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of cool because you know,</v>

1902
01:28:06.311 --> 01:28:09.790
<v Speaker 6>you put yourself back in that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>like old school comic books,</v>

1903
01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:12.970
<v Speaker 6>style of storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did in the fifties and the innocent</v>

1904
01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:15.300
<v Speaker 6>days when they made that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the other thing was like,</v>

1905
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:20.310
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how naive like the portrait of like an </v>

1906
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.310
<v Speaker 6>alien,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what it would be and you know,</v>

1907
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:25.201
<v Speaker 6>just how naive the situation was in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>military and every obvious bad guys and </v>

1908
01:28:25.961 --> 01:28:28.510
<v Speaker 6>good guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like how naive but yet,</v>

1909
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:35.310
<v Speaker 4>how do you know who even now there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really no impressive concept of aliens.</v>

1910
01:28:35.441 --> 01:28:40.441
<v Speaker 4>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you're familiar with </v>

1911
01:28:40.441 --> 01:28:40.441
<v Speaker 4>this science fiction writers Stanislaw </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lem,</v>

1912
01:28:40.441 --> 01:28:41.350
<v Speaker 4>but he wrote Solaris and his master's </v>
<v Speaker 4>voice and all these books in.</v>

1913
01:28:41.351 --> 01:28:46.351
<v Speaker 4>His main idea is that humans can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceive of anything that is truly </v>

1914
01:28:46.351 --> 01:28:50.611
<v Speaker 4>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're only looking for ourselves in the </v>

1915
01:28:50.611 --> 01:28:50.611
<v Speaker 4>universe in anything that was truly </v>
<v Speaker 4>unlike us.</v>

1916
01:28:50.611 --> 01:28:50.740
<v Speaker 4>We couldn't even imagine.</v>

1917
01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:54.410
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So even like the movie alien still isn't</v>

1918
01:28:54.411 --> 01:28:57.380
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not even like it could be a living ocean</v>

1919
01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.680
<v Speaker 6>or living planet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>write a plan,</v>

1920
01:29:00.681 --> 01:29:01.410
<v Speaker 6>and with consciousness,</v>

1921
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:07.370
<v Speaker 2>that's always been a fascinating idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything has some sort of </v>

1922
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:08.100
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1923
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:13.160
<v Speaker 2>whether or not a expresses pain or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels it or can't communicate that </v>

1924
01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:16.230
<v Speaker 2>everything has some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a type of consciousness will definitely.</v>

1925
01:29:16.231 --> 01:29:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Our idea of life is generally very </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrow,</v>

1926
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:24.180
<v Speaker 2>like a budding field of astrobiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just a speculative science,</v>

1927
01:29:24.181 --> 01:29:27.360
<v Speaker 2>but even in astrobiology textbooks from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years ago,</v>

1928
01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:29.370
<v Speaker 2>there would be no mention of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility that,</v>

1929
01:29:29.650 --> 01:29:34.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that arsenic could replace phosphorous </v>

1930
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:34.840
<v Speaker 2>in bio molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't even seem like a possibility.</v>

1931
01:29:34.841 --> 01:29:36.990
<v Speaker 2>And now we know that that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>

1932
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>

1933
01:29:38.850 --> 01:29:40.320
<v Speaker 2>There was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lake,</v>

1934
01:29:40.321 --> 01:29:42.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in Nevada that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely,</v>

1935
01:29:42.931 --> 01:29:44.910
<v Speaker 2>extremely high levels of arsenic in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

1936
01:29:44.911 --> 01:29:47.730
<v Speaker 2>And this researcher is last name is </v>
<v Speaker 2>felice.</v>

1937
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I think a collected bacteria from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lake and found that they were producing </v>

1938
01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:57.630
<v Speaker 2>dna and amino acids where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phosphorous atom that's present in a lot</v>

1939
01:29:57.631 --> 01:30:00.240
<v Speaker 2>of these molecules was replaced by </v>
<v Speaker 2>arsenic.</v>

1940
01:30:00.650 --> 01:30:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I had arsenic poisoning from eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>sardines.</v>

1942
01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I told you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1943
01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate too many sardines.</v>

1944
01:30:07.561 --> 01:30:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I was eating learn Qantas or deans a day</v>
<v Speaker 2>or so.</v>

1945
01:30:09.421 --> 01:30:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who does that?</v>

1946
01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:13.590
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only person that likes sardines.</v>

1947
01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Are they a good source of arsenic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1948
01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least sardines there they feed on </v>

1949
01:30:22.730 --> 01:30:24.870
<v Speaker 2>heavy metal or will they don't feed on </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy metal,</v>

1950
01:30:24.871 --> 01:30:28.440
<v Speaker 2>but they feed at the bottom of the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where a lot of pollution as a</v>

1951
01:30:28.441 --> 01:30:30.680
<v Speaker 2>lot of the heavy metal pollution and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1952
01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:35.920
<v Speaker 2>they get a concentration of arsenic not </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to really to make you sick but </v>

1953
01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.241
<v Speaker 2>enough that shows up on tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get your blood checked and he </v>

1954
01:30:39.241 --> 01:30:39.241
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who should have some arsenic in there?</v>

1955
01:30:39.241 --> 01:30:41.040
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone's trying to kill me slowly.</v>

1956
01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Or is it sardines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns out it was hard Ns.</v>

1957
01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1958
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:50.670
<v Speaker 2>What if you could get turquoise point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like poisoning,</v>

1959
01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:53.700
<v Speaker 2>like if you like constantly ate a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of turquoise everyday.</v>

1960
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Like if is turquoise toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1961
01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.330
<v Speaker 2>It's in stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1962
01:30:57.331 --> 01:31:02.331
<v Speaker 2>But if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaved it down into a powder and put it </v>

1963
01:31:02.331 --> 01:31:02.331
<v Speaker 2>in some proteins and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1964
01:31:02.331 --> 01:31:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the chemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>composition of voices,</v>

1965
01:31:04.141 --> 01:31:07.140
<v Speaker 2>but you just don't study show that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get you fucked up.</v>

1966
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:07.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1967
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:10.650
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best thing ever.</v>

1968
01:31:10.651 --> 01:31:12.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's.</v>

1969
01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:15.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it leads to a half decent one.</v>

1970
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:18.510
<v Speaker 2>How do you think they've discovered all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychedelic substances on earth?</v>

1971
01:31:18.511 --> 01:31:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1972
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:25.520
<v Speaker 2>not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first saw Alexander Seligman's </v>

1973
01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.761
<v Speaker 2>work and saw call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was discouraged by it because I </v>

1974
01:31:28.761 --> 01:31:31.341
<v Speaker 2>thought that it had all been done that </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single possible psychoactive </v>

1975
01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:35.340
<v Speaker 2>tryptamine and ethylamine had already </v>
<v Speaker 2>been sent in from people who don't know.</v>

1976
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Picasso is Phil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it that I had known then that </v>

1977
01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:43.920
<v Speaker 2>means I've known and loved and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tryptamines I've known and loved in </v>

1978
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.431
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These two enormous thousand plus page </v>

1979
01:31:46.431 --> 01:31:48.360
<v Speaker 2>books written by a chemist in California</v>
<v Speaker 2>named Alexander Silgan and they contain,</v>

1980
01:31:48.370 --> 01:31:53.370
<v Speaker 2>knew least about 100 drugs that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>synthesized and these two chemical </v>

1981
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 2>classes in each volume and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty comprehensive.</v>

1982
01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:59.620
<v Speaker 2>It looks as if he's evaluated every </v>
<v Speaker 2>imaginable psychedelic,</v>

1983
01:31:59.621 --> 01:32:01.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's only a fraction of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1984
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I love that interview that you had with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a man because I had never seen a guy </v>

1985
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:09.250
<v Speaker 2>like that in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen some super chemists.</v>

1986
01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Dude is created like God knows how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>common auditory.</v>

1987
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.590
<v Speaker 2>So how many times has he created </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1988
01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:17.190
<v Speaker 2>some new cool thing or discovered some </v>
<v Speaker 2>new cool things.</v>

1989
01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.070
<v Speaker 2>It's hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1990
01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:19.690
<v Speaker 2>How many has he documented?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing,</v>

1991
01:32:19.691 --> 01:32:20.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enormous,</v>

1992
01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:20.800
<v Speaker 2>enormous.</v>

1993
01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Don't incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that he's sitting there just </v>

1994
01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:27.991
<v Speaker 2>rattling all this information off to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you were like a fucking kid in a </v>

1995
01:32:27.991 --> 01:32:28.450
<v Speaker 2>candy store that you could tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were like,</v>

1996
01:32:28.451 --> 01:32:33.451
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you couldn't believe you were </v>

1997
01:32:33.451 --> 01:32:33.910
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so cool that the enthusiasm,</v>

1998
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:39.150
<v Speaker 2>like it really came through like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>your honest enthusiasm to be hanging </v>

1999
01:32:39.150 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 2>around with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really.</v>

2000
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:44.671
<v Speaker 2>You had an educated sense of reverence </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what he's done.</v>

2001
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:47.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's like when you addressed all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

2002
01:32:47.441 --> 01:32:51.400
<v Speaker 2>like you could tell that you had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>great joy in getting this opportunity to</v>

2003
01:32:51.401 --> 01:32:52.480
<v Speaker 2>talk to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2004
01:32:52.481 --> 01:32:55.450
<v Speaker 2>It was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love him with a passion.</v>

2005
01:32:55.451 --> 01:32:57.430
<v Speaker 2>He is one of the most amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>

2006
01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Talk a little watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

2007
01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:00.040
<v Speaker 2>how can I find that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

2008
01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:05.420
<v Speaker 2>If you type Hamilton's Pharmacopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the name of my show on vbs.</v>

2009
01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find it on vice.com</v>

2010
01:33:07.601 --> 01:33:10.240
<v Speaker 2>through the video section if you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>look for Hamilton's Pharmacopia.</v>

2011
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2012
01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:17.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's in it and I seen him quite a</v>
<v Speaker 2>few times since then and it really is a </v>

2013
01:33:17.761 --> 01:33:21.901
<v Speaker 2>privilege because his entire methodology</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one that's not followed anymore.</v>

2014
01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:26.971
<v Speaker 2>It's like it seems very antiquated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>most young people and even </v>

2015
01:33:26.971 --> 01:33:27.520
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that,</v>

2016
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:28.900
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2017
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:32.050
<v Speaker 2>anyone would take a drug that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>synthesize is ridiculous,</v>

2018
01:33:32.051 --> 01:33:33.580
<v Speaker 2>but that totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally normal.</v>

2019
01:33:33.581 --> 01:33:35.200
<v Speaker 2>They used to be the way drugs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed.</v>

2020
01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:41.460
<v Speaker 2>The chemistry invented Ritalin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took it after he synthesized it and </v>

2021
01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 2>tried it and didn't really get much from</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2022
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:47.281
<v Speaker 2>Then he gave it to his wife Rita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she loved it and said that it </v>

2023
01:33:47.281 --> 01:33:48.740
<v Speaker 2>improved her tennis game and so he named</v>
<v Speaker 2>it after her Rita Lynn.</v>

2024
01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that kind of thing was calm and </v>

2025
01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:54.120
<v Speaker 2>improved her tennis game because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially like speed,</v>

2026
01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:54.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2027
01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like cocaine or how does that work </v>

2028
01:33:59.220 --> 01:33:59.220
<v Speaker 2>with kids where it makes them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2029
01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:00.790
<v Speaker 2>kids who were really rowdy at calms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2030
01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:02.530
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2031
01:34:02.531 --> 01:34:06.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different proposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms that are kind of complicated.</v>

2032
01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.430
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know how it works.</v>

2033
01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:11.020
<v Speaker 2>That's always been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2034
01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I've met a couple kids that are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ritalin and it's always been a very dark</v>

2035
01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:19.630
<v Speaker 2>sort of a moment when you realized that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are drugging their kid,</v>

2036
01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:20.700
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2037
01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if some people need it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know some people don't need it.</v>

2038
01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some kids that are just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit rowdy and they need attention</v>

2039
01:34:26.651 --> 01:34:28.990
<v Speaker 2>and not getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden they're pilled up.</v>

2040
01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:31.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a disturbing thing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2041
01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially with very young children </v>

2042
01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:36.060
<v Speaker 2>around high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>College Age,</v>

2043
01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.290
<v Speaker 2>and especially when the mom crushed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the down.</v>

2044
01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:43.291
<v Speaker 2>They snort it like in the wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>whites of West Virginia.</v>

2045
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:47.000
<v Speaker 2>The wild and wonderful wives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were snorting pills as after friend</v>

2046
01:34:47.001 --> 01:34:48.910
<v Speaker 2>after she gave birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she gave birth.</v>

2047
01:34:48.911 --> 01:34:50.920
<v Speaker 2>She was in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

2048
01:34:52.130 --> 01:34:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have seen some of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

2049
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:55.990
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like watching.</v>

2050
01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.430
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you turned</v>

2051
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.280
<v Speaker 6>monkeys loose and let them live amongst </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

2052
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:03.020
<v Speaker 6>How they live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would live like these people.</v>

2053
01:35:03.021 --> 01:35:05.330
<v Speaker 6>These people are wild.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're fucking</v>

2054
01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.650
<v Speaker 1>why y'all?</v>

2055
01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.200
<v Speaker 6>They're a different breed of human being</v>
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

2056
01:35:09.201 --> 01:35:12.320
<v Speaker 6>You're in here rattling off all this </v>
<v Speaker 6>scientific knowledge,</v>

2057
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:17.210
<v Speaker 6>neurochemistry and Pharmacopia and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's people that could breed with you</v>

2092
01:36:50.730 --> 01:36:50.730
<v Speaker 1>people ever and I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2093
01:36:50.730 --> 01:36:54.100
<v Speaker 1>they both took up 90 percent of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my seat.</v>

2094
01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So the whole time I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in the middle and the other </v>

2095
01:36:59.280 --> 01:36:59.280
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a movie.</v>

2096
01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was holding myself like this and </v>

01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I am so jacked from that flight.</v>

2099
01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:10.200
<v Speaker 1>That was the closest thing to torture </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever been and I couldn't do </v>

2100
01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:10.750
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do well.</v>

2101
01:37:10.751 --> 01:37:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they kick Kevin Smith off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.320
<v Speaker 1>How big were these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty big.</v>

2103
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2104
01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:16.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2105
01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:18.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was bigger than the girl.</v>

2106
01:37:18.641 --> 01:37:23.641
<v Speaker 1>But the problem was the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had so much room to lean on the </v>

2107
01:37:23.641 --> 01:37:27.130
<v Speaker 1>window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he decided to lean on my side and so</v>

2108
01:37:27.131 --> 01:37:28.230
<v Speaker 1>the whole time he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2109
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:33.270
<v Speaker 1>he's on my lap on the east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the woman was trying to be a little </v>

2110
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:34.240
<v Speaker 1>bit nicer about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was still pretty big.</v>

2111
01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:38.800
<v Speaker 1>So she was on my space like our C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a human rights issue.</v>

2112
01:37:39.170 --> 01:37:44.170
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking seats for two goddamn slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need like a rape whistle would slip </v>

2113
01:37:44.170 --> 01:37:48.571
<v Speaker 1>right in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just go sideways and those </v>

2114
01:37:49.421 --> 01:37:54.421
<v Speaker 1>families couldn't even touch you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like a sheet of paper between </v>

2115
01:37:54.421 --> 01:37:54.421
<v Speaker 1>pure red rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2116
01:37:54.421 --> 01:37:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem.</v>

2117
01:37:54.730 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>There should be a whistle for them.</v>

2118
01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 2>We have an issue with people are getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>too fucking fat,</v>

2119
01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's been going on for a long time.</v>

2120
01:38:00.751 --> 01:38:05.751
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an image once that I saw </v>

2121
01:38:05.751 --> 01:38:08.121
<v Speaker 2>online from the early 19 hundreds and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was one of those carnivals and it was </v>

2122
01:38:08.121 --> 01:38:12.771
<v Speaker 2>the Batman and the carnival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there wouldn't be the guy that was </v>

2123
01:38:12.771 --> 01:38:13.270
<v Speaker 2>the fat man and he was barely fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2124
01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.250
<v Speaker 2>in comparison to what we consider fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

2125
01:38:15.251 --> 01:38:20.251
<v Speaker 2>like some of these people that you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have to get moved out of their </v>

2126
01:38:20.251 --> 01:38:22.101
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to cut a hole out and they're </v>

2127
01:38:22.101 --> 01:38:22.101
<v Speaker 2>attached to the couch because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't gotten up.</v>

2128
01:38:22.101 --> 01:38:24.680
<v Speaker 2>They'd been shooting where they sit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their fiber,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking chair.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is not just one person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is many,</v>

2131
01:38:29.881 --> 01:38:31.320
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people have done this.</v>

2132

<v Speaker 2>It's been a bunch of people that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to cut their fucking house open so </v>

2133
01:38:36.650 --> 01:38:36.780
<v Speaker 2>they could pull them out attached to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their couch.</v>

2134
01:38:37.290 --> 01:38:39.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2142
01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:05.820
<v Speaker 2>amount of time ago where it was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>rare to get that fat.</v>

2143
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:09.810
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how far society,</v>

<v Speaker 2>when it comes to that or our bodies are </v>

2145
01:39:14.811 --> 01:39:19.640
<v Speaker 2>exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's so common to see people just </v>

01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:24.590
<v Speaker 2>These teas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>methamphetamine used instead of me and </v>

2172
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:24.590
<v Speaker 2>they used 10 metres,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the views,</v>

2173
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:29.060
<v Speaker 2>anything you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any stimulant and just anything that </v>

2174
01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:29.910
<v Speaker 2>they could sell you to make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to loose the stimulants,</v>

2175
01:40:29.911 --> 01:40:31.950
<v Speaker 2>do work and fen phen worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2176
01:40:31.951 --> 01:40:35.380
<v Speaker 2>And do those things that you see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2177
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:37.390
<v Speaker 2>ripped fuel and all that shit or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2178
01:40:37.410 --> 01:40:40.580
<v Speaker 2>those are those diet pills or those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things affect it?</v>

2179
01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if there are,</v>

2180
01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.590
<v Speaker 2>some of them have weird derivatives of </v>
<v Speaker 2>finesse,</v>

2181
01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Colombian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2182
01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does all that stuff?</v>

2183
01:40:47.671 --> 01:40:49.260
<v Speaker 2>This was just amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

2184
01:40:49.690 --> 01:40:54.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just probably really weak </v>

2185
01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:54.690
<v Speaker 2>stimulant.</v>

2186
01:40:54.970 --> 01:40:59.770
<v Speaker 4>Like thin ethylamine is a close </v>
<v Speaker 4>derivative of amphetamine,</v>

2187
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:03.580
<v Speaker 4>just missing one carbon atom and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's illegal.</v>

2188
01:41:03.581 --> 01:41:08.581
<v Speaker 4>So you can just put tons of it into </v>
<v Speaker 4>dietary supplements and it produces a </v>

2189
01:41:08.581 --> 01:41:09.880
<v Speaker 4>short lasting stimulant effect.</v>

2190
01:41:11.410 --> 01:41:16.410
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing that that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>number one concerns that people have </v>

2191
01:41:16.410 --> 01:41:19.120
<v Speaker 6>getting rid of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's it.</v>

2192
01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:24.170
<v Speaker 6>It's a very strange statement when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>think about how society becomes so </v>

2193
01:41:24.170 --> 01:41:27.160
<v Speaker 6>successful that even when people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>down in the dumps,</v>

2194
01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:30.160
<v Speaker 6>they're still fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's still fucking.</v>

2195
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:34.630
<v Speaker 6>It's like normal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's normal to have excess energy stored</v>

2196
01:41:34.631 --> 01:41:37.450
<v Speaker 6>away onto your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's normally to be prepared for,</v>

2197
01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.390
<v Speaker 6>for your fucking stocked up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2198
01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.470
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the,</v>

2199
01:41:41.471 --> 01:41:43.540
<v Speaker 6>the wild days.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So rare to,</v>

2200
01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.640
<v Speaker 6>to become a fat person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2201
01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:51.660
<v Speaker 6>so fucking terrible conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You guys checked out a long time ago.</v>

2202
01:41:52.751 --> 01:41:57.310
<v Speaker 6>I smelled it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All this talk about fat.</v>

2203
01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:01.510
<v Speaker 6>You know when you have friends that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>overweight and you worry,</v>

2204
01:42:01.511 --> 01:42:02.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>after patrice died,</v>

2205
01:42:02.651 --> 01:42:06.120
<v Speaker 6>especially our friend Patrice O'Neal's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a standup comedian just recently.</v>

2206
01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:08.350
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have friends that are overweight and</v>

2207
01:42:08.351 --> 01:42:11.800
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like a bomb and you know it's going</v>

2208
01:42:11.801 --> 01:42:14.410
<v Speaker 6>to go off eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know what you can do.</v>

2209
01:42:14.530 --> 01:42:19.530
<v Speaker 6>You've got to try to diffuse it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You try to lead them in the right </v>

2210
01:42:19.530 --> 01:42:20.050
<v Speaker 6>direction or enjoy them until they blow </v>
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>

2211
01:42:20.690 --> 01:42:24.680
<v Speaker 4>Patrice o'neal think that is fatness </v>
<v Speaker 4>aided his comedy as well.</v>

2212
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:28.140
<v Speaker 6>I've never had that conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 6>them so I could never speak of it,</v>

2213
01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:33.180
<v Speaker 6>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was really analytical about his </v>

2214
01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.911
<v Speaker 6>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just think he was also a guy who </v>

2215
01:42:35.911 --> 01:42:36.280
<v Speaker 6>wanted to do whatever the fuck you want </v>
<v Speaker 6>her to do right then and there.</v>

2216
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:40.600
<v Speaker 6>Some of the best comedians are also very</v>
<v Speaker 6>impulsive people and you know,</v>

2217
01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:45.601
<v Speaker 6>it can be good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know comedians will become impulsive </v>

2218
01:42:45.601 --> 01:42:48.900
<v Speaker 6>gamblers and they get addicted to drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so like a lot of them have really kind </v>

2219
01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.790
<v Speaker 6>of wild and impulsive instincts and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what makes him funny.</v>

2220
01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:53.890
<v Speaker 6>That be the first person to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bitch,</v>

2221
01:42:53.891 --> 01:42:56.350
<v Speaker 6>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was patrice o'neil.</v>

2222
01:42:56.351 --> 01:42:58.990
<v Speaker 6>He was the first guy that would say he </v>
<v Speaker 6>call you on your bullshit.</v>

2223
01:42:59.230 --> 01:43:04.230
<v Speaker 6>The first guy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shut the fuck up and to be that person </v>

2224
01:43:04.230 --> 01:43:07.291
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't really like worry about how</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is going to come out and just fly </v>

2225
01:43:07.291 --> 01:43:07.291
<v Speaker 6>with it.</v>

2226
01:43:07.291 --> 01:43:09.970
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's a very specific type of </v>
<v Speaker 6>personality.</v>

2227
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:13.810
<v Speaker 6>Not that many people do it and they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that personality is prone to doing a lot</v>

2228
01:43:13.811 --> 01:43:15.750
<v Speaker 6>of other crazy shit to that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that personality,</v>

2229
01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:18.400
<v Speaker 6>personalities prone to just eat until </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're fucking pass out.</v>

2230
01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:22.900
<v Speaker 6>A personality is prone to do 15 shots </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know on a dare.</v>

2231
01:43:22.901 --> 01:43:25.240
<v Speaker 6>That's a wild personality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a personality.</v>

2232
01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:27.160
<v Speaker 6>It's going to go with you to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2233
01:43:27.161 --> 01:43:29.020
<v Speaker 6>it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the reason why they're funny.</v>

2234
01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:32.140
<v Speaker 6>So it becomes a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're sad.</v>

2235
01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:37.170
<v Speaker 6>Like you see your friend who's really </v>
<v Speaker 6>big and you see them eating themselves </v>

2236
01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:37.270
<v Speaker 6>to death and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh shit,</v>

2237
01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:38.240
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

2238
01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:43.260
<v Speaker 6>you can't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing you can do anymore than </v>

2239
01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:43.260
<v Speaker 6>you've already done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're an asshole.</v>

2240
01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 6>You tell them you love them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Give them a pat on the back.</v>

2241
01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:45.700
<v Speaker 6>If you need help,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come to the gym.</v>

2242
01:43:45.701 --> 01:43:47.980
<v Speaker 6>I work out with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But other than that,</v>

2243
01:43:47.981 --> 01:43:50.380
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck else can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a weird world.</v>

2244
01:43:50.381 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 6>We live in people eating themselves to</v>

2245
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.290
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton Morris.</v>

2246
01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:59.291
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You stay slender with the vegetarian </v>

2247
01:43:59.291 --> 01:44:02.531
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle on your bare basic alanines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever various substances you choose.</v>

2248
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you.</v>

2249
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Are you a multivitamin guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You seem like you know so much about the</v>

2250
01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:07.670
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

2251
01:44:07.930 --> 01:44:10.710
<v Speaker 2>do you take supplements?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take,</v>

2252
01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:14.780
<v Speaker 2>I take lists that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew you motherfucker.</v>

2253
01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:20.650
<v Speaker 2>You're concerned about your liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what supplement.</v>

2254
01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them have hepatic toxicity </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

2255
01:44:24.411 --> 01:44:29.411
<v Speaker 2>but some of them do you handle taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just about not like,</v>

2256
01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.780
<v Speaker 2>it's inherently bad for your liver to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take vitamins,</v>

2257
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:34.220
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of food,</v>

2258
01:44:34.221 --> 01:44:35.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's essentially what I mean.</v>

2259
01:44:35.481 --> 01:44:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Everything has to go through your liver </v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't,</v>

2260
01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:41.890
<v Speaker 2>that's not a huge worry unless it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something or some in super high doses of</v>

2261
01:44:41.891 --> 01:44:46.891
<v Speaker 2>toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are the ones who was the </v>

2262
01:44:46.891 --> 01:44:46.891
<v Speaker 2>lawyer?</v>

2263
01:44:46.891 --> 01:44:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Soluble ones are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like vitamin e potentially vitamin A</v>

2264
01:44:51.021 --> 01:44:52.250
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2265
01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:54.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not something I've done a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of research on,</v>

2266
01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:59.740
<v Speaker 2>but now when you say fat soluble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody said that once for someone </v>

2267
01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:03.800
<v Speaker 2>who got caught taking a performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drug and one of the the people</v>

2268
01:45:03.801 --> 01:45:08.801
<v Speaker 2>that was in his camp said one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that fucked him up was that he's </v>

2269
01:45:08.801 --> 01:45:11.270
<v Speaker 2>too fat and so he can't get it out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his system as quick short.</v>

2270
01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Is that really true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it stays in your fat,</v>

2271
01:45:13.131 --> 01:45:15.800
<v Speaker 2>like if you are a lean person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would get it out of your system.</v>

2272
01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you were a person that had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high percentage of body weight,</v>

2273
01:45:18.951 --> 01:45:21.380
<v Speaker 2>it would remain for longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

2274
01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:26.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the main physical </v>

2275
01:45:26.381 --> 01:45:28.871
<v Speaker 2>properties of any molecule is that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has different abilities and different </v>

2276
01:45:28.871 --> 01:45:32.351
<v Speaker 2>chemicals and some things are lipid </v>
<v Speaker 2>soluble and and if it's something like </v>

2277
01:45:32.351 --> 01:45:36.401
<v Speaker 2>thc and you have a huge amount of fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>tissue on your body that the thc can </v>

2278
01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:41.240
<v Speaker 2>stay in so you just fucking high all </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

2279
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Certain people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting high off of it.</v>

2280
01:45:44.301 --> 01:45:49.301
<v Speaker 2>It's just just in hearing and yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not doing anything unless it's in </v>

2281
01:45:49.301 --> 01:45:51.290
<v Speaker 2>the central nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just giving you a very mild high,</v>

2282
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:56.310
<v Speaker 2>just in my mildest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just cooks in Lindsay's point where it </v>

2283
01:45:56.310 --> 01:46:00.630
<v Speaker 2>the claim that there's like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>reservoir in your spinal fluid or </v>

2284
01:46:00.630 --> 01:46:01.250
<v Speaker 2>something and if you crack your back the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right way,</v>

2285
01:46:01.251 --> 01:46:06.251
<v Speaker 2>that all really blast of cannabinoids or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lsd or something really.</v>

2286
01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would say that.</v>

2287
01:46:08.481 --> 01:46:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2288
01:46:09.711 --> 01:46:14.711
<v Speaker 2>there's people that say that Kundalini </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga practice can lead to psychedelic </v>

2289
01:46:14.711 --> 01:46:14.711
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2290
01:46:14.711 --> 01:46:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever experienced that?</v>

2291
01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I studied Kundalini Yoga for a while </v>

2292
01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:21.320
<v Speaker 2>during the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2293
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:26.410
<v Speaker 2>no try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was one of the ways they </v>

2294
01:46:26.410 --> 01:46:29.261
<v Speaker 2>tried to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to take it as part of my sport's </v>

2295
01:46:29.261 --> 01:46:30.420
<v Speaker 2>requirement in high school and Sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

2296
01:46:32.210 --> 01:46:34.340
<v Speaker 2>That is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2297
01:46:34.341 --> 01:46:35.860
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2298
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:37.600
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2299
01:46:38.050 --> 01:46:43.050
<v Speaker 2>And they tried to sell it by equating it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a drug experience of some kind and </v>

2300
01:46:43.581 --> 01:46:45.830
<v Speaker 2>that's why it was so popular in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties for that same reason,</v>

2301
01:46:45.831 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never achieved any</v>

2302
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.160
<v Speaker 4>profound state of altered consciousness.</v>

2303
01:46:53.890 --> 01:46:55.750
<v Speaker 6>One friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2304
01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:58.450
<v Speaker 6>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a girl that he knew that was a friend of</v>

2305
01:46:58.451 --> 01:47:03.451
<v Speaker 6>his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that he actually went on a trip with </v>

2306
01:47:03.451 --> 01:47:05.401
<v Speaker 6>her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were actually just platonic </v>

2307
01:47:05.401 --> 01:47:05.401
<v Speaker 6>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they would,</v>

2308
01:47:05.401 --> 01:47:08.101
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>traveled together occasionally and she </v>

2309
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:10.381
<v Speaker 6>was into like serious Kundalini Yoga </v>
<v Speaker 6>where she would get up every morning at </v>

2310
01:47:10.571 --> 01:47:14.470
<v Speaker 6>a very specific time and she would have </v>
<v Speaker 6>to face a very specific angle.</v>

2311
01:47:14.471 --> 01:47:17.550
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was towards the Sun or away from the sun</v>

2312
01:47:17.551 --> 01:47:22.551
<v Speaker 6>and I don't know what she was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she would do these very intense </v>

2313
01:47:22.551 --> 01:47:25.720
<v Speaker 6>Kundalini exercises for like an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an hour and 15 minutes,</v>

2314
01:47:25.721 --> 01:47:28.600
<v Speaker 6>an hour and 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she did it every day and she claimed</v>

2315
01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:30.850
<v Speaker 6>that when she did it for long periods of</v>
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

2316
01:47:30.851 --> 01:47:35.851
<v Speaker 6>because she did it so much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she could get into like an astral </v>

2317
01:47:35.851 --> 01:47:39.691
<v Speaker 6>traveling sort of dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a traveling state of consciousness where</v>

2318
01:47:40.061 --> 01:47:41.650
<v Speaker 6>she would have psychedelic experiences.</v>

2319
01:47:41.710 --> 01:47:42.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

2320
01:47:42.311 --> 01:47:43.990
<v Speaker 4>now that I think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did have some.</v>

2321
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:48.220
<v Speaker 4>You just forget that they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same.</v>

2322
01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.140
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've had,</v>

2323
01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:52.480
<v Speaker 4>you've had so many psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences for you to have one in Yogi,</v>

2324
01:47:52.481 --> 01:47:53.080
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

2325
01:47:53.081 --> 01:47:54.610
<v Speaker 4>I have one in that too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't really,</v>

2326
01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:56.340
<v Speaker 4>it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2327
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:57.880
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't use breathing techniques,</v>

2328
01:47:57.881 --> 01:48:02.881
<v Speaker 4>breath of fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for a normal person having an </v>

2329
01:48:02.881 --> 01:48:02.881
<v Speaker 4>experience like that would be something </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would never forget.</v>

2330
01:48:02.881 --> 01:48:07.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did yoga and I had this most incredible </v>

2331
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:07.800
<v Speaker 4>transcendent experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I left my body,</v>

2332
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:08.830
<v Speaker 4>I became one with the universe for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

2333
01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:10.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did that during yoga too.</v>

2334
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:14.830
<v Speaker 4>So how did it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did that go down?</v>

2335
01:48:15.170 --> 01:48:20.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to follow these different </v>

2336
01:48:20.170 --> 01:48:21.361
<v Speaker 4>breathing techniques and then hold </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself in some kind of a weird stress </v>

2337
01:48:21.361 --> 01:48:23.180
<v Speaker 4>position that's extremely exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then your,</v>

2338
01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:28.260
<v Speaker 4>all of your muscles start to vibrate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was on that machine of the turbo </v>

2339
01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:28.260
<v Speaker 4>sonic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2340
01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.920
<v Speaker 4>like the Turbo Sonic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a turbo sonic type effect.</v>

2341
01:48:31.930 --> 01:48:36.930
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would compare it more to the turbo </v>

2342
01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:36.930
<v Speaker 4>sonic then to Lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

2343
01:48:37.150 --> 01:48:38.290
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:43.610
<v Speaker 6>What's the number one thing that if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>had to do it again,</v>

2345
01:48:43.621 --> 01:48:45.810
<v Speaker 6>you would approach with more caution?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is there any.</v>

2346
01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.290
<v Speaker 6>Is there any one psychedelic experience </v>
<v Speaker 6>for a loop?</v>

2347
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:50.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2348
01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:55.740
<v Speaker 4>many have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think drugs like there certainly </v>

2349
01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.910
<v Speaker 4>are drugs that are more friendly than </v>
<v Speaker 4>others and I think five immuno dmt would</v>

2350
01:48:57.911 --> 01:49:02.911
<v Speaker 4>be an example of something that has the </v>
<v Speaker 4>capacity to be extremely unpleasant if </v>

2351
01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:04.690
<v Speaker 4>you take it under the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances.</v>

2352
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:08.370
<v Speaker 6>I had a friend completely flip out </v>
<v Speaker 6>taking it because he had.</v>

2353
01:49:08.371 --> 01:49:13.371
<v Speaker 6>He had eaten and so he had to throw up </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he got up to throw up and he got to </v>

2354
01:49:13.371 --> 01:49:17.180
<v Speaker 6>the sink just in time to throw up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then he was just going crazy.</v>

2355
01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:21.630
<v Speaker 6>You're talking about rape,</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

2356
01:49:21.631 --> 01:49:22.590
<v Speaker 6>Took his shirt off.</v>

2357
01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend lose consciousness and </v>

2358
01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:28.100
<v Speaker 4>started vomiting and look as if they had</v>
<v Speaker 4>died.</v>

2359
01:49:28.130 --> 01:49:29.690
<v Speaker 4>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend read them.</v>

2360
01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:32.180
<v Speaker 6>My friend Doug Stanhope comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought we'd lost him.</v>

2361
01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:37.570
<v Speaker 6>It was going like this and little </v>
<v Speaker 6>bubbles were coming out of the corner of</v>

2362
01:49:40.571 --> 01:49:41.860
<v Speaker 6>his mouth and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

2363
01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:47.640
<v Speaker 6>And I'm hanging out with Doug and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>just thinking of all the chemicals that </v>

2364
01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.430
<v Speaker 6>doug throws into his body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes and beer</v>

2365
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:52.540
<v Speaker 2>and fucking mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug's shits on multivitamins.</v>

2366
01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:54.520
<v Speaker 2>He's not taking a multivitamin fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of here.</v>

2367
01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:59.660
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might have red lined his body with </v>

2368
01:49:59.660 --> 01:49:59.660
<v Speaker 2>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2369
01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:00.040
<v Speaker 2>he just took a big hit and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might,</v>

2370
01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:02.530
<v Speaker 2>he might be a goner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he came through it,</v>

2371
01:50:02.531 --> 01:50:04.450
<v Speaker 2>but it was terrifying for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

2372
01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:06.070
<v Speaker 2>You did map them out then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2373
01:50:06.170 --> 01:50:09.860
<v Speaker 2>almost done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2374
01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:10.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>

2375
01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:19.810
<v Speaker 2>What were you saying about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that you were asking me if there's </v>

2376
01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:22.020
<v Speaker 2>one that I would approach with caution </v>
<v Speaker 2>again in the mail you think would be the</v>

2377
01:50:22.330 --> 01:50:27.330
<v Speaker 2>scariest one probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's also just isolated </v>

2378
01:50:27.330 --> 01:50:31.921
<v Speaker 2>experiences that you can't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>connect with the substance p called </v>

2379
01:50:31.921 --> 01:50:35.770
<v Speaker 2>there's like an shogun takes this </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen,</v>

2380
01:50:35.771 --> 01:50:40.771
<v Speaker 2>less masculine derivative called </v>
<v Speaker 2>isocracy and goes into a fugue state </v>

2381
01:50:40.781 --> 01:50:45.781
<v Speaker 2>where she has a prevailing sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unreality that lasts for months or </v>

2382
01:50:45.781 --> 01:50:46.150
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2383
01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.550
<v Speaker 2>It just totally feels like she's in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>

2384
01:50:48.730 --> 01:50:53.730
<v Speaker 2>But then I've had friends who also have </v>
<v Speaker 2>used unusual substances that have been </v>

2385
01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:55.960
<v Speaker 2>tested very much and have weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactions,</v>

2386
01:50:55.961 --> 01:51:00.961
<v Speaker 2>but every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you ingest the same substance </v>

2387
01:51:00.961 --> 01:51:03.451
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really don't know exactly what's </v>

2388
01:51:03.451 --> 01:51:06.751
<v Speaker 2>going to happen with the psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You taking the exact same quantity of </v>

2389
01:51:06.751 --> 01:51:08.770
<v Speaker 2>synthetic suicide and over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over again a year apart.</v>

2390
01:51:08.771 --> 01:51:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Every year will feel completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different every time.</v>

2391
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:15.550
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always skeptical of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>deals if they really know the effects of</v>

2392
01:51:15.551 --> 01:51:18.130
<v Speaker 2>any substance because you always </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different.</v>

2393
01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt always seemed like there's so much </v>

2394
01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:23.770
<v Speaker 2>coming at you and there was coming at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you from like 15 minutes.</v>

2395
01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Like it was almost impossible to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>back anything.</v>

2396
01:51:26.201 --> 01:51:28.330
<v Speaker 2>It was almost impossible to record any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

2397
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2398
01:51:29.531 --> 01:51:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean to say that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that experience,</v>

2399
01:51:31.421 --> 01:51:33.340
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to do that experience so many</v>

2400
01:51:33.341 --> 01:51:38.341
<v Speaker 2>times just to get a general sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just looking around and just relaxing </v>

2401
01:51:38.341 --> 01:51:39.070
<v Speaker 2>and trying to absorb it all.</v>

2402
01:51:39.070 --> 01:51:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Trying to like figure out what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>is this?</v>

2403
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Can I move this around myself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is this?</v>

2404
01:51:43.151 --> 01:51:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this an organism?</v>

2405
01:51:44.890 --> 01:51:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this the universe?</v>

2406
01:51:46.421 --> 01:51:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Is this the wiring of love?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on here?</v>

2407
01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:54.930
<v Speaker 2>It takes so long like you do it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you do it you come back and </v>

2408
01:51:54.930 --> 01:51:54.930
<v Speaker 2>then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck was that?</v>

2409
01:51:54.930 --> 01:51:57.790
<v Speaker 2>And then you go back in again and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>still the same thing for 15 minutes.</v>

2410
01:51:57.791 --> 01:52:00.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just like it's too alien and too </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

2411
01:52:00.370 --> 01:52:02.730
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you can have a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly get a grip on it.</v>

2412
01:52:02.731 --> 01:52:05.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you can go on a vacation </v>
<v Speaker 2>to dmt land,</v>

2413
01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:07.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could take a trip,</v>

2414
01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:13.460
<v Speaker 2>you know you could go somewhere for two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks and in that two week time you </v>

2415
01:52:13.781 --> 01:52:16.630
<v Speaker 2>would see the entire time you will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through a dmt trip.</v>

2416
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe you would kind of get a grip </v>

2417
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:24.751
<v Speaker 2>on the IOWASCA is some intermediate </v>
<v Speaker 2>between smoking dmt and a non </v>

2418
01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:30.900
<v Speaker 2>intermediate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the longest that you can have </v>

2419
01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:31.780
<v Speaker 2>that experience and even then you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

2420
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:36.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not it lengthening the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you some greater understanding </v>

2421
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:41.011
<v Speaker 2>of what it is necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's really any less or </v>

2422
01:52:41.011 --> 01:52:42.580
<v Speaker 2>more confusing than smoking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a longer duration.</v>

2423
01:52:42.581 --> 01:52:43.660
<v Speaker 2>And even then you have people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gordon,</v>

2424
01:52:43.661 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>todd skinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are opening themselves up</v>

2425
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 4>to ivy bags filled with dmt.</v>

2426
01:52:48.730 --> 01:52:53.730
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the guy that you wrote about in </v>

2427
01:52:53.730 --> 01:52:53.730
<v Speaker 6>the what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is it called?</v>

2428

<v Speaker 6>They'll call,</v>

2430
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:57.120

<v Speaker 6>Your article was called high on crystal.</v>

2431
01:52:57.660 --> 01:53:01.230
<v Speaker 6>Crystal is what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A fucking crazy story.</v>

2432
01:53:01.450 --> 01:53:04.530
<v Speaker 6>If you haven't read that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a must read the other one.</v>

2433
01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:07.200
<v Speaker 6>The other thing we were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you were interviewing shogun was amazing</v>

2434
01:53:07.201 --> 01:53:08.820
<v Speaker 6>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you have to see this.</v>

2435
01:53:09.930 --> 01:53:14.930
<v Speaker 6>This girl was a stripper and she meets </v>
<v Speaker 6>this dude who's like this big time lsd </v>

2436
01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:21.140
<v Speaker 6>manufacturer who has a fucking house in </v>
<v Speaker 6>a silo and millions of dollars,</v>

2437
01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:26.600
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's rich as fuck and he's like the </v>

2438
01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:26.600
<v Speaker 6>number one lsd guy in the country</v>

2439
01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:31.710
<v Speaker 4>or so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's also unclear is another </v>

2440
01:53:31.710 --> 01:53:32.500
<v Speaker 4>example of a story where a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about it with an enormous amount of</v>

2441
01:53:32.501 --> 01:53:35.500
<v Speaker 4>confidence is if they have no </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of what happened and say,</v>

2442
01:53:35.501 --> 01:53:37.120
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all crystal Coles folder.</v>

2443
01:53:37.121 --> 01:53:42.121
<v Speaker 4>It's all x's falter wise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I've learned anything from </v>

2444
01:53:42.121 --> 01:53:45.480
<v Speaker 4>researching it over the course of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it said absolutely nothing is certain </v>

2445
01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:48.511
<v Speaker 4>about the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's incredibly complicated and there's </v>

2446
01:53:48.511 --> 01:53:51.541
<v Speaker 4>so much conflicting information for </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely every element of the story </v>

2447
01:53:51.541 --> 01:53:55.780
<v Speaker 4>that you have to be very careful about </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about what happened with </v>

2448
01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:58.320
<v Speaker 4>certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there was this lab and uh,</v>

2449
01:53:58.321 --> 01:54:02.350
<v Speaker 4>and they did crystal coal into it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she did become a part of it.</v>

2450
01:54:05.070 --> 01:54:07.680
<v Speaker 6>She took down the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2451
01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:11.370
<v Speaker 6>That's amazing what everyone was crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>girl.</v>

2452
01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:13.880
<v Speaker 6>Shamana Kalanick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Woo.</v>

2453
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:15.600
<v Speaker 6>It's just hundred that she did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2454
01:54:15.601 --> 01:54:19.920
<v Speaker 6>It's way harder than she did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I and stuck it up his ass.</v>

2455
01:54:19.921 --> 01:54:21.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't even care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why did it,</v>

2456
01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:25.500
<v Speaker 6>how to amazing story though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2457
01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:26.160
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2458
01:54:26.161 --> 01:54:28.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this girl escaped,</v>

2459
01:54:28.891 --> 01:54:33.891
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the dude came after and </v>

2460
01:54:33.891 --> 01:54:36.530
<v Speaker 6>kidnapped her and some other dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they escaped together to get away from </v>

2461
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:40.401
<v Speaker 6>this fucking crazy guy and it turns out </v>
<v Speaker 6>the guy was working with the FBI or the </v>

2462
01:54:40.401 --> 01:54:41.370
<v Speaker 6>Dea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's number one,</v>

2463
01:54:41.371 --> 01:54:45.930
<v Speaker 6>lsd dealers working with the dea and had</v>
<v Speaker 6>been for quite some time.</v>

2464
01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:47.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2465
01:54:47.970 --> 01:54:50.960
<v Speaker 6>that reminds me of a story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know who Whitey Bulger is?</v>

2466
01:54:50.970 --> 01:54:52.950
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know that store then from acid?</v>

2467
01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:53.430
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2468
01:54:53.431 --> 01:54:55.260
<v Speaker 6>You're from Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What an amazing story.</v>

2469
01:54:55.261 --> 01:55:00.261
<v Speaker 6>For people that don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whitey bulger was the head of the Irish </v>

2470
01:55:00.261 --> 01:55:02.901
<v Speaker 6>mob and he was also working for the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so if you turned Whitey bulger in Whitey</v>

2471
01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:05.760
<v Speaker 6>bulger would know from the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

2472
01:55:05.761 --> 01:55:10.761
<v Speaker 6>they wouldn't arrest him and then he </v>
<v Speaker 6>would kill you and that's really how it </v>

2473
01:55:10.761 --> 01:55:10.761
<v Speaker 6>ran.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2474
01:55:10.761 --> 01:55:12.780
<v Speaker 6>they really did run it like that and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>find that out and you go,</v>

2475
01:55:12.810 --> 01:55:16.560
<v Speaker 6>that is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is essentially along the same lines</v>

2476
01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:17.910
<v Speaker 6>and things like</v>

2477
01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:21.690
<v Speaker 4>it's been happening for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both in the US and internationally.</v>

2478
01:55:22.210 --> 01:55:27.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the Iran Contra is with this </v>

2479
01:55:27.210 --> 01:55:30.561
<v Speaker 4>whole scandal about them pumping cocaine</v>
<v Speaker 4>into ghettos in America to create the </v>

2480
01:55:30.691 --> 01:55:33.330
<v Speaker 4>crack problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that it's necessarily true,</v>

2481
01:55:33.331 --> 01:55:38.331
<v Speaker 4>but it's a theory that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>have and the same thing happened in </v>

2482
01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:38.910
<v Speaker 4>South Africa with with methaqualone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with quaaludes.</v>

2483
01:55:39.090 --> 01:55:44.090
<v Speaker 4>There was this whole project called </v>
<v Speaker 4>project coast where they were </v>

2484
01:55:44.090 --> 01:55:47.390
<v Speaker 4>synthesizing massive quantities of Mgma </v>
<v Speaker 4>and quail ludes in order to weaponize </v>

2485
01:55:47.881 --> 01:55:52.881
<v Speaker 4>them for crowd control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supposedly they were pumping them all </v>

2486
01:55:52.881 --> 01:55:55.020
<v Speaker 4>into the streets and now the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>MTMA weapons is a crowd control.</v>

2487
01:55:55.140 --> 01:56:00.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you would blast the crowd with </v>

2488
01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:00.140
<v Speaker 4>ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2489
01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:00.210
<v Speaker 4>it's called project coast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a brilliant idea.</v>

2490
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:03.840
<v Speaker 4>Where do I sign up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my bit about how to calm down the</v>

2491
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.230
<v Speaker 4>Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a bit.</v>

2492
01:56:04.231 --> 01:56:09.231
<v Speaker 4>I did about sending crop duster planes </v>
<v Speaker 4>just fucking cover the Middle East with </v>

2493
01:56:09.231 --> 01:56:10.320
<v Speaker 4>chronic smoke for just weeks.</v>

2494
01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:15.120
<v Speaker 4>And then they did that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually weaponized thc.</v>

2495
01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:20.180
<v Speaker 4>They did at at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the craziest James Gyms.</v>

2496
01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.060
<v Speaker 4>There's a crazy sentence ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weaponized Tac.</v>

2497
01:56:24.450 --> 01:56:26.280
<v Speaker 4>They called it like red oil or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2498
01:56:26.281 --> 01:56:30.180
<v Speaker 4>That was like the code name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it do?</v>

2499
01:56:30.181 --> 01:56:31.530
<v Speaker 4>You spray it on people and they become </v>
<v Speaker 4>high.</v>

2500
01:56:31.531 --> 01:56:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2501
01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.020
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Edgewood arsenal,</v>

2502
01:56:34.021 --> 01:56:35.570
<v Speaker 4>that's the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2503
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it probably,</v>

2504
01:56:37.801 --> 01:56:42.801
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was not a visit improvement because </v>

2505
01:56:42.801 --> 01:56:44.450
<v Speaker 4>it's a nonlethal incapacitating agent </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2506
01:56:44.490 --> 01:56:48.600
<v Speaker 4>if you have a choice between shooting </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone and dusting them with Thc,</v>

2507
01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:51.540
<v Speaker 4>dad's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe that was a real product.</v>

2508
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:52.650
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2509
01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:57.390
<v Speaker 4>What else can they trust you with MDM </v>
<v Speaker 4>TAC and they try LSD as well.</v>

2510
01:56:57.391 --> 01:57:02.391
<v Speaker 4>I mean the problem is also that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical properties of these different </v>

2511
01:57:02.391 --> 01:57:05.241
<v Speaker 4>drugs that limit their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their ability to travel through the air </v>

2512
01:57:05.241 --> 01:57:09.090
<v Speaker 4>to maintain their potency when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>laid on surfaces around the soil.</v>

2513
01:57:09.090 --> 01:57:12.330
<v Speaker 4>LSD is pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a stable molecule.</v>

2514
01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:13.680
<v Speaker 4>So when they were trying to weaponize </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2515
01:57:13.681 --> 01:57:14.750
<v Speaker 4>one of the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2516
01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:18.540
<v Speaker 4>it didn't aerosolized well it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>last on service as well.</v>

2517
01:57:18.541 --> 01:57:22.680
<v Speaker 4>And then they settled on bz because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought it was a better chemical weapon.</v>

2518
01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:28.020
<v Speaker 4>Bz what is bz?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a anticholinergic drug like Jacob's</v>

2519
01:57:28.021 --> 01:57:30.720
<v Speaker 4>ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The movie Jacob's ladder is really?</v>

2520
01:57:30.721 --> 01:57:35.721
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they really were trying to make lsd </v>

2521
01:57:35.721 --> 01:57:35.721
<v Speaker 4>and use it as a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2522
01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:36.990
<v Speaker 4>What was the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2523
01:57:36.991 --> 01:57:41.991
<v Speaker 4>what was it going to do to the troops?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to make them disoriented and you </v>

2524
01:57:41.991 --> 01:57:41.991
<v Speaker 4>just take them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2525
01:57:41.991 --> 01:57:41.991
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2526
01:57:41.991 --> 01:57:46.011
<v Speaker 4>can you imagine if you discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't know anything about </v>

2527
01:57:46.011 --> 01:57:46.440
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics at all and discovered LSD </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they.</v>

2528
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:48.090
<v Speaker 4>They tried absolutely everything they </v>
<v Speaker 4>could with it.</v>

2529
01:57:48.091 --> 01:57:50.220
<v Speaker 4>They tried to see if they could use it </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a truth serum.</v>

2530
01:57:50.490 --> 01:57:53.220
<v Speaker 4>They tried to see if they could use it </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

2531
01:57:54.150 --> 01:57:59.150
<v Speaker 4>They tried to both good and bad uses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were scientists using it to </v>

2532
01:57:59.150 --> 01:58:03.080
<v Speaker 4>increase their intelligence and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there were people trying to get use it </v>

2533
01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:04.500
<v Speaker 4>as to make people insane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to reprogram people's brains.</v>

2534
01:58:04.501 --> 01:58:07.440
<v Speaker 4>That was the large part of the MK Ultra </v>
<v Speaker 4>was about,</v>

2535
01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:13.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>manipulating people's minds using </v>

2536
01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:13.580
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics and sensory deprivation and</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

2537
01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:17.760
<v Speaker 4>And it was just crazy trial and error by</v>
<v Speaker 4>murderers.</v>

2538
01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:21.900
<v Speaker 4>That's how they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trial and error by Nixon's people.</v>

2539
01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:24.270
<v Speaker 4>They should make it into a steam ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine man,</v>

2540
01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:29.630
<v Speaker 4>trial and error with Lsd by Nixon's </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and supposedly the word trip </v>

2541
01:58:29.630 --> 01:58:33.980
<v Speaker 4>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like FBI lingo from when they </v>

2542
01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:34.680
<v Speaker 4>were doing the experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2543
01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:39.740
<v Speaker 4>The scariest thing that I've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to any psychedelic </v>

2544
01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:42.501
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was that Timothy leary was </v>

2545
01:58:42.501 --> 01:58:42.501
<v Speaker 4>connected or not Timothy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

2546
01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:47.730
<v Speaker 2>the unit Barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Kaczynski was connected to a some </v>

2547
01:58:47.730 --> 01:58:51.511
<v Speaker 2>studies at Harvard and he had done like </v>
<v Speaker 2>some classified lsd studies and they,</v>

2548
01:58:52.450 --> 01:58:53.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2549
01:58:53.321 --> 01:58:55.300
<v Speaker 2>they tweaked a lot of people's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

2550
01:58:55.560 --> 01:59:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Then he went back to Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I taught math for a few years till he </v>

2551
01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:03.421
<v Speaker 2>got enough money to buy that cabin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take on the technology they might have </v>

2552
01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:05.100
<v Speaker 2>fried that dude's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

2553
01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:08.610
<v Speaker 2>They were love automizing people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing just unbelievable.</v>

2554
01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And if you're familiar with the book </v>
<v Speaker 2>acid dreams we had,</v>

2555
01:59:10.771 --> 01:59:14.600
<v Speaker 2>they did every imaginable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hookup people to ids with stimulant,</v>

2556
01:59:14.601 --> 01:59:19.601
<v Speaker 2>like amphetamine in one wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're the second person in a week </v>

2557
01:59:19.601 --> 01:59:20.680
<v Speaker 2>that's direct recommended acid dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to go get that now.</v>

2558
01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Let's read the first half of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's all about mk ultra different </v>

2559
01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:29.851
<v Speaker 2>experiences that they tried to important</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with lsd and it's about.</v>

2560
01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

2561
01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:33.760
<v Speaker 2>all of these attempts to weaponize LSD </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to use it as a truth.</v>

2562
01:59:33.761 --> 01:59:38.761
<v Speaker 2>Sarah and mk ultra buying it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2563
01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:42.850
<v Speaker 2>it's an old book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been around since the eighties.</v>

2564
01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:44.480
<v Speaker 2>You've heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2565
01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:45.410
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2566
01:59:45.870 --> 01:59:49.790
<v Speaker 2>it's supposedly an urban myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a French town that they dosed.</v>

2567
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is true.</v>

2568
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:53.180
<v Speaker 2>So they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2569
01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:59.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's more recent research that </v>
<v Speaker 2>came up in the last maybe in the last </v>

2570
01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:03.001
<v Speaker 2>five years I had read it and then I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>read a counterpoint that said it was </v>

2571
02:00:03.001 --> 02:00:05.650
<v Speaker 2>bullshit because you can't even get acid</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work in bread like that,</v>

2572
02:00:05.651 --> 02:00:07.780
<v Speaker 2>that they wouldn't maintain itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

2573
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't,</v>

2574
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:13.860
<v Speaker 2>it would not survive the heating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they could've added it afterwards </v>

2575
02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:14.380
<v Speaker 2>and they supposedly they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2576
02:00:14.381 --> 02:00:15.080
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2577
02:00:15.081 --> 02:00:16.360
<v Speaker 2>So when they have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2578
02:00:16.361 --> 02:00:19.360
<v Speaker 2>how would you go about getting that acid</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the bread?</v>

2579
02:00:19.810 --> 02:00:24.810
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to get a CIA guy who works </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and just just fucks with </v>

2580
02:00:24.810 --> 02:00:24.810
<v Speaker 2>everybody's bread and squirts it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead eat that.</v>

2581
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2582
02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:28.300
<v Speaker 2>you could spray Brad with LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2583
02:00:28.301 --> 02:00:30.070
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an interesting argument when I,</v>

2584
02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:32.020
<v Speaker 2>when I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had to assume that it was true</v>

2585
02:00:32.021 --> 02:00:33.340
<v Speaker 2>and I was like saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2586
02:00:33.341 --> 02:00:38.341
<v Speaker 2>look what they found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I saw this counter point to it </v>

2587
02:00:38.341 --> 02:00:38.341
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2588
02:00:38.341 --> 02:00:38.341
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that they have,</v>

2589
02:00:38.341 --> 02:00:43.020
<v Speaker 2>could have created a more stable form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>LSD or could it be some other </v>

2590
02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.680
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic that would have similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects that would be stable?</v>

2591
02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2592
02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:46.620
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

2593
02:00:46.650 --> 02:00:51.650
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of psychedelics that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were testing at that time that are more </v>

2594
02:00:51.650 --> 02:00:54.350
<v Speaker 2>stable than LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>LSD is unusually in stable,</v>

2595
02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.780
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2596
02:00:58.781 --> 02:01:03.781
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they recovered some </v>

2597
02:01:03.781 --> 02:01:03.781
<v Speaker 2>communication between two operatives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said like,</v>

2598
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:07.240
<v Speaker 2>did you finish the mission with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>diastal I it or something.</v>

2599
02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:11.620
<v Speaker 2>You didn't specifically say Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they used some abbreviated form.</v>

2600
02:01:11.621 --> 02:01:14.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's not conclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that there's strong evidence</v>

2601
02:01:14.981 --> 02:01:19.981
<v Speaker 2>that that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would think that if they knew of </v>

2602
02:01:19.981 --> 02:01:23.330
<v Speaker 2>that it would have monstrous effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have to know whether or not </v>

2603
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:24.270
<v Speaker 2>there's something that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>monetarily.</v>

2604
02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they did that.</v>

2605
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:26.470
<v Speaker 2>They want it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted,</v>

2606
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:31.570
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like such a powerful thing </v>

2607
02:01:31.570 --> 02:01:34.621
<v Speaker 2>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to find out what it's </v>

2608
02:01:34.621 --> 02:01:34.621
<v Speaker 2>capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of just let it go.</v>

2609
02:01:34.621 --> 02:01:38.220
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to like try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>crack the code and apparently they were </v>

2610
02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:39.450
<v Speaker 2>like spraying it into the New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>subway system.</v>

2611
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.020
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2612
02:01:42.030 --> 02:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2613
02:01:42.411 --> 02:01:45.420
<v Speaker 2>they had an entire CIA or house where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were taking.</v>

2614
02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's operation midnight.</v>

2615
02:01:46.851 --> 02:01:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Climax in San Francisco and New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two different whorehouses.</v>

2616
02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:53.030
<v Speaker 2>That's an amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that story.</v>

2617
02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>You gotTa Google that folks because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

2618
02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:57.710
<v Speaker 2>They ran brothels where they dosed </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes.</v>

2619
02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just killing in there for some sexual </v>

2620
02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:03.710
<v Speaker 2>relief just to just take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take his mind off.</v>

2621
02:02:03.711 --> 02:02:05.660
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2622
02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:07.580
<v Speaker 2>would you like to drink honey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2623
02:02:07.581 --> 02:02:09.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said Jack and coke or do me great</v>

2624
02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:13.400
<v Speaker 2>jack and coke with acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

2625
02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:16.570
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really didn't know them.</v>

2626
02:02:16.650 --> 02:02:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably had an idea,</v>

2627
02:02:17.961 --> 02:02:22.961
<v Speaker 2>but there was the anthropological </v>
<v Speaker 2>reports of what Indians do when they </v>

2628
02:02:22.961 --> 02:02:23.360
<v Speaker 2>take pod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had no idea how.</v>

2629
02:02:23.361 --> 02:02:28.361
<v Speaker 2>Just some businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well apparently they started doing it </v>

2630
02:02:28.361 --> 02:02:31.511
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stopped getting people that are </v>

2631
02:02:31.511 --> 02:02:34.481
<v Speaker 2>willing to sign up for their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the voluntary tests that too many </v>

2632
02:02:34.671 --> 02:02:38.150
<v Speaker 2>people were getting fucked up by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests and so this is what I had read was</v>

2633
02:02:38.151 --> 02:02:41.930
<v Speaker 2>that they switched to a dosing people </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they ran out of volunteers.</v>

2634
02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine they would have had </v>

2635
02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:48.020
<v Speaker 2>volunteers especially later on in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs and they were becoming publicly</v>

2636
02:02:48.050 --> 02:02:50.860
<v Speaker 2>known substances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet a lot of the early research,</v>

2637
02:02:50.900 --> 02:02:55.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a book called drugs and fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's just people being dosed with </v>

2638
02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:58.130
<v Speaker 2>PCP and I think the France one was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>51 or something like that,</v>

2639
02:02:58.131 --> 02:02:59.710
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just something.</v>

2640
02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really terrifying to think they </v>

2641
02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:05.480
<v Speaker 2>actually did do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe it.</v>

2642
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:08.840
<v Speaker 2>The downs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole town.</v>

2643
02:03:09.170 --> 02:03:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know nuts.</v>

2644
02:03:12.650 --> 02:03:17.650
<v Speaker 2>You've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen the videos of them dousing </v>

2645
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:17.650
<v Speaker 2>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2646
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:20.351
<v Speaker 2>If she ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I believe it was the English </v>

2647
02:03:20.351 --> 02:03:22.121
<v Speaker 2>army know they just wandering around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing and people died in that </v>

2648
02:03:22.121 --> 02:03:22.790
<v Speaker 2>French town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2649
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:26.330
<v Speaker 2>didn't he commit suicide?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People jumped off bridges.</v>

2650
02:03:26.331 --> 02:03:27.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's the same kind of stuff that</v>

2651
02:03:27.831 --> 02:03:31.280
<v Speaker 2>happens today with psychedelics for </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain people respond badly and want to</v>

2652
02:03:31.281 --> 02:03:32.390
<v Speaker 2>jump off of things.</v>

2653
02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you support the theory that that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cause of the Salem witch trials and </v>

2654
02:03:37.671 --> 02:03:40.610
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff that it was an Erg got </v>
<v Speaker 2>infection.</v>

2655
02:03:42.090 --> 02:03:44.150
<v Speaker 2>You know that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that story?</v>

2656
02:03:45.230 --> 02:03:50.230
<v Speaker 2>I know that they claim that which brooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>or an implement for vaginally </v>

2657
02:03:50.230 --> 02:03:52.900
<v Speaker 2>administering scopolamine and atrophying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of these fronts.</v>

2658
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Delirium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ vaginally,</v>

2659
02:03:55.971 --> 02:04:00.470
<v Speaker 2>distributing with a pole that seems so </v>
<v Speaker 2>crude and uncreative.</v>

2660
02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:05.560
<v Speaker 2>That's one idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know about or God in </v>

2661
02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:05.560
<v Speaker 2>witches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2662
02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

2663
02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2664
02:04:07.341 --> 02:04:09.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2665
02:04:09.230 --> 02:04:09.930
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2666
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:11.780
<v Speaker 2>a fungus apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2667
02:04:11.781 --> 02:04:16.781
<v Speaker 2>I know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And apparently it has some psychoactive </v>

2668
02:04:16.781 --> 02:04:17.510
<v Speaker 2>effects and they didn't get like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>poisoning from it and then give you some</v>

2669
02:04:17.511 --> 02:04:22.511
<v Speaker 2>sort of a psychoactive effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they thought it was responsible for </v>

2670
02:04:22.511 --> 02:04:22.511
<v Speaker 2>a graph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2671
02:04:22.511 --> 02:04:23.690
<v Speaker 2>They thought it could have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for people that thought they</v>

2672
02:04:23.691 --> 02:04:25.990
<v Speaker 2>were experiencing magic and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucinating.</v>

2673
02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:26.510
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2674
02:04:26.511 --> 02:04:28.190
<v Speaker 2>getting fucked up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2675
02:04:28.191 --> 02:04:30.650
<v Speaker 2>and they could've started blaming it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

2676
02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:31.580
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which do,</v>

2677
02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:36.860
<v Speaker 2>you can't get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're all fucked up on this crazy </v>

2678
02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:36.860
<v Speaker 2>bread is Erg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got,</v>

2679
02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently if you've</v>

2680
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:40.080
<v Speaker 6>never heard of or got being psychotic.</v>

2681
02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

2682
02:04:40.711 --> 02:04:40.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2683
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:41.550
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2684
02:04:41.551 --> 02:04:44.990
<v Speaker 4>And that's really what is the effect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what is the effect of or got like,</v>

2685
02:04:45.110 --> 02:04:47.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it contains just a variety of these</v>

2686
02:04:47.401 --> 02:04:50.760
<v Speaker 4>different ergo line substances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's lysergic acid,</v>

2687
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 4>amides and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2688
02:04:53.191 --> 02:04:56.700
<v Speaker 4>and they were used medicinally for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a very long time.</v>

2689
02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:01.760
<v Speaker 4>That was the reason that lsd was </v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered is because they were using </v>

2690
02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:05.540
<v Speaker 4>these isolating different alkaloids from</v>
<v Speaker 4>or got Sclerosia and trying to see if </v>

2691
02:05:05.731 --> 02:05:10.731
<v Speaker 4>they had some use in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in preventing postpartum bleeding in </v>

2692
02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:12.980
<v Speaker 4>pregnant women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

2693
02:05:13.050 --> 02:05:18.050
<v Speaker 4>so it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they weren't investigating psychoactive </v>

2694
02:05:18.050 --> 02:05:19.350
<v Speaker 4>drugs that had some interest in using </v>
<v Speaker 4>them as potential analytics,</v>

2695
02:05:19.351 --> 02:05:21.480
<v Speaker 4>like drugs to reduce fatigue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was this one,</v>

2696
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:26.600
<v Speaker 4>nootropic hydro gene was produced by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Albert Hoffman in the course of that </v>

2697
02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:30.951
<v Speaker 4>study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they certainly weren't looking for </v>

2698
02:05:30.951 --> 02:05:30.951
<v Speaker 4>anything like LSD,</v>

2699
02:05:30.951 --> 02:05:31.470
<v Speaker 6>wasn't lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was.</v>

2700
02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:36.500
<v Speaker 6>There were some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people that they were looking for </v>

2701
02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:38.130
<v Speaker 6>something to make women more fertile or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something along those lines.</v>

2702
02:05:38.910 --> 02:05:43.910
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck that I read to something </v>
<v Speaker 6>that would encourage women to ovulate?</v>

2703
02:05:45.181 --> 02:05:47.580
<v Speaker 6>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did I read nonsense?</v>

2704
02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:49.410
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it happens all the time.</v>

2705
02:05:49.411 --> 02:05:51.420
<v Speaker 6>It's out of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hate that.</v>

2706
02:05:51.421 --> 02:05:54.420
<v Speaker 6>I hate when I have a thought that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>can't wrap my head around.</v>

2707
02:05:54.421 --> 02:05:56.310
<v Speaker 6>There's too much goddamn information </v>
<v Speaker 6>online.</v>

2708
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2709
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:59.500
<v Speaker 4>But that happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in medical,</v>

2710
02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:03.330
<v Speaker 4>they'll be trying to create for one </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and wow,</v>

2711
02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:05.650
<v Speaker 4>that's the story of Viagra probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>drove to keep them,</v>

2712
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:06.350
<v Speaker 4>to stop them.</v>

2713
02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:10.380
<v Speaker 6>Bitchin I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2714
02:06:10.381 --> 02:06:11.490
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what it is.</v>

2715
02:06:11.970 --> 02:06:16.970
<v Speaker 6>Let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you're a rational guy that does </v>

2716
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:17.070
<v Speaker 6>the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're obviously very well read.</v>

2717
02:06:17.130 --> 02:06:22.130
<v Speaker 6>You know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Clearly when you have an intense I could</v>

2718
02:06:22.531 --> 02:06:27.531
<v Speaker 6>delegate experience and when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience what seems to be something </v>

2719
02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:35.900
<v Speaker 6>that is not you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something that you're interacting with </v>

2720
02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:36.480
<v Speaker 6>that does not appear to be the </v>
<v Speaker 6>imagination.</v>

2721
02:06:37.170 --> 02:06:39.030
<v Speaker 6>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2722
02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:44.450
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people have interesting </v>

2723
02:06:44.450 --> 02:06:48.050
<v Speaker 6>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people that have seen real </v>

2724
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:49.140
<v Speaker 6>intense psychedelic visions have very </v>
<v Speaker 6>interesting opinions and you,</v>

2725
02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:54.500
<v Speaker 6>you might be the most psychedelically </v>
<v Speaker 6>traveled person I've ever met in my </v>

2726
02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:55.290
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's a perfect combination for you to</v>

2727
02:06:55.291 --> 02:06:57.810
<v Speaker 6>be the guy that answers that question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is going on?</v>

2728
02:06:57.870 --> 02:07:00.540
<v Speaker 6>When you have an intense psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience,</v>

2729
02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:05.570
<v Speaker 6>is it just chemicals perturbing your </v>
<v Speaker 6>natural brain state?</v>

2730
02:07:05.650 --> 02:07:05.960
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

2731
02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:07.380
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it is,</v>

2732
02:07:07.381 --> 02:07:12.381
<v Speaker 4>but st just chemical chemicals is </v>
<v Speaker 4>already kind of problematic because </v>

2733
02:07:12.381 --> 02:07:12.381
<v Speaker 4>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's just chemicals.</v>

2734
02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:17.660
<v Speaker 4>Chemicals is absolutely everything you </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever experienced and remember </v>

2735
02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:18.300
<v Speaker 4>remembering I've ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so everything is a chemical phenomenon.</v>

2736
02:07:18.450 --> 02:07:23.450
<v Speaker 4>Consciousness as a chemical phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact they were able to perceive any </v>

2737
02:07:23.450 --> 02:07:24.210
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll have this conversation right now.</v>

2738
02:07:24.211 --> 02:07:26.570
<v Speaker 4>It's all an amazing chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>interactions,</v>

2739
02:07:26.571 --> 02:07:31.571
<v Speaker 4>so I don't see the need to bring in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of supernatural interpretation of </v>

2740
02:07:31.681 --> 02:07:35.530
<v Speaker 4>the phenomenon because it just is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily the same reason that I don't</v>

2741
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:41.040
<v Speaker 2>see the need to bring in a supernatural </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of the universe or or of </v>

2742
02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:42.940
<v Speaker 2>anything else or even ghosts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2743
02:07:42.941 --> 02:07:45.790
<v Speaker 2>you can look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at a ghost haunting,</v>

2744
02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:47.200
<v Speaker 2>you can look at it two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

2745
02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:52.380
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a weird supernatural </v>

2746
02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:52.380
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say this was a really weird</v>

2747
02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:56.250
<v Speaker 2>moment of psychopathology and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological mechanism may this person </v>

2748
02:07:56.250 --> 02:08:00.540
<v Speaker 2>so afraid that they hallucinated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought they heard something or thought </v>

2749
02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:00.680
<v Speaker 2>they saw another being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is equally fascinating,</v>

2750
02:08:00.681 --> 02:08:05.681
<v Speaker 2>if not more fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or there's a dude who didn't get enough </v>

2751
02:08:05.681 --> 02:08:08.551
<v Speaker 2>attention from his parents or pretends </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see God is in the basement and watch </v>

2752
02:08:08.551 --> 02:08:11.230
<v Speaker 2>a show with night vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be the case too.</v>

2753
02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost feel like that's the.</v>

2754
02:08:13.230 --> 02:08:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Like the lesser interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the easy way.</v>

2755
02:08:16.850 --> 02:08:17.980
<v Speaker 2>It's much easier to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2756
02:08:17.981 --> 02:08:18.770
<v Speaker 2>they're aliens.</v>

2757
02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:23.770
<v Speaker 2>That's very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you actually wonder what is </v>

2758
02:08:23.770 --> 02:08:25.660
<v Speaker 2>the true biochemical basis of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>

2759
02:08:25.661 --> 02:08:28.960
<v Speaker 2>it's an incredibly complicated question </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it won't have a simple answer,</v>

2760
02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:31.750
<v Speaker 2>but that's why it's a worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

2761
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that it's possible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking something along the lines of Bmt </v>

2762
02:08:37.211 --> 02:08:41.680
<v Speaker 2>or any really intense psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually opens up some sort of a door to</v>

2763
02:08:41.681 --> 02:08:43.990
<v Speaker 2>another dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another place,</v>

2764
02:08:43.991 --> 02:08:48.991
<v Speaker 2>another exist in something that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience another frequency and other </v>

2765
02:08:48.991 --> 02:08:50.890
<v Speaker 2>station on the dial?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think other dimensions of yourself,</v>

2766
02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:55.920
<v Speaker 2>certainly I don't know that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>another physical dimension that you are </v>

2767
02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:56.200
<v Speaker 2>accessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't.</v>

2768
02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any reason to believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's enough inside of all of </v>

2769
02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:04.111
<v Speaker 2>us to account for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think that when you have this </v>

2770
02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:09.160
<v Speaker 2>incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like massive visual experience,</v>

2771
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:14.310
<v Speaker 2>it's all an imagined Tory thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like your consciousness travels</v>

2772
02:09:15.221 --> 02:09:17.950
<v Speaker 2>to a place more tunes into a frequency.</v>

2773
02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:20.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that.</v>

2774
02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:25.020
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's just a chemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction but in incredibly fascinating,</v>

2775
02:09:25.091 --> 02:09:28.870
<v Speaker 2>accomplished or chemical and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not arguing with you.</v>

2776
02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:30.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sold on what the hell it is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>

2777
02:09:30.691 --> 02:09:35.691
<v Speaker 2>I've had that argument with people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really almost like they almost </v>

2778
02:09:35.691 --> 02:09:37.260
<v Speaker 2>proselytize about the experience to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where they're,</v>

2779
02:09:37.330 --> 02:09:42.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about like as if it's a </v>

2780
02:09:42.330 --> 02:09:42.330
<v Speaker 2>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a religious,</v>

2781
02:09:42.330 --> 02:09:42.330
<v Speaker 2>definite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2782
02:09:42.330 --> 02:09:43.570
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens.</v>

2783
02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:45.190
<v Speaker 2>And I've always said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2784
02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:47.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also possible.</v>

2785
02:09:47.591 --> 02:09:52.591
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean it's not spiritual </v>

2786
02:09:52.591 --> 02:09:52.591
<v Speaker 2>spiritual benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

2787
02:09:52.591 --> 02:09:57.450
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't have a religious experience </v>

2788
02:09:57.450 --> 02:09:57.450
<v Speaker 2>or they can't interpret it however they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

2789
02:09:57.450 --> 02:10:00.580
<v Speaker 2>but I sure the interaction is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the interaction is beautiful,</v>

2790
02:10:00.581 --> 02:10:03.880
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to be other worldly for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be defined.</v>

2791
02:10:04.330 --> 02:10:05.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interaction is beautiful.</v>

2792
02:10:05.741 --> 02:10:08.380
<v Speaker 2>It could set you off on another </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

2793
02:10:08.381 --> 02:10:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Rewire your board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2794
02:10:10.421 --> 02:10:15.421
<v Speaker 2>how many people have you ever talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have had a big psychedelic </v>

2795
02:10:15.421 --> 02:10:15.850
<v Speaker 2>experience and totally stopped doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>pills,</v>

2796
02:10:15.851 --> 02:10:20.851
<v Speaker 2>are totally stopped smoking cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 2>or just completely rewired their life </v>

2797
02:10:20.851 --> 02:10:23.410
<v Speaker 2>because of one like emphatic psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 2>rewiring.</v>

2798
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2799
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2800
02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.020
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that you think.</v>

2801
02:10:29.110 --> 02:10:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

2802
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

2803
02:10:31.151 --> 02:10:33.870
<v Speaker 2>just the chemical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just something to be careful with</v>

2804
02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:35.250
<v Speaker 4>and when interpreting things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2805
02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:36.250
<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a chemical.</v>

2806
02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:36.730
<v Speaker 4>Everything is just,</v>

2807
02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:39.550
<v Speaker 6>I sound too dumb to be talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 6>first place.</v>

2808
02:10:39.570 --> 02:10:42.350
<v Speaker 6>I'm just trying to skate by with my </v>
<v Speaker 6>limited knowledge I have,</v>

2809
02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:47.360
<v Speaker 6>but I want to pick your brain so when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you experience like really profound </v>

2810
02:10:49.130 --> 02:10:53.810
<v Speaker 6>wisdom in um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in psychedelic states or you have like,</v>

2811
02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:58.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this almost feeling of being analyzed </v>

2812
02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:01.451
<v Speaker 6>and like seeing through and shown all </v>
<v Speaker 6>your flaws and all your craziness and </v>

2813
02:11:01.451 --> 02:11:02.420
<v Speaker 6>then you have this sort of like a reset </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2814
02:11:02.421 --> 02:11:07.421
<v Speaker 6>We kind of get a new fresh perspective </v>
<v Speaker 6>of your place in the world and how </v>

2815
02:11:07.421 --> 02:11:07.810
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what kind of an energy,</v>

2816
02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:12.850
<v Speaker 6>what kind of vibe you're putting out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You think that that's all maybe </v>

2817
02:11:12.850 --> 02:11:12.850
<v Speaker 6>internal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's all.</v>

2818
02:11:12.850 --> 02:11:16.781
<v Speaker 6>Maybe imagination or is it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is there the potential that there is </v>

2819
02:11:16.781 --> 02:11:16.781
<v Speaker 6>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2820
02:11:16.781 --> 02:11:21.650
<v Speaker 6>another intelligence out there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's some sort of a thing that you </v>

2821
02:11:21.650 --> 02:11:25.541
<v Speaker 6>can tune into some sort of a way that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're connected to but we don't have </v>

2822
02:11:27.251 --> 02:11:30.440
<v Speaker 6>access on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that possible or is it silly?</v>

2823
02:11:30.690 --> 02:11:35.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason to believe that that </v>

2824
02:11:35.690 --> 02:11:40.131
<v Speaker 4>is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that there's all kinds of </v>

2825
02:11:40.131 --> 02:11:41.400
<v Speaker 4>things within us that we don't currently</v>
<v Speaker 4>acknowledged and understand.</v>

2826
02:11:41.401 --> 02:11:44.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean Shogun Shogun and Timothy leary </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about this idea,</v>

2827
02:11:44.521 --> 02:11:49.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all this noncoding DNA that's </v>

2828
02:11:49.521 --> 02:11:50.870
<v Speaker 4>sometimes called junk DNA or in Toronto </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dna and uh,</v>

2829
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.980
<v Speaker 4>and although it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were probably wrong about that.</v>

2830
02:11:53.981 --> 02:11:58.830
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't contain any kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>instinctual evolutionary knowledge,</v>

2831
02:11:58.831 --> 02:11:59.760
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was,</v>

2832
02:11:59.910 --> 02:12:04.910
<v Speaker 4>they were using it as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what if all this noncoding DNA </v>

2833
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:08.150
<v Speaker 4>contains instinctual ancient knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're able to access will or on </v>

2834
02:12:08.150 --> 02:12:08.280
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2835
02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:11.790
<v Speaker 4>but maybe not with specifically with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>noncoding DNA,</v>

2836
02:12:11.791 --> 02:12:16.791
<v Speaker 4>but with parts of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with who knows what sorts of things are </v>

2837
02:12:16.791 --> 02:12:16.920
<v Speaker 4>stored within us that we don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 4>to access.</v>

2838
02:12:16.921 --> 02:12:19.650
<v Speaker 4>I think that it is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientologist idea,</v>

2839
02:12:19.651 --> 02:12:24.651
<v Speaker 4>but I think that there's some truth to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that we remember absolutely </v>

2840
02:12:24.651 --> 02:12:25.760
<v Speaker 4>everything that we experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's all in there somewhere.</v>

2841
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:29.440
<v Speaker 4>You just need the right catalyst to </v>
<v Speaker 4>remove that piece of information.</v>

2842
02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:30.870
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

2843
02:12:30.970 --> 02:12:31.990
<v Speaker 6>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2844
02:12:31.991 --> 02:12:36.991
<v Speaker 6>sometimes someone will bring something </v>
<v Speaker 6>up and then all of sudden the file will </v>

2845
02:12:36.991 --> 02:12:36.991
<v Speaker 6>open up in your head and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2846
02:12:36.991 --> 02:12:37.690
<v Speaker 6>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where is he?</v>

2847
02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:39.480
<v Speaker 6>What has he been doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like boom,</v>

2848
02:12:39.610 --> 02:12:41.490
<v Speaker 6>all of a sudden some person who you </v>
<v Speaker 6>have,</v>

2849
02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:43.450
<v Speaker 6>I could have come up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you know of,</v>

2850
02:12:43.451 --> 02:12:44.720
<v Speaker 6>of Bruce Blah Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blah,</v>

2851
02:12:44.770 --> 02:12:45.430
<v Speaker 6>and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2852
02:12:45.431 --> 02:12:50.431
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea who that is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then somebody shows you a picture </v>

2853
02:12:50.431 --> 02:12:50.431
<v Speaker 6>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you remember this guy,</v>

2854
02:12:50.431 --> 02:12:50.431
<v Speaker 6>second grade,</v>
<v Speaker 6>remember?</v>

2855
02:12:50.431 --> 02:12:50.740
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

2856
02:12:50.741 --> 02:12:51.460
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

2857
02:12:51.461 --> 02:12:56.461
<v Speaker 6>click.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden the file's open and </v>

2858
02:12:56.461 --> 02:12:56.461
<v Speaker 6>you'll remember several experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might've had that person.</v>

2859
02:12:56.461 --> 02:12:59.470
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like we don't have enough </v>
<v Speaker 6>room for all the shit we're saying.</v>

2860
02:13:00.010 --> 02:13:05.010
<v Speaker 6>We just put stuff in shitty hard drives </v>
<v Speaker 6>and stuff in the closet and then every </v>

2861
02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:05.260
<v Speaker 6>now and then it comes out,</v>

2862
02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:05.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2863
02:13:05.891 --> 02:13:08.200
<v Speaker 4>it's like an indexing problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That information is there,</v>

2864
02:13:08.201 --> 02:13:09.790
<v Speaker 4>but we don't always know how to access </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2865
02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:12.390
<v Speaker 4>You remember that show taxing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2866
02:13:12.430 --> 02:13:13.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm familiar.</v>

2867
02:13:13.370 --> 02:13:18.370
<v Speaker 6>Marilu Henner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>remember the very attractive redhead </v>

2868
02:13:18.370 --> 02:13:18.370
<v Speaker 6>woman that was on that show?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2869
02:13:18.370 --> 02:13:20.000
<v Speaker 6>she's got some crazy memory thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was on stern show.</v>

2870
02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:23.150
<v Speaker 6>She can remember everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She has an insane memory.</v>

2871
02:13:23.151 --> 02:13:25.400
<v Speaker 6>Like she can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you can tell her,</v>

2872
02:13:25.401 --> 02:13:26.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>June 13th,</v>

2873
02:13:26.721 --> 02:13:27.920
<v Speaker 6>19,</v>
<v Speaker 6>76.</v>

2874
02:13:28.070 --> 02:13:29.110
<v Speaker 6>What were you wearing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was like,</v>

2875
02:13:29.111 --> 02:13:31.870
<v Speaker 6>I was wearing a blue dress and because I</v>
<v Speaker 6>was on my way to this and that it was.</v>

2876
02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:37.120
<v Speaker 2>And she'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she can tell you what the temperature </v>

2877
02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:37.120
<v Speaker 2>was outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can tell you everything.</v>

2878
02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:38.640
<v Speaker 2>She remembers everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2879
02:13:38.730 --> 02:13:39.540
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is possible.</v>

2880
02:13:39.541 --> 02:13:41.910
<v Speaker 2>It's very much in the size of a normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

2881
02:13:41.911 --> 02:13:46.911
<v Speaker 2>Those things are possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need giant brains and the size </v>

2882
02:13:46.911 --> 02:13:46.911
<v Speaker 2>of a normal head and she's not even a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nut.</v>

2883
02:13:46.911 --> 02:13:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Like she's like a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you talked to her.</v>

2884
02:13:48.901 --> 02:13:53.901
<v Speaker 2>She sounds normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't sound like some maladjusted </v>

2885
02:13:53.901 --> 02:13:54.510
<v Speaker 2>person with some incredible gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not like a rain man,</v>

2886
02:13:54.690 --> 02:13:56.520
<v Speaker 2>just like a normal human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2887
02:13:56.530 --> 02:13:58.230
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's lots of these new modernists</v>

2888
02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:03.260
<v Speaker 2>that are capable of those sorts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind feeds.</v>

2889
02:14:04.351 --> 02:14:09.351
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one interesting thing about the new </v>

2890
02:14:09.351 --> 02:14:09.351
<v Speaker 2>monitors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all seem to have synesthesia.</v>

2891
02:14:09.351 --> 02:14:10.710
<v Speaker 2>At least ones that I've read about and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2892
02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:16.040
<v Speaker 2>so when they remember something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a visual memory and an auditory </v>

2893
02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:19.821
<v Speaker 2>memory and all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all their memories are cross linked </v>

2894
02:14:19.821 --> 02:14:19.821
<v Speaker 2>over multiple sensory modalities.</v>

2895
02:14:19.821 --> 02:14:21.130
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2896
02:14:21.131 --> 02:14:21.510
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2897
02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:26.540
<v Speaker 2>and then there was a lot of research in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the seventies about potentially using </v>

2898
02:14:26.540 --> 02:14:30.201
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics as cognitive enhancers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one way that they could </v>

2899
02:14:30.201 --> 02:14:34.131
<v Speaker 2>function is by encouraging this type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>synesthetic thinking where you're </v>

2900
02:14:34.131 --> 02:14:36.630
<v Speaker 2>experiencing everything through multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>senses,</v>

2901
02:14:36.631 --> 02:14:39.690
<v Speaker 2>an indexing information through multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>senses simultaneously.</v>

2902
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:41.160
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial,</v>

2903
02:14:41.161 --> 02:14:43.110
<v Speaker 2>stoned ape theory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2904
02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:48.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any evidence for </v>

2905
02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:48.680
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's like a lot of parents,</v>

2906
02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:48.680
<v Speaker 2>we kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

2907
02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting and worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 2>and funny and sexy.</v>

2908
02:14:50.970 --> 02:14:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

2909
02:14:51.841 --> 02:14:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that he said everything that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

2910
02:14:53.581 --> 02:14:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it,</v>

2911
02:14:55.051 --> 02:14:56.640
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it's a little wonky.</v>

2912
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is,</v>

2913
02:14:57.511 --> 02:14:59.340
<v Speaker 2>but that's not much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2914
02:14:59.341 --> 02:15:01.080
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>

2915
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even the stuff that's Wonky,</v>

2916
02:15:03.421 --> 02:15:08.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm always willing to give him the </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit of the doubt that I just don't </v>

2917
02:15:08.421 --> 02:15:08.421
<v Speaker 2>see that he seen it.</v>

2918
02:15:08.421 --> 02:15:08.421
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2919
02:15:08.421 --> 02:15:11.400
<v Speaker 2>that's most science anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just people coming up with theories</v>

2920
02:15:11.401 --> 02:15:13.860
<v Speaker 2>and models and trying to improve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

2921
02:15:13.861 --> 02:15:15.720
<v Speaker 2>So he came up with a model or theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was wrong.</v>

2922
02:15:15.721 --> 02:15:18.570
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing bad about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just stoned ape theory.</v>

2923
02:15:18.571 --> 02:15:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Is it wrong as far as like the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>frame of,</v>

2924
02:15:22.321 --> 02:15:25.050
<v Speaker 2>of history and development?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like because that's what I've.</v>

2925
02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I think I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that he got his,</v>

2926
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:31.720
<v Speaker 2>his errors wrong or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2927
02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there was any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that primates eat mushrooms.</v>

2928
02:15:34.621 --> 02:15:36.600
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that.</v>

2929
02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the evidence that he was relying</v>

2930
02:15:39.151 --> 02:15:44.151
<v Speaker 2>on for that theory that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either it was LSD or psilocybin </v>

2931
02:15:44.151 --> 02:15:48.171
<v Speaker 2>increases visual acuity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that's been </v>

2932
02:15:48.171 --> 02:15:50.510
<v Speaker 2>definitively proven science that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed published in a prestigious </v>

2933
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.510
<v Speaker 2>journal at the time.</v>

2934
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that all of that research </v>
<v Speaker 2>was methodologically sound.</v>

2935
02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:53.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

2936
02:15:53.850 --> 02:15:58.850
<v Speaker 2>how the study works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think they only had like two </v>

2937
02:15:58.850 --> 02:15:58.850
<v Speaker 2>sticks that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't parallel lines,</v>

2938
02:15:58.850 --> 02:16:03.510
<v Speaker 2>and then they would have someone turning</v>
<v Speaker 2>one stick on the other side of extremely</v>

2939
02:16:03.511 --> 02:16:07.740
<v Speaker 2>slowly to the point where they would no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer be parallel.</v>

2940
02:16:07.890 --> 02:16:12.060
<v Speaker 2>And it was who could recognize that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first and the stone people recognized it</v>

2941
02:16:12.210 --> 02:16:15.430
<v Speaker 2>more than the nonstop people on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his,</v>

2942
02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:20.680
<v Speaker 2>his joke was that maybe being stoned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the world better than it really </v>

2943
02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:21.800
<v Speaker 2>is or better than you can when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sober.</v>

2944
02:16:21.810 --> 02:16:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2945
02:16:22.621 --> 02:16:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean it hasn't really been studied </v>
<v Speaker 2>very extensive.</v>

2946
02:16:24.611 --> 02:16:26.490
<v Speaker 2>So even though it was published,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could've been horseshit.</v>

2947
02:16:26.491 --> 02:16:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Like you would have to be replicated a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few times.</v>

2948
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2949
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.240
<v Speaker 5>it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2950
02:16:31.241 --> 02:16:31.980
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2951
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:33.740
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that seemed like a weird one too because</v>

2952
02:16:33.741 --> 02:16:35.290
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's going to take a little dose?</v>

2953
02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:36.930
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to have mushrooms you're</v>

2954
02:16:36.931 --> 02:16:41.931
<v Speaker 5>going to blast off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't see it being to the point </v>

2955
02:16:41.931 --> 02:16:42.910
<v Speaker 5>where you're going to take like a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>tiny doses of it so you can see better.</v>

2956
02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:45.010
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have the blast off thing,</v>

2957
02:16:45.011 --> 02:16:46.270
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2958
02:16:46.271 --> 02:16:49.180
<v Speaker 5>what if I just don't blast off?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if I just nibble,</v>

2959
02:16:49.181 --> 02:16:51.700
<v Speaker 5>nibble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nibble so I can barely feel it?</v>

2960
02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:54.040
<v Speaker 5>Who's going to do that to go hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

2961
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:56.370
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe they didn't even know that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could play for awhile.</v>

2962
02:16:56.530 --> 02:17:01.530
<v Speaker 5>Thinking Salvia people don't realize </v>
<v Speaker 5>until the nineties until they started </v>

2963
02:17:01.530 --> 02:17:02.410
<v Speaker 5>extracting it and making those extracts </v>
<v Speaker 5>publicly available.</v>

2964
02:17:02.470 --> 02:17:03.790
<v Speaker 5>People didn't really know their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2965
02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:04.760
<v Speaker 5>their chewing and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

2966
02:17:04.761 --> 02:17:09.761
<v Speaker 5>it is active,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they couldn't really characterize </v>

2967
02:17:09.761 --> 02:17:09.990
<v Speaker 5>the effect until he had concentrated the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Salvinorin a,</v>

2968
02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:15.240
<v Speaker 5>it is a trip that they look like dinner </v>
<v Speaker 5>plates to trip that they just grow out </v>

2969
02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:15.240
<v Speaker 5>of the ground.</v>

2970
02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:15.250
<v Speaker 5>They look like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2971
02:17:15.251 --> 02:17:19.140
<v Speaker 5>look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you know when mushrooms grow mean?</v>

2972
02:17:19.630 --> 02:17:24.630
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a green field and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>green grass and this white thing just </v>

2973
02:17:25.261 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here I am,</v>

2974
02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:28.930
<v Speaker 5>and it's like asking you to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2975
02:17:28.931 --> 02:17:30.460
<v Speaker 5>if there's anything that's ever asked </v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

2976
02:17:30.461 --> 02:17:33.190
<v Speaker 5>it's a polite and subtle color.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm white,</v>

2977
02:17:33.370 --> 02:17:35.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm so bland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't even worry.</v>

2978
02:17:35.711 --> 02:17:37.870
<v Speaker 5>Just come home and take a bite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2979
02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:43.650
<v Speaker 5>and the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they might have actually not even </v>

2980
02:17:43.650 --> 02:17:46.300
<v Speaker 5>from this planet and they might've come </v>
<v Speaker 5>here and asteroidal impacts.</v>

2981
02:17:46.330 --> 02:17:47.230
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2982
02:17:47.290 --> 02:17:49.140
<v Speaker 5>that's my favorite one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>

2983
02:17:49.170 --> 02:17:51.910
<v Speaker 5>my favorite sexy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2984
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:53.730
<v Speaker 5>that there's another mechanic theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2985
02:17:53.731 --> 02:17:56.620
<v Speaker 5>Whereas he or he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he supported the idea that,</v>

2986
02:17:56.621 --> 02:17:58.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said you would know this.</v>

2987
02:17:58.391 --> 02:17:59.420
<v Speaker 5>He said that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2988
02:17:59.890 --> 02:18:03.850
<v Speaker 5>silicide Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was no other plant that was our,</v>

2989
02:18:04.670 --> 02:18:08.050
<v Speaker 5>that had the four and the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 5>position or no other,</v>

2990
02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:11.230
<v Speaker 5>no other life form fungus that had that.</v>

2991
02:18:11.490 --> 02:18:16.490
<v Speaker 5>It was the only one except for </v>
<v Speaker 5>hydroxylation is unusual and there's a </v>

2992
02:18:16.490 --> 02:18:19.090
<v Speaker 5>lot of five in the plant kingdom for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>four is unusual.</v>

2993
02:18:19.510 --> 02:18:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Is there other other ones besides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not that I can think of off the top </v>

2994
02:18:26.981 --> 02:18:29.320
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So his theory in mushrooms,</v>

2995
02:18:29.350 --> 02:18:31.750
<v Speaker 5>there's sites didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>

2996
02:18:32.050 --> 02:18:34.390
<v Speaker 5>His theory was that that had come from </v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2997
02:18:34.391 --> 02:18:39.391
<v Speaker 5>an asteroid impact that sports could </v>
<v Speaker 5>survive in a vacuum when we know the </v>

2998
02:18:39.391 --> 02:18:41.680
<v Speaker 5>building blocks of life and amino acids </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibly came here from outer space.</v>

2999
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:44.870
<v Speaker 5>Maybe mushrooms that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was them.</v>

3000
02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:50.040
<v Speaker 5>They're communicating with you my plans </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

3001
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:52.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3002
02:18:52.631 --> 02:18:54.460
<v Speaker 5>He would buy the guy totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He meaning,</v>

3003
02:18:54.490 --> 02:18:57.580
<v Speaker 5>that's what made him write the timewave </v>
<v Speaker 5>zero novelty theory.</v>

3004
02:18:57.581 --> 02:18:58.270
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3005
02:18:58.450 --> 02:19:00.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they told him that he had to do it,</v>

3006
02:19:01.410 --> 02:19:06.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could you imagine how annoying would be </v>

3007
02:19:06.410 --> 02:19:06.410
<v Speaker 5>every time you went on a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3008
02:19:06.410 --> 02:19:08.010
<v Speaker 5>you got some fucking alien mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 5>people telling you,</v>

3009
02:19:08.011 --> 02:19:13.011
<v Speaker 5>you gotta write a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to write some biological </v>

3010
02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:13.011
<v Speaker 5>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

3011
02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:17.581
<v Speaker 5>you could not look anymore board who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening from now on foreheads and </v>

3012
02:19:17.581 --> 02:19:22.201
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cut you off before you went to five and </v>

3013
02:19:22.201 --> 02:19:22.201
<v Speaker 5>you can't handle five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think you can.</v>

3014
02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:26.290
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we got over the stoned ape theory.</v>

3015
02:19:26.350 --> 02:19:27.640
<v Speaker 5>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to ask you a</v>

3016
02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:31.200
<v Speaker 6>alien life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes or no.</v>

3017
02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:33.650
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3018
02:19:33.700 --> 02:19:38.700
<v Speaker 4>all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there just isn't enough evidence either </v>

3019
02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:41.821
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know that it's like a boring </v>

3020
02:19:41.821 --> 02:19:41.821
<v Speaker 4>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in some ways,</v>

3021
02:19:41.821 --> 02:19:41.821
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3022
02:19:41.821 --> 02:19:45.661
<v Speaker 4>people will say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always huge news when they find an </v>

3023
02:19:45.661 --> 02:19:46.810
<v Speaker 4>extra solar planet that might be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>support earth like life,</v>

3024
02:19:47.470 --> 02:19:50.770
<v Speaker 4>but so far they've never found anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the known universe,</v>

3025
02:19:50.771 --> 02:19:55.030
<v Speaker 4>a single planet that we could live on </v>
<v Speaker 4>without a suit for a minute.</v>

3026
02:19:56.380 --> 02:19:58.780
<v Speaker 4>So that's not really that encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately.</v>

3027
02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:04.140
<v Speaker 4>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then when you also factor in the </v>

3028
02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:04.140
<v Speaker 4>enormity of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then of course,</v>

3029
02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:05.350
<v Speaker 4>I think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

3030
02:20:05.351 --> 02:20:09.220
<v Speaker 4>I think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't see at this specific moment</v>

3031
02:20:09.221 --> 02:20:14.221
<v Speaker 4>in history any reason to think that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the part of the universe that we've </v>

3032
02:20:14.221 --> 02:20:15.310
<v Speaker 4>observed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's any life.</v>

3033
02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:20.520
<v Speaker 6>What do you think of the theory that </v>
<v Speaker 6>life does not come here in a physical </v>

3034
02:20:21.731 --> 02:20:23.980
<v Speaker 6>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but comes here through your mind in that</v>

3035
02:20:23.981 --> 02:20:28.981
<v Speaker 6>what psychedelics are is real like </v>
<v Speaker 6>gateways to communicate with other life </v>

3036
02:20:28.981 --> 02:20:33.691
<v Speaker 6>forms and that we were hung up on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea that something has to actually be </v>

3037
02:20:33.691 --> 02:20:36.640
<v Speaker 6>right there to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3038
02:20:36.890 --> 02:20:38.060
<v Speaker 6>wait something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The theory,</v>

3039
02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:43.120
<v Speaker 6>the theory is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And psychedelics opened up some sort of </v>

3040
02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:45.440
<v Speaker 6>a gateway that allows you to communicate</v>
<v Speaker 6>with aliens.</v>

3041
02:20:45.441 --> 02:20:50.441
<v Speaker 6>That's the only aliens have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are the aliens only exist in this </v>

3042
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:53.150
<v Speaker 6>is when you take a psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can communicate with it.</v>

3043
02:20:53.151 --> 02:20:56.860
<v Speaker 6>You can enter into some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>frequency that the alien is on.</v>

3044
02:20:56.900 --> 02:20:59.360
<v Speaker 6>That's the only way they get here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't get here through metal ships.</v>

3045
02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:01.430
<v Speaker 6>That's all just craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3046
02:21:01.431 --> 02:21:03.660
<v Speaker 6>alien contact only comes through </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics.</v>

3047
02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:05.450
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting idea</v>

3048
02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:12.540
<v Speaker 3>to what end are very dismissive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I believe,</v>

3049
02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:15.030
<v Speaker 3>I forget who was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3050
02:21:15.031 --> 02:21:15.050
<v Speaker 3>whose</v>

3051
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:16.650
<v Speaker 6>idea that was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there was a.</v>

3052
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:20.910
<v Speaker 6>God Damn it when the aliens or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 6>they watch when they're in our bodies.</v>

3053
02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:26.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might've been when Kennedy's idea as </v>

3054
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:26.030
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3055
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:26.030
<v Speaker 6>He had a lot of nutty ones abroad about </v>
<v Speaker 6>mushrooms.</v>

3056
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:29.781
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure it was him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but his idea was that it was an alien </v>

3057
02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:30.060
<v Speaker 6>life form.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then that's how you would,</v>

3058
02:21:30.090 --> 02:21:35.090
<v Speaker 6>you would communicate with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't think it was going to come </v>

3059
02:21:35.090 --> 02:21:37.341
<v Speaker 6>here and metal shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He thinks it was going to come here </v>

3060
02:21:37.341 --> 02:21:39.410
<v Speaker 6>through the frequency that you would </v>
<v Speaker 6>achieve heavy duty psychedelic state </v>

3061
02:21:39.410 --> 02:21:42.120
<v Speaker 6>that he believes he believes he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>really encountering something else.</v>

3062
02:21:42.490 --> 02:21:47.490
<v Speaker 6>You don't believe that you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You believe that it's just just the </v>

3063
02:21:47.490 --> 02:21:52.370
<v Speaker 6>deepest facets of your imagination or is</v>
<v Speaker 6>there a kashic records like do you </v>

3064
02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:53.430
<v Speaker 6>believe in any of that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>

3065
02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:54.780
<v Speaker 6>The ACACIA,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Acacia,</v>

3066
02:21:55.050 --> 02:21:55.900
<v Speaker 6>Acacia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Greg Kaushik.</v>

3067
02:21:56.520 --> 02:22:01.520
<v Speaker 6>The idea that there's knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 6>information out there and you just tune </v>

3068
02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:05.121
<v Speaker 6>into it and that there's a record of </v>
<v Speaker 6>information and like literally exists </v>

3069
02:22:05.121 --> 02:22:06.810
<v Speaker 6>that you can just tune into and this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>where creativity comes from.</v>

3070
02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:12.080
<v Speaker 6>The other in creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you teach eve the zen state of </v>

3071
02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:13.170
<v Speaker 6>being completely in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these ideas would just come to you.</v>

3072
02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:17.640
<v Speaker 6>The idea is that these ideas are not </v>
<v Speaker 6>just the firing of your synapses and the</v>

3073
02:22:17.641 --> 02:22:22.641
<v Speaker 6>accumulation of your life experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in fact you are pulling from a well </v>

3074
02:22:22.641 --> 02:22:27.050
<v Speaker 6>of information that's out there that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>can't quite recognized a regular basis </v>

3075
02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:31.520
<v Speaker 6>and that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's knowledge inherent to to the </v>

3076
02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:32.750
<v Speaker 6>world and I think it's called the a cash</v>
<v Speaker 6>occur.</v>

3077
02:22:32.751 --> 02:22:37.751
<v Speaker 6>Acacia records is the idea behind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like taking account to </v>

3078
02:22:38.450 --> 02:22:43.450
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like a crude way of </v>

3079
02:22:43.450 --> 02:22:45.120
<v Speaker 6>explaining why we don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 6>creativity.</v>

3080
02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:48.000
<v Speaker 6>While you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't understand the state of mind to</v>

3081
02:22:48.001 --> 02:22:53.001
<v Speaker 6>achieve the proper creativity is like </v>
<v Speaker 6>this zen excepting sorta like when I'm </v>

3082
02:22:53.731 --> 02:22:55.140
<v Speaker 6>in the zone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you're writing something,</v>

3083
02:22:55.141 --> 02:22:57.830
<v Speaker 6>you know you have great writing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read a bunch of Shit.</v>

3084
02:22:57.831 --> 02:22:59.760
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you write some really beautiful lines,</v>

3085
02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:02.760
<v Speaker 6>but you know how sometimes they just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you're banging them out,</v>

3086
02:23:02.761 --> 02:23:07.761
<v Speaker 6>but sometimes they're just flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like they're coming out of </v>

3087
02:23:07.761 --> 02:23:11.121
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you go into this zen state and </v>

3088
02:23:11.121 --> 02:23:11.121
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3089
02:23:11.121 --> 02:23:12.630
<v Speaker 6>that just came to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's this thing.</v>

3090
02:23:12.810 --> 02:23:17.810
<v Speaker 6>Some people believe that the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you're doing is by being really </v>

3091
02:23:17.810 --> 02:23:20.910
<v Speaker 6>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're tuning in to intelligence,</v>

3092
02:23:20.911 --> 02:23:25.911
<v Speaker 6>you're tuning into ideas and that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>human body and it's managing as </v>

3093
02:23:25.911 --> 02:23:27.450
<v Speaker 6>consciousness is really just managing a </v>
<v Speaker 6>radio,</v>

3094
02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:29.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3095
02:23:29.251 --> 02:23:29.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of that.</v>

3096
02:23:30.050 --> 02:23:35.050
<v Speaker 4>I find all those ideas kind of Hokey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well just ultimately disempowering </v>

3097
02:23:35.050 --> 02:23:39.110
<v Speaker 4>because the de emphasize the agency that</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings have in creating,</v>

3098
02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:41.190
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can create.</v>

3099
02:23:41.191 --> 02:23:46.191
<v Speaker 4>Our brains are not sufficient to create,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to tune into some kind of a </v>

3100
02:23:46.191 --> 02:23:46.590
<v Speaker 4>record of that creates for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3101
02:23:46.650 --> 02:23:49.120
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of a religious idea as well </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3102
02:23:49.170 --> 02:23:53.100
<v Speaker 4>that there's like a god that gives us </v>
<v Speaker 4>some kind of power.</v>

3103
02:23:53.101 --> 02:23:58.101
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a pattern and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these ideas is that they try to remove </v>

3104
02:23:58.101 --> 02:24:01.530
<v Speaker 4>power from the individual and place it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some kind of intangible realm that we</v>

3105
02:24:01.531 --> 02:24:06.210
<v Speaker 4>can access through being pious or </v>
<v Speaker 4>through following some set of rules.</v>

3106
02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:11.340
<v Speaker 4>But ultimately I don't want to buy into </v>
<v Speaker 4>any of those ideas.</v>

3107
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:16.910
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I find that I completely agree with you </v>

3108
02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:20.250
<v Speaker 6>and that I think that a big part of it </v>
<v Speaker 6>is when people do better with creative </v>

3109
02:24:20.250 --> 02:24:24.991
<v Speaker 6>endeavors when they're humble and so </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's sort of a way of not taking credit </v>

3110
02:24:25.541 --> 02:24:29.800
<v Speaker 6>for what they're doing and just tuning </v>
<v Speaker 6>into the right creative frequency.</v>

3111
02:24:30.010 --> 02:24:33.250
<v Speaker 6>And sometimes that creative frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the best way to do is just give it up to</v>

3112
02:24:33.251 --> 02:24:34.210
<v Speaker 6>like a higher power.</v>

3113
02:24:34.290 --> 02:24:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not to say that it doesn't </v>

3114
02:24:39.290 --> 02:24:39.290
<v Speaker 4>help people in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>

3115
02:24:39.290 --> 02:24:39.960
<v Speaker 4>even if it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>helps an enormous number of people.</v>

3116
02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:45.020
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've always said that it's a great </v>

3117
02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:45.270
<v Speaker 6>operating system for a lot of people and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it really does enhance their life.</v>

3118
02:24:45.271 --> 02:24:47.610
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for whatever reason,</v>

3119
02:24:47.611 --> 02:24:52.611
<v Speaker 6>I don't know whether it's they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>uninspired or whether they have brains </v>

3120
02:24:52.611 --> 02:24:55.260
<v Speaker 6>that don't function at the right Rpms or</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is.</v>

3121
02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:59.130
<v Speaker 6>But if you give them a some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 6>ideology,</v>

3122
02:24:59.131 --> 02:25:03.210
<v Speaker 6>they can live a happy life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you left them alone in the sea of</v>

3123
02:25:03.450 --> 02:25:08.450
<v Speaker 6>doubt and in the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they could go down any path they could.</v>

3124
02:25:09.301 --> 02:25:11.600
<v Speaker 6>They could wind up a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They could wind up depressed.</v>

3125
02:25:11.601 --> 02:25:13.890
<v Speaker 6>I got mine up fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can wind up in a cult.</v>

3126
02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:17.730
<v Speaker 6>You give them a happy religion to just </v>
<v Speaker 6>live 70,</v>

3127
02:25:17.731 --> 02:25:19.350
<v Speaker 6>happy years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>die,</v>

3128
02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:22.440
<v Speaker 6>be happy that they know they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>go to heaven and everything's cool.</v>

3129
02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:24.940
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's an effective operating system.</v>

3130
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:30.030
<v Speaker 6>And at the end we were really not </v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly sure how much of this fucking </v>

3131
02:25:30.030 --> 02:25:32.470
<v Speaker 6>thing we're controlling with our mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're really not.</v>

3132
02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:36.010
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of doubt on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of doubt as to how much of</v>

3133
02:25:36.011 --> 02:25:41.011
<v Speaker 6>life is truly random and how much of it </v>
<v Speaker 6>is really created by the energy you put </v>

3134
02:25:41.141 --> 02:25:43.480
<v Speaker 6>out your imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

3135
02:25:43.490 --> 02:25:46.480
<v Speaker 6>your actions and your deeds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is really going on?</v>

3136
02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:48.910
<v Speaker 6>Is it 100 percent physical or is there </v>
<v Speaker 6>some.</v>

3137
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.480
<v Speaker 6>Is there some manifestation that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>imagination takes part in?</v>

3138
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:56.770
<v Speaker 6>We don't really necessarily know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's people that are always good.</v>

3139
02:25:56.771 --> 02:26:01.771
<v Speaker 6>Things are constantly happening to them </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're always in great moods and </v>

3140
02:26:01.771 --> 02:26:04.660
<v Speaker 6>they seem to perpetrate that same energy</v>
<v Speaker 6>forward and you look at people like that</v>

3141
02:26:04.661 --> 02:26:07.000
<v Speaker 6>and you wonder like how much of that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>them?</v>

3142
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:12.030
<v Speaker 6>How much of that is they just figured </v>
<v Speaker 6>out how to roll this thing and figured </v>

3143
02:26:12.030 --> 02:26:15.090
<v Speaker 6>out how to create reality if they </v>
<v Speaker 6>figured out how to just ride this thing </v>

3144
02:26:15.090 --> 02:26:15.090
<v Speaker 6>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it possible?</v>

3145
02:26:15.090 --> 02:26:15.430
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is,</v>

3146
02:26:15.431 --> 02:26:16.330
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

3147
02:26:16.331 --> 02:26:21.331
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're one of the most experienced guys </v>

3148
02:26:21.331 --> 02:26:24.511
<v Speaker 6>I think I've ever come across and as far</v>
<v Speaker 6>as altered states of consciousness and </v>

3149
02:26:24.511 --> 02:26:24.511
<v Speaker 6>you're not an old guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How old are you?</v>

3150
02:26:24.511 --> 02:26:25.800
<v Speaker 6>Thirty four.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Twenty four.</v>

3151
02:26:25.810 --> 02:26:28.560
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ son.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say you're 30.</v>

3152
02:26:29.130 --> 02:26:31.540
<v Speaker 2>You're a hard 24 kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them on the apple commercial.</v>

3153
02:26:31.541 --> 02:26:33.790
<v Speaker 2>You were really young and that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody just sent me that.</v>

3154
02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:34.720
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

3155
02:26:34.721 --> 02:26:37.150
<v Speaker 2>You're way too smart to be 24.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>

3156
02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:39.130
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating,</v>

3157
02:26:39.131 --> 02:26:40.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was 24,</v>

3158
02:26:40.841 --> 02:26:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I spoke in grunts for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing,</v>

3159
02:26:44.411 --> 02:26:45.820
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3160
02:26:45.970 --> 02:26:47.790
<v Speaker 2>You um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3161
02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3162
02:26:48.390 --> 02:26:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you must be the most experienced person </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever met.</v>

3163
02:26:50.651 --> 02:26:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>

3164
02:26:52.770 --> 02:26:56.020
<v Speaker 2>many more experienced in this case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't know that.</v>

3165
02:26:56.050 --> 02:26:58.690
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff he's really done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you take out of it,</v>

3166
02:26:58.691 --> 02:26:59.240
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

3167
02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.320
<v Speaker 2>are you happy that you had all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences that changed you who you </v>

3168
02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:04.320
<v Speaker 2>are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3169
02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

3170
02:27:04.390 --> 02:27:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I think just experimentation in general </v>
<v Speaker 2>is important.</v>

3171
02:27:07.211 --> 02:27:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Can everybody handle it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

3172
02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3173
02:27:11.710 --> 02:27:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd be a fix that.</v>

3174
02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:17.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated question.</v>

3175
02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.270
<v Speaker 2>So good one though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you got a problem.</v>

3176
02:27:19.271 --> 02:27:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Some guys are good worker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it requires.</v>

3177
02:27:22.010 --> 02:27:23.890
<v Speaker 2>She was good with the landscape in </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

3178
02:27:24.430 --> 02:27:27.090
<v Speaker 2>So that fucking Hamilton Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardamom acid.</v>

3179
02:27:27.730 --> 02:27:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3180
02:27:28.390 --> 02:27:33.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had close friends that dropped out </v>

3181
02:27:33.390 --> 02:27:33.880
<v Speaker 2>of society for whatever reason because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they started to find a pointless.</v>

3182
02:27:33.881 --> 02:27:37.000
<v Speaker 2>And it's difficult to argue with that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone really genuinely feels that way.</v>

3183
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:38.890
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just a,</v>

3184
02:27:38.910 --> 02:27:43.910
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of an infantilizing gen </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally disempowering idea in </v>

3185
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:47.170
<v Speaker 2>psychiatry and throughout society that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are not in control of ourselves.</v>

3186
02:27:47.180 --> 02:27:49.660
<v Speaker 2>We probably see a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The doctor is the expert on our mind and</v>

3187
02:27:49.661 --> 02:27:54.661
<v Speaker 2>our body and they tell us what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know us better than we know </v>

3188
02:27:54.661 --> 02:27:54.760
<v Speaker 2>ourselves even after only talking to us </v>
<v Speaker 2>for five minutes.</v>

3189
02:27:54.940 --> 02:27:57.430
<v Speaker 2>And so if you go to a psychiatrist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

3190
02:27:57.730 --> 02:28:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm having trouble working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may maybe depressed and they have adhd,</v>

3191
02:28:02.141 --> 02:28:05.320
<v Speaker 2>what do you think I should do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that adderall would help me.</v>

3192
02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:10.400
<v Speaker 2>It's immediately suspicious because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you already know too much about </v>

3193
02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:14.341
<v Speaker 2>what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want you to go in as an infant </v>

3194
02:28:14.341 --> 02:28:14.341
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they can tell you what you need,</v>

3195
02:28:14.341 --> 02:28:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I believe that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some emphasis or some,</v>

3196
02:28:18.941 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 2>there's some impact at the imagination </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your thinking and your energy</v>

3197
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:27.100
<v Speaker 6>has on life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I also believe there's a lot of </v>

3198
02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:28.160
<v Speaker 6>random shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's an either or.</v>

3199
02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:33.340
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a combination of you </v>
<v Speaker 6>interacting with all these other people </v>

3200
02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:37.451
<v Speaker 6>that are also creating their own </v>
<v Speaker 6>realities at the same time and that you </v>

3201
02:28:37.451 --> 02:28:37.451
<v Speaker 6>can have a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3202
02:28:37.451 --> 02:28:39.620
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can all tune into a,</v>

3203
02:28:39.621 --> 02:28:42.350
<v Speaker 6>a good frequency and perhaps you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>create a good community.</v>

3204
02:28:42.351 --> 02:28:44.930
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's what people try to do</v>
<v Speaker 6>it in tribes and shit like that.</v>

3205
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:47.930
<v Speaker 6>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're still dealing with random shit.</v>

3206
02:28:48.170 --> 02:28:53.170
<v Speaker 6>Like the idea that you blame people for </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking diseases or for being attacked </v>

3207
02:28:53.170 --> 02:28:53.910
<v Speaker 6>by barbarians,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3208
02:28:53.911 --> 02:28:55.100
<v Speaker 6>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was that in the secret,</v>

3209
02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:56.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the secret work back 10.</v>

3210
02:28:56.741 --> 02:28:59.390
<v Speaker 6>Did they manifest these barbarians to </v>
<v Speaker 6>come over the hills and,</v>

3211
02:28:59.540 --> 02:28:59.930
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3212
02:28:59.931 --> 02:29:02.730
<v Speaker 6>and chop people up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But swords back into Kona and days.</v>

3213
02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:03.810
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3214
02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:07.190
<v Speaker 6>You can't say it's completely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody would ask for that.</v>

3215
02:29:07.191 --> 02:29:10.790
<v Speaker 6>Nobody would create that in their own </v>
<v Speaker 6>imagination for there for themselves,</v>

3216
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:16.150
<v Speaker 6>so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not that you are completely in </v>

3217
02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:17.060
<v Speaker 6>control of your destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it seems like you have at least some</v>

3218
02:29:17.061 --> 02:29:20.140
<v Speaker 6>sort of influence with energy and with </v>
<v Speaker 6>your imagination and with,</v>

3219
02:29:20.420 --> 02:29:25.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the things that you create and the </v>

3220
02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:26.690
<v Speaker 6>environment that you set up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's one of the most important</v>

3221
02:29:26.691 --> 02:29:29.000
<v Speaker 6>things that I've ever learned from </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics.</v>

3222
02:29:29.250 --> 02:29:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3223
02:29:30.330 --> 02:29:33.900
<v Speaker 4>And just being in a mindset to try new </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

3224
02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:36.900
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they're chemical or experiential</v>

3225
02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:37.590
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>

3226
02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:41.430
<v Speaker 6>I think cautiously try to consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

3227
02:29:41.431 --> 02:29:46.431
<v Speaker 6>I mean obviously you didn't find out all</v>
<v Speaker 6>this information about it after you've </v>

3228
02:29:46.431 --> 02:29:48.550
<v Speaker 6>tried all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you knew that going in.</v>

3229
02:29:49.630 --> 02:29:51.280
<v Speaker 6>What's the one thing that you ever did?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were like,</v>

3230
02:29:51.310 --> 02:29:52.510
<v Speaker 6>Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here we go.</v>

3231
02:29:52.990 --> 02:29:55.390
<v Speaker 4>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This might be a slippery one.</v>

3232
02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:58.360
<v Speaker 4>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

3233
02:29:59.270 --> 02:30:00.430
<v Speaker 4>Slippery one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3234
02:30:00.431 --> 02:30:04.450
<v Speaker 4>I've had a few slippery ones in my day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

3235
02:30:05.050 --> 02:30:07.330
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of the really potent </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics have,</v>

3236
02:30:07.430 --> 02:30:11.890
<v Speaker 4>have the ability to induce terror if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're too high of a dose.</v>

3237
02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:14.860
<v Speaker 4>I've had that happen with both dmt and </v>
<v Speaker 4>suicide than,</v>

3238
02:30:15.210 --> 02:30:18.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so just so many,</v>

3239
02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:23.580
<v Speaker 4>so many different occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but suddenly I've never had anything </v>

3240
02:30:23.580 --> 02:30:23.860
<v Speaker 4>where I will actually have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3241
02:30:23.861 --> 02:30:28.861
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had a few kind of close to what I </v>

3242
02:30:28.861 --> 02:30:31.861
<v Speaker 4>would consider overdose of psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the dose is just so high that I </v>

3243
02:30:31.861 --> 02:30:32.770
<v Speaker 4>think there might be some physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>toxicity,</v>

3244
02:30:33.940 --> 02:30:36.730
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with those sorts of cases,</v>

3245
02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:41.440
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 4>between what is motivated by fear.</v>

3246
02:30:41.441 --> 02:30:42.190
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people,</v>

3247
02:30:42.191 --> 02:30:43.270
<v Speaker 4>even when they're sober,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

3248
02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:46.270
<v Speaker 4>they'll panic or be uncomfortable and </v>
<v Speaker 4>think they're having a heart attack,</v>

3249
02:30:46.271 --> 02:30:48.850
<v Speaker 4>but it's just a panic attack or it's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>even a panic attack.</v>

3250
02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:50.110
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3251
02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:55.120
<v Speaker 4>the mind is so informed by the body that</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in a psychedelic state,</v>

3252
02:30:55.331 --> 02:31:00.331
<v Speaker 4>that it's very difficult to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if you're drinking IOWASCA and </v>

3253
02:31:00.331 --> 02:31:04.291
<v Speaker 4>suddenly your heart starts beating fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is your heart beating fast because </v>

3254
02:31:04.291 --> 02:31:06.841
<v Speaker 4>you're scared?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you scared because your heart is </v>

3255
02:31:06.841 --> 02:31:08.551
<v Speaker 4>beating fast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And which do you concentrate on the </v>

3256
02:31:08.551 --> 02:31:09.100
<v Speaker 4>heart or the fear first in order to calm</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself down?</v>

3257
02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:15.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you might be throwing a puzzle that </v>

3258
02:31:15.640 --> 02:31:16.280
<v Speaker 6>you can't wrestle with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just runs you over.</v>

3259
02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:21.340
<v Speaker 6>It's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you're just there in utter fear and </v>

3260
02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:21.340
<v Speaker 6>until it</v>

3261
02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:21.960
<v Speaker 1>slowly leaves your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3262
02:31:22.470 --> 02:31:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I overdosed when I ate that one bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>shroom trip,</v>

3263
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six months ago.</v>

3264
02:31:25.891 --> 02:31:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't walk.</v>

3265
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:28.780
<v Speaker 1>My legs would not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3266
02:31:28.781 --> 02:31:29.940
<v Speaker 1>they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were failing.</v>

3267
02:31:30.090 --> 02:31:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3268
02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:33.540
<v Speaker 1>That's how he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got over seven grounds.</v>

3269
02:31:34.390 --> 02:31:39.390
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a guest that was over </v>

3270
02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:39.420
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be way more than that.</v>

3271
02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:40.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3272
02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:42.300
<v Speaker 1>you're silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to hearts on not,</v>

3273
02:31:42.470 --> 02:31:44.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3274
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Did you come back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3275
02:31:46.650 --> 02:31:47.560
<v Speaker 1>what'd you come back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>

3276
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Took me a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a day.</v>

3277
02:31:49.330 --> 02:31:52.440
<v Speaker 1>A good 24 hours after two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt 100 percent.</v>

3278
02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:54.780
<v Speaker 1>But didn't you learn something from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>

3279
02:31:55.350 --> 02:31:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3280
02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:58.760
<v Speaker 1>My wall was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or my bathroom was like,</v>

3281
02:31:58.770 --> 02:32:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Tron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original tron.</v>

3282
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:04.860
<v Speaker 1>If you two had a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

3283
02:32:05.010 --> 02:32:06.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one of these is 24?</v>

3284
02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Which one is almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost scary.</v>

3285
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:11.760
<v Speaker 1>How old are you now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty seven.</v>

3286
02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Thirty seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>37,</v>

3287
02:32:12.991 --> 02:32:17.220
<v Speaker 1>he's 37 and you're 24 and see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he votes too.</v>

3288
02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I took molly the other day and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molly,</v>

3289
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Molly said the MTMA and it was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed something recently doing </v>

3290
02:32:25.441 --> 02:32:29.460
<v Speaker 1>shrooms and it happened for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>with molly this last time.</v>

3291
02:32:29.461 --> 02:32:31.980
<v Speaker 1>So it makes me wonder how much of it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>really Mali.</v>

3292
02:32:32.250 --> 02:32:35.760
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see so much better when I'm on a</v>

3293
02:32:35.761 --> 02:32:36.570
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3294
02:32:36.571 --> 02:32:41.040
<v Speaker 1>like it seems like my eyes were up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because her pupils are bigger.</v>

3295
02:32:41.041 --> 02:32:42.890
<v Speaker 1>So you probably don't have that vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3296
02:32:42.900 --> 02:32:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean like brighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything's a lot brighter </v>

3297
02:32:47.900 --> 02:32:51.291
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can almost see in the garden </v>

3298
02:32:51.291 --> 02:32:51.291
<v Speaker 1>tools and it makes me.</v>

3299
02:32:51.291 --> 02:32:54.580
<v Speaker 1>And I had this thing I was thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it would be weird if like all the </v>

3300
02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:56.400
<v Speaker 1>shit that you see when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>showrooming is there all the time,</v>

3301
02:32:56.670 --> 02:33:01.670
<v Speaker 1>but your eyes adjust to the certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>lightness or there's certain level of </v>

3302
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:05.160
<v Speaker 1>being open that you see it more when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on shrooms.</v>

3303
02:33:05.161 --> 02:33:10.161
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're seeing like you're </v>

3304
02:33:10.161 --> 02:33:11.961
<v Speaker 1>looking at your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing like this crazy shit all </v>

3305
02:33:11.961 --> 02:33:11.961
<v Speaker 1>rounded like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3306
02:33:11.961 --> 02:33:14.970
<v Speaker 1>like minds that are growing over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if that Shit's there all the time,</v>

3307
02:33:14.971 --> 02:33:19.971
<v Speaker 1>but you're just focusing in on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>layer of a brightness or if it was more </v>

3308
02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:25.040
<v Speaker 1>as we throw to you possible surveys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one here qualified to answer that.</v>

3309
02:33:25.810 --> 02:33:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if I had an answer for you </v>

3310
02:33:30.810 --> 02:33:30.820
<v Speaker 1>poppy cock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just one of the things I thought,</v>

3311
02:33:30.930 --> 02:33:35.930
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm molly because I was looking like </v>

3312
02:33:35.930 --> 02:33:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

3313
02:33:35.930 --> 02:33:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I can see in the dark right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make a bet.</v>

3314
02:33:36.061 --> 02:33:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's make a bet because I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says it's bullshit.</v>

3315
02:33:38.370 --> 02:33:39.690
<v Speaker 1>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3316
02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:40.710
<v Speaker 1>it's just a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

3317
02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:43.800
<v Speaker 1>What if no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would probably say,</v>

3318
02:33:43.850 --> 02:33:45.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your brain just shutting down.</v>

3319
02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had to support your own thing.</v>

3320
02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:48.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3321
02:33:48.810 --> 02:33:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I don't?</v>

3322
02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think he would think?</v>

3323
02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is even right.</v>

3324
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I would say he would be exactly what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says on everything you know,</v>

3325
02:33:57.651 --> 02:34:01.860
<v Speaker 1>like he's takes the safe route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I do,</v>

3326
02:34:01.861 --> 02:34:04.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's like I'm not going to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes the scientific,</v>

3327
02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:08.280
<v Speaker 1>the scientific route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more angels and Unicorns.</v>

3328
02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for bigfoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

3329
02:34:09.811 --> 02:34:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm always looking for bigfoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know I'm looking for bigfoot.</v>

3330
02:34:12.510 --> 02:34:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I know I really want big foot to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3331
02:34:14.221 --> 02:34:16.140
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3332
02:34:16.350 --> 02:34:17.860
<v Speaker 1>But I really want them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3333
02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3334
02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:21.970
<v Speaker 2>you don't see any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing exists in the first place.</v>

3335
02:34:21.971 --> 02:34:26.971
<v Speaker 2>None of this is colored or has any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing actually looks the way we </v>

3336
02:34:26.971 --> 02:34:31.561
<v Speaker 2>perceive it as a sensory phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to say what things are actually </v>

3337
02:34:31.561 --> 02:34:33.790
<v Speaker 2>like is already problematic because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sensory experience.</v>

3338
02:34:33.791 --> 02:34:35.290
<v Speaker 2>So how you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3339
02:34:35.291 --> 02:34:36.700
<v Speaker 2>That is fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3340
02:34:36.701 --> 02:34:41.701
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really wrap their heads up that your </v>

3341
02:34:41.701 --> 02:34:44.791
<v Speaker 2>mind puts that red in that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind puts the dark and someone's </v>

3342
02:34:44.791 --> 02:34:44.791
<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3343
02:34:44.791 --> 02:34:46.390
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your interpretation of the world.</v>

3344
02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3345
02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:50.170
<v Speaker 2>and then that's the total stolen talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonder Man.</v>

3346
02:34:50.830 --> 02:34:54.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like the color blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what does it look like to you,</v>

3347
02:34:54.701 --> 02:34:56.440
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see this guy,</v>

3348
02:34:57.010 --> 02:34:58.040
<v Speaker 2>what does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do?</v>

3349
02:34:58.041 --> 02:35:01.420
<v Speaker 2>You really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do know that it is different for some</v>

3350
02:35:01.421 --> 02:35:04.360
<v Speaker 2>people really different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3351
02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:09.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this colorblindness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like linguistic relativity and color </v>

3352
02:35:09.361 --> 02:35:10.360
<v Speaker 2>naming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been a lot of scholarly research</v>

3353
02:35:10.361 --> 02:35:15.361
<v Speaker 2>into the issue where certain primitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies have fewer names for colors </v>

3354
02:35:15.361 --> 02:35:19.200
<v Speaker 2>and so they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll only have black and white and </v>

3355
02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:19.240
<v Speaker 2>that will encompass black one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Companies like red and blue and white,</v>

3356
02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:24.430
<v Speaker 2>so it's not cross culturally defined in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any way to.</v>

3357
02:35:24.490 --> 02:35:26.210
<v Speaker 2>It must suck to get your car painted </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3358
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Can you car painted in the jungle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I asked for blue.</v>

3359
02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:32.120
<v Speaker 2>This is red.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck that.</v>

3360
02:35:32.121 --> 02:35:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Like same shit.</v>

3361
02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:40.780
<v Speaker 2>The end of the podcast.</v>

02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:52.800

<v Speaker 2>all over the interpretation of things </v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3392
02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:05.380
<v Speaker 2>many people that are interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific element of a few close </v>

3393
02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:07.340
<v Speaker 2>friends who are scientists who I talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>with about this kind of stuff.</v>

3394
02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:08.960
<v Speaker 2>So when you date,</v>

3399
02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:22.800
<v Speaker 2>did they look to you for God?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it depends on what their academic</v>

3400
02:37:22.801 --> 02:37:23.940
<v Speaker 2>background is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

3401
02:37:23.941 --> 02:37:28.941

<v Speaker 2>interested in that sort of thing unless </v>

<v Speaker 2>None at the top of my head.</v>

3415
02:38:05.561 --> 02:38:06.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a pastor</v>

3416
02:38:08.470 --> 02:38:11.360
<v Speaker 9>second.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Trying to find it now,</v>

3417
02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:14.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to talk one profile.</v>

3418
02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Please vote for me on the shorter shorty</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's got a desk dot TV and at the </v>

3419

<v Speaker 2>top of it click on phone for me and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting beat by a wwe wrestler that has </v>

<v Speaker 2>half a million hits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't win,</v>

3421
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:28.210
<v Speaker 2>but it just makes me feel happy that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>in second place.</v>

3422
02:38:28.211 --> 02:38:30.690
<v Speaker 2>At least Hamilton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mars only has one tweet and this is it.</v>

3423
02:38:30.730 --> 02:38:35.730
<v Speaker 2>In the realm of scientific observation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>luck is granted only to those who are </v>

3424
02:38:35.730 --> 02:38:35.730
<v Speaker 2>prepared.</v>

3425
02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:39.070
<v Speaker 2>That's romantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have one quote by the way.</v>

3426
02:38:39.071 --> 02:38:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that quotes kind of hacky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

3427
02:38:41.771 --> 02:38:43.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of versions that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

3428
02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

3429
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:46.750
<v Speaker 2>somebody fucking gangsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote.</v>

3430
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Luck is only granted those prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3431
02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:53.830
<v Speaker 2>success is when luck meets preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an old.</v>

3432
02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:56.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the oldest quotation ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

3433
02:38:56.261 --> 02:38:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Dr that shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made it fancy.</v>

3434
02:38:58.570 --> 02:39:01.210
<v Speaker 2>They made it sound a little profound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little more profound,</v>

3435
02:39:01.211 --> 02:39:04.750
<v Speaker 2>but really basically they dug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dot an old saying a Fox,</v>

3436
02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:08.320
<v Speaker 2>but if you're going to have one quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it dude.</v>

3437
02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:13.680
<v Speaker 2>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even use quote marks or didn't </v>

3438
02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:13.680
<v Speaker 2>use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Period though.</v>

3439
02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:15.670
<v Speaker 2>You used the period maybe should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributed to someone,</v>

3440
02:39:15.671 --> 02:39:17.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's easy enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3441
02:39:17.081 --> 02:39:18.310
<v Speaker 2>they should figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3442
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:23.980
<v Speaker 2>You didn't write that yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you fade away like Def Leppard?</v>

3443
02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3444
02:39:24.980 --> 02:39:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Did he say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton Morris.</v>

3445
02:39:26.470 --> 02:39:28.590

<v Speaker 2>ever had,</v>

3446
02:39:28.591 --> 02:39:31.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's only because of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3447
02:39:31.271 --> 02:39:33.700
<v Speaker 2>You were amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time we called upon you,</v>

3448
02:39:33.701 --> 02:39:36.180
<v Speaker 2>your questions were great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just got Brian a little two.</v>

3449
02:39:37.050 --> 02:39:40.570
<v Speaker 2>It's two stones and it threw us off a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>

3450
02:39:40.810 --> 02:39:42.310
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fascinating,</v>

3451
02:39:42.311 --> 02:39:42.880
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

<v Speaker 2>place to access all your stuff?</v>

3461

<v Speaker 5>but they're going to try to rework it.</v>

3471
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:34.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It must terrify you mean you.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you're doing illegal shit.</v>

3474
02:40:39.390 --> 02:40:40.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it could have some employee.</v>

3475
02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:45.600
<v Speaker 5>The idea that they can just come in and </v>
<v Speaker 5>take down your site at their discretion,</v>

3476
02:40:45.930 --> 02:40:50.930

<v Speaker 5>a a national defense authorization act </v>

3477
02:40:50.930 --> 02:40:52.290

<v Speaker 5>which is another terrifying thing to.</v>

3478
02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Could just arrest you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have to have a warrant.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and you'll get 15 percent off the number</v>

3484
02:41:06.541 --> 02:41:08.340
<v Speaker 5>one sex toy for men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hamilton.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a weird subject.</v>

3491
02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:23.000
<v Speaker 5>It's much like psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really underappreciated.</v>

3492
02:41:23.570 --> 02:41:26.490
<v Speaker 5>It's physical maintenance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

3493
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:31.550
<v Speaker 5>I think it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The body needs to be able to breathe as </v>
