1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:03.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like we were talking about virtual reality.</v>

4
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:05.521
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

5
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>how long before they made a porn,</v>

6
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean when the moment they came up with Oculus,</v>

7
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>we knew like it's a matter of time,</v>

8
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.091
<v Speaker 1>matter of time,</v>

9
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and they did it and they did it.</v>

10
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>it is going to create some fucking hilarious earthquakes and a lot of different</v>

12
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.270
<v Speaker 1>relationships and marriages because people are going to have to uh,</v>

13
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>define whether or not fucking a Hologram is a form of infidelity.</v>

14
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to have to make a rule for that in,</v>

15
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>in your relationship.</v>

16
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to fuck a Hologram?</v>

17
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Not Alive,</v>

18
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>not a person,</v>

19
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>but looks like it's fucking you looking you right in the eyes,</v>

20
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>right in the fucking eyes.</v>

21
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.101
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

22
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

23
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty weird because your brain,</v>

25
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>when a Hologram is looking at you in the eyes in a loving way,</v>

26
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>your brain doesn't reject it.</v>

27
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

28
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.611
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

29
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I think this girl really likes me.</v>

30
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>

31
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a hologram.</v>

32
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.580
<v Speaker 1>But in one millisecond you get this feeling of like strange connection,</v>

33
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

34
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.391
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

35
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>we're in the most rudimentary parts of Vr,</v>

36
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>only apparently only,</v>

37
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:26.221
<v Speaker 1>I just read this,</v>

38
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>it might've been a dated article,</v>

39
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>but only 100,000 people or so on and HTC vive,</v>

40
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>if that's drastically off you guys.</v>

41
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:34.351
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

42
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but not a lot of people have VR goggles right now.</v>

43
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So not a lot of people.</v>

44
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of us who are fucking ear beating people at parties who</v>

45
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>clearly just don't want to hear about it anymore than you want to hear about</v>

46
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>someone talking about it dream.</v>

47
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>But there's a huge group of people right now that are having some of the most</v>

48
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mind bending experience is through technology.</v>

49
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And they can't even talk about it or describe it to people because when you</v>

50
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:02.281
<v Speaker 1>describe it,</v>

51
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're talking about a dream,</v>

52
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.531
<v Speaker 1>but you're like,</v>

53
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:04.741
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

54
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>this is happening to a lot of us right now.</v>

55
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:12.711
<v Speaker 1>We're going into alternate dimensions via technology and hanging out there,</v>

56
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>enjoying it,</v>

57
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>experiencing the freedom,</v>

58
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>from the confines of being constantly in an infinitely located in whatever</v>

60
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>physical space your body happens to be inhabiting to suddenly remove that weight</v>

61
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:35.391
<v Speaker 1>and how I can pop these things on and instantly translocate to some art universe</v>

62
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>that some geniuses created.</v>

63
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Fuck around.</v>

64
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Shoot Arrows,</v>

65
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>wander through Minecraft,</v>

66
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>have sex with two,</v>

67
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>girls who I always apparently going to throw out of my house if they didn't fuck</v>

69
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

70
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what the porn is.</v>

71
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I have</v>

72
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>never do that.</v>

73
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>But in this universe,</v>

74
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what I do.</v>

75
00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>So the kind of rapey what is not rapey it's just like,</v>

77
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:03.461
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

78
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't have money for the rent.</v>

79
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Can I suck your Dick?</v>

80
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

81
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>it's her idea.</v>

83
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

84
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>You're not saying you're not raping her.</v>

85
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.111
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

86
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:11.351
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

87
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.310
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta give up some pussy otherwise,</v>

88
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>otherwise I'm kicking you in the street.</v>

89
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:15.920
<v Speaker 1>You could say it if you want.</v>

90
00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:16.661
<v Speaker 1>And to the porn.</v>

91
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:16.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

92
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>you could say whatever you want.</v>

93
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:18.994
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

94
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>You have a microphone?</v>

95
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

96
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm a microphone,</v>

97
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>but you can talk to it if you want to be a Weirdo.</v>

98
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.763
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>

99
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.941
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

100
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:25.301
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

101
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>How long before you can talk to it,</v>

102
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>how long before it talks back to you?</v>

103
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

104
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.131
<v Speaker 1>you're going to look,</v>

105
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:31.350
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at like a,</v>

106
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>so we got to figure out a way to either,</v>

107
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:39.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean I imagine that probably exists in some rudimentary way for some kind of</v>

108
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>CGI style porn,</v>

109
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>but to be able to like instantaneously communicate with live video porn,</v>

110
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need some kind of AI that I don't think we probably have just</v>

111
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>yet or we are probably on the PR,</v>

112
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.671
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

113
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:52.504
<v Speaker 1>that will happen.</v>

114
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.201
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

115
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely gonna happen.</v>

116
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>I've watched x Mckenna again on the plane the other day.</v>

117
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I watched it for the second time.</v>

118
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.111
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

119
00:03:59.111 --> 00:03:59.771
<v Speaker 1>It's just as good.</v>

120
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:00.604
<v Speaker 1>The second time.</v>

121
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>That movie freaks me out,</v>

122
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

123
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

124
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Because the girl's so beautiful and she's so,</v>

125
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>she's so attractive.</v>

126
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.071
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

127
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>you know that guy.</v>

128
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>You could see as much as he knew that she was a robot.</v>

129
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:17.040
<v Speaker 1>As much as he knew that he wasn't a robot as much,</v>

130
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>as much as he knew that she was artificial,</v>

131
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>he was in love with her and she was amazing and it seemed like she cared about</v>

132
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>him and when she was talking to him for real,</v>

133
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>like when the lights went out and the camera was down,</v>

134
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.264
<v Speaker 1>spoiler alert,</v>

135
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.051
<v Speaker 1>and she was like,</v>

136
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:29.884
<v Speaker 1>don't trust him.</v>

137
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

138
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>this is like a real person.</v>

139
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a real person.</v>

140
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 1>She's thinking like a person.</v>

141
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a person and he's like completely locked into this idea that it's a person.</v>

142
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>He's hitting a time.</v>

143
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a person.</v>

144
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

145
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>this whole distinction between artificial intelligence and intelligence is the</v>

146
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>same as the distinction between virtual reality and reality.</v>

147
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just like another human attempt to be in control of something.</v>

148
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>

149
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.581
<v Speaker 1>you want to say,</v>

150
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:54.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

151
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you if this is fucking reality or not.</v>

152
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

153
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>this is virtual reality.</v>

154
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>This isn't reality reality.</v>

155
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

156
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 1>oh really?</v>

157
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>So realities compartmentalized into places where there's,</v>

158
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>if something is created by a human,</v>

159
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.441
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

160
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>that's not real reality.</v>

161
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Even though humans are reality.</v>

162
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Reality is reality.</v>

163
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence is intelligence because the intelligence is inhabiting something</v>

164
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>that isn't the human vessel.</v>

165
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to what we were talking about earlier,</v>

166
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.331
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

167
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>because it's not in a fucking meat body now it's artificial intelligence.</v>

168
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:29.080
<v Speaker 1>How is why intelligence is intelligence,</v>

169
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>but here's my weirdness about all this.</v>

170
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>You know we were talking about language and the limitations of language and the</v>

171
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 1>eventuality of a virtual reality and I wonder how we're going to digest data and</v>

172
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>information in a virtual world.</v>

173
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Like if people decide like what if you decide that you want to read books in a</v>

174
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>virtual world,</v>

175
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>this is how you want to read books.</v>

176
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>The way you want to read books is what your feet up on the couch in your</v>

177
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>mansion,</v>

178
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 2>in your virtual world.</v>

179
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 2>All these girls around you like finger banging themselves with a high heels on</v>

180
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>and Queens fat bottom girls,</v>

181
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>you make a rock in the world,</v>

182
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 2>go round plays in the background share,</v>

183
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 2>and you get to sit down and read books in a virtual world.</v>

184
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.653
<v Speaker 2>What happens then?</v>

185
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

186
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.810
<v Speaker 2>What happens when you're watching movies in a virtual world?</v>

187
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Well then that's probably,</v>

188
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.313
<v Speaker 2>that'd be stupid.</v>

189
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>I think the movies would be,</v>

190
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 2>they would exist.</v>

191
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I think movies in a virtual world,</v>

192
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 2>they're definitely coming.</v>

193
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:24.231
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

194
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:24.741
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to,</v>

195
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 2>you're going to exist in the world.</v>

196
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not gonna sit down and watch a movie.</v>

197
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

198
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.660
<v Speaker 1>They have a great theory theaters in Vr now you can sit down,</v>

199
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 1>put on a movie and watch it on the,</v>

200
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.450
<v Speaker 1>unlike a massive screen in VR there I went to,</v>

201
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:38.284
<v Speaker 1>don't you think,</v>

202
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.620
<v Speaker 2>why do they do that as their limitations in the medium where they can't have it?</v>

203
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

204
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.960
<v Speaker 2>the movie play out in front of you.</v>

205
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Like if you went to see jaws,</v>

206
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

207
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

208
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

209
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of Nice to watch a movie floating in space.</v>

210
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind that the virtue of you,</v>

211
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>there's an app called virtual desktop where you like,</v>

212
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.060
<v Speaker 1>you put on your VR goggles and suddenly your desktop is wrapped around you,</v>

213
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>a giant screen,</v>

214
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.530
<v Speaker 1>giant screen wrapped around you that you then can like pull up any kind of movie</v>

215
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>you might want to watch.</v>

216
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And so you just like can sit in there and why.</v>

217
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And if you look down,</v>

218
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>you see space.</v>

219
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.041
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

221
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Virtual desk that now the problem with Vr,</v>

222
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>when you look at that,</v>

223
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>the problem with Vr,</v>

224
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:28.450
<v Speaker 1>like people looking at it on the Internet is it you cannot convey how fucking</v>

225
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>cool it looks from looking at it that way.</v>

226
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Like it is suddenly there's this massive thing in front of you.</v>

227
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>The space look real.</v>

228
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 1>What the space will grill.</v>

229
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

230
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.543
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

231
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it looks real enough pretty.</v>

232
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that.</v>

233
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

234
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say really realistic.</v>

235
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I think there are probably some,</v>

236
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.330
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be by now some three 60 videos that are actually from that,</v>

237
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:53.864
<v Speaker 1>from Hubble.</v>

238
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 1>But it looks good enough where you're like,</v>

239
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking awesome.</v>

240
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

241
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:57.651
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

242
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 2>What's the benefit of like they're just watching you play a video game.</v>

243
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 2>What's the benefit and playing a video game on a screen in a virtual world</v>

244
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 2>instead of playing the video game in the virtual world?</v>

245
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

246
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

247
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but honestly in that case,</v>

248
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:10.191
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

249
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 1>like I've,</v>

250
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I started a game up in there and just like,</v>

251
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:12.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

252
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 2>but do you hear what you see what I'm saying here?</v>

253
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Because like he's clicking and menus and stuff.</v>

254
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 2>He's using it like a computer.</v>

255
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

256
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.131
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

257
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the benefit is the right thing to look for there.</v>

258
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

259
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:28.630
<v Speaker 1>it's just bad ass to like suddenly be completely immersed in a new environment</v>

260
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>doing like whatever the work is that you want to do that with virtual desktop.</v>

261
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I just use it to watch documentaries</v>

262
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 2>about bleeding,</v>

263
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm thinking is like,</v>

264
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 2>would you rather like,</v>

265
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

266
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 2>like they're perfect example.</v>

267
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at a screen,</v>

268
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:45.291
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

269
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Clearly a floating screen if you watch jaws and that floating screen,</v>

271
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.090
<v Speaker 2>that would not be as good as if you were sitting in your living on when you're</v>

272
00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:51.720
<v Speaker 2>looking down,</v>

273
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 2>you were on the boat with Roy Scheider.</v>

274
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:53.931
<v Speaker 2>Well he was like,</v>

275
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:54.764
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna need a bigger one.</v>

276
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh mean like if there was like a VR jaws,</v>

277
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

278
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

279
00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:58.981
<v Speaker 1>that'd be fucking cool.</v>

280
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't exist yet.</v>

281
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

282
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm saying,</v>

283
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>like that's going to happen.</v>

284
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

285
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

286
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:04.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

287
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:06.630
<v Speaker 1>that'll definitely happen for sure.</v>

288
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>

289
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.450

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You have to stretch out these like tubes to build this weird device that you</v>

<v Speaker 1>talking about it,</v>

370
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>you feel like a fucking,</v>

371
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:25.750
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to an eight year old talk about a drawing that they made.</v>

372
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

374
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to convey.</v>

375
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a game and it's a game where this guy is moving.</v>

376
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.920
<v Speaker 1>He's got devices in his hand and then devices move things in the virtual world.</v>

377
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:40.440
<v Speaker 1>He's holding onto these two like a controllers.</v>

378
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 1>But this is not a good,</v>

379
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:42.690
<v Speaker 1>if you look up car doesn't matter.</v>

380
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking fucking cool.</v>

381
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

382
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.560
<v Speaker 1>You'll see it on Friday.</v>

383
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:47.131
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you.</v>

384
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I've got us and what we need to talk about his porn.</v>

385
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.150
<v Speaker 1>What's that like Duncan?</v>

386
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 1>What's it like in this world?</v>

387
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.513
<v Speaker 1>What's it like?</v>

388
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.401
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

389
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:55.234
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

390
00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like I'll tell you something even better than porn man.</v>

391
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.533
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

392
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 1>here's what's really cool about VR that I don't think a lot of people have</v>

393
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:06.551
<v Speaker 1>caught onto.</v>

394
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a few of them have.</v>

395
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Cause the porn of course is amazing.</v>

396
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:12.903
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

397
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.081
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

398
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>If anything is going to drive VR and I hope everything drives Vr,</v>

399
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.550
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be the fucking porn because the porn that is shot for Vr is very,</v>

400
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 1>very close to like experiencing having sex with someone,</v>

401
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 1>obviously minus the body,</v>

402
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

403
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 1>There's nobody there.</v>

404
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 1>There's nobody there.</v>

405
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.980
<v Speaker 1>But it's amazing and it's going to cause a lot of great and hilarious problems.</v>

406
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And I'm excited to hear the outrage that comes from the world when people start</v>

407
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:51.901
<v Speaker 1>realizing that every single person on earth now has access not just to in a</v>

408
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:54.430
<v Speaker 1>voyeuristic way witnessing,</v>

409
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

410
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

412
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 1>that I'm telling you man,</v>

413
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.570
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

414
00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.403
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

415
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.870
<v Speaker 2>this girl's acids and sane and so she's right in front of you,</v>

416
00:13:02.871 --> 00:13:03.261
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

417
00:13:03.261 --> 00:13:05.330
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing a good job with us cause it's got to,</v>

418
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

419
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.380
<v Speaker 1>that's just how it,</v>

420
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.951

00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:08.490
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

423
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.910
<v Speaker 1>you have to use virtual desktop to bring those two things together.</v>

424
00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:16.911
<v Speaker 1>Like the porn that you download is broken up and stereoscopic.</v>

425
00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:19.620
<v Speaker 1>So the VR goggles bring it together</v>

426
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:20.221
<v Speaker 2>to kill you.</v>

427
00:13:20.221 --> 00:13:23.450
<v Speaker 2>You have to get specific programs that are designed for this,</v>

428
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:24.284
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

429

434
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.850
<v Speaker 2>guys that are watching it.</v>

435
00:13:31.851 --> 00:13:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Like we're watching this guy who is sitting on his bed and like,</v>

436
00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:37.130
<v Speaker 2>he's looks like he's doing everything to keep from coming in his pants.</v>

437
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.241
<v Speaker 2>He's lab like,</v>

438
00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:39.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever watch porn like that.</v>

439
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.770
<v Speaker 2>There's like sheer joy and him watching that porn,</v>

440
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.780
<v Speaker 2>like what you're talking about is something that's very different than watching</v>

441
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.810
<v Speaker 2>a two dimensional screen.</v>

442
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

443
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Speaker 1>it's as different as sax and watching a two dimensional screen,</v>

444
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 1>except there's no body there.</v>

445
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:55.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

446
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you are in,</v>

447
00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.311
<v Speaker 1>you look,</v>

448
00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 1>or you can look around,</v>

449
00:13:58.691 --> 00:13:59.524
<v Speaker 1>you can like,</v>

450
00:13:59.560 --> 00:13:59.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>

452
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 1>let's say there was a,</v>

453
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:03.671
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

454
00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this shit.</v>

455
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.730
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine watches it,</v>

456
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.630
<v Speaker 1>but let's say,</v>

457
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 1>let's say that there was a,</v>

458
00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

459
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.620
<v Speaker 1>let's say that there was a,</v>

460
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:12.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

461
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

462
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

463
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 1>in a VR porn experience,</v>

464
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:15.671
<v Speaker 1>there's a girl,</v>

465
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>he's giving you a blow job while another girl is shoving her pussy in your face.</v>

466
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 1>You can actually look up and see her pussy,</v>

467
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 1>not her pussy.</v>

468
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.880
<v Speaker 1>You can look around her pussy and see that,</v>

469
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 1>see your face looking down at you,</v>

470
00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 1>just like it was really happening.</v>

471
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's Vr porn.</v>

472
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.713
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's,</v>

473
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.640
<v Speaker 2>you can look at her pussy and then you can go back to the other girls talking.</v>

474
00:14:37.641 --> 00:14:38.001
<v Speaker 2>Your Dick,</v>

475
00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:38.834
<v Speaker 2>you give,</v>

476
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.681
<v Speaker 2>you can move anywhere.</v>

477
00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:41.240
<v Speaker 2>You could stare at her feet if you're a Weirdo</v>

478
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.600
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

479
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.250
<v Speaker 1>if you just were a fan of feet</v>

480
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.063
<v Speaker 1>either way,</v>

481
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.000
<v Speaker 1>either way.</v>

482
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.481
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

483
00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:48.870
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

484
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:49.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

485
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:49.711
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

486
00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:50.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's a game changer.</v>

487
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a game changer,</v>

488
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:52.191
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

489
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a game changer and it's one of the many freedoms the virtual reality's</v>

490
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 1>offering people.</v>

491
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like you are saying,</v>

492
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.440
<v Speaker 1>who wants to,</v>

493
00:14:59.440 --> 00:14:59.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

494
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 1>like even just watching a movie in two D in your virtual reality room,</v>

495
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.110
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty awesome.</v>

496
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't have the greatest apartment,</v>

497
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

498
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.840
<v Speaker 1>But you put on VR goggles and suddenly your apartment has transformed into a,</v>

499
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 1>into a massive,</v>

500
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>beautiful space.</v>

501
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.390
<v Speaker 1>And the HTC vive,</v>

502
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:24.170
<v Speaker 1>it comes with like Vr home and there's two different versions.</v>

503
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 1>But when you go into this space,</v>

504
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.960
<v Speaker 1>you feel that same sense of expansiveness that you get from being in a big</v>

505
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.014
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

506
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.471
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

507
00:15:33.471 --> 00:15:34.730
<v Speaker 1>your body's still like,</v>

508
00:15:34.731 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 1>feels like it's,</v>

509
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

510
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you're in a,</v>

511
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you still feel that weird sense of freedom that you feel when you're in a big</v>

512
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 1>space and you're not there.</v>

513
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful,</v>

514
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:45.501
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

515
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the most liberating,</v>

516
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.120
<v Speaker 1>incredible technologies.</v>

517
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that a lot,</v>

518
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>some people are giving it a little bit of a hard time right now because they see</v>

519
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 1>the game from Youtube and they think those graphics look like Shit.</v>

520
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:00.891
<v Speaker 1>But let me tell you,</v>

521
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:01.724
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

522
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.740
<v Speaker 1>do Minecraft and Vr like I,</v>

523
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:05.250
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

524
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I did Minecraft in Vr.</v>

525
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Speaker 1>I play my graft at VR regularly now.</v>

526
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 1>But you do Minecraft and Vr and when suddenly you're perched on the edge of a</v>

527
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:19.391
<v Speaker 1>cliff looking down on some hyper colored underground river,</v>

528
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.070
<v Speaker 1>your body initially reacts in the same way or reacts to being at the edge of a</v>

529
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:25.904
<v Speaker 1>real cliff.</v>

530
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Your balance gets weird.</v>

531
00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:27.411
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

532
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:27.801
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

533
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

534
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:28.940
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

535
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.320
<v Speaker 1>It's that real.</v>

536
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the vive.</v>

537
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 1>The HTC vive is in fucking saying,</v>

538
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

539
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to show you man.</v>

540
00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:38.834
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

541
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.100
<v Speaker 1>it just works.</v>

542
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.610
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

543
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mess up.</v>

544
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Like anytime I want to now I can go.</v>

545
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I've,</v>

546
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I've made a room in my house where now I can just put on these goggles and I'm</v>

547
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:50.980
<v Speaker 1>instantly in.</v>

548
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh fucking,</v>

549
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a game called Hover junkers,</v>

550
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 1>which is so fun.</v>

551
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.021
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

552
00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:57.854
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

553
00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

554
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

555
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.230
<v Speaker 1>you could probably pull it up.</v>

556
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:05.360
<v Speaker 1>You ride around like it knows how big the spaces that what's called your place</v>

557
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:06.920
<v Speaker 1>space that knows how big it is.</v>

558
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.220
<v Speaker 1>So you're riding in a craft in this place,</v>

559
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:15.221
<v Speaker 1>space shooting weapons at people flying around in these other things.</v>

560
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

561
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 1>It's so you could like,</v>

562
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:20.390
<v Speaker 1>you could all go in your garage and you could,</v>

563
00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:20.661
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

564
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:24.320
<v Speaker 1>the garage would become the environment where you're playing your game.</v>

565
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:24.891
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

566
00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:25.191
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

567
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not in your garage anymore.</v>

568
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.420
<v Speaker 1>You're flying around in that fucking thing shooting at people,</v>

569
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.790
<v Speaker 1>which means you actually have to be good at shooting.</v>

570
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to be able to aim,</v>

571
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:35.480
<v Speaker 1>this isn't like pressing buttons.</v>

572
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Like you need to know how to fire at least at some Sunday.</v>

573
00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>What are you holding you holding a fake gun?</v>

574
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.821
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

575
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:44.120
<v Speaker 1>you're holding these controllers that feel exactly like a fucking,</v>

576
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 1>they feel very close to a gun and it's got haptic technology.</v>

577
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:48.590
<v Speaker 1>So when you're shooting,</v>

578
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:49.424
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

579
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if this would actually teach you how to shoot better.</v>

580
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.200
<v Speaker 1>They have a,</v>

581
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 1>they have a great archery program.</v>

582
00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

583
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 1>is it making your art tree better?</v>

584
00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

585
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.430
<v Speaker 1>it's making me not do archery because just do it.</v>

586
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 1>It's way easier.</v>

587
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Are you good at it?</v>

588
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Are you good at this archery?</v>

589
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

590
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>it me doing real archery jet definitely translated into me playing look up the,</v>

591
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to keep asking you to look up stuff.</v>

592
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

593
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Look up,</v>

594
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

595
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.483
<v Speaker 1>archery.</v>

596
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.650
<v Speaker 1>The lab VR.</v>

597
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.750
<v Speaker 1>This is one of my favorite archery programs.</v>

598
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.970
<v Speaker 1>They also have a VR boxing,</v>

599
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:22.080
<v Speaker 1>which I haven't tried yet,</v>

600
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.670
<v Speaker 1>but which I'm excited about because that seems like you could really train</v>

601
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 1>people to learn how to box.</v>

602
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.191
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

603
00:18:31.191 --> 00:18:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

604
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is,</v>

605
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:36.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

606
00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:36.531
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

607
00:18:36.531 --> 00:18:40.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a different archery program than the one that look up the lab.</v>

608
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

609
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.531
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

610
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:43.660
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

611
00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.750
<v Speaker 1>it's valve look up valve archery.</v>

612
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:46.584
<v Speaker 1>Vr.</v>

613
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:48.571
<v Speaker 1>Now there is,</v>

614
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:48.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

615
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>This one's a really fucking fun man.</v>

616
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:51.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

617
00:18:51.741 --> 00:18:53.750
<v Speaker 1>this one is fucking cool.</v>

618
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.951
<v Speaker 1>You just shoot it.</v>

619
00:18:54.951 --> 00:18:56.850
<v Speaker 1>These little guys who were trying to infiltrate your,</v>

620
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

621
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.020
<v Speaker 1>so you're shooting at things.</v>

622
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

623
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's so game.</v>

624
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

625
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.231
<v Speaker 1>My God.</v>

626
00:19:03.231 --> 00:19:04.820
<v Speaker 1>And you are you pulling a bow back?</v>

627
00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:04.941
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

628
00:19:04.941 --> 00:19:05.840
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing in your head?</v>

629
00:19:05.841 --> 00:19:07.250
<v Speaker 1>So you have two controllers,</v>

630
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:08.390
<v Speaker 1>you're pulling them back.</v>

631
00:19:08.391 --> 00:19:09.131
<v Speaker 1>There's haptics,</v>

632
00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:11.080
<v Speaker 1>so it vibrates according to this,</v>

633
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.040
<v Speaker 1>the tension of the bow string.</v>

634
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.390
<v Speaker 1>And then when you want an Arrow,</v>

635
00:19:14.391 --> 00:19:18.290
<v Speaker 1>you're reaching behind your back and pulling it from behind your back.is nuts,</v>

636
00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:18.471
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

637
00:19:18.471 --> 00:19:18.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

638
00:19:18.771 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 1>it's so fun.</v>

639
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it actually could help your archery skill for sure.</v>

640
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.390
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is it's really weird because you get used to like,</v>

641
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

642
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.050
<v Speaker 1>it's different because you use a compound bow,</v>

643
00:19:29.051 --> 00:19:29.421
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

644
00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:29.721
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

645
00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:29.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

646
00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:30.061
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

647
00:19:30.061 --> 00:19:30.681
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of same.</v>

648
00:19:30.681 --> 00:19:31.760
<v Speaker 1>You get used to like,</v>

649
00:19:31.761 --> 00:19:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I have a place on my cheek where I put my point.</v>

650
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.020
<v Speaker 1>The anchor point changes cause the goggles right up here.</v>

651
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.950
<v Speaker 1>So you have to get new anchor point.</v>

652
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's still pretty fucking fun.</v>

653
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:43.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

654
00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:47.420
<v Speaker 1>how often you get to shoot at things in and like an archery range like this?</v>

655
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:47.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

656
00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:48.830
<v Speaker 1>this is wild.</v>

657
00:19:48.831 --> 00:19:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder,</v>

658
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.270
<v Speaker 1>that means they should definitely be able to do something like this for a like</v>

659
00:19:53.271 --> 00:19:54.170
<v Speaker 1>compound balls.</v>

660
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

661
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.180
<v Speaker 1>definitely go deer hunting with it.</v>

662
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.120
<v Speaker 1>There's another archery program that you can get on steam.</v>

663
00:19:59.121 --> 00:20:00.500
<v Speaker 1>That looks pretty cool.</v>

664
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

665
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name of it though,</v>

666
00:20:02.421 --> 00:20:04.550
<v Speaker 1>but it looks a little bit more,</v>

667
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:05.241
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

668
00:20:05.241 --> 00:20:06.074
<v Speaker 1>realistic.</v>

669
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:06.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

670
00:20:06.321 --> 00:20:07.580
<v Speaker 1>they have an archery program.</v>

671
00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:11.450
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find his archery program where you shoot at us a virtual screen.</v>

672
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.000
<v Speaker 1>You actually shoot a real bow at uh,</v>

673
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.370
<v Speaker 1>these images on a screen and this,</v>

674
00:20:16.371 --> 00:20:17.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

675
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:17.600
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

676
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you go to like in front of like a giant movie theater type thing and you stand</v>

677
00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:23.420
<v Speaker 1>in front of this thing and these animals walked by.</v>

678
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:23.541
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

679
00:20:23.541 --> 00:20:24.021
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

680
00:20:24.021 --> 00:20:27.560
<v Speaker 1>And they run from you and they hide and you got to sneak up on them and shoot</v>

681
00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:28.394
<v Speaker 1>arrows at them.</v>

682
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:28.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

683
00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure this will be translated into VR.</v>

684
00:20:30.831 --> 00:20:31.341
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you,</v>

685
00:20:31.341 --> 00:20:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

686
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.720
<v Speaker 1>if I was,</v>

687
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.590
<v Speaker 1>if I were a young man,</v>

688
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I would be developing shit for Vr.</v>

689
00:20:35.571 --> 00:20:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

690
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Developing.</v>

691
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

692
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:37.881
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

693
00:20:37.881 --> 00:20:38.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not a developer.</v>

694
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.913
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

695
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.300
<v Speaker 1>there's so many ideas that you will have when you try these goggles on where</v>

696
00:20:44.301 --> 00:20:44.781
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like,</v>

697
00:20:44.781 --> 00:20:44.931
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

698
00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Ha,</v>

699
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.700
<v Speaker 1>this needs to exist in the world.</v>

700
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Get this shit developed man,</v>

701
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to like,</v>

702
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things that once you experience it where like,</v>

703
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:53.891
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

704
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 1>someone needs to build this.</v>

705
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Someone like for example,</v>

706
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.370
<v Speaker 1>a fucking boxing game,</v>

707
00:20:58.371 --> 00:21:00.010
<v Speaker 1>he's nodding in the,</v>

708
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:00.850
<v Speaker 1>in the one hour,</v>

709
00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I think I got a demonstration of it.</v>

710
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I was just sitting there asking the guy,</v>

711
00:21:03.581 --> 00:21:05.290
<v Speaker 1>so what about when we're,</v>

712
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 1>someone gets a hold of this and they start thinking about doing this thing and</v>

713
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:11.380
<v Speaker 1>what about when rockstar gets it and then they start thinking about making grand</v>

714
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:12.010
<v Speaker 1>theft auto this way.</v>

715
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.221
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

716
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:12.590
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

717
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:13.261
<v Speaker 1>you're exactly,</v>

718
00:21:13.261 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 1>your brain just take,</v>

719
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.423
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

720
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 1>fallout is coming for the vive,</v>

721
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 1>which is going to be pretty fucking cool.</v>

722
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.050
<v Speaker 1>But dude for the,</v>

723
00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:24.670
<v Speaker 1>and they have like a a boxing program that looks like it's still in development,</v>

724
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.930
<v Speaker 1>but a fucking a real boxing program because it tracks the controllers perfectly</v>

725
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:31.720
<v Speaker 1>in real time.</v>

726
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 1>So you could actually learn how to box.</v>

727
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.143
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

728
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 1>someone needs to build a real,</v>

729
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.620
<v Speaker 1>not only learn how to box,</v>

730
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.250
<v Speaker 1>but you could train with the great boxers like you could throw kicks to.</v>

731
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:42.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

732
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:44.200
<v Speaker 1>you would have to have something on your foot.</v>

733
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.550
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to have another edition.</v>

734
00:21:45.551 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 1>It was like that could be done boots right?</v>

735
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Easily man.</v>

736
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Easily kind of sneakers.</v>

737
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 1>You get a great fucking workout too.</v>

738
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:52.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

739
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:53.181
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

740
00:21:53.181 --> 00:21:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Remember when people were doing dance dance revolution,</v>

741
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 1>they lost tons of weight.</v>

742
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

743
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.680
<v Speaker 1>there was a huge thing a lot of guys lost and gals lost a ton of weight off that</v>

744
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:03.290
<v Speaker 1>dance dance revolution again,</v>

745
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.480
<v Speaker 1>cause it was so fun to do.</v>

746
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

747
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:08.950
<v Speaker 1>that's what's funny about Vr is that right now when people think of a video</v>

748
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.823
<v Speaker 1>Gamer,</v>

749
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:10.510
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

750
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hear someone say,</v>

751
00:22:11.771 --> 00:22:14.440
<v Speaker 1>oh they are lean and Tan and they like her deck.</v>

752
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.700
<v Speaker 1>They have such dexterity.</v>

753
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.870
<v Speaker 1>But now when you think of someone who's great at Vr,</v>

754
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:20.880
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna.</v>

755
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be in fucking jail.</v>

756
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.650
<v Speaker 1>There's the box and program.</v>

757
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to download it.</v>

758
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:27.250
<v Speaker 1>The creators of this or seem like they're super cool.</v>

759
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I think I could get a good workout with this.</v>

760
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:30.730
<v Speaker 1>They have VR pool top.</v>

761
00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

762
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't want that pools for real.</v>

763
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:34.571
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

764
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:37.930
<v Speaker 2>the thing about this is this is something that you could do on your own and get</v>

765
00:22:37.931 --> 00:22:38.621
<v Speaker 2>a workout in.</v>

766
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:38.940
<v Speaker 2>What I,</v>

767
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.850
<v Speaker 2>what I find interesting about this too is you could tune a dude up and you don't</v>

768
00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:45.520
<v Speaker 2>feel bad about it right now.</v>

769
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.990
<v Speaker 2>What you need to do eventually is they're going to have something that looks</v>

770
00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:50.351
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

771
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:51.161
<v Speaker 2>but it's a robot.</v>

772
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Like both things.</v>

773
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Like you have an a thing that you can actually hit.</v>

774
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Well now you could just,</v>

775
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you could already,</v>

776
00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a way that you could hang a bag and um,</v>

777
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:01.690
<v Speaker 1>cause like,</v>

778
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:01.931
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

779
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 1>so when I,</v>

780
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:03.814
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

781
00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.100
<v Speaker 1>when I'm talking about southern,</v>

782
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.943
<v Speaker 1>the hits back,</v>

783
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:06.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

784
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:06.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

785
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.480
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

786
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:07.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

787
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be something that</v>

788
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to have a lot of power.</v>

789
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.040
<v Speaker 2>They could have like a really mushy arm and it knows how to move the way,</v>

790
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.460
<v Speaker 2>the way you move,</v>

791
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.390
<v Speaker 1>like it's actually a throwing punches at you.</v>

792
00:23:20.391 --> 00:23:21.530
<v Speaker 1>So if it hits you,</v>

793
00:23:21.531 --> 00:23:22.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not hurting you.</v>

794
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.391
<v Speaker 1>You know what that could be,</v>

795
00:23:23.391 --> 00:23:23.810
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

796
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:28.810
<v Speaker 1>it could be like a haptic face mask that registers the punch and vibrates so</v>

797
00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:30.860
<v Speaker 1>that you could feel it,</v>

798
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

799
00:23:31.371 --> 00:23:31.491
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

800
00:23:31.491 --> 00:23:32.810
<v Speaker 1>and wherever it hits you.</v>

801
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.550
<v Speaker 2>But it also could be like some sort of a robot that has inflatable arms and the</v>

802
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:42.190
<v Speaker 2>inflatable arms move with the program.</v>

803
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.070
<v Speaker 2>So as you're looking at Apollo creed in front of you,</v>

804
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.180
<v Speaker 2>when he snaps his jab out at you pop,</v>

805
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 2>he is,</v>

806
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>he's throwing this like spongy,</v>

807
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 2>almost like a inflatable raft balloon arm.</v>

808
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

809
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 2>like when you're little kids.</v>

810
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

811
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Inflatable balloon toys.</v>

812
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

813
00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

814
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not gonna hurt you at all.</v>

815
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:01.990
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to touch your face.</v>

816
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 2>It'd be fucking incredible.</v>

817
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:03.610
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

818
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:04.700
<v Speaker 2>and what's in,</v>

819
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:05.421
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to see,</v>

820
00:24:05.421 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

821
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.640
<v Speaker 2>is people are going to get really good at this shit.</v>

822
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're good at shooting and VR minus like the half to the gun and the</v>

823
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 2>real kick of whatever gun in the real world are you using [inaudible] it's going</v>

824
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:16.424
<v Speaker 2>to translate.</v>

825
00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
