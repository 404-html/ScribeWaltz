64
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>accusing him of eating her pussy</v>

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 3>tiger cats all in.</v>

149
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:02.330
<v Speaker 3>The last thing was um,</v>

150
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Olivia dawn back then it says that I wanted to eat her pussy.</v>

151
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:05.881
<v Speaker 3>They let him go on.</v>

152
00:04:05.881 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 3>And I have never said that in my life tour.</v>

153
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:09.274
<v Speaker 3>I would never do that.</v>

154
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm happily married.</v>

155
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 3>I've got more than enough to eat at home.</v>

156
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Unscripted nails,</v>

157
00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:17.370
<v Speaker 2>every word of it.</v>

158
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.360
<v Speaker 2>And the best part about that video is after he leaves,</v>

159
00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:21.320
<v Speaker 2>one of the reporters goes,</v>

160
00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love that guy.</v>

161
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.171
<v Speaker 2>One of the report,</v>

162
00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:25.004
<v Speaker 2>it says it.</v>

163
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like finally something's happening.</v>

164
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.150
<v Speaker 2>And he's naming names.</v>

165
00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:29.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

166
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:32.180
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you learn is politician is keep it vague.</v>

167
00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:32.871
<v Speaker 2>Keep it general.</v>

168
00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:34.280
<v Speaker 2>This guy's going like at Billy,</v>

169
00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:35.450
<v Speaker 2>the waiter down there,</v>

170
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.150
<v Speaker 2>he said that I was doing lines and the</v>

171
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>

172
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.480
<v Speaker 2>most likely you're doing lines,</v>

173
00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 2>especially if there's a video of you smoking crack,</v>

174
00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:43.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

175
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.810
<v Speaker 2>He admits to that.</v>

176
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

177
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.060
<v Speaker 2>He admits to the video of him smoking crack.</v>

178
00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:47.751
<v Speaker 2>He's beautiful.</v>

179
00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:49.730
<v Speaker 2>He is a beautiful man.</v>

180
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

181
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.283
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

182
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.130
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

183
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.963
<v Speaker 2>he does good.</v>

184
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.801
<v Speaker 2>These are good.</v>

185
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:55.910
<v Speaker 2>He has gone through the roof with him as the mayor.</v>

186
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.721
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bad man.</v>

187
00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:59.960
<v Speaker 2>He's also a guy who came up through going to the projects,</v>

188
00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 2>helping out the working poor and you know,</v>

189
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.380
<v Speaker 2>being an inspiration.</v>

190
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.220
<v Speaker 2>I think he coaches a football team and the reason why he's an off his</v>

191
00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:10.520
<v Speaker 2>favoribility rating is not that fucking low considering.</v>

192
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.750
<v Speaker 2>And it's because the poor people remember where this guy came from and he,</v>

193
00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:18.410
<v Speaker 2>they know what he's done for that and they'll overlook who gives a shit.</v>

194
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Nobody really should give a shit the crack.</v>

195
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

196
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.251
<v Speaker 2>the rest of it.</v>

197
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

198
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.910
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of funny that it's cracked too.</v>

199
00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:29.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like you went for the most ghetto of ghetto drugs and he did it with a</v>

200
00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:31.460
<v Speaker 2>bunch of black people and they got videos of him.</v>

201
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

202
00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:34.970
<v Speaker 2>does he not know what a fucking cell phone is where they're holding a cell phone</v>

203
00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:35.804
<v Speaker 2>in front of him?</v>

204
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Look at Mike Tyson.</v>

205
00:05:36.951 --> 00:05:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Shit's the best part where he said he wants to fight Mike Tyson.</v>

206
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:40.311
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

207
00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll kill Mike Tyson.</v>

208
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:42.200
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

209
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

210
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:43.820
<v Speaker 2>you haven't seen that and that's the best one.</v>

211
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.983
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>

212
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

213
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

214
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.800
<v Speaker 2>I've seen one where he challenged some guy too.</v>

215
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm an MMA fight.</v>

216
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.103
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's it.</v>

217
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.690
<v Speaker 2>It challenged.</v>

218
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

219
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I've only watched like five seconds of it.</v>

220
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:54.450
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

221
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 2>this guy's crazy.</v>

222
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.031
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

223
00:05:56.031 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Jason Ellis,</v>

224
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.030
<v Speaker 2>he's a mayor.</v>

225
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

226
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Umay your,</v>

227
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean we had Marion Barry,</v>

228
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 2>but that guy was like not like this.</v>

229
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have the dimensions that this guy had.</v>

230
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Well he also does not have the ability to own it.</v>

231
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Marion Barry lied about it all.</v>

232
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Like Marion Barry was on opening a and Anthony and I got to ask him some</v>

233
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.520
<v Speaker 1>questions and uh,</v>

234
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I was one yes in person,</v>

235

<v Speaker 1>as close as you are to me.</v>

236
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

237
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>what about the crack thing when they caught you smoking crack?</v>

238
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew he only had like five minutes and I was like,</v>

239
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I am going to ask this like right away.</v>

240
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't like beat around the bush.</v>

241
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.001
<v Speaker 1>He's in and out.</v>

242
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>He's doing a bunch of different reviews.</v>

243
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.681
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

244
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>what was that about?</v>

245
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:32.121
<v Speaker 1>What was going on there?</v>

246
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

247
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

248
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>they did not know whether or not what I had was crack.</v>

249
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

250
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>What they have is a video.</v>

251
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Me Smoking.</v>

252
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.411
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

253
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:40.131
<v Speaker 1>but what was it?</v>

254
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:40.964
<v Speaker 1>Was it crack?</v>

255
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Like wouldn't,</v>

256
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.311
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't answer.</v>

257
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:44.144
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't say,</v>

258
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.040
<v Speaker 1>listen man.</v>

259
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

260
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I got a little crazy.</v>

261
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:46.941
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

262
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:47.774
<v Speaker 1>I smoked a little crack.</v>

263
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what you should never said</v>

264
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.911
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

265
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:53.451
<v Speaker 1>Lines.</v>

266
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 1>That's an outright lie.</v>

267
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>It's an insult.</v>

268
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>My friend is not a prostitute.</v>

269
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.181
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you have to see,</v>

270
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 1>your friend is not a prostitute.</v>

271
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Nice man by name.</v>

272
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.000

275
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.443
<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson.</v>

276
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.573
<v Speaker 3>He is</v>

277
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 3>walking around like this.</v>

278
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.403
<v Speaker 3>Fucking,</v>

279
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.661
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

280
00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:46.494
<v Speaker 3>he's coked up.</v>

281
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:46.741
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

282
00:07:46.741 --> 00:07:48.000
<v Speaker 3>how come I haven't seen this?</v>

283
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.203
<v Speaker 3>Looks like</v>

284
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.250
<v Speaker 3>everyone in the room and he keeps on saying brother like brother</v>

285
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.730
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes</v>

286
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>now because of this video,</v>

287
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the side of the people trying to get them out of office</v>

288
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.150
<v Speaker 1>because of that video.</v>

289
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I officially think he's out of control.</v>

290
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think he was out of control before.</v>

291
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just being silly man.</v>

292
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Somebody from Toronto that I know,</v>

293
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:34.710
<v Speaker 2>it says actually he knows that this drug dealer that's friends with him and</v>

294
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>

295
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.720
<v Speaker 2>That's not calling in to the podcast on now.</v>

296
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I think they already have talked to drug dealers and I think this is like known</v>

297
00:08:41.071 --> 00:08:42.810
<v Speaker 2>in Canada that like this is just ridiculous.</v>

298
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Problem is a fat guy.</v>

299
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Dom is dangerous.</v>

300
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Like thinking he can actually beat up Mike Tyson and it only needs this 15</v>

301
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 1>minutes and I'll have him down.</v>

302
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Rip His eyes out like,</v>

303
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.663

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 2>delusional.</v>

308
00:08:57.901 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're so confident now.</v>

309
00:08:59.131 --> 00:08:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

310
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

311
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.850
<v Speaker 2>cause that's the dumbest Shit I've ever heard.</v>

312
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.043
<v Speaker 2>Politicians,</v>

313
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 2>the mood,</v>

314
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 2>like the decisions they make in their lives,</v>

315
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 2>the fucking balls that they just cheating while in office when you think that</v>

316
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 2>everything's being examined as cameras on you all the time and you're going to</v>

317
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 2>fucking cheat and you think,</v>

318
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:14.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

320
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I think they've always done it.</v>

321
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I think guys like,</v>

322
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.531
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

323
00:09:18.531 --> 00:09:18.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

324
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 2>the Clinton types are the JFK types that,</v>

325
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>have this like lust for it.</v>

327
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's always been what they got away with.</v>

328
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 2>It's always been a part of it.</v>

329
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Someone's always swept it under the rug and so they,</v>

330
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 2>they've always kept going and like they like it so much they don't want to stop.</v>

331
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 2>They liked the power of it,</v>

332
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 2>but no one's ever been like,</v>

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.613
<v Speaker 2>how old's Rob Ford?</v>

399
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I think he's four.</v>

400
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 2>He looks old and 54 50 can remember being on a coke Jag and pacing like that and</v>

401
00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 2>saying shit like I'm a bad mother.</v>

402
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Felt like I remember being in that space.</v>

403
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

404
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.830
<v Speaker 2>let me stop you.</v>

405
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.120
<v Speaker 2>You were 19 right?</v>

406
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Big Fuck right.</v>

407
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.740
<v Speaker 2>44 44 44 Jesus Christ.</v>

408
00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:36.574
<v Speaker 2>It looks like shit.</v>

409
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

410
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was deep in his fifties so what happens to rob forward over the</v>

411
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.650
<v Speaker 2>next year is different.</v>

412
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:44.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

413
00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:45.461
<v Speaker 2>most likely,</v>

414
00:11:45.461 --> 00:11:45.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

415
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.660
<v Speaker 2>But Canada is different when it comes to their ability to get people out of</v>

416
00:11:49.661 --> 00:11:50.260
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

417
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>You can't just pull something out of office for conduct if they don't any</v>

418
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>of the state laws,</v>

419
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 1>if they don't like get in trouble,</v>

420
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:58.474
<v Speaker 1>steal money.</v>

421
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 1>It was like a lot of things that you have to have done to get them out of</v>

422
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

423
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.930
<v Speaker 1>So right now they're just sort of taking away his power.</v>

424
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 1>They're just slowly but surely making him a puppet mayor.</v>

425
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 1>They removing his power,</v>

426
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:15.030
<v Speaker 1>so that gets weird because then you sort of like crippling your own sort of</v>

427
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 1>economy and you're,</v>

428
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.550
<v Speaker 1>you're crippling your own government.</v>

429
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know if that's going to work.</v>

430
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Most people would quit,</v>

431
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.010
<v Speaker 1>but this guy's not good,</v>

432
00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 1>so I got to quit.</v>

433
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.101
<v Speaker 1>He'll never quit.</v>

434
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:24.934
<v Speaker 1>He's suing them.</v>

435
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.710
<v Speaker 1>He's going to sue them to keep his job,</v>

436
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>but they should show that video and then have an expert come in and you're like</v>

437
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 1>a teddy atlas and explain what would happen if Mike Tyson and him got into an</v>

438
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:35.770
<v Speaker 1>actual ring together.</v>

439
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Does this make sense or would you categorize a person that's 44 years old?</v>

440
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 1>It looks like there's 60 that's clearly coked out of their mind.</v>

441
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 1>It looks like they ate a beach ball.</v>

442
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.870
<v Speaker 1>D would you categorize that as delusional to the utmost?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bring in Dr drew.</v>

444
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.600
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to just bring in a few fight experts,</v>

445
00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.340
<v Speaker 1>just bringing Teddy Atlas and Jim Lampley and have them describe and then have</v>

446
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson and then tell him though,</v>

447
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:02.580
<v Speaker 1>theory athlete.</v>

448
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.413
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

449
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.120
<v Speaker 1>have him laugh and</v>

450
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:13.610
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
