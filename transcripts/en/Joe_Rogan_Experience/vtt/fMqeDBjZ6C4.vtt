17
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.460

<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

45
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's been a bunch of controversy</v>

46
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think may have people called me.</v>

47
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Dude when he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just got this.</v>

48
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>I just got this last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May Have touched on.</v>

49
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>I might have given them one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you one if you want.</v>

50
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I got some extra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

51
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I got my girlfriend here once she got on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>

52
00:01:55.931 --> 00:02:00.931
<v Speaker 1>then I know what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything many times rather than </v>

53
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>blindly times on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cantaloupes in the microwave.</v>

54
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I only discovered like 12 months ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Japanese toilets all have a </v>

55
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>shoot water into your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

56
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 1>So Ivan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what my ass in Japan for the last 10 </v>

57
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 1>months because it shoots water in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and cleans your house yet.</v>

58
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>But that's really the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had to go and uh,</v>

59
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>warms a seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Warmers.</v>

60
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>The seat tilts from side to side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you shift back a little bit more,</v>

61
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>it goes from your so shoots onto your </v>
<v Speaker 1>bolts.</v>

62
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.130
<v Speaker 1>So the Japanese tourists can fumble your</v>
<v Speaker 1>balls,</v>

63
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you're lonely nights on the road and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fondled and get the moisturizer.</v>

64
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you do from the bull </v>
<v Speaker 1>senseless men on the road.</v>

65
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>So I prepare for fight commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you prepare?</v>

66
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you prepare it to like sit down with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

67
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everything there is to know about</v>

68
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>all these guys that are fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

69
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that I appreciate about </v>

<v Speaker 1>conversation and he just puts it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>

139
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I could appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

140
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.510
<v Speaker 1>every second word is an ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a bad word,</v>

141
00:05:58.511 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>a taboo word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like nigga,</v>

<v Speaker 1>people in Australia,</v>

144
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.480
<v Speaker 1>but every sixth word doesn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't really know.</v>

145
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>So it's like americans calling someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>an abo,</v>

146
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.770
<v Speaker 1>aba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aba,</v>

147
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.610
<v Speaker 1>aboriginal aboriginal ebo.</v>

148
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you call someone,</v>

149
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.460

<v Speaker 1>that nigger is going to kill me.</v>

153
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.980

<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing as call them and </v>

<v Speaker 2>I know it's creepy,</v>

232
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.910
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of them don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about marsh lots,</v>

233
00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:53.911

234
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:53.911
<v Speaker 2>conversation really about martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 2>and dana is so competitive that he does </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this environment where he feels </v>

237
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.040
<v Speaker 2>like they should pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ufc first and then if they don't,</v>

238
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.380
<v Speaker 2>he's not very happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see is the,</v>

239
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.180
<v Speaker 2>it's the promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the one you go to a plantation,</v>

240
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 2>that attitude in the pushing it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as the reason why this fucking </v>

241
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 2>sports gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why it's going Australia,</v>

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 2>he's not lazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's taken on all fronts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

244
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough for journalists,</v>

245
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

246
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 2>in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 2>but theRe are soMe fucking talented guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>

248
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like josh gross is a talented </v>

249
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:31.840
<v Speaker 2>journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's honest aBout shed.</v>

251
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.970
<v Speaker 2>He's sometimes he's a little hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical,</v>

252
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes guys get like critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>about dudes abilities and characters and</v>

253
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:42.141
<v Speaker 2>they try to say something bitchy because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone puts in a bad performance </v>

254
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:42.141
<v Speaker 2>they'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel like,</v>

255
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:47.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's their job to be critical and to be </v>

256
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.030
<v Speaker 2>shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter,</v>

257
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.570
<v Speaker 2>bitter to fucking wrote about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the keY perfect prison.</v>

258
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 2>Perfect of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what do you say about like a cro cop</v>

259
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:55.890
<v Speaker 2>in amir fight when cro cop in me or </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight man,</v>

260
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.690
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of positive things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

261
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 2>The positive thing to say is the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>

262
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:04.731
<v Speaker 2>Of course frank mir landed a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>knee and put krakow away and then </v>

263
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:04.731
<v Speaker 2>finished them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

264
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:06.450
<v Speaker 2>jumped all over him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good thing to say.</v>

265
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:09.150
<v Speaker 2>But for everything up before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what cota writer say,</v>

266
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they just start going off about,</v>

267
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the just the worst possible shit that </v>

268
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.430
<v Speaker 2>they could think of.</v>

269
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with frank mir and how,</v>

270
00:11:17.151 --> 00:11:22.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this attitude and cro cop </v>

271
00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Speaker 2>should hang it up and they'll just write</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most bitter fucked up shit.</v>

272
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the human drama is far more</v>

273
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 2>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real drama of that fight,</v>

274
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.550
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a strange fight,</v>

275
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 2>man that fought the liked each other or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something came out and he said,</v>

276
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 2>even if I lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get cut from you have </v>

277
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

278
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 2>When I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

279
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fucking saY this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fully.</v>

280
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came out and said one of the websites</v>

281
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:42.930
<v Speaker 2>like medical essays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I lose,</v>

282
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:44.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't get cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

283
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.370
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fucking watch that </v>

284
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.370
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

285
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.741
<v Speaker 2>Because already I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if you've that give you a </v>

286
00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:51.741
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

287
00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if he really said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I these words maybe misconstrued very </v>

288
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 2>could be taken out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you lose this fight,</v>

289
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 2>do you think you'll be kicked out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ufc?</v>

290
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marco says he won't be kicked out of the</v>

291
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:03.040
<v Speaker 2>ufc if he loses his fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Journalism sometimes is that bad?</v>

292
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.280
<v Speaker 2>So misconstrued saved exactly what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly said and I was like,</v>

293
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

294
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 2>you're missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has been the big difference,</v>

295
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:17.431
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Between commentatIng outside of America </v>

296
00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:17.890
<v Speaker 2>and then recently coming onto the </v>
<v Speaker 2>american scene.</v>

297
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could people that sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and watch the broadcast and </v>

298
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.491
<v Speaker 2>analyze every fucking word and pause and</v>
<v Speaker 2>breath you take and then dissect that </v>

299
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 2>down to the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad and it's negative,</v>

300
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 2>but I also think it's good for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

301
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

302
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot from shitty people </v>
<v Speaker 2>online saying shitty things because you </v>

303
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:40.690
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst case scenario,</v>

304
00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 2>what can they attack you on?</v>

305
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Is there any validity in this total </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of shit was saying terrible things</v>

306
00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:51.511
<v Speaker 2>about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do they have a point and if they do </v>

307
00:12:51.511 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 2>have a point then you can like snatch </v>
<v Speaker 2>victory from the older negative bullshit</v>

308
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:57.931
<v Speaker 2>by using and improving it and why if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>use a positively it x is a watch dog for</v>

309
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:02.040
<v Speaker 2>your own abilities and your appearances </v>
<v Speaker 2>on her toe to total console.</v>

310
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I get personal freedom out of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the shittiest,</v>

311
00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:10.351
<v Speaker 2>nastiest things that like I know just </v>
<v Speaker 2>some desperate angry fuck has and </v>

312
00:13:10.351 --> 00:13:14.761
<v Speaker 2>turning it into a positive thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have this little game that I </v>

313
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:14.761
<v Speaker 2>played with because it's very dIfficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

314
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I want to do like solen bob and on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck is that when you read,</v>

317
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.590

<v Speaker 2>it's was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do?</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's going to be douche bags no </v>

327
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:54.540

<v Speaker 2>because we're finally getting to see </v>

339
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:31.261
<v Speaker 2>stars.</v>

340
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:32.980
<v Speaker 2>much more likely to be believing their </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I got a newspaper,</v>

344
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:44.650
<v Speaker 2>it had to be like big news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like roman polanski type news to make it</v>

<v Speaker 3>she'd stuck a tampon to fire up her </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>

473
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.680
<v Speaker 3>She asked doctor need to get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had to give up the pliers,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the tongues and go into the skills </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking kevin,</v>

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.180
<v Speaker 3>She came back the next month with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same problem and she was coming back for</v>

00:20:42.181 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 3>four months in a row with the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

478
00:20:44.401 --> 00:20:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Sticking your tampon to far per month to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to pull it out.</v>

479
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.680
<v Speaker 1>So eventually dr nick realize that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

480
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:56.310
<v Speaker 1>because he'd never looked her in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face because you're not really pulling </v>

481
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.370
<v Speaker 1>shit out of her tampon this time he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's deciding to hang herself.</v>

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I could just pinch your legacy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think it might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was,</v>

689
00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.190
<v Speaker 2>there's two parts of the gardens is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller part in the bigger part.</v>

690
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much space they had.</v>

691
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I barely remember it,</v>

692
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.910
<v Speaker 2>but when I came back to do as a standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

693
00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

694
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:13.010
<v Speaker 3>no much more aware of what was going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I drove up I drove up the west </v>

695
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.610
<v Speaker 3>side highway and saw it for the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

696
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.220
<v Speaker 3>I remember going,</v>

<v Speaker 3>how fucking big is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why did they keep building here?</v>

698
00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:22.130
<v Speaker 3>If you been to tokyo know you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>been yet.</v>

699
00:30:22.131 --> 00:30:26.090

<v Speaker 3>40 minutes or an hour and it's still </v>

701
00:30:31.091 --> 00:30:33.950
<v Speaker 3>built up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skyscrapers they never fucking in.</v>

702
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.220
<v Speaker 3>You look out your window and all tHe way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the fucking horizon.</v>

703
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.150
<v Speaker 3>All you see is concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is fucking that.</v>

704
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Is it bigger than New York?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's be a land wise.</v>

705
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:50.220

<v Speaker 3>million of the fuckers in tai chi man </v>

<v Speaker 3>imagine?</v>

707
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:58.690
<v Speaker 3>You've got shavaya crossing the busiest </v>
<v Speaker 3>crossing in the world and fucking </v>

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.600
<v Speaker 3>But In Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one jay walks.</v>

710
00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.780
<v Speaker 3>I'd been walking at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning when I'm jet lagged for </v>

711
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:07.850
<v Speaker 3>4:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>

712

<v Speaker 3>There's not a car in sight for fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles and I'll be standing next to a </v>

<v Speaker 3>jaywalk 4:30</v>

<v Speaker 3>overly polite utopia.</v>

722

748
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Some of the people don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting that is,</v>

749
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.490
<v Speaker 2>who don't know k one because most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people like in the ufc is striking.</v>

750
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 2>That's what the average person like </v>
<v Speaker 2>striking people,</v>

751
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 2>boo when shit goes to the ground happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

752
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>For those people that are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just want to watch some violence,</v>

753
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.780
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is more violent in k one </v>

<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck is more volume than </v>
<v Speaker 2>alistair overeem?</v>

755
00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking carry.</v>

756
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Somebody in cracked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cracked.com</v>

757
00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:12.131
<v Speaker 2>wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he was genetically </v>

758
00:33:12.131 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 2>engineered to fuck your girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it was cracked.com.</v>

759
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:18.191
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm crediting the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it looks to these </v>

760
00:33:18.191 --> 00:33:21.761
<v Speaker 2>fucking frigging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>WhIch leads me to the question now </v>

761
00:33:21.761 --> 00:33:23.831
<v Speaker 2>because when we spoke last time on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice versus the whole rage then was </v>

762
00:33:23.831 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 2>fetal versus brock and we spoke a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about final versus broken and you know,</v>

763
00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:31.190
<v Speaker 2>I have to fight all these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fights lost its luster completely.</v>

764
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 2>So now everyone is like overeem versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>brock.</v>

765
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over.</v>

766
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I want to see overeem versus fate or </v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

767
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I want to say that alice said once that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight badly,</v>

768
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:46.660
<v Speaker 2>like he is all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did the voice versus alistair </v>

769
00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.460
<v Speaker 2>overeem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shuttered in Korea and um,</v>

770
00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.700
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really wants to fight.</v>

771
00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.470
<v Speaker 2>Find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing with alistair overeem,</v>

772
00:33:51.471 --> 00:33:54.830
<v Speaker 2>you gotta fucking take him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all that talk of standing.</v>

773
00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.010
<v Speaker 2>There's all out the window now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be the guys can stand without</v>

774
00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 2>alastar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like chuck stood with him for a bit.</v>

775
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Chuck actually shot in for a take down </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

776
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:07.270
<v Speaker 2>You know the problem with dallin starr </v>
<v Speaker 2>was always that he was trying to make </v>

777
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:07.270
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>

778
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was always the problem and he </v>

779
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:11.981
<v Speaker 2>wasn't dedicated like he is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once I motherfucker went up to </v>

780
00:34:11.981 --> 00:34:11.981
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight and started getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>dedicated.</v>

781
00:34:11.981 --> 00:34:16.390
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's scariest thing is like last week </v>

782
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:17.120
<v Speaker 2>and he knocked out ben edwards had bins </v>
<v Speaker 2>in nausea and I've been commentating him</v>

783
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:19.390
<v Speaker 2>for like six overcoming tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough,</v>

784
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:20.960

<v Speaker 2>three clean shots.</v>

786
00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:30.191
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is that usually lsj would </v>
<v Speaker 2>get away with a lot because of his </v>

787
00:34:30.191 --> 00:34:34.151
<v Speaker 2>strength any size alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now he's technique is just superb </v>

<v Speaker 2>level of k one that he's achieved.</v>

802
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.500
<v Speaker 2>And the level of mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

803
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:07.850
<v Speaker 2>because we've always had guys who say </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

804
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a real,</v>

805
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:10.730
<v Speaker 2>he's a really good striker and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are for,</v>

806
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:15.731
<v Speaker 2>for mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but als stars are really good striker </v>

807
00:35:15.731 --> 00:35:15.731
<v Speaker 2>for key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

808
00:35:15.731 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 2>But who can adjust to mma striking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very impressive man,</v>

809
00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the distancing,</v>

810
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.400
<v Speaker 2>the footwork is all completely different</v>
<v Speaker 2>from mma structure.</v>

811
00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:27.450
<v Speaker 2>TaIwan striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to swing between them at the two </v>

812
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:27.450
<v Speaker 2>highest levels is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

813
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:27.950
<v Speaker 2>is an insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

814
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.840
<v Speaker 2>treated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he put it to brett rogers.</v>

815
00:35:29.841 --> 00:35:30.950
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

816
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.530
<v Speaker 2>he fucking threw him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

817
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:38.400
<v Speaker 2>it was what it was before he threw him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was fucking up on his feet.</v>

818
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.580
<v Speaker 2>He hit brett rogers with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ducked under a right hand.</v>

819
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:46.581
<v Speaker 2>I hit him with a leg kick and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>popped out of the way and you could see </v>

820
00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:46.581
<v Speaker 2>the look on roger's face.</v>

821
00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:48.610
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a job.</v>

822
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.790
<v Speaker 2>am I doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a jolt to like,</v>

823
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

824
00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:54.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody ever kicked him like that before.</v>

825
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.500
<v Speaker 2>To me it was just luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

826
00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I'll just bend over to get fucked in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass because it's going to be less </v>

827
00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:00.520
<v Speaker 2>painful than the beating you're about to</v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

828
00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave's that shin into that meet bob baum</v>

829
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 2>and there was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that look on roger's facebook site for a</v>

830
00:36:07.681 --> 00:36:09.250
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You saw this fLashlight.</v>

831
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.730
<v Speaker 2>God damn.</v>

833
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:19.070
<v Speaker 2>I'd be cleaNs up on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big problem to me that there's </v>

834
00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 2>all these organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was just a ufc,</v>

835
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 2>we will know who is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But alastar would not have gotten to </v>

836
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.480
<v Speaker 2>become our star if it wasn't for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting all these other organizations.</v>

837
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:32.481
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not enough fights in the </v>

838
00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:32.481
<v Speaker 2>ufc.</v>

839
00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough shows.</v>

840
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.720
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only so many shows.</v>

841
00:36:33.721 --> 00:36:38.721
<v Speaker 2>Like we need other organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just wish they could fucking just </v>

842
00:36:38.721 --> 00:36:40.530
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to work it out where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get to fight each other.</v>

843
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.000
<v Speaker 2>We'll come together as friends for one </v>
<v Speaker 2>night for one night.</v>

844
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:48.230
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe you and I could come and </v>

845
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.230
<v Speaker 2>take together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

846
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.230
<v Speaker 2>for one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have to be.</v>

847
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:52.940
<v Speaker 2>The problem is the ufc is such a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger name and there were so much more </v>

848
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.631

<v Speaker 2>which is like build up the enemy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

967
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Watching that ring side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was surreal.</v>

00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:39.700
<v Speaker 2>It's happy that we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pulled it off in volumes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>also middle.</v>

973
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:47.291

<v Speaker 2>The one not with fighter actually loses </v>

974
00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:51.011
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's as opposed to never have been </v>

975
00:41:51.011 --> 00:41:51.011
<v Speaker 2>president if he was ever fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You were there.</v>

977
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:56.350
<v Speaker 2>It's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can appreciate all the other ones </v>

978
00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:56.350
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

979
00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:56.350
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a special athlete.</v>

980
00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:56.690
<v Speaker 2>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting guy.</v>

981
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:59.780
<v Speaker 2>To a very fascinating personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

982
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line is the only way to get </v>

983
00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.791
<v Speaker 2>through a guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're doomed because you've got to </v>

984
00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:08.501
<v Speaker 2>train with a guy like we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he was training with guys like </v>

985
00:42:08.501 --> 00:42:08.501
<v Speaker 2>we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would hear about it.</v>

986
00:42:08.501 --> 00:42:08.501
<v Speaker 2>We would hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

987
00:42:08.501 --> 00:42:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

988
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 2>he just went down and he's spending </v>
<v Speaker 2>three weeks,</v>

989
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:14.690
<v Speaker 2>so with is going to work on his guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

990
00:42:14.691 --> 00:42:19.691
<v Speaker 2>you don't hear about all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's basically working with these </v>

991
00:42:19.691 --> 00:42:21.821
<v Speaker 2>guys that are pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're decent and he's got so much </v>

992
00:42:21.821 --> 00:42:24.851
<v Speaker 2>confidence because he's undefeated in 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and he thinks he can just fall </v>

993
00:42:24.851 --> 00:42:25.190
<v Speaker 2>into her garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be just punched him in the face.</v>

994
00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

995
00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.440
<v Speaker 2>it was a capital mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man and I,</v>

996
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 2>that's on another level.</v>

997
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:36.130
<v Speaker 2>You don't appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've rolled with guys like for doing </v>

998
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:36.130
<v Speaker 2>before and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

999
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:36.530
<v Speaker 2>not that level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like john jacques machado,</v>

1000
00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:41.531
<v Speaker 2>he's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's that level as far as like </v>

1001
00:42:41.531 --> 00:42:41.531
<v Speaker 2>international and they just run through </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1002
00:42:41.531 --> 00:42:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean just slap shit on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you haven't felt that level,</v>

1003
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.690
<v Speaker 2>if you're not in there all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>training with that,</v>

1004
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get overconfident.</v>

1005
00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I bet anybody that fade or puts in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard or if it get in,</v>

1006
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 2>theodore gets in someone's guard in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

1007
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet he just runs through betty.</v>

1008
00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Just postures up breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody probably taps in with triangles,</v>

1009
00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:06.180
<v Speaker 2>but he slaps that shit like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>octopus from hell's just pitching gulen </v>

1010
00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:13.170
<v Speaker 2>fucking attacks and adjusts and attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every time theodore defends,</v>

1011
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 2>he gets deeper in the hole and fight or </v>
<v Speaker 2>held on for as long as he could,</v>

1012
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:16.220
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1013
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.320
<v Speaker 2>But when he broke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

1014
00:43:18.321 --> 00:43:21.840
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking tapping was going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John broke his arms,</v>

1015
00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:24.350
<v Speaker 2>were about to go fate or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad motherfucker,</v>

1016
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 2>but he just made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1017
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:30.550
<v Speaker 2>he needs it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody needs to work with the best </v>

1018
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.550
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be that everybody was,</v>

1019
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:32.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be able to have like this little</v>

1020
00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:35.000
<v Speaker 2>camp and it was just you and a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>other guys that you train with.</v>

1021
00:43:35.001 --> 00:43:36.890
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think you can rock it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anymore.</v>

1022
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I think the levels just gotten too high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You everyone's got to train with the </v>

1023
00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:45.491
<v Speaker 2>best guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the reason why golden glory in </v>

1024
00:43:45.491 --> 00:43:48.101
<v Speaker 2>holland have so much success in k one </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also mixed martial arts because the </v>

1025
00:43:48.101 --> 00:43:51.641
<v Speaker 2>best guys are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not only and they'll fight each </v>

1026
00:43:51.641 --> 00:43:51.641
<v Speaker 2>other and they'll fight each other and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like semi shell now start.</v>

1027
00:43:51.641 --> 00:43:54.050
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna fight each other to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and that will go for broke.</v>

1028
00:43:54.051 --> 00:43:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Errol zimmerman fought semi shelter </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier this year and he went for,</v>

1029
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.540
<v Speaker 2>went for broke on semi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not under both from the same gene</v>

1030
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:02.000
<v Speaker 2>and when I spar together over in </v>
<v Speaker 2>holland,</v>

1031
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.180
<v Speaker 2>this sparring sessions are as hard as </v>

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:11.421
<v Speaker 1>hours it does is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it heats the thc to a point where it </v>

1160
00:50:11.421 --> 00:50:15.111
<v Speaker 1>doesn't burn the plant material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it burns off the tfc and makes a </v>

1161
00:50:15.111 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 1>vapor out of it and visible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot see It.</v>

1163
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Exhaling any smoke enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of see it,</v>

1164
00:50:22.521 --> 00:50:24.230
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look.</v>

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.920
<v Speaker 1>You get used to like see you smoke a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joint.</v>

1166
00:50:25.921 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 1>You take a deep breath,</v>

<v Speaker 3>burning of the plant to.</v>

1172
00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:41.840

<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

1173
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I wonder if there's a psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect from the actual burning of the </v>

1174
00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:50.201
<v Speaker 3>leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe together those things like </v>

<v Speaker 2>I would guess something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the equation was involved.</v>

1227

<v Speaker 2>A dude and money.</v>

<v Speaker 3>roy.</v>

1277
00:56:26.041 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 3>It's because I used to editor a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilding magazine back in the day,</v>

1278
00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:33.601
<v Speaker 3>so I used to interview a lot of female </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilders and they cleat comes like </v>

1279
00:56:33.601 --> 00:56:34.630
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a small dick.</v>

1280
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.760
<v Speaker 3>but they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>

1281
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:42.030
<v Speaker 3>I never fucked anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Builders told being in the industry is </v>

1282
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:43.300
<v Speaker 3>like fire the horniest fucking cans out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1283
00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:48.340
<v Speaker 3>female bodybuilder fAster and because </v>
<v Speaker 3>all you need to do is touch the big </v>

1284
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 3>penis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cliteracy and I basically have an orgasm</v>

1285
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.400
<v Speaker 3>like insanely sexually excited get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the doctor,</v>

1286
00:56:57.821 --> 00:57:02.821
<v Speaker 3>a doctor will put a woman on </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone for something like some </v>

1287
00:57:02.821 --> 00:57:06.511
<v Speaker 3>sort of an ailment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually they've got skin disease when </v>

1288
00:57:06.511 --> 00:57:06.511
<v Speaker 3>they're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the girls will go on on a,</v>

1289
00:57:06.511 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 3>on steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on testosterone.</v>

1290
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:13.591
<v Speaker 3>It's a shame because one of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a photographer back home and when </v>

1291
00:57:13.591 --> 00:57:18.211

<v Speaker 3>beautiful young girl.</v>

1293
00:57:18.211 --> 00:57:20.590
<v Speaker 3>But then she started to develop skin </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems and bad acne.</v>

1294
00:57:20.591 --> 00:57:24.100
<v Speaker 3>That was something hormonal and she had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go on steroids to get rid of it.</v>

1295
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And then now she's fucking fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ugly,</v>

1296
00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:28.480
<v Speaker 3>like bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poor thing.</v>

1495
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for doing nothing.</v>

1496
01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.270
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing to what we call an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

1497
01:05:58.271 --> 01:06:00.220
<v Speaker 1>A dole bludger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1498
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of those.</v>

1499
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Does that keep everybody calm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's always something.</v>

1500
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're a fucking loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always have something you don't have</v>

1501
01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:07.930
<v Speaker 1>to rob and steal.</v>

1502
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.360
<v Speaker 1>And do you know because you're an </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for that.</v>

1503
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Is there an argument for the idiots are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always going to be idiots.</v>

1504
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Losers are always going to be losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just if you give a little bit money,</v>

1505
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

1506
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:22.530
<v Speaker 1>This is this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least they have something invested </v>

1507
01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:22.530
<v Speaker 1>back into the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's usually invested.</v>

1508
01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Well unless you're a drug dealer will </v>
<v Speaker 1>purchasing alcohol,</v>

1509
01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:29.170
<v Speaker 1>but it's far too easy that if there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>too many.</v>

1510
01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Is that a strategy though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1511
01:06:31.371 --> 01:06:36.371
<v Speaker 1>like let's let people be fucking losers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just take care of them and then </v>

1512
01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:37.390
<v Speaker 1>there'll be less crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that makes sense?</v>

1513
01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1514
01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dole didn't come in until like 1975 </v>

1515
01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.440
<v Speaker 1>when there was a lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have it then if people are </v>

1516
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:49.440
<v Speaker 1>forced to catch up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1517
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:49.720
<v Speaker 1>People are forced to pay their own way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1518
01:06:49.721 --> 01:06:52.140
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is though,</v>

1519
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy who's on the doll and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>will not get off his ass to get a Job.</v>

1520
01:06:56.290 --> 01:07:01.290
<v Speaker 1>He will not even go for job interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he claims that he's got some disability </v>

1521
01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:01.290
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he hasn't.</v>

1522
01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.500
<v Speaker 1>And It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.560
<v Speaker 1>my fucking Texas that I work hard for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>money and I've got to give money to the </v>

<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay fucking Texas.</v>

1525
01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Then going your pocket to pay you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink alcohol at home all day.</v>

1526
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>But I would rather give my tax money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>losers and drunks and idiots and people </v>

1527
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.090
<v Speaker 1>had no ambition whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then to war,</v>

1528

<v Speaker 1>He goes to war and there's nothing I </v>

1530
01:07:28.531 --> 01:07:31.651
<v Speaker 1>could say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather put the fucking loses to </v>

1553
01:08:16.821 --> 01:08:21.821
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why the homeless </v>
<v Speaker 3>population rocketed in the 19 eighties </v>

1554
01:08:21.821 --> 01:08:22.460
<v Speaker 3>just because ronald reagan in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>

1555
01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:27.480
<v Speaker 3>they changed the definition of insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's a lot of people that were in </v>

<v Speaker 3>Exposure to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being homeless.</v>

1561
01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:44.210

<v Speaker 1>feed it,</v>

1706
01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:58.020
<v Speaker 1>take it for a walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you return it to the shop.</v>

1707
01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:01.780
<v Speaker 1>You rent a dog into cat for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1708
01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:04.990
<v Speaker 1>What if you get attached to the dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you develop a relationships in the</v>

1709
01:16:04.991 --> 01:16:09.991
<v Speaker 1>dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you could maybe rent it for two </v>

1710
01:16:09.991 --> 01:16:09.991
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So it really is.</v>

1713
01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean the writing is so different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so completely unrelated.</v>

1714
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:19.290
<v Speaker 1>If you look at like the writing of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1715
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:24.510
<v Speaker 1>all the european countries except for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hungry a couple of days,</v>

1716
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.680
<v Speaker 1>they all share.</v>

1717
01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.840
<v Speaker 1>They use the arabic alphabet that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

1718
01:16:28.841 --> 01:16:33.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all share it and you go to China </v>

1719
01:16:33.841 --> 01:16:33.841
<v Speaker 1>and Korea and Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1720
01:16:33.841 --> 01:16:34.480
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are aliens.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is alien stuff.</v>

1722
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:40.530
<v Speaker 1>This isn't even related to like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew completely independent of the </v>

1723
01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:42.130
<v Speaker 1>european style writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so different.</v>

1724
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:43.420
<v Speaker 1>What a better world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The place will be.</v>

1725
01:16:43.421 --> 01:16:45.620
<v Speaker 1>If everyone spoke one language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it?</v>

1726
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1727
01:16:46.841 --> 01:16:51.841
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cool to watch all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different branches now mad if people </v>

1728
01:16:52.481 --> 01:16:55.390

<v Speaker 1>one single language,</v>

1729
01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.330
<v Speaker 1>people would go to war over eichler </v>

1737
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.560
