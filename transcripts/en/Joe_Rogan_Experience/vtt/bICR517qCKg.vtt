1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism as a religion,</v>

3
00:00:04.451 --> 00:00:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean at least in terms of how we understand religion.</v>

4
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.803
<v Speaker 1>Is it tax free?</v>

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>is it tax free?</v>

7
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you have tax free exemption the same way that other religions too?</v>

9
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.080
<v Speaker 1>We personally don't.</v>

10
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>But you could,</v>

11
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.503
<v Speaker 1>you could do that.</v>

12
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.580
<v Speaker 1>You'll get a fucking chase down,</v>

14
00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:19.414
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

15
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.253
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

16
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>it gets really,</v>

17
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.280
<v Speaker 1>really hairy when you don't want to pay taxes.</v>

18
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

19
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.211
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

20
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:26.044
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

21
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Time to take a little closer look at the Buddhist Geek Organization.</v>

22
00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're doing on Saturday nights there.</v>

24
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.613
<v Speaker 1>Infiltrate.</v>

25
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

26
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I think with anything like Buddhism,</v>

27
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean you inherit,</v>

28
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 2>but choosing that framework we inherit all,</v>

29
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.503
<v Speaker 2>we inherit it.</v>

30
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a lot about um,</v>

31
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.750
<v Speaker 2>religions and spirituality in general that is not,</v>

32
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 2>that I don't personally like,</v>

33
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:47.774
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.733
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

35
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.873
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

36
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that there is a,</v>

37
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a tendency to project,</v>

38
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean you brought in the word divinity,</v>

39
00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 2>so I'll use it like to project our divinity onto the teachers are onto some sort</v>

40
00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 2>of system and um,</v>

41
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.790
<v Speaker 2>it can be disempowering for a lot of people.</v>

42
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 2>People can get trapped and beliefs that you know,</v>

43
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 2>have been carried forward for,</v>

44
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 2>years and centuries that aren't,</v>

46
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 2>isn't forwarding anymore.</v>

47
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

48
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 2>and so that sense like by choosing to go under Buddhism,</v>

49
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 2>we're also choosing to,</v>

50
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.880
<v Speaker 2>work on how we can evolve,</v>

52
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 2>how we think about it.</v>

53
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.140
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that I really like is the,</v>

54
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.150
<v Speaker 2>is the practices themselves,</v>

55
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

56
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 2>the mind training aspect of it.</v>

57
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what's been really beneficial to me and that's one of the reasons why</v>

58
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I've chosen to continue cause if its impact,</v>

59
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Speaker 1>the mind training aspects of it.</v>

60
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.883
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

61
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

62
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.781
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

63
00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is like the tangible benefits of this mind training aspect of</v>

64
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 1>it that you personally experience?</v>

65
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Personally I can say personally I feel much,</v>

66
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 2>much more,</v>

67
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 2>much more open.</v>

68
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more generous,</v>

69
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 2>compassionate.</v>

70
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.860
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot more freedom I can get stuck on the smaller sense of self.</v>

71
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Meaning,</v>

72
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I have these thoughts of unworthiness or self contraction or hatred or any of</v>

74
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

75
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 2>w biological kind of urges and at the same time they're so transient and they're</v>

77
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 2>so not who I am.</v>

78
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 2>And I see that very,</v>

79
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 2>very clearly that it kind of diminishes in just a second.</v>

80
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the good days.</v>

81
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's more intense and I've learned to really work with that and learn</v>

82
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:34.871
<v Speaker 2>how to see clearly what's happening so that I have the freedom to really choose</v>

83
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:40.130
<v Speaker 2>how to live my life in a much more full way.</v>

84
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>That just the evidence that the Internet is real.</v>

85
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the best evidence is that there are people that are just so far</v>

86
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>beyond how fucking smart you think smart is.</v>

87
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like remember when you were like five or six years old,</v>

88
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 1>you had like a lot of times you had like this one kid in the neighborhood that</v>

89
00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was like a little bit bigger,</v>

90
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>a little bit stronger than the other kids and when you would play with them on</v>

91
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:02.801
<v Speaker 1>the field,</v>

92
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>like he'd get like bummed out.</v>

93
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:09.091
<v Speaker 1>Like you get knocked over and shit like remember what you thought that was like</v>

94
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>that was a strong little kid.</v>

95
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>But if you were there right now,</v>

96
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.461
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

97
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:12.911
<v Speaker 1>get out of here.</v>

98
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:13.744

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.083
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

102
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.621
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

103
00:03:18.621 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>it was more secured that he had freckles or something like that.</v>

104
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.281

109
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.000

110
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>like technologically and,</v>

111
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>and just the mental capacity of a super genius in comparison to me.</v>

112
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if I'm that little kid and like if I tried to figure out how the</v>

113
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>fuck they figured out the Internet,</v>

114
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I just be like,</v>

115

<v Speaker 1>It's just so wacky,</v>

148
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>wacky.</v>

149
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 1>So I see we could spend the whole thing talking about this because it's so,</v>

150
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where like,</v>

151
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people in on a joke,</v>

152
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.141
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

154
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 1>just wanting someone to say,</v>

155
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:45.911
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

156
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:46.744
<v Speaker 1>we're just fucking,</v>

157
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>and no one does.</v>

158
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:49.684
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

159
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

160
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>those belief systems,</v>

161
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:54.940
<v Speaker 1>the thing about having those belief systems is that they're very empowering for</v>

162
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>people who believe in him.</v>

163
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

164
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it and go,</v>

165
00:04:58.691 --> 00:04:59.171
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

166
00:04:59.171 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

167
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Fucking planet.</v>

168
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Xenu really insane.</v>

169
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm reading about this after you brought up Excalibur while you were</v>

170
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:08.741
<v Speaker 1>talking about it,</v>

171
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>and I pulled up that website,</v>

172
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>that mock Scientology,</v>

173
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>z new.net.</v>

174
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

175
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:13.451
<v Speaker 1>I've never been there.</v>

176
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

177
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>oh my favorite site.</v>

178
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:15.311
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

179
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>They have everything they have,</v>

180
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.680
<v Speaker 1>they have the entire Scientology like,</v>

181
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 1>like Whoa,</v>

182
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>everything about what they believe.</v>

183
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>All of the operating manual.</v>

184
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I grabbed everything,</v>

185
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>wiki leaks and wasn't looking at that is operating the operating Payton's manual</v>

186
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:31.210
<v Speaker 1>like level three,</v>

187
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>which is apparently where I guess Tom Cruise is like four or five or six or</v>

188
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:36.251
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

189
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:37.490
<v Speaker 1>But he was three a couple years.</v>

190
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Like they have different manuals,</v>

191
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:39.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>so he was three a couple of years ago and now he's four or five or six.</v>

193
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where he's at and I haven't been keeping up with his level what</v>

194
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:45.611
<v Speaker 1>rank is at,</v>

195
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>but I know he's ranked up because they've like given him,</v>

196
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>they made up some new ward for him.</v>

197
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that video that leaked?</v>

198
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.261

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>they made up this thing they'd never had.</v>

202
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a guardian of the galaxy,</v>

203
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of like gave it to him and he was like,</v>

204
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>he's like saying all that shit that made no sense.</v>

205
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>And using all their words and stuff.</v>

206

<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean almost.</v>

214
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.020
<v Speaker 1>It is almost like something that you would,</v>

215
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>you'd see from some artists who's doing so I'm like fucking piece.</v>

00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>It helps my acting if I can pretend to really be into Scientology,</v>

224
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>but this long it's like the dumb and dumber me,</v>
