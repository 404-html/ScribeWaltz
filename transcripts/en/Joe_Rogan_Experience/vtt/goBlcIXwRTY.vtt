<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I feel like all these problems are put there for a reason than</v>

3
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:05.694
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>you're so cute.</v>

6
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I know reason.</v>

7
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

8
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

9
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

10
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Anything is anything a solvable including that happens,</v>

11
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>happens for a reason.</v>

12
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>When that stuff is all annoying.</v>

13
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.491
<v Speaker 1>It's annoying,</v>

14
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>but then it's not right.</v>

15
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

16
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I believe what you're saying.</v>

17
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:21.151
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

18
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's anything.</v>

19
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Any human beings do incredible things,</v>

20
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:26.184
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

21
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Just come up with.</v>

22
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever hear the story about Morse Morse code like that was the most</v>

23
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary is the turning point in history more because if you think about</v>

24
00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

25
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Alexander the Great.</v>

26
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Who was 18,</v>

27
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>20 when it was invented?</v>

28
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I hit it when the first time they actually,</v>

29
00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 18,</v>

30
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>19 years and when the first time they actually had a 10 mile stretch of of wire</v>

31
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>and the guy was able to send a message and before that,</v>

32
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.651
<v Speaker 1>think about this.</v>

33
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:53.484
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>

34
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>the the guy,</v>

35
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>the guy before 18,</v>

36
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:57.361
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

37
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

38
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

39
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>he had to send a message the same exact way.</v>

40
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Alexander the Great did either on horseback,</v>

41
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>either on foot or either by boat.</v>

42
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.613
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

43
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And when Morse code came up and Morris was a guy who was a really,</v>

44
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>really successful painter,</v>

45
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.563
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

46
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And he had nothing to do with electronic magnetic fields or anything.</v>

47
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>He was a really successful painter.</v>

48
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.051
<v Speaker 1>His wife,</v>

49
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>he gets what we get to a letter that his wife is very sick.</v>

50
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>He loved his wife in Connecticut.</v>

51
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>By the time it gets there,</v>

52
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.201
<v Speaker 1>she's not only dead.</v>

53
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>She's been buried and he said,</v>

54
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>this got to be a way I can get information faster because it killed them.</v>

55
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It was this tragedy.</v>

56
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.951
<v Speaker 1>Seven years later,</v>

57
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:32.784
<v Speaker 1>he's on a boat.</v>

58
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>He meets this electromagnetic engineer.</v>

59
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>He starts talking to him.</v>

60
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>He gets fascinated with the idea that maybe I can come up with a way to use</v>

61
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic fields to send a message.</v>

62
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>About 10 years after that,</v>

63
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>he invented something called Morse code.</v>

64
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.533
<v Speaker 1>This painter,</v>

65
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>because he was so heartbroken over his wife and and by the end of the world has</v>

66
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>never been the same.</v>

67
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>That was a bigger communication leap actually than the Internet because it was</v>

68
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>the first time we were able to send instantaneous messages,</v>

69
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.011
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

71
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>and I think five years later we finally had a wire from New York to New Orleans,</v>

72
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>which was so much faster and you could get instantaneous communication in the</v>

73
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>world was never the same,</v>

74
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>and of course we built on that,</v>

75
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>but there's the history,</v>

76
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>so full of individuals that we're trying to solve a problem that seemed</v>

77
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>insurmountable and oftentimes it was because they basically.</v>

78
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

79
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Fleming had a cold.</v>

80
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

81
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

82
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.360
<v Speaker 1>his snot fell in.</v>

83
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>He had all these petri dishes working on different sports and stuff,</v>

84
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.451
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

85
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>he decided to clean stuff out himself.</v>

86
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>He never used to clean his own petri dishes.</v>

87
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.261
<v Speaker 1>He had a cold,</v>

88
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:45.261
<v Speaker 1>is snot fell into one of the moldy dishes and he realized that the bacteria</v>

89
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>under the microscope,</v>

90
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>the mold that killed all the bacteria and he went,</v>

91
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

92
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>That's how he invented a little something called penicillin,</v>

93
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>which then became antibiotics,</v>

94
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>which is why people are alive.</v>

95
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.123
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

96
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>So many.</v>

97
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>So many of these things either happen through accident with individuals or</v>

98
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>people were trying to solve a problem.</v>

99
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:03.560
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

101
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things about life is that you need struggle.</v>

102
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you shouldn't have it,</v>

103
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.743
<v Speaker 1>but you need it.</v>

104
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading this book by Jon Krakauer called under the banner of Heaven,</v>

105
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.790
<v Speaker 2>which is about fundamentalist Mormons.</v>

106
00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:18.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about this?</v>

107
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.380
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

108
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

109
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

110
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Is that like the Jeffries Guy?</v>

111
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

112
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.170
<v Speaker 2>there's A.</v>

113
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.980
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

114
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.611
<v Speaker 2>The jeffries,</v>

115
00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:27.450
<v Speaker 2>which was the Jefferies,</v>

116
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.081
<v Speaker 2>Jefferies Guy,</v>

117
00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:29.550
<v Speaker 2>was the guy that just got arrested.</v>

118
00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:31.110
<v Speaker 2>He was the polygamists.</v>

119
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.471
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

120
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:31.830
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

121
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.663
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

122
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 2>So here's the way it works.</v>

123
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.940
<v Speaker 2>There is in this book it talks about,</v>

124
00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the town,</v>

125
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.140
<v Speaker 2>but there is an area that is run completely by a guy named Uncle Ruan or was run</v>

126
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:47.970
<v Speaker 2>by this guy named uncle rule on who is a mormon fundamentalist.</v>

127
00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:48.181
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

128
00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:53.181
<v Speaker 2>These are these people are rejected by the mainstream Mormons because the</v>

129
00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:55.230
<v Speaker 2>government came in at one point and said,</v>

130
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:56.460
<v Speaker 2>you guys can't be polygamous.</v>

131
00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:57.121
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal.</v>

132
00:03:57.121 --> 00:03:59.370
<v Speaker 2>And so they had to renounce polygamy,</v>

133
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.110
<v Speaker 2>and this was something that,</v>

134
00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:03.030
<v Speaker 2>according to this book Joseph Smith said,</v>

135
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:05.220
<v Speaker 2>was the essence of mormonism.</v>

136
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.780
<v Speaker 2>It's still one of the most deepest,</v>

137
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:10.980
<v Speaker 2>most important parts of mormonism is that you have multiple or what they call a</v>

138
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:12.720
<v Speaker 2>plurality of wives.</v>

139
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.411
<v Speaker 2>Plurality.</v>

140
00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:14.330
<v Speaker 2>That's good learning.</v>

141
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.150
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

142
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.781
<v Speaker 2>and here's the thing,</v>

143
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:17.220
<v Speaker 2>this is why you need a bunch of wives.</v>

144
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.800
<v Speaker 2>If you are a fundamentalist Mormon,</v>

145
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 2>you are only supposed to have sex with your wife when she's,</v>

146
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

147
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.113
<v Speaker 2>oscillating.</v>

148
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Which means if you only have one wife,</v>

149
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you're not only going to have sex a few times a month,</v>

150
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:30.781
<v Speaker 2>once a month,</v>

151
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:31.081
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

152
00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:32.370
<v Speaker 2>a women late once a month.</v>

153
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.450
<v Speaker 2>If you have 15 wives you can fuck every night.</v>

154
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's very important to have as many wives as possible because then you could</v>

155
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:42.390
<v Speaker 2>have sex with them all the time and they're always humping.</v>

156
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of these guys have so many children that one of the,</v>

157
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember which one it was,</v>

158
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:49.050
<v Speaker 2>it might have an uncle ruin.</v>

159
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember which one had so many children that they named them according</v>

160
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:55.741
<v Speaker 2>to the year.</v>

161
00:04:55.741 --> 00:04:57.840
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a born in like 1979,</v>

162
00:04:57.841 --> 00:04:59.130
<v Speaker 2>you are your name would have an a,</v>

163
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.490
<v Speaker 2>so it'd be like Annabel Angus Ra and then you would know what year your kid was</v>

164
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:07.770
<v Speaker 2>born in by the first letter of his name.</v>

165
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.450
<v Speaker 2>That's how many kids are having.</v>

166
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.560
<v Speaker 2>So then you have girls and your girls get to be the age of 14 and you've got a</v>

167
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:17.910
<v Speaker 2>pow like vita 14 year old kid and I was a fundamentalist mormon.</v>

168
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.451
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

169
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:19.284
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

170
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.890
<v Speaker 2>why don't you marry my daughter Laurie?</v>

171
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 2>She just started bleeding and then I would give her to you and you would</v>

172
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:29.130
<v Speaker 2>immediately start fucking her.</v>

173
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.850
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what they're doing out there is like.</v>

174
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:37.851
<v Speaker 2>It's just like just herds and packs of pregnant teenagers that have been</v>

175
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:43.611
<v Speaker 2>impregnated by these older dudes who have so many wives and this shit is.</v>

176
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it's still going on today,</v>

177
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:46.621
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

178
00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:51.210
<v Speaker 2>There's whole communities dedicated to this polygamist lifestyle,</v>

179
00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:55.590
<v Speaker 2>which is a lifestyle that Joseph Smith said was one of the most important</v>

180
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 2>aspects of mormonism according to book.</v>

181
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 2>The other thing about Joseph Smith,</v>

182
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>do you know what he did before?</v>

183
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 2>He found he founded mormonism,</v>

184
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 2>what he was,</v>

185
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 2>what was called like a treasure seeker,</v>

186
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.880
<v Speaker 2>and so you would use magic stones to peer through to that would show you where</v>

187
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 2>secret treasure was buried and he.</v>

188
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 2>There was a huge lawsuit against him because he convinced all these people that</v>

189
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:20.264
<v Speaker 2>he could find.</v>

190
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 2>That was also what he said about the golden tablets.</v>

191
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 2>That was a seer stone and see it through a magic rock.</v>

192
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 2>That's how he could read the golden tablets before he was doing the seer stone</v>

193
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.330
<v Speaker 2>and the Angel Moroni before he's using the seer stone in Angel Moroni came to</v>

194
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

195
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 2>He was actually getting work convincing people like,</v>

196
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:42.291
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

197
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 2>I've got a magic rock and there and I can find your silver for you.</v>

198
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Because there was like a guy who hired him because he knew that there was some</v>

199
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 2>silver hidden up in the hills somewhere and Joseph Smith went around with boards</v>

200
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 2>through the courts and finally after like three months of hiring and by the</v>

201
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 2>month they took him to court and they're like,</v>

202
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:02.541
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

203
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 2>this guy can't really find treasure with that.</v>

204
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:05.114
<v Speaker 2>Rock</v>

205
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

206
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.771
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

207
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 2>he's out there looking every day.</v>

208
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you have loved to seen like a video of him talking of Joseph Smith,</v>

209
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:18.431
<v Speaker 2>like talking and explaining his strategies and what he does and what mormonism</v>

210
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 2>is all about?</v>

211
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

212
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:20.121
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

213
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just love.</v>

214
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 2>I just love that idea of like</v>

215
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

216
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Here's a man who was.</v>

217
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.423
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

218
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.323
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

219
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Let's just admit it.</v>

220
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Here's a man who's like,</v>

221
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 2>just basically like a classic con artists come on man class.</v>

222
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Really telling people you can find treasure with a rock.</v>

223
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever found treasure.</v>

224
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 2>That's something like when I was in the third grade that I would lie about to a</v>

225
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 2>kid in the playground or something,</v>

226
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 2>but this guy was making money off of it.</v>

227
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just very interesting to see something grow roots and flourish in the way</v>

228
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 2>that that mormonism has.</v>

229
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Just with a very simple investigation ended the.</v>

230
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 2>You've got lawsuits.</v>

231
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 2>There's written records against Joseph Smith because he was taken to court for</v>

232
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.063
<v Speaker 2>lying.</v>

233
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.751
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

234
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Itunes or recording to server.</v>

235
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

236
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Server.</v>
