15
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>vampire rules until real recently people got so fucking arrogant.</v>

16
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

17
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.280

<v Speaker 1>Now Vampires are actually your friend and they only eat deer and they don't burn</v>

22
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>when it's sunny out.</v>

23
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>They just glisten and they don't want to be glistening.</v>

24
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>They sparkle Joe.</v>

25
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>They don't listen.</v>

26
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>They sparkle just vampires all of a sudden became cool and you could fuck them.</v>

27
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah dude.</v>

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

32
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>The fucking interview with a vampire.</v>

33
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

34
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so man.</v>

35
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Because even before interview with the Vampire,</v>

36
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Dracula was very sexual.</v>

37
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Dracula was a hypnotic.</v>

38
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

39
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>he was a very sexual and like a lot of the older movies,</v>

40
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>there was a few of them.</v>

42
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.081
<v Speaker 1>The Gary Oldman.</v>

43
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:04.831
<v Speaker 1>What came first?</v>

44
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Gary Oldman or Anne Rice?</v>

45
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.291
<v Speaker 1>Probably in rice.</v>

46
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

47
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to Gary Oldman Dracula.</v>

48
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I think Anne Rice,</v>

49
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.071
<v Speaker 1>I'm always positive.</v>

50
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:11.331
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

51
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the fucking Old Dracula,</v>

52
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

53
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>the Brahm Stoker Dracula.</v>

54
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

55
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>that was a long traps and the castle didn't he have like there was a room you</v>

56
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>went into and there are all these female vampires.</v>

57
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Runyon hot.</v>

58
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.103
<v Speaker 1>Is that a call?</v>

59
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>and like they were seductive and they would like,</v>

61
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>they were powerful Dracula.</v>

63
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the good point of what everyone's hating on Dracula.</v>

64
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>It's got these hard pitches that want to suck blood.</v>

65
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 1>They're ready to throw it out.</v>

66
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>

67
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Just gets a bone him.</v>

68
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.110
<v Speaker 1>He never bound them in front of you buddy though.</v>

69
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

70
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I guess once you start drinking people's blood that's like way cooler than</v>

71
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.423
<v Speaker 1>bowling and checks.</v>

72
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>He just completely give up on bowling.</v>

73
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the world of vampires,</v>

74
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>it's that is boning the best track live though of all time?</v>

75
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.671
<v Speaker 1>Unquestionably.</v>

76
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It was Gary Oldman.</v>

77
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Bram stoker I sold.</v>

80
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>It's so good that Kiana Reeves can't fuck it up.</v>

81
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I got it like I don't know cause I haven't seen it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>King Kong is not really scary.</v>

189
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a fucking Nosferatu though.</v>

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

203
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>people that want the want romance,</v>

204
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

205
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

206
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.241
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>the thing about the twilight books,</v>

208
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

209
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.920
<v Speaker 1>so I've been told by Mrs Rogan,</v>

210
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

211
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>is that the very romantic,</v>

212
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>unrealistically romantic because he's a vampire and it's like he's got all the</v>

213
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>super power and everything like that.</v>

214
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like he,</v>

215
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:05.240
<v Speaker 1>like he's giving it all up,</v>

216
00:05:05.241 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but just to be with her,</v>

217
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.200
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

218
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's this weird sort of like,</v>

219
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.280
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

220
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>he needs her so much and women love that shit.</v>

221
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just a natural sort of a thing for though.</v>

222
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>So like when you see women that would be waiting in line to go to those movies,</v>

223
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>that just,</v>

224
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>it just hits a chord that we don't,</v>

225
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>we don't have,</v>

226
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>we don't know that court,</v>

227
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>but the Chica wrote that shit knows their cord.</v>

228
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>So she nailed it.</v>

229
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>She talking about the quarter love,</v>

230
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the court of affection and admiration.</v>

231
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Like I think all women want to be,</v>

232
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>the w don't want to be worshiped,</v>

234
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>they think that that's like the most romantic thing for a guy who would do</v>

236
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:44.674
<v Speaker 1>anything for you.</v>

237
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>So he would do anything for that girl in,</v>

238
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.600
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

239
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>in those books.</v>

240
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.800
<v Speaker 1>He would do anything for,</v>

241
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

242
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even want to bite her.</v>

243
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:52.624
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to,</v>

244
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to protect her from everybody who was in love with her.</v>

245
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

246
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>he was like a thousand years old and she's in high school.</v>

247
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really fucking creepy if you stop and think about it.</v>

248
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>He's a thousand years old or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

249
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I tell them she's in high school,</v>

250
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

251

252
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking crazy kind of conversations you're having with her.</v>

253
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

254
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

255
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>it'd be hard enough if you were 30 you were 30 and you're dating a girl in high</v>

256
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:17.421
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

257
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

258
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I got to kill myself.</v>

259
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.453
<v Speaker 1>I can't take it.</v>

260
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk to her.</v>

261
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.300
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking just shows.</v>

262
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.250
<v Speaker 1>All she wants to talk about is Instagram thousand year old per se.</v>

263
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Fucking creeper ups.</v>

264
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>He's a total creeper.</v>

265
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>She could be as great Greg.</v>

266
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he just was frozen for all those years.</v>

267
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Like captain America.</v>

268
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

269
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>this asshole's been alive the whole time and pretend that he's in high school.</v>

270
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>It might be one of the dumbest ideas ever.</v>

271
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>

272
00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 1>He's got magical powers.</v>

273
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>He can fly.</v>

274
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.530
<v Speaker 1>He's flying a fucking high school kid through the trees.</v>

275
00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

276
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Did they fuck?</v>

277
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.601
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

278
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Eventually.</v>

279
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

280
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Later in the boiler spoiler.</v>

281
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.403
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

282
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.303
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>

283
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.540

284
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.790

00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 1>It already happened.</v>

287
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 1>It might have already happened.</v>

288
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I only saw like two of them.</v>

289
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I think there's been three of them.</v>

290
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Put it in her asshole.</v>

291
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they had partial lot to do that.</v>

292
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a sin even for vampires.</v>

293
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.913
<v Speaker 1>Vampires.</v>

294
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.753
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

295
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.773
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

296
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.643
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

297
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Females.</v>

298
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>That project,</v>

299
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.763
<v Speaker 1>we'll cut the shape.</v>

300
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.933
<v Speaker 1>Just stop it.</v>

301
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>They don't even shit anymore,</v>

302
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 1>so it probably drives up nice,</v>

303
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>don't shit.</v>

304
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>When you're eating blood,</v>

305
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.700
<v Speaker 1>they probably barely have to urinate.</v>

306
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>You probably get the exact amount you need.</v>

307
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.613
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that.</v>

308
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine you would get the exact amount you need now,</v>

309
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 1>man of vampires.</v>

310
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Asshole is swollen.</v>

311
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Brogan.</v>

312
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 1>A scene where you walked down into a New York City subway and you saw some crazy</v>

313
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:42.550
<v Speaker 1>looking vampire dude.</v>

314
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 1>You shitting blood,</v>

315
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.990
<v Speaker 1>which is blood squirting out of his chunky cottage cheese blood.</v>

316
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what a vampire looks like.</v>

317
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.003
<v Speaker 1>Tunnel,</v>

318
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>subway tunnel,</v>

319
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 1>just shitting blood,</v>

320
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 1>looking at you and thinking about sucking your blood next.</v>

321
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>It's weird like that's that.</v>

322
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>That's as far as they go.</v>

323
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Like vampires suck your blood.</v>

324
00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst thing they do,</v>

325
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 1>but there's never been like a supernatural creature that won't be like mouth</v>

326
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:10.184
<v Speaker 1>fucks you.</v>

327
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.661
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

328
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:11.931
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

329
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 1>we talked about that before.</v>

330
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>As ridiculous as it is.</v>

331
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I think we actually did talk about this before.</v>

332
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>It must be on my fucking mind,</v>

333
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:19.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

334
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking bat or some creepy for rapes people.</v>

335
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.860
<v Speaker 1>There was mouth rape and dudes,</v>

336
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't use that word,</v>

337
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.630
<v Speaker 1>but it they're a fucking arm.</v>

338
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Horrifying,</v>

339
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>horrifying being.</v>

340
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:31.280
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be a vampire.</v>

341
00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>He could just be some bug,</v>

342
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>some insect or something that came out of the earth and that's how it does it.</v>

343
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:37.364
<v Speaker 1>It just fucking,</v>

344
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.470
<v Speaker 1>it made her,</v>

345
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.850
<v Speaker 1>it leaves off of the,</v>

346
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>it lives off of like people gagging.</v>

347
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.050
<v Speaker 1>It absorbs the</v>

348
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.260
<v Speaker 1>gagging.</v>

349
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.780
<v Speaker 1>It gets power for the trick.</v>

350
00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>The twitching of your body when you're trying to throw up gag pyre pipe is</v>

351
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>clogged by fat cock.</v>

352
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 1>You can't even throw up.</v>

353
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.280
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to throw up and he's just holding the back of your head with Scaly</v>

354
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.113
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>

355
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what they came to do.</v>

356
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>They just came to get head.</v>

357
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>They have a really tough dicks.</v>

358
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Like you really cannot even pierce the skin.</v>

359
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 1>You can bite it as hard as you want.</v>

360
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter when alien's face fuck you.</v>

361
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.531
<v Speaker 1>They just did.</v>

362
00:09:15.531 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>It just goes in.</v>

363
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.840
<v Speaker 1>You accept it and it,</v>

364
00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 1>it just fucks your throat when you try to throw up.</v>

365
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 1>But he can't get past the fat alien cock that's stretching your insides out,</v>

366
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 1>pumping oxygen.</v>

367
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:26.131
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

368
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:27.690
<v Speaker 1>it's keeping you alive in you alive.</v>

369
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Why you suck at Scott's.</v>

370
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 1>It changes your whole,</v>

371
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.390
<v Speaker 1>it blows your lungs out and actually eats them and uh,</v>

372
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.560
<v Speaker 1>converts it to a type of glue that keeps the cock attached to your body to keep</v>

373
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:43.231
<v Speaker 1>you alive.</v>

374
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Cause now you no longer have lungs.</v>

375
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>You get all your oxygen through his cock.</v>

376
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

377
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:55.171
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine?</v>

378
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>That would be the word.</v>

379
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.090
<v Speaker 1>And in some people would say,</v>

380
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

381
00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

382
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I love aliens anyway.</v>

383
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>There's still awesome her teaching us.</v>

384
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

385
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.210
<v Speaker 1>if for him might be really awesome,</v>

386
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe he loves the fact that he's getting the oxygen to that cock.</v>

387
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>You stay alive.</v>

388
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Your body where there's a way you can't really move.</v>

389
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Your arms are flailing and you like him paled,</v>

390
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you just look like a skeleton with a fucking Dildo in its mouth and every year</v>

391
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:22.080
<v Speaker 1>it just goes deeper in your body,</v>

392
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>keeps that keeps growing.</v>

393
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it turns into you,</v>

394
00:10:24.701 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 1>you just turn it in like a cactus like cactus Dick thing.</v>

395
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Sugar Bob Shish Kebab,</v>

396
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Dick Kebab every year the the,</v>

397
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:33.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

398
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 1>the Dick slowly grows inside your body and starts cracking open.</v>

399
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Oregon's and pushing ribs to this side,</v>

400
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>popping and snapping them as it eventually goes through your body.</v>

401
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:46.260
<v Speaker 1>But it does it so slowly that you never actually die,</v>

402
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 1>especially since the,</v>

403
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:47.581
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

404
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:49.290
<v Speaker 1>the deck is providing with oxygen,</v>

405
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.730
<v Speaker 1>but then when it gets to the hat,</v>

406
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 1>to the end,</v>

407
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.600
<v Speaker 1>the deck pops out of your asshole and you deflate like a balloon.</v>

408
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.141
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

409
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:58.310
<v Speaker 1>and that sound is that sound is known as funking.</v>

410
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like the sound of a man's final farm.</v>

411
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no words sound.</v>

412
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like a pinky.</v>

413
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
