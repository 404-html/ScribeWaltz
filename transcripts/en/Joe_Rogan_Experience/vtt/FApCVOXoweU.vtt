00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.820
And we're live.
Hello.
Hi.
Good to see you again.
Great to see you.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.770
What's cracking my Kombucha is cracking.
Did you get the real stuff?
Yes.

3
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:13.570
I have been addicted to this.
I need to start making my own.
Could be shy,

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.270
but I've been drinking this now ever since.

5
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:19.290
You told me about the dark container having more,
you know?
Yeah,

6
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.230
they wouldn't really silly for a while at whole foods.

7
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:26.490
They had a pull all of the dark container ones and then they created a watered

8
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:27.450
down version of it.

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.860
They had to get like a license to sell it because it's more than one half of 1%

10
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:34.950
alcohol.
Right.
I've never heard of anybody getting drunk from it,

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.020
but a a mark Marin tweeted it.
He said,
ah,
I just tried Kombucha.
Is this beer?

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.150
He's like,
I think I have a buzz,
but you have to drink like the shit.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.610
Look what is normal.
Be like 5% alcohol and America,

14
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.470
so you'd have to drink 20 of those to get like somewhat of a bet is to drink a

15
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.890
beer to get a beer.
20 those is a beer and you would be,

16
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.190
you would probably die from drinking too much.

17
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.680
Like we'd be one of those people that dies from too much water.
You know,

18
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.920
that happens.
Have you ever heard it?
You've heard that,
right?
I've heard of that.

19
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:08.520
Yeah.
The woman died in San Jose,
I believe it was.
They had a,

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.060
one of those radio contests and if you drank the most water,

21
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:14.490
you won something like an x box.

22
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:18.180
So she's trying to win an Xbox for a kid and she fucking died.

23
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.430
I haven't heard of it just from drinking.

24
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:24.000
I've heard of it happening after you've exerted yourself like very strenuously,

25
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.770
like after a marathon or something and then you drink a bunch of water and a,

26
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.680
the salts that you basically excrete out,
like you're,
you're totally imbalanced.

27
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.640
But I've never heard of that.
I've heard of it one other time.
Um,

28
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.900
it was a frat thing when they were those Frat,
what are those called?

29
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.770
Hazing.
Hazing.
That,
you know,
when they're,

30
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.850
they're trying to get you to join the Frat.
They get you to do stupid stuff.

31
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:50.580
And one of the things they did is get these guys to drink just gallons of water

32
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.320
and one guy died gang.
Apparently you can die from water,
just plain old water.

33
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.160
You can die from anything.
It's all about the dose.
God dammit.

34
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.270
It's all about the dose.
Um,

35
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.070
sauna since you been here last boy,
um,

36
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.890
I've read so much stuff about the sauna,

37
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.340
about the benefits of the sauna and then you publish that thing saying there's a

38
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:16.170
40% decrease in mortality on a basically a on everything.

39
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.130
Well,
I didn't publish it,
someone else published it but I will,

40
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.610
I'm sorry you tweeted it about,
sorry did,

41
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.580
I wrote an article on some of the health benefits of the sauna and I predicted

42
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:30.240
that I thought it would play a role in longevity based on some other evidence.

43
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.270
And then this study came out showing indeed that there is a link between sauna

44
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:40.500
use and at decrease in all cause mortality.
So people dying from cancer,

45
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.620
from cardiovascular disease,
from a variety of different diseases.

46
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.940
And that was like a big crease,
right?
Yeah.
So,
well,

47
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.280
there was a dose dependent,
um,
decrease in all cause mortality.
So,

48
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.630
so men that used the sauna once a week compared to those that used it two to

49
00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:00.520
three times,
two to three times a week,
they had a decrease,

50
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.720
<v 1>a 24% decrease in all cause mortality and men that used it like four to seven</v>

51
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.720
times a week.
How to 40% decrease in all cause mortality.

52
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.450
So when I say a 40% decrease in all cause mortality,

53
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.870
I mean over the time span that these,
these men were followed,
which was 20 years.

54
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.360
So they're following these men for 20 years.

55
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.620
They were in there between 50 to 65 when the study started.

56
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.650
And those men that had been using this on a more frequently had a 40% reduction

57
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.640
in,
you know,
dying from many causes that aren't accidental.
That's amazing.

58
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.650
Yeah,
it's super,
super cool.
And um,
you know,
one,

59
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:39.640
a part of it,
there's a lot of things going on with the sauna.
I just actually,

60
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.920
the place I'm staying at has a steam shower.

61
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:45.970
So I just had a steam shower before I came here and all endorphin buzzed and it

62
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:49.780
feels like work just as good.
Um,
it's,
you know,

63
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.790
it's doesn't get as hot as like a typical dry sauna where the air is,

64
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.710
it's like 174 79 degrees Fahrenheit,

65
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.610
which is how hot the,
yeah.
Yeah.
That's like,
like in my gym,
that's,

66
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:11.380
that's pretty,
pretty much the temperature.
It's like 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

67
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.130
So it's hot.
Um,
steam showers there,

68
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.940
they get hot and I definitely feel,
you know,
my heart racing.

69
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:21.100
So what happens when you're in the heat is you,

70
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.520
your heart starts to race like much like cardiovascular exercise where your

71
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:29.080
heart starts to beat like between a hundred and sometimes 150 beats,
like,

72
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.190
you know,
so it's like,
it's pretty fast.
And,
um,

73
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.420
part of the benefit of that is you have increased plasma and blood flow to the

74
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:41.980
heart,
so the heart's actually doing less work than it normally would do.
Um,

75
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.581
but that's,

76
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:46.300
and that's part of the cardiovascular benefits that are associated with like

77
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.490
exercise and sauna use.

78
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.230
But the sauna in addition to that has other effects.
So you know,

79
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.770
heat stress is a stress as his exercise and you know,

80
00:04:56.771 --> 00:05:01.771
the stress activates all these stress response mechanisms in the body and,

81
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.290
and that's really good.
And that's part of the benefit from exercise.

82
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:08.500
It's part of the benefit from any type of,
you know,
good stress.

83
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.920
So heat specifically will activate something called heat shock proteins.

84
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.440
So it's a gene that makes something called heat shock proteins.

85
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.680
And there are a class of proteins that are activated by heat.

86
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:23.170
So when you exercise and your core body temperature raises,

87
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.530
they get activated and he chocked proteins are pretty awesome because they are

88
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:33.901
able to prevent a certain type of damage that accumulates in our cell from,

89
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.530
from happening.
And if you think about the causes of aging,

90
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.080
it's an accumulation of damage that's happening in the cell.

91
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.780
Like if you're looking at it at the molecular level,
at the cellular level.

92
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.800
And part of that damage occurs in proteins that we make.
You know,

93
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:52.300
so genes are,
DNA is the genetic code.
It makes RNA,

94
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:56.080
RNA gets translated into proteins and proteins are doing all the work inside of

95
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:57.950
our body.
You know.
So for example,

96
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.760
glutathione peroxidase is a very potent antioxidant.

97
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.290
It's an enzyme that's using glutathione to do all this great antioxidant stuff

98
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.180
that's a proteins to type of proteins.

99
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.920
So proteins in our inside of ourselves as we age,
they start to dysfunction.

100
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:16.400
They start to aggregate the aggregate in our blood vessels can lead to plaque,

101
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:20.150
say aggregate in our brains,
amyloid Beta,
Pratt plaques.
And this happens,

102
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.040
you know,
this increases as we age,
but he,

103
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:26.360
chuck proteins prevent that from happening.
And so heat stress activates them.

104
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.420
And when you,
when you have heat stress and they're,
and they're activated,

105
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:31.610
they're actually activated for a long period of time.

106
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.570
In some cases it can be like a couple of weeks.
So it's,

107
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.420
it's Kinda like you would do this heat stress and then two weeks later and you

108
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:41.480
still have these activated heat shock proteins,
which are,
you know,
making,

109
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.690
preventing all this damage from accumulating in,
in your cells.

110
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.930
What's really interesting is that if you look in like worms or flies,

111
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.780
you expose them to one heat shock,
meaning like you,
you know,

112
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.990
you increase the temperature,
uh,

113
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:58.280
for like 15 minutes and it increases their life span by like 15%.

114
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
So that's pretty cool.
Um,

115
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.160
also people that have a certain variation of the heat shock gene that makes

116
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.750
these proteins,
that makes them active all the time,

117
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.010
they're more likely to be a centenarian so they,

118
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.580
they actually have a higher chance of living to be 100.
So you know,

119
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.300
there's definitely evidence that these heat shock proteins are involved in

120
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:23.480
longevity.
You know,
we know the mechanism,
we know that,
you know,

121
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:27.200
heat helps activate them and they're doing all this good stuff.

122
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:30.530
They also prevent muscle atrophy and that's been shown in mice.
For example,

123
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.220
if you make a mouse in mobile so it can't move like its hind limb for example,

124
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:40.010
for like seven days and you let it like use kind of like a sauna where it's like

125
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:42.860
a whole body,
he chocked for 30 minutes a day.

126
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.630
They are able to regrow their muscles faster and they have less muscle atrophy

127
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:51.710
than mice that are not exposed to the heat but are also in mobile.

128
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.190
So I think the heat shock proteins are one possible way.

129
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:57.140
It plays a role in longevity.

130
00:07:57.141 --> 00:08:00.560
And the other way is by activating this other pathway that's really,

131
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.510
really awesome.
And it's called foxo three and it's a little heavy.

132
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:07.220
I don't want to get too technical here,

133
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:12.110
but it's kind of cool because this foxo three gets activated by exercise.

134
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.550
It gets activated by heat.
And what it does is it like,

135
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.310
it activates this whole host of genes,

136
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.250
genes that are like glue to an antioxidant genes.

137
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:26.420
It activates genes that are involved in repairing damage to your DNA,

138
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:30.590
which can lead to cancer.
It repairs damage to your entire cell,

139
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.130
which can lead to the cell dying.
And if that happens in your stem cells,

140
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:38.660
your stem cell pools go down.
So foxo three,
it's doing so much.

141
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.220
And foxo three,
I've actually worked with it in worms.

142
00:08:43.221 --> 00:08:46.330
Some of the early research I did in aging.
Um,

143
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.820
we could take a warm and make it always have it by genetically engineering it.

144
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:54.710
We could make it always have an active foxo three and these worms live between

145
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:56.520
50 to 100% longer.

146
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.880
So the worm lifespans use around 15 days,

147
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.590
but we it could live to a maximum of 30 days when you have it always having this

148
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:09.090
foxo three active and humans that actually have a variation in this gene.

149
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.080
So variations in genes are what makes us all different,
right?

150
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:16.470
So we all have different variations of genes and um,

151
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.060
if they happen in a percentage of the population that's more than 1%,
it's,

152
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.450
it's called the polymorphism because it's not just random mutation.

153
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.370
Well this foxo three is a polymorphism cause quite a bit of the percentage of

154
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:32.340
the population has a form of it that has an active a lot.

155
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.770
And those people that have it have a 2.7 fold increased chance of living to be a

156
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.190
hundred.

157
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.660
And what happens to people that have this often are they're able to handle

158
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.230
stress better.
So they're able to,
for example,

159
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.690
you've heard of people that are like a hundred and they've smoked cigarettes and

160
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:48.871
you're like,

161
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:53.400
how have you smoked cigarettes for 50 years and live to be a hundred like,

162
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:57.420
what's going on there?
Well,
oftentimes people have this,

163
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.710
this overactive foxo three where they can handle this smoking stress.

164
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.960
They can handle,
you know,
drinking a lot.

165
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:07.530
They can handle just a poor lifestyle because they're able to detoxify things.

166
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:11.040
They're able to clean up the mess,
you know,
get the damage out.

167
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:13.350
And so it's not accumulating and doing all this bad stuff.

168
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.850
So sauna activates that.
Um,
and I think,
and I'm totally speculating here,

169
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:21.600
this wasn't shown in the paper.
It was the paper was an associate of study.

170
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.100
So it basically looked at these about 2000 men that were using the sauna and

171
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.070
then said,
okay,
well in a dose dependent manner,

172
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:30.870
meaning the more often they use the sauna,

173
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.600
the less likely they were to die of cardiovascular diseases.
Pick your,
you know,

174
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:39.540
your choice of,
you know,
heart attacks,
cornea,
coronary artery disease,

175
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:43.080
coronary heart disease,
atherosclerosis,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
cancer.

176
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.240
So these were all down in men that used us on a more frequently.
Uh,

177
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.760
so I think that's pretty cool and I really think part of that is that hormetic

178
00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:55.761
response where you're stressing your body with heat to activate these heat shock

179
00:10:57.271 --> 00:11:01.530
proteins or Fox or three and other things that are then active for a longer

180
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:05.190
period of time and help you deal with stress with the stress of aging that,

181
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.040
you know,
with the stress of breathing and oxygen,
you know,

182
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:11.120
which does a lot of damage.
Just breathing and oxygen,
you know,

183
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.180
and the way we make energy,

184
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:16.320
we use oxygen and we eat food and that's coupled to make energy in that process,

185
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.430
uh,
generates damage just as a metabolic byproduct.

186
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.280
So I think that's,

187
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.850
that's really cool that the sauna is able to activate those really important

188
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:31.680
genetic pathways.
That's fascinating.
Unbelievably fascinating.
Now,
oxygen,

189
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:33.320
is oxygen creeds damaged?

190
00:11:33.321 --> 00:11:38.160
And how does hyperbaric chambers work because it's a more pure,

191
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:42.540
refined or more intense version of oxygen,
compressed oxygen?

192
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.730
I,
I don't know.

193
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:48.660
I think that I'm a little weary of hyperbaric chambers because it is,

194
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.160
it does create damage.
Um,
having more oxygen and,

195
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.130
but it really depends

196
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.080
<v 0>on the context.
Are we talking about,
you know,</v>

197
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:59.650
someone that isn't getting enough oxygen to their brain because the blood,

198
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.350
the blood brain barrier has been damaged.
You know,

199
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:06.490
so in that context hyperbaric treatment can help get more oxygen.

200
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:10.870
So I don't know if hyperbaric treatment is great for like your everyday person

201
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:14.580
because it does,
it does create damage.
More damage.
So,

202
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.220
so weird that it creates damage cause it's being touted as something that helps

203
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:21.430
repair damage.
Like that's where athletes used it.

204
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:25.870
They use it to heal broken bones quicker,
injured tendons,
surgery.

205
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.440
Well yeah.
And that makes sense in a way too because you're,
you know,

206
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:31.990
you're carrying your red blood cells are caring,
you know,

207
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.740
it's more red blood cells are getting carrying goodies to that side of damage.

208
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.230
So it's kind of like a trade off,
you know,

209
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:41.860
but but oxygen itself does cause damage.
Like it just,

210
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:43.510
I think it just depends on the context.

211
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.020
I think some folks even use it for anti aging,
if I remember correctly,

212
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:51.160
that there's some proponents of anti aging treatments using the hyperbaric

213
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:54.010
chamber on a regular basis.
That's interesting.

214
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.630
One of the reasons why I brought it up is because there was an article on Joe

215
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.830
Nemeth,
uh,
Joe Nemeth,
the famous football player.
Um,
do you know who he is?

216
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.780
The name sounds familiar.
How dare you kind of an American art,
you know,

217
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.660
my dad would be so disappointed.
Um,

218
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:15.930
Joe Nemeth was a very famous football player from the 70s who lot of damage,

219
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:19.090
like every football player,
a lot of concussions.
And uh,

220
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:22.540
apparently he has been using the hyperbaric chamber.

221
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.800
I should say it right because I'm not sure if I'm saying hyperbaric or hypo

222
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:27.730
barrack hyper,
but there's two,
right?

223
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.600
There's two different types or would be more oxygen hypo.
Would it be less?
Okay.

224
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.800
So there's two different types of chambers that they have and the less oxygen

225
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:38.950
one is for what benefit?
The less oxygen one.

226
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.400
I'm not sure what they would use that for me is that,

227
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.620
is that you believe so maybe Jamie can find out for us.
Um,
but Joe named was,

228
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:48.080
has been using,

229
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.190
I believe as you've been using the hyper barrack and there was an article on it

230
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.640
that he,
you know,

231
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.650
remarkably because he's in his seventies and most of these football players.

232
00:13:56.651 --> 00:14:00.010
I don't know if you saw that real sports piece with Bryant Gumbel cause we,

233
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.340
we talked pretty extensively about brain damage last time you were here because

234
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.920
it was right after I brought you to a UFC.
Yes.

235
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.560
And you and Dan came back all scrambled.
You'll like,

236
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:11.550
what the fuck did we just watch?
Uh,

237
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:16.950
but the hyperbaric chamber has been helping Joe Nemeth deal with the relatively

238
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:25.380
minor reactions to concussions that he has had because he's pretty lucid and

239
00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:26.400
he's still,
um,

240
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.760
he had some substance abuse problems and things along those lines that I'm sure

241
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:32.950
it probably affected his cognitive function as well.

242
00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:37.951
But as far as a seven year old former professional football player doing pretty

243
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:40.120
well and you know this,

244
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.460
this treatment apparently has really helped him quite a bit.

245
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.850
So it makes sense because in the sense of,
you know,

246
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:50.851
oxygen is required to for metabolism and in order to anything

247
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.530
<v 1>metallic metabolism meaning you need to make energy.</v>

248
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:59.100
So in order to repair a ligament that's been wounded or you know,

249
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.410
brain damage,
anything,

250
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.280
oxygen is part of that component to generate energy,

251
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.480
oxygen plus food,
whether that's carbohydrates or you know,

252
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:13.220
a fatty acids.
It doesn't,
you know,
your,
your energy sourced,
it doesn't matter.

253
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:16.940
Like those two things coupled together is how we make energy.

254
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:20.960
So the more oxygen you have been,
and that's part of how,
you know,
cardio,

255
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:24.590
respiratory fitness comes into play to people that can now breathe in more

256
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:28.070
oxygen and you know,
they're able to actually make more energy.

257
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:31.970
So in that sense it,
you know,
it would help because one,
you're at,

258
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:36.260
you're able to like get the oxygen to your cells,
which have Mitochondria,

259
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:39.440
which is where the energy is made.
The oxygen coupled with the,

260
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.990
the food that you take in.
So that,
that's one possibility that makes sense.

261
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:47.510
And the other would be,
like I said,
with the brain injury where you're,

262
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.260
in some cases people can't,
their blood brain barrier's damage and so they're,

263
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.840
they're not getting enough oxygen into the brain.

264
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.470
And so the hyperbaric training can help get more oxygen to then because the

265
00:15:57.471 --> 00:16:00.230
auction,
you have to get the oxygen to the brain to make energy.

266
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.210
Your neurons need oxygen to make an energy.
So that makes sense.

267
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:06.044
But again,

268
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.150
there's always a byproduct of that metabolic reaction and that that byproduct is

269
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:16.010
damage.
Um,
in the,
in the form of oxygen super oxide,

270
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.930
which is very reactive or hydrogen peroxide,

271
00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:21.800
both those things are produced as a byproduct of using the oxygen for energy.

272
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:27.100
<v 0>How bizarre that oxygen is necessary but yet damaging us at the same time.</v>

273
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.710
<v 1>Yeah,
it's,
it's one of the like main major.</v>

274
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:33.400
Like if you're just looking at a baseline level of,
you know,

275
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.440
of damage that we're all accumulating.
As you know,

276
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.460
the days go on as the weeks go by years,

277
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.010
it's partly just from breathing.

278
00:16:42.011 --> 00:16:46.660
And oxygen and eating food and that process of like creating energy.

279
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.380
There's nothing you can do about it.
And that's part of the aging process.
It,

280
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:54.410
it creates these reactive products that damage to DNA in ourselves that damaged

281
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.850
proteins to damage the whole cell itself.
Um,

282
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.500
and people that have poor metabolism,
inefficient metabolism,

283
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.250
people that have higher levels of inflammation,
it's worse.

284
00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:09.850
So they're making even dare like accelerating that damage.
So

285
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.220
<v 0>is there any benefit health wise to living in an high altitude environment that</v>

286
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.100
as low oxygen?

287
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.900
I don't know because a mountain people strong as fuck.
You know,

288
00:17:18.901 --> 00:17:20.360
you always like think of mountain people.

289
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:25.361
It's like these like really hardy folk that just seemingly can just kind of get

290
00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:31.011
by under extreme circumstances and conditions that us low lying c level folk

291
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.440
struggle at is that is bullshit.

292
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.200
<v 1>Maybe because the altitude is a type of stress that's activating all this stress</v>

293
00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:39.840
response mission,

294
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.890
<v 0>Muslims,
well all the extra blood cells they have,
you know,
that's,</v>

295
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.810
that's the reason why athletes go and train at high altitude.

296
00:17:45.811 --> 00:17:48.090
And have you seen those tents that people sleeping?

297
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.210
It's an thing that a lot of fighters started doing.

298
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:56.211
They started sleeping in these high altitude tent because apparently the way to

299
00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:01.020
do it best is they think you should live at high altitude but train at sea
level.

300
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.820
So if you could like live at a place like big bear where you're at 5,000 plus

301
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:09.780
feet above sea level and then go down to say like,
you know,

302
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.470
Santa Monica or something like that to train where you're at sea level.

303
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.570
So that way you would be able to put out more work output because the fact is in

304
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:21.060
more oxygen rich environment,
you can train harder,

305
00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:24.890
you'll have more energy and then when you recover you're recovering and allows

306
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.800
to an environment.

307
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.670
And apparently that's the best combination as far as athletic results.

308
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.130
And that's been shown Yam,

309
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.290
that's the problem is these protocols and he's like the,
they,
they sort of,

310
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.900
they move with the tides.
You know,
people,

311
00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:43.290
they have these ideas that you got to do it this way and then they change it and

312
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:45.270
they got to do it that way.
Um,

313
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.100
essentially an article on cold water immersion cause some gentleman had written

314
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:54.360
an article on cold water immersion and the negative aspects of cold water

315
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:55.170
immersion,

316
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:59.310
it had benefited somewhat had benefited endurance athletes but didn't it showed

317
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:03.310
negative consequences for strength athletes.
And um,

318
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.930
I've found that to be pretty fascinating too because I know that there's

319
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.960
definitely negative or definitely rather positive benefits of cryotherapy,

320
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.120
which is a different situation because it's not cold water immersion.

321
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.140
You're dealing with 250 degrees below zero for short periods of time and your

322
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:23.490
body develops a producer's side of Keen's right inside I [inaudible] which are a

323
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:24.600
type of protein as well.

324
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.860
And apparently your body really only one wants to produce these when it's cold

325
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:29.694
as fuck.

326
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.730
<v 1>So,
um,
the,
I there,</v>

327
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.780
I first became interested in this,

328
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.960
this cold shock as the scientists called it.
Um,

329
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.530
whether that's by cold water immersion and require therapy or whatever.
Um,

330
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.600
like last January when a paper came out that showed cold,

331
00:19:49.911 --> 00:19:54.830
shocking can regrow synapses that are lost.

332
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.450
And I was like,
Whoa,

333
00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.570
that's really cool because synapses are what connect two neurons together.

334
00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:05.750
And it's essentially when you learn something,
when you experience something,

335
00:20:05.751 --> 00:20:07.730
a synapse forms,
and that's a memory,

336
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.120
whether that's a memory of an experience or it's a memory of something that you

337
00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:14.750
learned,
it's a memory.
And as we age,

338
00:20:14.751 --> 00:20:18.050
we lose synapses,
we lose those memories.
You know,

339
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.900
that's worse with neurodegenerative diseases and things like that.

340
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.830
Traumatic brain injury,
you lose synopsis.
And so I was like,

341
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.850
that's really cool.
That's something about the cold can regrow the synapses.

342
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.960
Well it turns out that like scientist started looking at this by looking at

343
00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:37.910
hibernating mammals.
They're looking at bears and like other rodents that um,

344
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.820
that hibernate or squirrels,
I think they were.

345
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.930
And what they found was that these,
these,
during hibernation,
when it's cold,

346
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.280
they lose between 30 to 40% of their synapses.

347
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.450
And then when it warms up in the spring,
they totally regrow them back.

348
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.910
And so there were scientists were like,
Whoa,
what's going on there?

349
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.650
So they further it did some studies in mice and they showed that if they culled

350
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:04.030
shocked a mouse by exposing it to like what would be like a refrigerator.

351
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:08.080
So like 40 degrees Fahrenheit for like 30 minutes.

352
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.240
Um,
these mice were able to induce what's called cold shock proteins,
which are,

353
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:17.170
I talked about the heat shock proteins will cold shock proteins are part of the

354
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:19.210
stress response because cold is a stress.

355
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.480
And so most things shut down when you're cold except for this class of proteins

356
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:26.920
called cold shock proteins which go up.

357
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:32.460
And apparently there's one specific one called RBM three that goes up in the

358
00:21:32.561 --> 00:21:33.011
brain.

359
00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:38.011
It also goes up in muscle and it is able to basically regenerate these synapses

360
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:42.580
because it trans,
it makes more protein.

361
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:45.340
So it sits there like on the drink dendritic spine,

362
00:21:45.341 --> 00:21:49.090
which is part of the neuron that talks to other neurons and it's able to regrow

363
00:21:49.091 --> 00:21:52.010
this in apps.
So anyways,
I thought that was super cool.
Um,

364
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.470
they were able to show that in mice after just one exposure to this cold shock.

365
00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.650
The caveat is that the core body temperature of these animals,

366
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.930
we went down to lake 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

367
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.560
They're not their core body temperatures normally like 98.6.

368
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.180
So that's huge change in core body temperature.
Um,

369
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.010
if they expose them twice to this cold shock,

370
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.370
they're able to increase the expression of this RBM three,

371
00:22:15.371 --> 00:22:19.570
this cold shock protein that regrows in apps is for six weeks in their brain.

372
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.230
And then they went on to like get these mice that were genetically engineered to

373
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:24.310
get Alzheimer's disease.

374
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.420
They exposed them like earlier in their life before they started having
symptoms.

375
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.840
They exposed him twice and it totally delayed the symptoms.

376
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.050
They didn't have the cognitive deficits and behavioral deficits.

377
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.310
Their brains didn't have all the amyloid plaque accumulation and the extended

378
00:22:39.311 --> 00:22:43.480
their lifespan.
So I read this study and I was like,

379
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:48.481
this is freaking cool because it has potentially has huge implications for you

380
00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:49.420
know,

381
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.080
brain aging in general for new degenerate diseases for a traumatic brain injury.

382
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.860
Of course it hasn't been shown in humans and there's no,
I have no clue.

383
00:22:56.861 --> 00:23:00.640
Like the question is what the minimal effective dose of cold is.
Can you,

384
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.910
can you sit in a cryo chamber that's like a minus 160 degrees Fahrenheit for two

385
00:23:07.481 --> 00:23:10.540
minutes and activate this cold shock protein?
I don't know.

386
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:14.410
That hasn't been shown,
but it will be really interesting to find out.
Um,

387
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:20.050
you mentioned the,
the differences between,
you know,

388
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:24.610
cold shock and its effects on athletic performance recovery,

389
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.360
even muscle hypertrophy.
So they're there,

390
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:33.590
the literature out there is a kind of confusing because it really,

391
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.110
there's so many different factors that come into play when you're doing a

392
00:23:38.111 --> 00:23:40.590
clinical trial like this where you're,
you're,
you know,

393
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.810
having an athlete that's either trained or untrained,

394
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.810
engage in some sort of physical activity that's either very strenuous or it's

395
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:51.430
moderate,
and then you're doing a cold chalk,

396
00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:56.060
whether that's cold water immersion or it's cryotherapy when you do the cold

397
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:58.640
shock and then what you're measuring and when you're measuring it.

398
00:23:58.641 --> 00:24:01.340
So there's so many different parameters that you have to look at because they

399
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:03.700
can have different effects.
And,

400
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.430
and part of the reason for that is when you do exercise,

401
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.910
it is a stress and the stress that happens.

402
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.640
So you're,
you're basically forcing your muscles to work harder,

403
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.880
which means they need to make more energy.
So you know,

404
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.140
that can cause more damage.
This damage happens because of the oxygen byproducts.

405
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:25.260
But also,
um,

406
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.020
it causes inflammatory molecules get made a pro inflammatory molecules.
So,

407
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.990
you know,
and that's,
and that when those things happen,

408
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.830
the response to of the body to that is to make good things.

409
00:24:36.831 --> 00:24:40.850
So to make anti inflammatory molecules,
and this has been shown empirically,

410
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:45.260
if you look at athletes that train really hard within,

411
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.060
like immediately after training,

412
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.080
there's a huge increase in these proinflammatory cytokines.
Things that can,

413
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.570
if they go out of control can cause more damage,

414
00:24:53.571 --> 00:24:55.760
damage to muscle tissue and cartilage and things like that.

415
00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.110
But then an hour later there's a huge response and anti inflammatory response.

416
00:25:00.111 --> 00:25:04.070
The cytokines that are able to promote wound healing,

417
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:07.250
they're able to regenerate,
you know,
tissue damage and things like that,

418
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.720
that happens an hour later.

419
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.240
And that's happening because of the stress that's induced.
Um,

420
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.930
but if you're looking at the dose,
the exercise dose,

421
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.090
that really sort of dictates how much of that bad stuff that you're gonna make.

422
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.600
So if you're a competitive athlete or if you are a professional athlete or

423
00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:31.580
someone that's really,
really training hard,
your you tend to actually make much,

424
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:36.581
much more of these pro inflammatory cytokines like aisle one beta or TNF alpha.

425
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.330
And what happens is these professional athletes make so much of it that it kind

426
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:45.920
of spirals out of control and causes muscle damage and tissue damage.

427
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:48.050
And so it's,
it's often called overtraining.

428
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.620
So in a case like that,
it's been,

429
00:25:51.621 --> 00:25:55.610
this has been shown with cryotherapy that if you do cryotherapy immediately

430
00:25:55.611 --> 00:26:00.350
after very strenuous exercise,
in some cases,
I'm in one study,

431
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:03.300
they were doing a very um,
strenuous,

432
00:26:03.301 --> 00:26:07.220
like he'll training where they were sprinting up hills and like doing this like

433
00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:11.330
really,
really strenuous activity.
They did the cryotherapy immediately after.

434
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.600
And what they found was that these athletes were,
had less muscle damage.

435
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:17.780
So they measured different biomarkers for muscle damage and they measured it

436
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:22.520
over a time course like,
so they did it like one hour later,
24 hours later,

437
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:26.900
96 hours later.
And what they found was that there was less,
less tissue damage.

438
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:33.010
Same thing was sort of shown for kayakers that we're doing a four hour boat

439
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:34.700
kayaking ride,
which is pretty long.

440
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.960
Those kayakers that did cryotherapy the day before they did this,

441
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.810
this four hour kayaking event,

442
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.530
we're able do the kayaking event the next day better.

443
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.640
So,
so something about doing the cryotherapy before doing the kayaking,

444
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:52.770
they were able to perform better than the next day when they were going to do

445
00:26:52.771 --> 00:26:54.210
another four hour kayaking event.

446
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:59.420
So doing it before somehow or another activates these anti inflammatory

447
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:05.391
cytokines and then that mitigates the effect of exercise induced proinflammatory

448
00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.830
cytokines.
It,
it mitigates the um,

449
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.280
the out of control affects,
yeah.

450
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:14.730
When people are really training hard and then you do it again after your

451
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:16.860
training.
Well,
different,
those were separate studies.

452
00:27:16.861 --> 00:27:19.380
So studies have been shown that if you do it right after training,

453
00:27:19.381 --> 00:27:22.500
it helped mitigate.
And also if you did it before,
it helped me to gate.

454
00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:27.300
But another study that you mentioned showed that people that were doing men that

455
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:32.130
were doing these sort of squads and they were doing leg presses and other like

456
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:37.131
leg exercises when they did cold water immersion immediately after it was,

457
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:42.210
it actually prevented muscle hypertrophy or perfect perfect tree,

458
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.410
I think it's called.
Um,
and I think in that case,
you know,
if your,

459
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.650
if you're just doing your everyday average gym workout,

460
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:51.210
like the minimal effective dose,

461
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.770
probably not a good idea to do the cold shock right after a cold water immersion

462
00:27:55.771 --> 00:27:59.820
or cryotherapy right after that.
Because the amount of pro inflammatory things,

463
00:27:59.821 --> 00:28:03.690
amount of stressful things that your body is producing isn't so out of control

464
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.080
and you need to make those to have the anti inflammatory response.

465
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.940
So I really think there's a spectrum in terms of argue and ask,

466
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.990
are you an athlete that's doing the minimal effective dose?

467
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:15.870
Are you just going there and doing,
you know,
a few,
you know,

468
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:19.260
exercises to get a benefit or are you really,
really pushing it?

469
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.090
Are you really training hard?

470
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.810
Are you one of those people that's like a professional athlete?
They are,

471
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.050
they are training really hard.
They are pushing it to the next level.

472
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.190
And those are the ones that are really subject to having this overactive immune

473
00:28:32.191 --> 00:28:35.160
response because they're training super,
super hard.

474
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.130
So I think that when you have a study come out that says

475
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:44.130
doing a cold water immersion after this workout,
you know,
you know,

476
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.780
nick mitigates muscle,
hyper,
hyper puppetry and hyperv.

477
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.730
A tree is growth,
growth,
growth.

478
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Then it's not like a one size fits all.
And you can't just go,

479
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.880
oh all athletes should never do you know,

480
00:28:56.881 --> 00:29:00.810
any sort of cold shock after working out.
Because look,
it stops muscle growth.

481
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:02.880
That's not really,
it's,
it's,

482
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.150
it's not the case because you have to look at the context.

483
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:08.940
So you have to look at the athlete,
the type of exercise they're doing.

484
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:10.410
There's so many factors.
You know,

485
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:14.940
it's Kinda like when these studies come out and saying if you take Beta
carotene,

486
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.620
it's going to cause cancer.

487
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.790
While all the studies that were done with Beta carotene that caused cancer were

488
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:24.510
done in smokers.
And we know that smokers,

489
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:25.830
if you take Beta carotene,

490
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:30.000
they've got this very oxidative environment in their lung that chops the Beta

491
00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:34.740
carotene up into bad things that can damage your DNA and lead to mutations that

492
00:29:34.741 --> 00:29:38.370
cause cancer,
the same amount of Beta carotene given to people that don't smoke.

493
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.430
Guess what?
It doesn't do that.
So you can't just say Beta carotene cause cancer.

494
00:29:42.431 --> 00:29:46.420
You have to look at the context and you have to understand what's going on.

495
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.810
So I think that's my take on the,

496
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:52.390
the cold and the cold shock,

497
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:56.740
whether that's cryotherapy or cold water immersion and how it affects muscle

498
00:29:56.741 --> 00:29:58.690
recovery,
how it affects,
you know,

499
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:03.400
performance and even muscle growth or regrowth.
Um,

500
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.293
so,

501
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.720
but the other thing is that there are other benefits to doing cryotherapy and to

502
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:13.870
doing cold shock in general.
So the,

503
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.780
the most consistent and robust effect,

504
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.140
and it doesn't matter if it's cold water immersion fact studies shown comparing

505
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.800
cold water immersion where you get up to your shoulders and you just do it for

506
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:28.620
like 20 seconds or cryotherapy.
So two minutes at like a hundred and a negative.

507
00:30:28.621 --> 00:30:30.310
166 degrees Fahrenheit,

508
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.760
you release nor epinephrin both in your brain and in your body and you release

509
00:30:36.221 --> 00:30:38.380
it like two to three fold.
Like it's very,

510
00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:42.820
very robust and this happens every time.
So like,
you know,

511
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:47.620
studies have shown that even after 12 weeks of doing this,
the 12th week,

512
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:51.700
you're still put your still bursting out just as much nor epinephrin as you did

513
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.030
the first time you did it.
So there's no attenuation of this response.

514
00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:00.370
And this is super,
super cool because norepinephrine in the brain is actually,

515
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:05.290
it's a neuro transmitter and it's associated with prolonged focus,

516
00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:09.580
attention,
vigilance.
It's also associated with energy,

517
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.550
like feeling this feeling of energy and positive mood.

518
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:14.080
It makes people feel better.
You know,

519
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:16.810
when you'd pharmacologically deplete norb norepinephrine from people,

520
00:31:16.811 --> 00:31:20.290
they become depressed.
Um,
the cognitive dysfunction happens.

521
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:23.830
They also become anxious and they'd feel lethargic.

522
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.940
So norepinephrine in the brain is acting as a neurotransmitter,

523
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.300
but it's also acting as a signaling molecule in the brain where it's been shown

524
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:33.190
to decrease inflammation.

525
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:37.990
It's been shown to decrease the induction of these pro inflammatory cytokines

526
00:31:37.991 --> 00:31:40.600
that are basically inflammation.

527
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:45.601
Is your immune system that is overactive and it's making all these damaging

528
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:50.080
products that are causing damage to your tissues,
your cells.

529
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:52.930
It's kind of like setting off a nuclear bomb to kill a cockroach or like your

530
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:57.310
immune system's like,
right.
It's like,
Whoa,
there's lots of damage going on here.

531
00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:58.630
So,
um,

532
00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:03.430
nor epinephrine's able to stop that from happening in the brain and the body,

533
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.730
it's acting as a hormone.
Um,
it,

534
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.950
it causes vasoconstriction acutely and this is part of a response mechanism to

535
00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:15.910
conserve energy heat.

536
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.530
So you're basically conserving it and it also is involved in like an,

537
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:24.670
uh,
an analgesic effect.
So it's able to,
you know,

538
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.220
reduce pain and that like,

539
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.340
norepinephrine is actually injected into people that have like back problems and

540
00:32:30.341 --> 00:32:33.310
their spine and it like totally legally it's alleviates their pain,

541
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.720
variety of different mechanisms,

542
00:32:34.721 --> 00:32:38.300
partly through the opioid pathway and things like that.
But I think that's,
um,

543
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:43.190
why cryotherapy has been shown to help with pain or partly why there's other

544
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:48.080
things going on.
You also are slowing like nerve ending,
you know,
like the,

545
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.880
the conduction of nerves,
you know,
at the end of nerves.
So like the pains,

546
00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:56.570
responses or slowed that's also happening.
But um,

547
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.090
the owner of bathroom response in itself is really cool because you know,
it's,

548
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.900
it's doing really good things in the brain and it's also,
uh,

549
00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:09.650
it's also got a positive effect in the body of,
you know,
being anti inflammatory.

550
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.350
So I think that inept itself is really cool.

551
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.500
And if you think about it like in the context of,
you know,

552
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.060
professional athletes that are,

553
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.890
that are subject to severe injury and damage like brain trauma,

554
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.870
UFC fighters that are getting blows to the head,

555
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:26.600
NFL players you're talking about,
uh,

556
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.470
using cryotherapy to mitigate some of that damage.
I mean,

557
00:33:30.471 --> 00:33:34.070
that's part of getting a blow to the head activates the immune system.

558
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:36.710
And we talked about this in great detail last time I was here.

559
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.660
So being able to slow that inflammatory po process like immediately after it

560
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:46.280
happens has very positive effects on people that have had trauma to the head.

561
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.080
And I think that,
you know,

562
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:53.081
that that ended up itself aside from the recovery aspect is,

563
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:56.190
is very interesting and important.
In fact,
it's hypothermia,

564
00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.500
which is cooling down the body,
is used to treat traumatic brain injury,
um,

565
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.660
in clinical settings.
So it's,

566
00:34:02.661 --> 00:34:07.130
it's something that's used and it's also used to treat,
you know,
schemic stroke,

567
00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:08.930
things like that.
So,
uh,

568
00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:12.410
and I think part of that's through this nor epinephrin response that's very,

569
00:34:12.411 --> 00:34:16.880
very robust.
So you're talking about like decreasing damage.
That's,
that's,

570
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.030
you know,
causing more brain aging.
And,
and I think that's,

571
00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:26.360
that's pretty compelling.
Um,
in addition to that,
uh,
the,

572
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.780
the,
um,
what was I gonna say?

573
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.350
<v 0>I lost my train of thought.
I was just going down this nor epinephrine.</v>

574
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.310
Can't believe that you actually lose your train of thought.

575
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.110
I'd never would have thought that would happened.
Oh,

576
00:34:37.111 --> 00:34:40.530
all the Tillman all the time.
Too much in there.

577
00:34:40.531 --> 00:34:45.060
You've run your hard drive down.
Yeah.
Room.
Oh,
I know what it was.

578
00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.580
Back to the

579
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.720
<v 1>BM three.
Like that is cool.
Like regrowing synopsis like that.</v>

580
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.790
There's the potential to do that is another cool thing.

581
00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:57.200
So I'm actually considering doing the cry at,
not Cryo,

582
00:34:57.201 --> 00:35:01.160
but somehow cold,
cold shock.
Adding that to my,
my daily routine,

583
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.870
<v 0>I did it,
um,
on a regular basis.
I was doing it like once a week or so,</v>

584
00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:10.190
and then I went on a run of three weeks where I did it every day for three
weeks.

585
00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:12.140
I did it five days a week.
I didn't do it on the weekends,

586
00:35:12.141 --> 00:35:15.380
but five days a week for three weeks and I've never felt better.

587
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.440
It's fucking incredible.
And one of the things that I've found,

588
00:35:18.441 --> 00:35:21.410
it's amazing is I guess it's the neuro Epinephrin.
How'd he say it?

589
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:26.320
Neuro Epinephrin or Epinephrin neuro.
Yeah.
Nor nor epinephrine.
Yeah.

590
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.380
Okay.
Maybe it's that,
but I feel happy when I get out of there.

591
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.770
I feel happy and I feel energetic.
The,
the way I was describing,

592
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:36.110
I feel like I could jump over cars.
You just feel like,

593
00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.510
like once your body recovers from that initial burst,

594
00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:45.690
whatever your body is producing to deal with the effects of that insane cold

595
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.740
gives you this amazing feeling of euphoria when you're out of it.

596
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.160
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean that makes perfect sense from,</v>

597
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:55.910
from the study that I read and you know,
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors,

598
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.550
which prevent nor epinephrin.

599
00:35:58.551 --> 00:36:03.551
So he released nor epinephrin from your neurons and they then go into the

600
00:36:03.651 --> 00:36:06.740
synapse and then they bind on another neuron.
And that's how they have function.

601
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.000
While norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors prevent it from being metabolized.

602
00:36:11.001 --> 00:36:13.730
So it sits around longer in the synopsis and can do its function.

603
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:18.140
It's used to treat Adhd,
to treat depression.
Uh,
you know,
of course,

604
00:36:18.141 --> 00:36:21.810
I think there's a lot of possible side effects with that because when you're

605
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:25.280
constantly allowing nor epinephrin to sit around in the synapses,

606
00:36:25.281 --> 00:36:27.140
there's biological responses to that.
You know,

607
00:36:27.141 --> 00:36:29.960
one of those being the receptors start to,
you start to make less of them.
So,

608
00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.790
but you know,
that's a different topic.

609
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.660
But it is interesting that it's used to treat depression.
Like I said,

610
00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:39.320
people that are pharmacologically depleted of it become depressed and,

611
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:42.860
and studies have shown at least they're not randomized controlled trials,

612
00:36:42.861 --> 00:36:43.910
but they're,

613
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:48.110
they're decent enough trials have shown that cryotherapy has been used

614
00:36:48.111 --> 00:36:50.420
successfully to treat depression and anxiety.

615
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.290
I think partially because of this nor epinephrin effect.

616
00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.590
<v 0>So the norepinephrine that you're talking about,
the negative effects of it,</v>

617
00:36:56.591 --> 00:37:01.060
is this from taking an external source of it or is from your body producing it

618
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.250
endogenously?

619
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:02.521
<v 1>No,</v>

620
00:37:02.521 --> 00:37:07.521
it's from taking a pill that stops your body from being able to metabolize it

621
00:37:09.631 --> 00:37:11.850
normally.
Oh,
okay.
So you're basically,

622
00:37:11.851 --> 00:37:15.390
it's kind of like a Serotonin reuptake inhibitor,
same concept.
So you know,

623
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.960
they're basically stopping your body from metabolites.

624
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:20.980
So usually there's a certain half life,

625
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.670
which means nor app and everyone's around and your neurons for a certain amount

626
00:37:23.671 --> 00:37:27.300
of time and then it's metabolized and then you release more up and you know,

627
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.230
so there's a cycle.
But if you stop that from happening,

628
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:35.100
the norepinephrine sits around longer and in the synapses and um,

629
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.680
it's,
they're doing its function for a longer period of time.

630
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.090
And so it makes people feel better.

631
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.910
But when you're doing something like cryotherapy,

632
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.880
you don't have to pharmacologically inhibit the pathway to,
you know,

633
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.600
prevent it from being re uptake.

634
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:51.210
Instead you're just releasing two to three fold more.

635
00:37:51.211 --> 00:37:54.300
But then you normally would,
it's still gonna get metabolized normally.

636
00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:58.080
So you don't have all these crazy responses,
biological responses,

637
00:37:58.081 --> 00:38:00.180
feedback loops that happen and you feel really,

638
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.770
I think you would feel really good and feel energized to feel happy.
And also,

639
00:38:04.771 --> 00:38:07.560
have you noticed anything with focus and attention to feel focused?

640
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:10.440
<v 0>Um,
I don't know.
[inaudible] there's so many.</v>

641
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.110
Have Eric and I were having this conversation earlier.

642
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.800
It's hard to tell when you do so many different things.
What,
what's,

643
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.490
what's the thing that's having the effect,
right.
I'm,
I'm uh,
uh,
um,

644
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:24.210
some sort of a performance enhancing junkie and a lot of ways I'm constantly

645
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:28.200
taking,
oh,
well,
you know,
I heard her Kumon him nuts.
You got to take,
okay.

646
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:32.070
Tumeric getting on it.
All right.
Fish oil.
I'm in,
you know,
and like,

647
00:38:32.071 --> 00:38:34.100
my body's like,
fuck dude,
you're meld like,

648
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.880
between that and the healthy foods and those nutrients,

649
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.380
I don't have a problem with focus.

650
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.710
The only time I have a problem with focuses when I'm tired and that's usually

651
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:45.760
just just a lack of sleep issue or too much exercise issue.

652
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
But I definitely feel elevated when I do it on a regular basis.

653
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.880
Um,
I feel elevated.
I just feel better.
And um,

654
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.100
two things I wanted to ask you.
One,

655
00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:02.580
when you were talking about the studies on the kayakers and all these different

656
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:06.970
people and they did cryotherapy where they doing cold water immersion or were

657
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:10.650
they doing the dry cryotherapy?
Doing whole body cry with,
okay.

658
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.910
So now when they say whole body cryotherapy,

659
00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:14.650
there's two different types of data as well.

660
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:18.460
There's from the neck down and then there's the kind that covers your entire

661
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:21.580
head.
You don't see that as much.
You see a lot of it,

662
00:39:21.581 --> 00:39:24.300
we step into this thing and it kind of like a,

663
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.400
it's just sort of closes like almost like saloon doors and from your head up

664
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.780
you're exposed,
you're,
you're in normal air and you,
uh,
you know the,

665
00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:38.560
the cold air,
the nitrogen is all below you from the neck down.

666
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.270
The ones that they have like cryo healthcare.

667
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:46.150
And I know the one that Chad Mendez is a UFC fighter.
He uses one in Sacramento.

668
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.520
You step into a room and you close the door and your,

669
00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.780
your whole body's your head everything.

670
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:58.490
And apparently the effect of having your head involved makes a big difference.

671
00:39:59.171 --> 00:40:02.380
It makes a big difference not just to mitigate the effects of training and

672
00:40:02.381 --> 00:40:06.340
getting hit in the head and all sorts of different inflammatory responses from

673
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:11.230
that.
But also that your body,
cause everything is in that cold,

674
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.350
your body is like,
this isn't a matter of like dipping our toes in the river.

675
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.170
We just got dropped off at the top of the world and we're going to fucking

676
00:40:17.171 --> 00:40:17.771
freeze to death.

677
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:22.150
So we gotta we gotta figure out a way to do something about this right away.

678
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.040
I would like to see some studies done on what the hell is actually going on.

679
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.970
Like what is the difference between having it from the neck up or having it from

680
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:35.470
your entire body.
And if there are studies out there,
I'd love to read them.
Yeah,

681
00:40:35.471 --> 00:40:37.990
I don't,
they,
they don't differentiate in the cities that I've read,

682
00:40:37.991 --> 00:40:41.970
when it said whole body cryotherapy,
I assumed everything,

683
00:40:41.971 --> 00:40:45.730
like we've stepped who's are super hard to find.
So maybe it wasn't the,

684
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.580
well they call it whole body because your whole body is in there,

685
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:49.780
but it's not your head.

686
00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.270
Usually whole body when it's in the scientific literature,

687
00:40:52.271 --> 00:40:56.170
like there's whole body hypothermia,
there's whole body hypothermia.

688
00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:00.250
So the whole body hypothermia is when they like put your whole body in like a

689
00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:04.150
sauna,
you know?
Or if it's a mouth they put you in.
So you do the whole body.

690
00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:08.860
So typically it's like everything including the head.
But if it's super rare,

691
00:41:08.861 --> 00:41:12.340
I don't know.
I mean that,
that wasn't distinguished and in those studies,
yeah,

692
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:15.130
it's rare.
There's not nearly as many of them as there are.

693
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:19.600
The ones that are from the neck down the neck down is much,
much more common.

694
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.650
And uh,
well,
it still has a great benefit.
I mean,
I've,
I've,

695
00:41:22.651 --> 00:41:25.900
I've felt a great benefit from the one that's the neck down as well,

696
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.110
but it's not the same.
The full body,
the head and immersed,

697
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.470
you're whole stepping into that fucking frozen room.
That's where it's at.

698
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.040
And you know,
a lot

699
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.580
<v 1>of people actually do the cold shock right after the heat shock.</v>

700
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:41.530
So they like go and sit in the sauna and then they jump into a cold,
you know,

701
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.970
lake or they take a cold shower.

702
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.250
That's interesting because the cryo healthcare guys,

703
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.660
they don't want you doing hot yoga and then going and doing the cold

704
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:55.520
cryotherapy.
They're like,
that's too much stress on your heart.
Oh really?
Yeah.

705
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.820
And I don't know why the heart,
why would they think it would be the heart?
Well,

706
00:41:58.821 --> 00:42:01.340
because when you're,
when you're doing the,
he,

707
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.950
your causing basal dilation,

708
00:42:03.951 --> 00:42:07.760
you're increasing plasma and blood flow to the heart and then all of a sudden

709
00:42:07.761 --> 00:42:11.150
when you're doing norepinephrine epinephrin you're constricting.
So it's,

710
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.140
you know,
kind of like the opposite.
So maybe,
maybe there is some sort of,

711
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:20.240
maybe it only kills weak,
weak people that we don't need.
You know,

712
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:24.770
the other thing people use it for this cold shocking is four because the Nora

713
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.580
norepinephrine also,
um,
ramps up metabolism.

714
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:32.330
And it does that because it's trying to,
uh,
but it,
it,

715
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.340
it activates a pathway that inside of yourselves where you're making energy

716
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:39.920
that,
that they're tricking these mitochondria,

717
00:42:39.921 --> 00:42:43.610
which are the sites of the energy production into thinking that,

718
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:47.190
so typically there's an electric chemical gradient that's made and,

719
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.110
and that's how you're yourself senses.
Okay,
I'm making energy.

720
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.620
Well nor epinephrin activates something that uncouples that it's called

721
00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:56.780
uncoupling protein one UCP one.

722
00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.750
And what happens that tricks your mitochondria into like thinking there's,

723
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.400
it's not making any,
any energy.
And it's like,
Oh my God,
I've got to make energy.

724
00:43:04.401 --> 00:43:06.400
So it ramps up metabolism and the,

725
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.610
the reason that happens is because you want to,

726
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.700
you basically want to make more heat when you're cold.

727
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:12.770
So that's kind of like the body's way of doing it.

728
00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:17.690
And so people actually lose weight when they do this cold shock frequently

729
00:43:17.691 --> 00:43:21.650
because they're able to basically trick the body into thinking it's not making

730
00:43:21.651 --> 00:43:24.410
energy by uncoupling this whole metabolism process.

731
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.830
And then the body speeds up metabolism to end a burning fat more.

732
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:33.040
And so that's also a very common tool that people use to,
to,

733
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:37.340
to,
to lose weight because they promote that in the crowd therapy literature.

734
00:43:37.341 --> 00:43:41.450
But I've never lost an ounce,
nothing.
I don't lose any anyway.

735
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.250
And I do three minutes and then I'd go out for like 10 minutes.

736
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.320
I go in for another three minutes.
Yeah.
I,
it's pro,
you know,

737
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:50.780
cryotherapy doing it for two minutes.
I mean,

738
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:53.600
you get cold and there's obviously it's been shown nor epinephrin and gets

739
00:43:53.601 --> 00:43:54.900
activated.
All those things happen.

740
00:43:54.901 --> 00:43:59.901
But in order to really like have this effect that I'm talking about you,

741
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.200
you basically have to like shiver and then you don't shiver.
So it's,

742
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:04.690
you have to really like,

743
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:08.450
I think have a prolonged period of being cold where you're like sitting in cold

744
00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:10.670
water for 20 minutes.

745
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:15.160
So cold water immersion maybe is better for losing weight.
Maybe.
So.
Yeah,
I,

746
00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.980
I would,
I would think that the cryotherapy,
you know,

747
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:22.850
like I've seen studies where they've looked at cryotherapy,
um,

748
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.110
the effects of cryotherapy on rectal temperature on muscle temperature.

749
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:31.100
Well,
I mean right till the temperatures in Dixon up in core body temperature but

750
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.870
really only dropped but like couple degrees so it's not,

751
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:38.000
it doesn't go down that dramatically.
So that would kind of make sense.
The,

752
00:44:38.001 --> 00:44:41.790
the long duration of being in the ice bath cause people go in the ice bath for

753
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:42.660
like 20 minutes.

754
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.340
So when you're in that ice bath for 20 minutes of your body's like fucker.
Yeah,

755
00:44:46.341 --> 00:44:49.260
that's,
that's probably gonna activate that pathway for sure.

756
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.980
I mean it makes sense.
Yeah.
Cause they say that being in the cold,

757
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:55.590
like in cold weather,
like they say if you want to lose weight,

758
00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:59.340
just wearing a light jacket in cold weather makes you lose weight.

759
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:03.840
Probably had the same,
the same mechanism.
But I say go to the gym,

760
00:45:03.841 --> 00:45:07.500
you lazy fucks and where a warm coat and be comfortable.
God Damn it.

761
00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:10.620
Be uncomfortable for short bursts.
Don't eat so much.

762
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.620
Exercise is so everything you just said,

763
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:16.560
you know there was a really interesting study that just came out,
um,

764
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:21.750
a couple of weeks ago where they looked at the rates of aging in young adults.

765
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.730
So they looked at different time points.
So they look at,
they took the,

766
00:45:25.731 --> 00:45:26.550
there was a whole,

767
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.390
I think it was like over a thousand people and the study started when they were

768
00:45:30.391 --> 00:45:35.391
like 26 years old and they measured like 18 different biomarkers of aging.

769
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.220
So they looked at like DNA health,
they looked at telomere length.

770
00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:44.080
So tila mirrors that those caps on the end of your chromosomes that protects me,

771
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:48.390
damage their marker for aging.
They looked at HDL cholesterol,

772
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:52.110
they looked at c reactive protein,
which is a inflammatory mediator.

773
00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:55.920
They looked at 18 different things and they looked at these people that were 26

774
00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:59.220
years old and then he did it again when they were 32 and then they did it again

775
00:45:59.221 --> 00:46:02.880
when there were 38 and what they found was that even though these people were

776
00:46:02.881 --> 00:46:07.620
all the same chronological age,
their cells looked very,

777
00:46:07.621 --> 00:46:11.100
very,
very different.
People age at different rates.
Some people,

778
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.750
if you looked on the cellular level,

779
00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:17.370
they look 10 years older and some people look 10 years younger than their

780
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:18.240
chronological age.

781
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.150
And I was looking at some of these graphs of people and you can see some people

782
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:25.530
start it out like they started out bad where they looked old and then they

783
00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:28.620
started getting better.
You know,
they probably started changing their diet,

784
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:32.700
their lifestyle.
Other people started going worse,
some people stayed the same,

785
00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.820
you know.
So there are lots of different very variable variables going on here.

786
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.610
But I think what's really interesting,
oh and by the way,

787
00:46:38.611 --> 00:46:41.070
that their physical appearance also correlated with,

788
00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:43.720
not their chronological age but their biological age.
But it's,

789
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.280
it's what it's called.
So if the,
if they showed their picture to people,

790
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.710
random people and said,
guess what age they are,

791
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.890
they would guess their biological age,
not their chronological age.

792
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:56.940
So if a person was 38 but they look 28 the person would say,

793
00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:01.410
oh they're probably 28 and if the person was 38 but they looked 48 they just

794
00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:05.700
look worn and you know,
rough,
then the person would guess that they were much,

795
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:06.600
much older than they were.

796
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:11.640
So there was a correlation between physical appearance and the biological age.

797
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.800
And this is,
I found this really,

798
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:18.801
really interesting because I think it is strong evidence for the fact that your

799
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:24.310
diet and your lifestyle play a major role in the way you age.
And,

800
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.020
and that's something,
a lot of people,
there is a genetic component.
You know,

801
00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:29.070
there is definitely a genetic,

802
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.580
I was talking about this pathway foxo three that activates all this great stuff

803
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:36.790
and you can deal with stress easier.
Those people are lucky.

804
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:40.300
My husband's one of those guys,
I'm not a,
so he's got the,

805
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.040
the variation of that gene that is,
he's likely to live,
you know,

806
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:48.640
2.5 2.7 times more likely to live to be 100.
But I'm

807
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.530
looking at him,
but,
so I,
you know,
I uh,

808
00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.370
I took this opportunity to really like think about,
you know,

809
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:01.750
how your diet and lifestyle plays a role in the way way you age and what you can

810
00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:04.690
do to be that person that looks 10 years younger,

811
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.640
biologically versus 10 years older.
You know,
and,
and there are really,
you know,

812
00:48:09.641 --> 00:48:12.820
there's w as we age,
we talked about this,
the damage accumulates.

813
00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:16.150
And also what happens is our ability to repair the damage decreases.

814
00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.060
So it's like not only are you increasing the damage,

815
00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:22.600
but your body is like decreasing its ability to take care of it and then reach

816
00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:26.410
this point.
And it's like death,
you know,
just too much damage over,
you know,

817
00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:28.210
overload and things start to shut down.

818
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.690
And I started looking at,

819
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:36.010
well what are like the major causes of death in the United States?
For example,

820
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:39.460
if you look at the major causes of death,
United States,
cardiovascular disease,

821
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:43.570
number one,
cancer is number two.
So most people that are dying when they die,

822
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:48.370
they die of cancer,
cardiovascular disease.
And then the second most common thing,

823
00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:52.210
they die of his cancer.
And if you think about that,

824
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:55.330
and studies have actually shown for cardiovascular disease,

825
00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.520
like 80% of that is preventable by diet,

826
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.890
80%.
So in the,
in the context of cardiovascular disease,

827
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:09.730
and this is where I started to really dive into this,
you know,

828
00:49:09.731 --> 00:49:13.960
heart health a decade ago or so,
we were,
we were all told,

829
00:49:13.961 --> 00:49:17.680
maybe it's two decades by now,
I don't know,
Time's flying.
Um,

830
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:20.980
we were all told that,
you know,
to have good heart health,

831
00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:25.390
you need to decrease your saturated fat intake,
right?
It's all cholesterol,

832
00:49:25.391 --> 00:49:28.900
clogs up your arteries and when you have cholesterol clogging up your arteries,

833
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:31.750
plaques form,
they rupture.
When they rupture,

834
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.090
then this causes a clot to form.

835
00:49:34.091 --> 00:49:37.780
And then if the clot forms in an artery to your heart,
you have a heart attack.

836
00:49:37.781 --> 00:49:40.150
If it forms in an artery to your brain,
you have a stroke.

837
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:45.220
And we were bled to believe this is all because of,
you know,
the fat we eat.

838
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:49.090
And we know now that it's much,
much more complicated than that.

839
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:54.640
And in fact that thought like did a lot more damage because then people started

840
00:49:54.641 --> 00:49:57.580
to eat something called transfats,

841
00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.510
which like did so much more damage than,
you know,
eating regular fat.

842
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:05.740
And recently the FDA,
thank God,
like banned all trans fats.

843
00:50:05.741 --> 00:50:08.380
And so we have like very recently,
very recently.
Yeah.

844
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:12.380
How long have they sold trends for us for,
I don't know,
but it's the,

845
00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:16.030
I deck my mom,
I remember my mom buying margarine.

846
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:20.230
Margarine is transplants.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
That's illegal.
Now it's,

847
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:24.400
they have three years to get it off the shelves.
Can I believe it's not butter,

848
00:50:24.401 --> 00:50:28.880
you're fucked.
I mean it's not butter the butter,

849
00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:32.360
it's,
it's bad.
It causes your cells to become really stiff,

850
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.670
which is what happens when you age because of damage.

851
00:50:34.671 --> 00:50:39.110
So it's like aging in accelerated time and it causes heart disease,

852
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:41.900
all sorts of problems.
I mean it's so bad,
but um,

853
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:47.690
back to their cause the actual cause of it,
of,
of this cardiovascular disease.

854
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:50.930
It actually I think comes down to gut health.

855
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:54.380
I know I talk a lot about micronutrients and the importance of vitamins and

856
00:50:54.381 --> 00:50:56.780
minerals and that also plays a very important role in the way you age.

857
00:50:56.781 --> 00:50:58.430
And you and I have talked a lot about this,

858
00:50:58.431 --> 00:51:02.390
but I kind of wanted to touch a little bit on this topic because I think it's

859
00:51:02.391 --> 00:51:06.770
really important since,
you know,
I know my parents generation,
um,

860
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:12.190
it's been really hard to educate them and help have them relearn everything they

861
00:51:12.561 --> 00:51:16.230
thought was bad and them understand well,
everything you thought was bad,

862
00:51:16.231 --> 00:51:19.150
it's actually not bad.
And let me explain what actually is bad.
You know,

863
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.780
because it,
I want them to be able to change their dietary habits and be healthy.

864
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:25.123
So

865
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:30.740
I think most people that are educated in health know that it's not just about

866
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:31.820
cholesterol.
They know well,

867
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:34.700
well it's LDL cholesterol and it's not just LDL cholesterol.

868
00:51:34.701 --> 00:51:38.600
It's small dense particles.
Right.
You've heard that most,

869
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:41.840
most people that are in the difference between HDL and Ldl.
Yeah.

870
00:51:41.841 --> 00:51:46.790
So you actually need cholesterol,
LDL,
it's not actually cholesterol.

871
00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:50.270
LDL is a lipid protein that transports cholesterol at transports,

872
00:51:50.271 --> 00:51:51.650
fatty acids and other things.

873
00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:56.270
But it's easy to think it's easy to call LDL cholesterol because that's what

874
00:51:56.271 --> 00:52:01.030
people think about it.
On the subway people,
no,
because the transport,
I mean,

875
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:06.230
well kind of,
but one of the major things,
it's transporting his cholesterol.

876
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:11.150
Okay.
So I think it's easier,
I think,
yeah.
If you just say Ldl,
people are like,

877
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:15.560
what's that?
But if you say LDL cholesterol,
I think it like people like,
Oh yeah,

878
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:16.900
I've heard of that.
You know?
So I just,

879
00:52:16.901 --> 00:52:19.400
I think it's better to talk about it like that.
So people can relate.

880
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.270
So the LDL cholesterol transports,
cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol,

881
00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:27.200
transports cholesterol to your cells,
to your cells,

882
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:29.350
and your liver to yourselves and your,
you know,

883
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:31.220
kidney to yourselves and your muscle.

884
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.520
And it does that because every cell in your body needs cholesterol.

885
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.450
It's part of the membrane of the cell,

886
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.970
which is an essential for the way the cell functions.

887
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:44.450
Anytime you damage yourself,
anytime you making,
you're making a new sell,

888
00:52:44.451 --> 00:52:47.210
guess what?
It needs cholesterol.
You go out,
you go to the gym,

889
00:52:47.211 --> 00:52:50.370
you work really hard and you've got some damage.
You need cholesterol to,

890
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.950
to repair that damage.
So LDL brings the cholesterol to your cells.

891
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.810
Once it gets to Yoursel,
um,
then something cuts it off,

892
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.870
like a little piece of the cluster,
all gets cuts off,
cut off the Ldl,

893
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.770
and then the LDL goes back to the liver and it's recycled.

894
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.770
So that's in a normal situation.

895
00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.970
So what happens is an HDL does,

896
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:18.971
what HDL does is HDL brings the cholesterol from yourselves or from your

897
00:53:19.281 --> 00:53:23.840
arteries if it's built up and it just rips it off and brings it back to the

898
00:53:23.841 --> 00:53:28.200
liver.
So it's like it's taking clusteral away from yourselves,
away from,

899
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:30.960
you know,
your,
your arteries,

900
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:33.420
the things that are built up in your arteries and your veins.

901
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:35.490
So it's removing that and bringing it to the levers.

902
00:53:35.491 --> 00:53:39.870
So HDL is really important if you have too much of the bad type of cholesterol,

903
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:44.100
which is the small dense.
And,
and what,

904
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.750
let me explain what small dense is.

905
00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:50.160
Cause I'm sure most people have no clue what that means.
Um,
it's like I said,

906
00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:53.970
when LDL cholesterol is going to yourself to repair damage,

907
00:53:53.971 --> 00:53:55.800
a little piece of it gets cleaved off and it's like,
okay,

908
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:57.810
here's a little piece of cholesterol.
Here you go.

909
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:01.830
And now the LDL that's left is smaller because it donated some of that

910
00:54:01.831 --> 00:54:06.780
cholesterol to your cell to repair.
So now it's smaller.
What happens is though,

911
00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:10.710
if you have an healthy gut,
and we can talk about what causes that,

912
00:54:10.711 --> 00:54:15.180
but if you have an unhealthy gut,
um,
most of the back.

913
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:20.250
So there's like over 112 trillion bacteria in your gut and they're there because

914
00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:21.960
they're metabolizing the food you eat,

915
00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.940
making them into fatty acids and proteins,
amino acids,
things like that.

916
00:54:26.941 --> 00:54:29.550
They're breaking this down.
Yeah,
$100 trillion.

917
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.670
They're also making vitamins and minerals and there's more peace,

918
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:37.730
more than there have been people in the world ever $100 trillion in one body,

919
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.113
one body,

920
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:42.570
while you also have the highest concentration of immune cells in your gut.

921
00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:44.100
And most people,
when I asked them,

922
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:46.710
where do you think you have the highest concentration of immune cells?

923
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.690
They're like,
oh,
your thymus or your basket in your blood,
you know?
Nope.

924
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:54.690
It's in your gut.
The highest concentration of immune cells,
right in your gut.

925
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:58.530
And the reason for that is because your gut is actually exposed to the external

926
00:54:58.531 --> 00:55:01.580
environment.
So every time you eat food from the environment,
your it,

927
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.440
your gut sees it.
So if there's something pathogenic there,

928
00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.870
you need to have that immune response to make sure it's not going to take you

929
00:55:06.871 --> 00:55:10.650
out.
Right?
So there's a lot of immune cells in your gut.
Well,

930
00:55:10.651 --> 00:55:14.890
they're separated by what's called the gut barrier.
And um,

931
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:18.540
when that becomes compromised,
which we can talk about in a minute,

932
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:22.590
what happens is your immune cells start to kill bacteria and your gut,

933
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.850
and this releases something that's part of the bacterial membrane called

934
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.900
endotoxin.

935
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.580
Endotoxin then gets into your bloodstream and guess what?

936
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.860
It binds to LDL cholesterol.

937
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.370
And the reason why it binds to it is there's these docking sites on the

938
00:55:38.371 --> 00:55:42.450
cholesterol,
the LDL cholesterol that soak it up like a sponge.

939
00:55:42.451 --> 00:55:47.130
So anytime you're inflamed,
you actually increase your LDL productions,

940
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:51.690
you actually make more LDL cholesterol.
And which is why it's important.

941
00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:55.740
Anytime you get a blood lipid panel done from a doctor,
do it more than once.

942
00:55:55.741 --> 00:55:59.100
Because if you add some stressful event the night before,
something crazy,

943
00:55:59.101 --> 00:56:00.990
you're inflamed,
you were sick,

944
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:04.140
your LDL cholesterol is going to be through the roof.
And you know,

945
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.150
it's just not going to be an accurate picture.

946
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:08.490
It's a snapshot of what's going on in your life at that time.

947
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:13.620
So should you get several over the course of a few days to get a baseline?

948
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:15.440
Yes.
You should get several.
Like,
you know,

949
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.240
if you add something stressful happening way too,

950
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:21.750
you're chilled out and then do another test,
you know,
like give it some time,

951
00:56:21.751 --> 00:56:23.200
a couple of weeks in end.

952
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:26.470
Is it all real stress or could it be like rollercoaster stress?

953
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:30.940
Like if you went on a crazy roller coaster,
does that change your LDL levels?

954
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:34.270
Like that Kinda like artificial stress if you are,

955
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:38.980
if it's stressed you out enough like tower of terror,
like yeah,

956
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:42.850
like if you really like,
we're terrified.
If you're terrified.
Yeah,

957
00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:47.740
it might actually,
that might cause enough inflammation to,
to do that.
So your,

958
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.593
your cholesterol,

959
00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:52.800
the reason your body does that is because the endotoxin that's released,
uh,

960
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:56.530
it's very damaging and it can,
I mean,
endotoxin being released in the system,

961
00:56:56.531 --> 00:56:58.660
when you have enough of it,
it can cause sepsis and death.

962
00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:03.550
So your body has this response mechanism of soaking up that endotoxin the

963
00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:07.330
cholesterol.
So it doesn't damage your tissues,
it doesn't damage your organs.

964
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:11.560
The problem is that when that endotoxin binds that cholesterol,

965
00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:13.510
that LDL cholesterol that we just talked about,

966
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:17.050
that was donating a piece of cholesterol to yourself,
so it's smaller.

967
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:22.300
It binds on the same docking sites that that LDL cholesterol uses to go back to

968
00:57:22.301 --> 00:57:23.950
the liver and get out of your circulation.

969
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:29.440
So then what happens is you're screwed because now that LDL cholesterol that's

970
00:57:29.441 --> 00:57:33.250
smaller has all this endotoxin there.
It can't go back to the liver.

971
00:57:33.251 --> 00:57:35.680
It's stuck in your circulation.
And guess what?

972
00:57:35.681 --> 00:57:39.730
Endotoxin is like a signal for your immune cells where it's like,
Hey,

973
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.530
I'm a foreign invader.
Come attack me.
So now it's stuck in your circulation.

974
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:48.070
Your immune cells are seeing the signal of endotoxin.
It's stuck to cholesterol,

975
00:57:48.071 --> 00:57:52.960
but it's not bacteria.
It's cholesterol.
So they come and they try to kill it,

976
00:57:52.961 --> 00:57:57.280
but they can't kill it because it's not a live bacteria.
It's your cholesterol.

977
00:57:57.281 --> 00:57:58.660
With this endotoxin bound to it.

978
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:02.650
They see create all these proinflammatory cytokines which recruit more.

979
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.580
And then you get this beginning of a plaque or what it's called,
a foam cell,

980
00:58:06.581 --> 00:58:09.430
which is up in your immune cells stuck to this LDL particle.

981
00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:13.980
So it's now small dense because it's got all the stuff and it's stuck there and

982
00:58:13.981 --> 00:58:18.340
your circulation.
So really if we look at the big picture of things,

983
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.410
you know,
saturated fat,

984
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:25.411
which does increase LDL cholesterol isn't such a bad thing and less you are

985
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.480
under chronic inflammation,

986
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.710
chronic inflammation at the level of the gut.

987
00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.820
So what causes that?
Uh,

988
00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:40.890
well if you think about your gut and the bacterial cells that are there and the

989
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:43.540
immune cells that are there and how they're being separated by this,

990
00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.030
it's really a,
it's called mucin.

991
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:50.800
So your gut cells secrete something called Mucin and it looks like mucus.
I mean,

992
00:58:50.801 --> 00:58:53.530
if it looks like Snot,
it's like viscous and gross.

993
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:56.580
Anyone that's had like inflammatory bowel disease and they've had like feast,

994
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:59.650
like problems and they're,
they can excrete it through their feces.

995
00:58:59.651 --> 00:59:02.650
It's like all slimy.
That's a mucin.
That's your gut barrier,

996
00:59:02.651 --> 00:59:05.050
like coming out and that's not good.

997
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.160
So the mucin that's secreted by your gut cells is very,

998
00:59:09.161 --> 00:59:12.520
very important because it's separating your immune cells from your bacteria so

999
00:59:12.521 --> 00:59:12.940
that you don't,

1000
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.870
your immune cells aren't going crazy causing this whole inflammatory cascade and

1001
00:59:16.871 --> 00:59:21.220
releasing endotoxin.
But in order for your gut cells to make Mucin,

1002
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:26.260
they require energy and your gut likes energy in the form of something called

1003
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:27.860
short chain fatty acids,

1004
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:32.861
which are basically generated from fermentable fibers like vegetables,

1005
00:59:33.051 --> 00:59:37.130
fruits,
shower quotes,
Sauerkraut,
mushrooms,

1006
00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.570
habit barley.

1007
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:44.170
These fermentable fibers get fermented by what's called commensal bacteria in

1008
00:59:44.441 --> 00:59:44.751
your gut,

1009
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:47.690
which are the good type of bacteria typically because they make these short

1010
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:51.410
chain fatty acids and when they make them lactate butyrate,

1011
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:52.760
propionate Acetate,

1012
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:57.790
those are the short chain fatty acids that 60 to 92% of that goes right to the

1013
00:59:58.071 --> 01:00:01.280
gut epithelium cells and it fuels them to make mucin.

1014
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.260
So your gut cells love it.

1015
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:05.930
When those short chain fatty acids come in because they're going to crank out

1016
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:08.360
more mucin and they're going to make sure that gut barrier is strong,

1017
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:10.580
they're going to make sure that it's not breaking down,

1018
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.630
that your immune cells not coming in contact with bacteria when you're not

1019
01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:19.100
feeding it the right thing.
So if you're eating a lot of refined carbohydrates,

1020
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.420
refined sugars,

1021
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:25.670
what happens is there's a bunch of other bacteria in your gut that don't eat

1022
01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:28.160
short chain or don't ferment these fibers.

1023
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.900
They like to take the sugar in and they take the sugar in and they're

1024
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:34.100
overgrowing.

1025
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:39.130
So they're basically occupying space in your gut that the commensal bacteria

1026
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:42.350
that usually are making the good stuff would occupy.
So it's like,
well,

1027
01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:45.050
if you have bad stuff here,
that's less room for the good stuff.
Right?

1028
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.440
The other thing that's happening is that there's actually,

1029
01:00:48.441 --> 01:00:50.510
and this is what shown very recently and it blew my mind,

1030
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:54.140
there's actually insulin resistance going on in the low at the level of the gut.

1031
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:56.360
So the more sugar you eat,

1032
01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:59.870
your gut cells begin to not respond.

1033
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:04.990
So that sugar and so there are getting starved of energy because now they can't

1034
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:09.590
take the sugar up into the cell to make Newson because they're not responding.

1035
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.130
They're there because they're not making insulin to be able to do that.

1036
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.160
And so now your gut cells are starving.
When they're starving,

1037
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:19.460
they start breaking down mucin and then you start to have inflammation.

1038
01:01:19.461 --> 01:01:22.330
So really the,
the,

1039
01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.290
the key to good at got good gut health is to not eat these refined
carbohydrates,

1040
01:01:27.291 --> 01:01:28.250
these refined sugars,

1041
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:33.490
and to try to eat more of the good fermentable types of fiber like vegetables

1042
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:39.020
and fruits.
I mean these are barley,
whole oats also habit.
Um,
and also,

1043
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:43.310
uh,
mushrooms,
mushrooms have a type of it called Beta glucans that are really,

1044
01:01:43.311 --> 01:01:46.250
really,
when you eat oats and you cover the oats and brown sugar,

1045
01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:50.610
what happens there?
Yeah,
that's not a good thing.
So the refined sugar,
yeah,

1046
01:01:50.611 --> 01:01:51.710
the refined sugar is not good.

1047
01:01:51.711 --> 01:01:54.440
But the thing that's super fucking up my oatmeal and we're on to Patrick,

1048
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.330
do you put brown sugar on your room?
And,
um,

1049
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:04.730
how about Stevia or Stevia?
I Dunno.
Say it.
Jamie bought some shitty new Stevia.

1050
01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.900
This new stuff sucks.
Wholesome Stevia.

1051
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.850
This is not good.
The stevia we had before,
it was like almost too strong.

1052
01:02:13.851 --> 01:02:17.060
The stuff is actually two weekends,
but I don't know,
he was weird.

1053
01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:20.640
Like I don't know how they're making this.
Like how can it vary so much?

1054
01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.170
Cause the other Stevie we had,
you would just take like a micro spoonful,

1055
01:02:25.171 --> 01:02:29.520
like maybe a 20th of a spoonful and it was good for a cup of coffee.

1056
01:02:29.521 --> 01:02:30.211
Like boom.

1057
01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:33.380
And anything more than that I would tell people when they were trying to out to

1058
01:02:33.381 --> 01:02:37.050
like be really careful because you could fuck it up quick because it's so strong

1059
01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:38.850
stuff is lemon.
It's a plant.

1060
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:42.900
So maybe we weekend Sperry assholes or cutting it.

1061
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.040
It's like drug dealers,

1062
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.090
they're cutting my Stevia is probably some baby powder in there or something.

1063
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:53.730
So the fermentable,
uh,
the gut bacteria are super interesting because,

1064
01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:56.850
um,
you want to have a lot of these good stuff.

1065
01:02:56.851 --> 01:02:59.580
The stuff that's making these things that are fueling your gut cells,

1066
01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:02.190
the commensal bacteria.
A lot of those are lactobacillus.
In fact,

1067
01:03:02.191 --> 01:03:04.860
I'm drinking Kombucha right now that has,

1068
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:09.600
it only has like a billion or so lactobacillus bacteria and those create those,

1069
01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:13.800
generate these lactate and they fee are our gut cells and they also feed other

1070
01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:14.634
good bacteria.

1071
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:19.830
But I actually have been experimenting recently with their probiotic called VSL

1072
01:03:19.831 --> 01:03:20.520
number three,

1073
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.520
which has 450 billion like so that's like drinking 450 of these.

1074
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:29.940
What?
Yeah,
so I buy it overkill.
Is it possible or no?

1075
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:34.280
So if it is gotchas takes over your brain cause effect.

1076
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.080
It has an effect on your personality.
Right?
Totally.
I have to talk about this.

1077
01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:39.150
Yeah.
It's so interesting.
Um,

1078
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:44.310
but so I did an experiment and yes,
it is overturned on your husband or yourself?

1079
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.450
Both.
We both did it.

1080
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:49.740
I wanted an end up to be worried if you're married to someone like her,

1081
01:03:49.741 --> 01:03:53.040
she was just starting to experiment and eat this fucking can I see your blood?

1082
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:58.710
I do do that.
But I get some interesting data.
Like,

1083
01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:01.650
so this VSL number three and where do you get the stuff?

1084
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:03.300
I have to order it online.

1085
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:07.820
You can find it at some pharmacies but you you want the sachets because the
Shah,

1086
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.420
the sachets VSL number three sachets.
Yeah.

1087
01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:14.790
S A C h e t.
S.
Basically what it is,

1088
01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:18.540
it's a little package that comes with this bacteria and there's like six

1089
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:23.010
different strains of it and I put it in my yogurt.
You can put it in,

1090
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:26.000
you know water I liked it is already probiotics.

1091
01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.160
So it's like super feeling feeling that the yogurt.

1092
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:34.550
And so I took this and it for 30 days every day and this has been shown by that.

1093
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:40.080
There's like 25 publications using this specific VSL.
Number three probiotic,

1094
01:04:40.081 --> 01:04:43.230
which has six different strains of commensal bacteria,

1095
01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:48.330
shows that it improves clinical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome,
colitis,

1096
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.140
you fill in the blank bowel problem and improves insulin sensitivity.

1097
01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:54.870
It also increases neurotrophic factors in the brain,

1098
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:59.550
brain drive neurotrophic factor.
So it's like super cool.
And I was like,
you know,

1099
01:04:59.551 --> 01:05:02.270
I'm convinced there's 25 publications on this.
I want to try.

1100
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.210
I want to see what happens to my gut.
So I took a,

1101
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.880
I sent my poop off to get sequenced.
You can do it.

1102
01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:13.143
Everybody's doing it.

1103
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.180
Everybody I know is my mother in law did it.
Um,

1104
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:22.270
so you basically they sequenced the different types of bacteria that are,

1105
01:05:22.271 --> 01:05:24.100
it's like the flow through coming out in your poop.

1106
01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:25.540
So it's like indicative of what's going on,

1107
01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:29.020
what type of bacteria happened your colon.
So I took a baseline.

1108
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.450
I saw the types of bacteria I had.

1109
01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:36.430
I didn't have as many commensal as I want it to have.
Um,
and I've had some,

1110
01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:39.580
some serious gut issues over the course of my life because I've had several

1111
01:05:39.581 --> 01:05:43.580
rounds of antibiotics.
I had MRI say infection.
Um,

1112
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.180
a few years ago that from surgery,
no,

1113
01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:47.620
I think it was from working in the hospital.

1114
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:52.000
I worked at Children's Hospital in Memphis and I don't know where I got it from

1115
01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:55.870
there everywhere in hospitals.
So possibly that's where I picked up.

1116
01:05:55.871 --> 01:06:00.070
But it wasn't from surgery.
I had no surgery.
It was,
and it was a pain in the ass.

1117
01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:01.740
Literally,
it was all my,
but like in,

1118
01:06:01.741 --> 01:06:06.150
so I had a horrible experience where,
um,

1119
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.620
this was when I was in graduate school.
You explain though what it is,

1120
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:13.710
medicated medication resistant necessarily and resistant staphylococcus aureus.

1121
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:18.400
And it's basically a type of staphylococcus bacteria,
which is all over our skin.

1122
01:06:18.401 --> 01:06:23.110
We have this that is resistant to most antibiotics.

1123
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.560
So most antibiotics that you take will not kill it.

1124
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.250
But the doctors said,
I went to,
you know,
I was,

1125
01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:32.350
I had some crappy health coverage of students,

1126
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.970
so I was going to the university and the guy was kind of a dummy and he gave me

1127
01:06:36.971 --> 01:06:39.130
this antibiotic course and it went away.

1128
01:06:39.131 --> 01:06:42.220
But then it came back and then I was like,
came back.
And then he did again.

1129
01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:45.250
He didn't like take a swab and sequence and to see,

1130
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:49.660
and so I did this like three times and my third time I was like,

1131
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:51.910
this is ridiculous.
Like,
you know.

1132
01:06:51.911 --> 01:06:56.320
And so I started reading the literature and found that there's other things you

1133
01:06:56.321 --> 01:06:59.590
can do to treat it.
Uh,
garlic,
uh,
gins,

1134
01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:03.670
the edge and say grapefruit,
grapefruit seed extract and tea tree oil.

1135
01:07:03.671 --> 01:07:07.570
I made this whole concoction of stuff oral,
or is this topical?
I did both.

1136
01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:12.100
So I made a topical cream with a bunch of crazy stuff and then I orally took

1137
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:16.330
tons of garlic and grapefruit seed extract and I took,

1138
01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.790
and it was gingko Biloba notch and said,
goes Gingko Biloba.

1139
01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:23.380
I found studies where it was killing methicillin resistant staphylococcus,

1140
01:07:23.381 --> 01:07:27.400
Darius Mrse.
And so I was like both orally administered and topically,

1141
01:07:27.401 --> 01:07:31.660
and this was in mice.
So I was trying to like translate this to me and it worked.

1142
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:36.560
It worked.
What was really interesting was the last time I had it,
um,

1143
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.200
and it kept coming in the same place.

1144
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.940
I put it on topically and I was taking it orally and literally within 24 hours

1145
01:07:42.941 --> 01:07:45.970
this thing came to a head puffed out.

1146
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.080
Like until there's like this little hole that was left and then it healed and it

1147
01:07:50.081 --> 01:07:53.940
never came back.
Whoa.
So,
um,

1148
01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:57.240
so this is not taken antibiotics.
You weren't taking antibiotics of the pill?

1149
01:07:57.241 --> 01:08:00.440
I had already taken three rounds.
Right.
So you were done,
done,

1150
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:04.000
done because it wrecks your system.
It makes me exhausted.

1151
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:08.860
Totally wrecked my system for a long years.
I had to recover from,

1152
01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:12.070
I mean I got all sorts of gut issues from,
from the,

1153
01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.160
from taking the three rounds of antibiotics because you didn't replenish it with

1154
01:08:16.161 --> 01:08:19.220
probiotics because you didn't know.
I didn't,
I didn't replenish it.

1155
01:08:19.221 --> 01:08:23.450
I was crazy busy.
I was stressed all the time.
So all the above was wrong.

1156
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.210
It was just all wrong.
And,

1157
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:29.430
and I ended up having some inflammatory bowel issues for,
for a while.

1158
01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.920
And then I had to figure that out,

1159
01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:34.280
which was a whole other can of worms because I was like,
what's going on?

1160
01:08:34.281 --> 01:08:38.450
Why all of a sudden sudden am I having this pain in my intestines?

1161
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.760
And I went to specialist pain doctors,
abdominal pain specialists,

1162
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.460
and they were the,
the,

1163
01:08:45.461 --> 01:08:50.380
the advice I got from them was we think it's neuropathy.
Uh,

1164
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.310
how crazy.
You're crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How do you feel about taking an Ssri?

1165
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:59.480
Whoa.
And I was like,
I'm not going to take an SSRI.

1166
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:02.420
And then he goes,
well how do you feel about taking an anticonvulsant?

1167
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:04.950
Both of these have been shown to help with this type of pain and you're a

1168
01:09:04.951 --> 01:09:08.270
bellman them.
And I said,
I absolutely won't take any of these drugs.

1169
01:09:08.271 --> 01:09:10.520
I walked out of this office and I never went back.

1170
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:16.030
And at that point I think I reached a turning point in my belief in the medical

1171
01:09:16.311 --> 01:09:21.230
system in general where I said,
wow,
you know,

1172
01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:23.570
these people have no idea what's going on.

1173
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.820
They're kind of just trial and error trying to figure things out.

1174
01:09:25.821 --> 01:09:30.590
No mention about my diet.
No.
Mentioned about are you taking enough fiber,

1175
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.101
you know,

1176
01:09:31.101 --> 01:09:34.190
what are you eating to make sure you're not getting you this pain isn't because

1177
01:09:34.191 --> 01:09:37.050
you know something's going on.
None of that at all.
And you know,

1178
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:40.850
I want as far as like having them look cause I thought there might be a

1179
01:09:40.851 --> 01:09:44.990
structural defect in like the last part of my colon.
So I had them look,
you know,

1180
01:09:44.991 --> 01:09:46.100
while I was awake,
you know,

1181
01:09:46.101 --> 01:09:49.400
they're going in there and we were looking together and you know,
there was,

1182
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:51.710
there was nothing there.
But you know,

1183
01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.400
the conclusion I came to and I've treated myself through just,

1184
01:09:55.401 --> 01:09:59.750
I've just had a really,
really forced me to have a great diet.

1185
01:09:59.751 --> 01:10:03.710
I upped my fiber intake to like,
oh,
you know,
I'm taking like 45 grand,

1186
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:08.390
I get 45 grams of fiber a day,
a lot of fiber.
And I really,

1187
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:13.630
I never really get this pain much unless I'm something like I don't sleep and

1188
01:10:13.911 --> 01:10:16.460
I'm really,
really stressed and all these little factors come in,

1189
01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:20.210
then it can kind of get a little bit of the pain.
But I mostly like,
it was bad.

1190
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.480
It was so chronic and bad.
It was like every day.
And it was,

1191
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:26.870
it was really interfering with my life,
you know,
my life,
you know,

1192
01:10:26.871 --> 01:10:29.390
granted the same time I'd taken these three rounds and they were strong

1193
01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:31.110
antibiotics.
Uh,

1194
01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.180
I was also very stressed and I wasn't sleeping a lot because I was working just

1195
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.310
nonstop,
just all those things.

1196
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:42.110
So I became interested in the gut many years ago for that reason.

1197
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:43.700
A personal experience,

1198
01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:46.400
you know where it's like when you're having pain every day,

1199
01:10:46.401 --> 01:10:49.550
like you're not used to that and you don't know what's going on.

1200
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.600
The pain wasn't getting worse.
So I knew it wasn't like a tumor,
you know?
But,

1201
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:58.250
but still it was like
no one could help me figure it out.

1202
01:10:58.251 --> 01:11:01.160
And if I was a dummy,
I mean not to say people are dummies,

1203
01:11:01.161 --> 01:11:06.000
I shouldn't say it that way.
But if I were a very dumb,
he's a great subject,

1204
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.590
please don't go politically correct.
You know?

1205
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:13.980
If I were to listen to like people authority like mds,
I might be

1206
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.310
<v 0>on,
you know,
Sris or anticonvulsants right now because it's like,</v>

1207
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:21.170
oh that works on them.
And trying to figure out how to Wean yourself off soundly.

1208
01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.140
I mean,
who knows?

1209
01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:25.680
I mean if my mom were to have gone into that office and she were to have the

1210
01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:29.220
pain and the doctor says take this,
it would have been done.

1211
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:31.830
It would have been a done deal.
She would be on that stuff.
We're right now.

1212
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.130
One of the things that struck me about these conversations that I have with you

1213
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.820
is there are so many things you need to learn.

1214
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:42.750
There's so much information and every time we do a podcast together,

1215
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:45.270
everyone on Twitter says,
Jesus fucking Christ.

1216
01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:47.970
I've got to get my notebook out and start writing things down and start doing

1217
01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:52.971
research because it's the amount of data that you distribute in just a three

1218
01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:55.830
hour podcasts is fucking staggering.

1219
01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:59.910
Now when you think about the amount of time that the average person who is a

1220
01:11:59.911 --> 01:12:02.370
doctor actually spends on nutrition,

1221
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:06.660
it is so small like I have friends that are doctors.
They,
they joke about it.

1222
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.970
It's like it's a you,
you don't learn anything.

1223
01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:13.740
You learn so little in medical school about actual nutrition and the effects and

1224
01:12:13.741 --> 01:12:18.330
it seems to me that over the last few decades it's just been that people are

1225
01:12:18.331 --> 01:12:21.720
starting to be more and more aware of this to the point where it was actually

1226
01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:26.520
joked around like I read this criticism of Bill Maher Ones Cause Bill Maher who

1227
01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.620
says a lot of things I don't agree with,

1228
01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:32.490
especially when it comes to vaccines and things along those lines like man

1229
01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:34.680
vaccines have stopped a lot of fucking diseases.

1230
01:12:34.681 --> 01:12:39.600
I mean there's a lot of things in vaccines have really had a tremendous health

1231
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:42.210
impact for the positive on the human race,

1232
01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:46.080
but he had a really good point that people were mocking.
They were saying,

1233
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:47.730
how come when I go to the doctor,

1234
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.360
the doctor never asked me about my diet and they were saying,

1235
01:12:51.361 --> 01:12:54.300
well look at you bill.
You're thin.
You,
you obviously look healthy.

1236
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.230
That's one of the dumbest fucking things anybody could ever say that that shows

1237
01:12:58.231 --> 01:12:58.770
to me,

1238
01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:03.770
just the common ignorance that the average person has about the word diet,

1239
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:09.120
like diet doesn't mean losing weight.
Diet means what?
What is,

1240
01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:12.750
what are the nutrients you're taking into your system and what,

1241
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.470
what is going on with your body in response to those new trends?

1242
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:20.310
What are you missing?
You know what,
if you don't get enough calcium,

1243
01:13:20.311 --> 01:13:22.500
you get osteoporosis.
We know that there's,

1244
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:26.970
there's significant factors when it comes to health and diet,

1245
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:32.040
but the average doctor doesn't,
average doctor just doesn't know.

1246
01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:34.380
And you have to go deep,
deep,
deep into this.

1247
01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.000
The average doctor who is working 10,

1248
01:13:36.001 --> 01:13:40.860
12 hours a day dealing with the rising costs of medical insurance,

1249
01:13:40.861 --> 01:13:45.270
of malpractice insurance,
uh,
try to pay off your student loans like Jesus Christ.

1250
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.120
And then if you have a family and then if you have a life and then if you have

1251
01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:51.510
hobbies and where does it,
where do they have the time?
It's,

1252
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:53.530
it seems like you need a,

1253
01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:58.620
a whole panel of experts just to figure out how to maximize and optimize the

1254
01:14:00.451 --> 01:14:04.020
human body just with food.
Absolutely.
I mean it's,

1255
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.280
it's a huge problem in terms of like the medical field.
And I think that,

1256
01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:12.190
you know,
as,
as the people are becoming more educated,

1257
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:15.850
<v 1>it puts pressure on,
on the young physicians that are,
you know,</v>

1258
01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:18.700
coming up to learn more about it.
Now,
you know,

1259
01:14:18.701 --> 01:14:20.500
exercise is another thing they don't learn about.
You know,

1260
01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:24.910
exercise is so important.
It's a very important component of health,

1261
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:29.540
disease prevention.
You know,
it's been shown to not only prevent,
you know,

1262
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.270
cancer for example,

1263
01:14:31.271 --> 01:14:33.670
like which is the number two cause of death in the United States,

1264
01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:37.930
but it's been shown to help treat cancer.
You know,
so people that have,

1265
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:40.630
for example,
colon cancer and they exercise a lot,

1266
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.150
they're much less likely to have cancer recurrence.

1267
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:46.270
I mean this has been shown in mouse models where they give them tumors.

1268
01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:49.570
If they exercise vigorously,
then you know,

1269
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:51.370
they're one point.

1270
01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:54.850
Like basically they kill twice as many tumor cells as they,

1271
01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.380
that they do if they don't exercise.

1272
01:14:56.381 --> 01:15:00.670
And this is also very similar to what a chemotherapy drug does,
you know?
And so,

1273
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:04.600
and if you look,
most actually most doctors that are surveyed,
um,

1274
01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:07.210
they don't know about these things.
They don't take an exercise.
In fact,

1275
01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:12.211
50% of all of the medical institutions in the United States at least have no,

1276
01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:15.820
they offer no curriculum.
And of the ones that do offer it,

1277
01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.840
it's optional for a medical medical student that's starting their training to

1278
01:15:19.841 --> 01:15:22.180
take.
So,
I mean it's,
I,

1279
01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:26.920
I think that what's going to happen is eventually the older generations are

1280
01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:29.410
going to die off.
And that's kind of what happens,
you know?

1281
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:33.100
And then we repopulate the new field with people that are more,
more trained,

1282
01:15:33.101 --> 01:15:36.160
more educated.
I do see a lot of younger physicians,
in fact,

1283
01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:38.470
a lot of them reach out to me and say that they've,

1284
01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.980
they've learned a lot from some of my videos from listening to me on the Joe

1285
01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:45.190
Rogan experience,
you know,
so I know that there's a group of people,

1286
01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:50.370
young physicians out there that are interested in prevention or are interested

1287
01:15:50.531 --> 01:15:54.160
in understanding this complex interaction between nutrition.

1288
01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:57.040
And how it affects disease susceptibility,

1289
01:15:57.190 --> 01:16:02.190
how it can help you not only optimize your performance and certain things,

1290
01:16:02.201 --> 01:16:05.370
cognitive performance,
but also can prolong your lifespan.

1291
01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.970
So I think that's coming.
It's changing.
And it's very frustrating.

1292
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:13.510
The amount of data required though.
It's just so overwhelming.

1293
01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:17.560
It's a lot of work.
How the fuck do you do it?
It's,

1294
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.990
it's,
it's,
you know,
I,
I do it because,

1295
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.800
you know,
I,
I really like getting this information,

1296
01:16:26.801 --> 01:16:29.380
synthesizing this information and communicating it to people.

1297
01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:32.830
That's something I really enjoyed doing.
I get feedback,
you know,

1298
01:16:32.831 --> 01:16:33.760
I do it part time,

1299
01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:37.180
but it's takes a lot of time and I want to shift more of my focus to doing this.

1300
01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:37.781
But I mean,

1301
01:16:37.781 --> 01:16:41.650
I get messages all the time from people saying that they've listened to me on

1302
01:16:41.651 --> 01:16:45.340
the,
on the jre or they've,
you know,
listen to my videos in it and they've,

1303
01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:48.520
you know,
fine tune their diet,
their micronutrient intake,

1304
01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:51.400
and it made a huge difference in their mental health.
You know,

1305
01:16:51.401 --> 01:16:54.070
they're off drug fill in the blank,
you know,

1306
01:16:54.071 --> 01:16:57.760
their physical health is better and it's,
you know,
so I think it's,

1307
01:16:57.761 --> 01:16:59.020
it's important,
you know,

1308
01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:03.250
for people to communicate this health information to the public and there are

1309
01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:06.230
people doing it and you know,
that's one way and,
and,
and,

1310
01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:08.470
and communicate it to doctors as well,
you know,

1311
01:17:08.471 --> 01:17:12.190
so it helps if you have someone else break it down for them,
uh,

1312
01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:13.580
because they don't have the time.
But

1313
01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:17.020
<v 0>there is an issue also were doctors don't wanna admit that they don't know</v>

1314
01:17:17.021 --> 01:17:20.830
things and they don't want admit there's a significant factor that maybe they

1315
01:17:20.831 --> 01:17:24.310
haven't researched at all that pertains to human health.
I mean,

1316
01:17:24.311 --> 01:17:27.760
that's human nature,
right?
Humans don't want to admit that,
especially doctors,

1317
01:17:27.761 --> 01:17:32.110
especially people that are in that massive position of power and expertise.

1318
01:17:32.111 --> 01:17:34.900
Like a doctor is a very respected member of society.

1319
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:38.480
Someone who's taking care of the Sig is healing you and you,
you know,

1320
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.620
it's going to put you under and stitch you up if he's a surgeon.
I mean,
there's,

1321
01:17:41.621 --> 01:17:43.900
right,
there's so much to that.
When I,

1322
01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:48.760
when I had that experience with my gut and you know,
there was just no

1323
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:51.020
<v 1>talk about nutrition at all.</v>

1324
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:55.080
And one of the major things with gut health is nutrition.
Yeah.

1325
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:59.930
I mean it blew my mind.
It blew my mind.
And I realized at that point,
you know,

1326
01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:04.790
I,
I can either blame this guy for like not knowing or maybe maybe people don't

1327
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:05.810
want to change our nutrition.

1328
01:18:05.811 --> 01:18:09.860
Maybe he's responding to people just wanting a pill.
I mean,
that's possible.

1329
01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:13.670
There are a lot of people that don't want to make changes that are difficult to

1330
01:18:13.671 --> 01:18:18.020
make.
Um,
and I don't really know what the case was,
but it regardless,

1331
01:18:18.021 --> 01:18:21.950
it blew my mind.
And,
and then at that point I said,
well,
I have to do this myself.

1332
01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.460
You know,
I have to,
I have to figure out what's going on.
Um,

1333
01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:29.810
and that's kind of why I got to this sequencing my poop thing because I,

1334
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.830
I've had issues in the past and so I did sequence it.
And you know,

1335
01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.650
I would say that my,
if you compare it to my husband,

1336
01:18:36.651 --> 01:18:40.040
our gut bacteria is a little different.
Even though we eat the same diet,

1337
01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.460
you know,
we are on the same circadian schedule,
things like that.

1338
01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:45.860
This is because of the VSL number three.
Well,

1339
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:49.310
what happened was after I took VSL number three for 30 days,
I,

1340
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:53.870
I dramatically increase the amount of good bacteria in my gut.

1341
01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.410
And that was really surprised.
I actually increased biodiversity,

1342
01:18:57.411 --> 01:19:01.040
so I like it was having new types of bacteria crop up that weren't there the

1343
01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:05.300
first time I did this.
And I think that's because when you're,

1344
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:10.370
when you're increasing their population of good bacteria in your gut that's

1345
01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:15.290
taking up space and they make things called blood lactate,
lactic acid,

1346
01:19:15.291 --> 01:19:16.430
it gets turned into lactic acid,

1347
01:19:16.431 --> 01:19:20.120
which actually a pathogenic bacteria cancer by and that,

1348
01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:23.900
so they actually die off.
So you're like dying,
you're killing off this bad stuff.

1349
01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:27.320
And that allows space room for new bacteria grow.

1350
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:31.220
So lactic acid kills pathogenic bacteria.
Um,

1351
01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.260
they can't live in an acidic environment.
So yeah,
when part of the,
you know,

1352
01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.870
lactobacillus strains,
that's in like every probiotic.

1353
01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:43.310
I mean you always see lactobacillus,
Xyz,
there's lots of different types.
Um,

1354
01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.630
one of the things they do is they,

1355
01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:49.460
they generate lactate and lactate is,
um,

1356
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:54.120
Ken get formed into lactic acid by adding a proton.
Uh,
and that,
uh,
it's a,

1357
01:19:54.121 --> 01:19:57.350
it's in a constant,
constant like homeostasis thing where it's,
you know,

1358
01:19:57.351 --> 01:20:01.610
going between lactic and lactic acid.
But one of the things that does is it kill,

1359
01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:06.620
it provides a and more acidic environment in the colon where these pathogenic

1360
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.450
bacteria can't survive.
But is,
is,

1361
01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.360
is that related to lactic acid that's produced during exercise?
Actually.
Um,

1362
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.330
so this is really,
it's really interesting.

1363
01:20:18.331 --> 01:20:23.331
The lactic acid that's produced when you exercise is absolutely related to it's

1364
01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:28.590
the same thing.
Um,
and it's actually beneficial.
Most people think of it as,

1365
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:33.000
you know,
causing muscle soreness.
It's like,
oh,
I'm making too much lactic acid.

1366
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:37.740
My,
my muscles hurt.
Um,
it's not actually true.
So lactate,

1367
01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.160
the reason why your gut likes it is because it's an easy source of energy.

1368
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:46.350
It doesn't require energy.
So when you have glucose,
um,
when you,

1369
01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:48.890
when you,
when you eat carbohydrates have glucose,

1370
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:53.010
you have to convert that into a form that your cells can use to make energy.

1371
01:20:53.011 --> 01:20:56.040
And that,
that requires energy to do that.
Well,
lactate,

1372
01:20:56.370 --> 01:21:00.160
it doesn't have to do that.
It,
it's,
it's thermodynamically favorable meaning it,

1373
01:21:00.170 --> 01:21:02.550
you don't,
it doesn't require energy to make energy.

1374
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:07.290
Lactic goes right into the cell and there's a transporter on their cell and also

1375
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:11.430
in your Mitochondria,
which are,
the energy is made or just goes right in and it,

1376
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:15.120
it's a really easily easy,
usable,
um,
source of energy.

1377
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:18.600
So when you,
when you exercise,
and this has been shown,

1378
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:20.790
you make more lactate.

1379
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:25.850
Now the lactic acid can form because your mitochondria are pushing out protons,

1380
01:21:27.301 --> 01:21:28.380
it's like a little technical,

1381
01:21:28.381 --> 01:21:32.430
but basically they're pushing out protons and w as the lactates there it can

1382
01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.500
bind onto the lactate and formed lactic acid.

1383
01:21:34.501 --> 01:21:36.630
But then at physiological ph it goes back to lactate.

1384
01:21:36.631 --> 01:21:38.070
So it's like this back and forth deal.

1385
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:42.630
But the lactase been shown when you exercise to go into the brain,

1386
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:48.150
it preferentially,
your neurons actually use lactate preferentially over glucose.

1387
01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:50.610
Most people don't know that,
but in your brain,

1388
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:53.070
so you have neurons and you have astrocytes,

1389
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:56.250
and the astrocytes are per supporting cells that make,

1390
01:21:56.850 --> 01:22:01.080
they make energy for your neurons.
They actually make lactate by using glucose.

1391
01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:01.980
They make lactate.

1392
01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.150
Lactate then gets shuttled to the neuron and it's a really easy a source they

1393
01:22:06.151 --> 01:22:09.480
can use for energy and it's actually the preferred source of energy for the

1394
01:22:09.481 --> 01:22:13.860
brain.
And in fact,
a friend of mine,
he's a professor at UC Berkeley.

1395
01:22:14.050 --> 01:22:14.940
His name is George Brooks.

1396
01:22:14.941 --> 01:22:17.910
He's the guy that actually has an exercise exercise physiologists,

1397
01:22:17.911 --> 01:22:22.740
and he's the guy that discovered the lactate transporter and figure it out.

1398
01:22:22.741 --> 01:22:23.574
That basically when you're,

1399
01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.010
when you're exercising this lactate that you're making,

1400
01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:29.880
the reason you're making it is because typically when you're exercising,

1401
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:30.960
when you're exercising,

1402
01:22:30.961 --> 01:22:33.930
you're doing more work and that oxygen we were talking about that you usually

1403
01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.760
breathe in and that's used to make energy.

1404
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:38.970
You're doing so much work that you don't have time for that.

1405
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:43.080
So the glucose that you have is being used in another way and it's making energy

1406
01:22:43.081 --> 01:22:45.540
quicker,
but it also makes lactate is a byproduct.

1407
01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:47.640
And so that's why when you're exercising,
that happens.

1408
01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.960
Our immune cells are t cells that are all,
they're always making lactate.

1409
01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.650
The lactate that they made in the circulation,
it goes to the muscle,

1410
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:59.820
goes to the heart,
it goes to the brain and it's used as a source of energy.

1411
01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:04.320
That's,
you know,
like I said,
it's just,
it's very easy to use.
So it's,
it's great.

1412
01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.570
Um,
as queer space being used to treat a Tbi,

1413
01:23:07.630 --> 01:23:10.810
my friend George books is now collaborating with someone at Ucla.
Um,

1414
01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:14.830
they're working with mostly Tbi from like gunshot wounds,
you know,

1415
01:23:14.831 --> 01:23:19.450
guys that are coming in from,
you know,
fights,
gang fights,
things like that.

1416
01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:23.470
They're in there.
They've got a Tbi from a gunshot wound.
Well,

1417
01:23:23.471 --> 01:23:28.471
they're finding that if they immediately administer lactate through their veins,

1418
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.850
so intravenously,
they're able to,

1419
01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:34.390
then lactate can go as long as their blood brain barrier's intact somewhat.

1420
01:23:34.391 --> 01:23:34.700
And you,

1421
01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:38.620
you have to be able to have oxygen getting to your brain in order to do this.

1422
01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:43.120
But the lactate dramatically improves the,
um,
their healing.

1423
01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:46.780
And that's for a couple of reasons.
One is because when you get,

1424
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.500
when you get a Tbi,
you're astrocytes,
which usually make it for your neurons.

1425
01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.120
Exercise also does this.
Uh,
they get damaged and they're not for some reason,

1426
01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:57.340
and no one knows why.
We haven't figured out why yet.

1427
01:23:57.370 --> 01:24:01.210
They stop making the lactate,
they're damaged and they're like,
they're like,

1428
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:03.010
they're trying to repair all this other stuff.

1429
01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.590
So then the neurons start to have to use glucose,

1430
01:24:05.591 --> 01:24:10.300
which means they have to work harder to use glucose to turn it into energy.

1431
01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:14.930
Well,
lactate is a lot easier for them to use.
And so at one that,

1432
01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.900
that's one thing that's good too,

1433
01:24:16.901 --> 01:24:20.200
is that glucose can then be used to make something,

1434
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:22.840
make precursors for glutathione.

1435
01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:26.830
So glucose can be shunted into this other pathway.

1436
01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:28.810
We're can then make precursors for glutathione,

1437
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:30.580
which is actually the strongest antioxidant in the brain.

1438
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.320
So under the sources of Tbi,

1439
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:35.550
and this has been shown when the lactates administered,
uh,

1440
01:24:35.551 --> 01:24:38.050
more of that glucose is then used to make glutathione and all this,

1441
01:24:38.051 --> 01:24:40.000
the repairing this damage.
And so,
you know,

1442
01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:42.110
the neurons are getting this source of energy that's,
you know,

1443
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:45.460
easily more easily used.
So the lactate when you were,

1444
01:24:45.461 --> 01:24:49.630
when you're exercising is actually doing a lot of good and it's been like radio

1445
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:53.170
labeled where they sh they are able to follow it and show that people when they

1446
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:57.860
exercise it goes right into the brain.
And what's really interesting is that,
um,

1447
01:24:57.970 --> 01:25:00.640
I've made this connection and Ma,
I'm not saying this is true,

1448
01:25:00.641 --> 01:25:03.490
but Parkinson's patients,
people with Parkinson's disease.

1449
01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.650
So Parkinson's is a disease where you're,

1450
01:25:05.651 --> 01:25:10.040
it's a neurogenerative disease where you're losing the dopaminergic neurons in

1451
01:25:10.041 --> 01:25:11.340
your substantial Niagara.
It's,

1452
01:25:11.341 --> 01:25:13.510
and they're dying and so you're not making enough dopamine.

1453
01:25:13.511 --> 01:25:18.340
And this affects motor control.
Well,
if they're forced to exercise really hard,

1454
01:25:18.341 --> 01:25:21.610
like if you have a two person bike and they're forced to like keep up.

1455
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:26.140
So it's not like you allow them to choose how hard they exercise.

1456
01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:28.510
They're actually forced to do it hard.
Um,

1457
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.960
it improves their symptoms so their motor control gets better there.

1458
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:34.630
They're walking.
So their gait,
the way they walk improves.

1459
01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:39.960
And another study came out in flies that were genetically engineered to get kind

1460
01:25:39.961 --> 01:25:42.790
of like a Parkinson's disease where they have this screwed up stuff going on in

1461
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:44.980
the neurons that's very similar to Parkinson's.

1462
01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:49.900
When they administered them l lactate,
it actually improved all this other,

1463
01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:54.130
you know,
the cells weren't dying,
so improved all this uh,
energetic metabolism,

1464
01:25:54.131 --> 01:25:54.731
things like that.

1465
01:25:54.731 --> 01:25:58.270
And so I'm wondering if part of the exercise that benefits the Parkinson's

1466
01:25:58.271 --> 01:26:01.270
patients has to do with the lactate that you're producing,

1467
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:04.100
which gets cross the blood brain gets into the brain

1468
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.130
<v 0>and that is easily usable source of energy for the,
the,</v>

1469
01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:12.170
the substantial Niagara Neurons.
Wow.
That is crazy.

1470
01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.530
Now lactic acid doesn't cause the muscle soreness.

1471
01:26:15.531 --> 01:26:18.230
What causing the muscle soreness is the damage of the tissue?
Well,

1472
01:26:18.231 --> 01:26:22.550
lactic acid can cause some of the muscle soreness,
but it's also used to repair,

1473
01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:26.030
you know,
the,
the damage because the lactate,

1474
01:26:26.031 --> 01:26:30.780
Jen goes into the muscle inside the cell and is used for energy and there as

1475
01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.980
there is other damage that's going on from cytokines and there's lots of things.

1476
01:26:33.981 --> 01:26:35.810
There's lots of inputs.
It's not just one thing.

1477
01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:39.950
If you've seen those things that people wear the like a pants and that smush

1478
01:26:39.951 --> 01:26:44.750
your legs and,
and they're supposed to aid recovery,
they'll or compression pants.

1479
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:48.260
You know what I'm talking about?
God Damn it Jamie.
See if you can look that up.

1480
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:51.050
They send them to me.
I haven't used it,
but my friend Cameron Hanes,

1481
01:26:51.051 --> 01:26:52.790
who he runs ultra marathons,

1482
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:57.200
he ran 106 something miles in 24 hours.

1483
01:26:57.230 --> 01:27:01.040
He's fucking nuts.
Crazy.
Crazy dude has a full time job too.

1484
01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:05.780
He's a bow hunter.
That's what he does.
And he's,
he's a maniac.
But uh,
no,
no,
no.

1485
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:06.201
These are,

1486
01:27:06.201 --> 01:27:10.860
these are compression pants there therefore there for recovery there.

1487
01:27:10.861 --> 01:27:14.720
I'm a chick,
can't remember the name of the company.
They sent me one.

1488
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:20.210
I never used it sitting in my garage somewhere.
But it's supposed to help,

1489
01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:25.240
but it's smushes your legs and it's supposed to somehow or another improve your,

1490
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:29.160
your circulation.
Some.
Yeah.
Those are the things.
Um,

1491
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:33.110
that's one of them.
The ones that I have looked different than that.

1492
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.190
Yeah.
See if you go back to that picture,

1493
01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:41.180
go back to that picture of the one and the right and those related images with

1494
01:27:41.181 --> 01:27:43.610
the black one.
Yeah.
That's it right there.

1495
01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.090
That and the one next to it.
Yeah.

1496
01:27:47.091 --> 01:27:50.630
What does the name of the company that says that?
Yeah.

1497
01:27:50.631 --> 01:27:55.100
Nor to tech or something like that.
Is that what it says?
NORMATEC NormaTec yeah,

1498
01:27:55.101 --> 01:27:56.830
that's the one that I have.
Um,

1499
01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:00.440
and I know people swear by that they say it really helps their recovery.

1500
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:03.920
Now when it helps your recovery,
what is going on there?

1501
01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:07.940
Is it pushing the lactic acid out of your muscles and is that positive or that,

1502
01:28:07.941 --> 01:28:10.040
could that be possibly negative or you just,

1503
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:14.450
you just gave us pseudoscience look to that didn't,
you?
Did,
did,

1504
01:28:15.090 --> 01:28:19.090
I don't think that's happening.
I mean the law,
the lactate would be,
uh,

1505
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:21.860
used by the muscles and that would be beneficial.
Uh,

1506
01:28:21.861 --> 01:28:25.520
if no idea what's going on there.
Other than that,

1507
01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:29.030
it looks really funny.
I have a shit.

1508
01:28:29.031 --> 01:28:31.760
I should have brought an avenue to try it on.
No,
you never tried them?
No,

1509
01:28:31.761 --> 01:28:34.430
I haven't tried it.
You've no idea what's going on there.

1510
01:28:34.431 --> 01:28:38.200
I have no idea what's going on there.
I mean,
I could,

1511
01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:40.760
I could speculate and will it be totally wrong?

1512
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:45.050
We'll rogue fitness has it and those guys are pretty Goddamn legit one.

1513
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:48.410
Let's go to the website and see if it has some sort of a,

1514
01:28:48.411 --> 01:28:52.750
an explanation of what it does and see if Ron Nicole's bowls.

1515
01:28:53.730 --> 01:28:54.770
Yeah,
I'm sure.
Uh,

1516
01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:58.640
an exercise physiologist would know much more about this thing than me.

1517
01:28:58.670 --> 01:29:00.440
What is it supposed to do?
What does it say?

1518
01:29:00.441 --> 01:29:01.980
Helps rejuvenate the muscle tissue and

1519
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.170
<v 1>dramatically reduced tightness and soreness,</v>

1520
01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.030
meaning less downtime and greater productivity.
Hmm.

1521
01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:14.090
Full length compression boots before and after intense workout can help.

1522
01:29:14.341 --> 01:29:15.750
Rejuvenate.
Does that make sense?

1523
01:29:16.930 --> 01:29:21.630
It doesn't really bring any science bells in my head.
Just smushing your legs.

1524
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:25.800
It didn't seem to go type of stress.
Compression is a type of stress,

1525
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:30.180
which I think there are different physiological mechanisms that are responding

1526
01:29:30.181 --> 01:29:33.300
to that that probably are anti-inflammatory,
but I know nothing about that.

1527
01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:34.730
And so I'm just going to shut up.
Okay.

1528
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:38.290
Once you go to the website and see if the website has fucking expensive.
Damn,

1529
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:42.900
it's two grand,
1500 bucks.
Um,
go to the website,
see if there's,

1530
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:48.600
um,
so w two things that I've wanted to get back to.

1531
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:52.230
Um,
one thing is,
uh,
the,

1532
01:29:52.231 --> 01:29:55.080
for the second of the two things of the first time I said two things,

1533
01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:58.320
which was the,
the exercise when they,

1534
01:29:58.321 --> 01:30:02.790
those guys did exercise and then did cold water immersion.

1535
01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:08.040
How do we know what level of stress and how hard they were exercising?

1536
01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.790
Um,
you're talking about the guy one that,
yeah,

1537
01:30:11.791 --> 01:30:16.170
they experienced a negative impact on muscle growth.
Well,
I mean you think,

1538
01:30:16.171 --> 01:30:20.550
I think you have to look at the types of exercise they were doing and then

1539
01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:25.350
everyone's different.
I mean,
I've seen people at the gym that they,
they're slow.

1540
01:30:25.351 --> 01:30:25.880
I mean they just,

1541
01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:29.780
they take forever to do is set and they don't look like they're pushing it in.

1542
01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.810
So the fact that they completed a set,
I think everyone's different,
right?

1543
01:30:33.811 --> 01:30:36.090
You know,
like it,
it's hard to tell how,

1544
01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:41.690
I think a really good way to do the study would actually be to measure a blood

1545
01:30:42.301 --> 01:30:45.360
biomarker like io one beta or Tnf Alpha,

1546
01:30:45.361 --> 01:30:49.830
which are both proinflammatory cytokines measure the level of that that's

1547
01:30:49.831 --> 01:30:53.700
released like immediately after exercise.
So people that are really,

1548
01:30:53.701 --> 01:30:58.260
really pushing it like competitively,
you know,
competitive trainers,
uh,
athletes,

1549
01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:02.310
they're going to have a really,
really high level of that,
like extremely high,

1550
01:31:02.311 --> 01:31:07.080
like off the charts versus someone who is not pushing it as hard.

1551
01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.390
So I think that would be one way to,

1552
01:31:09.391 --> 01:31:13.320
at least in a study when you're designing this trial,
like so you can know,
okay,

1553
01:31:13.321 --> 01:31:17.400
well this isn't the amount of,
you know,
inflammation,
this is the amount of,

1554
01:31:17.401 --> 01:31:18.990
and you can measure other things as well.

1555
01:31:18.991 --> 01:31:22.920
Other biomarkers of stress that's going on in this,

1556
01:31:22.921 --> 01:31:26.340
this person that's doing training.
And I think most people know.

1557
01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.310
And then after that.
Okay,
well then after you mentioned that amount,

1558
01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:33.660
then you do the cold therapy and you know,

1559
01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.930
then you measure biomarkers late,
like the anti inflammatory things like that.

1560
01:31:36.931 --> 01:31:39.930
But you kind of assumed that they weren't working out that hard.

1561
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.500
I assumed based on the conflicting literature,

1562
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:48.510
if you look at these people that were doing the hill training,

1563
01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:51.030
and I guess I guess it's more endurance training,

1564
01:31:51.031 --> 01:31:53.640
but you can work out hard by doing resistance training.

1565
01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:56.370
I mean not saying that's a hill training,
it might be endurance training,

1566
01:31:56.371 --> 01:31:59.220
but it certainly has a big taxing effect on your muscles.

1567
01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.250
It's one of the most brutal

1568
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.590
<v 0>things you can do to your muscles.
Right?
Yeah,</v>

1569
01:32:01.650 --> 01:32:02.950
<v 1>right.
I mean there,</v>

1570
01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:06.690
I mean it is a type of resistance training as well as close to the other guys,

1571
01:32:06.691 --> 01:32:11.550
which were just lifting weights.
They were doing leg presses and like some,

1572
01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.590
some kind of squat jumps where you,

1573
01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:16.410
I don't know what that is and I think there was some metrics,

1574
01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:20.770
something else that we're doing,
but I think there's a spectrum.

1575
01:32:20.771 --> 01:32:24.450
I mean there's a spectrum of,
of athletes of how people train.
I mean,

1576
01:32:24.451 --> 01:32:26.820
some people train really,
really,
really hard.

1577
01:32:26.821 --> 01:32:31.821
And those people do produce a lot of proinflammatory cytokines that spin out of

1578
01:32:32.911 --> 01:32:34.530
control and start to not only,

1579
01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:38.310
not only do you have a hormetic effect where it's like,
okay,
this,

1580
01:32:38.490 --> 01:32:41.250
this bad stuff is now signaling to turn on all this good stuff,

1581
01:32:41.251 --> 01:32:44.580
which is great and you need that.
That's part of recovery.

1582
01:32:44.581 --> 01:32:48.090
And that's also part of growing new muscles.
So,
you know,
uh,

1583
01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:51.390
having producing these damaging products activates mitochondria.

1584
01:32:51.391 --> 01:32:53.820
You grow more Mitochondria and that's,
you know,

1585
01:32:53.821 --> 01:32:56.370
plays a role in things like building more muscle.

1586
01:32:56.790 --> 01:33:01.620
But if you have too much of that stress,
it's all about the dose,

1587
01:33:01.621 --> 01:33:04.470
then you start to have damage where the,

1588
01:33:04.471 --> 01:33:07.140
the pro stress stuff is going a little out of control.

1589
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:10.590
And this is the case with people that are really,
really overtraining.

1590
01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:14.640
And it's the case when you're injured.
Um,
or,
or like I said,

1591
01:33:14.641 --> 01:33:17.880
in the case where you're actually getting traumatic injury,

1592
01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:20.280
whether that's like a blow to the body or the head or

1593
01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:21.541
<v 0>with athletes,</v>

1594
01:33:21.541 --> 01:33:25.350
it's a big issue trying to figure out when they are overtraining and with

1595
01:33:25.351 --> 01:33:29.250
wrestlers especially they're almost chronically overtrained,

1596
01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.050
especially amateur wrestlers.

1597
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:35.640
One of the things that wrestlers develop is the ability to push through fatigue,

1598
01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:37.470
pain and dehydration.

1599
01:33:37.471 --> 01:33:41.430
It's a huge issue and it also creates incredible mental toughness.
Like men.

1600
01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:46.380
I've found that amateur wrestlers are amongst the toughest,
like as a whole,

1601
01:33:46.530 --> 01:33:49.620
the toughest groups of athletes that compete in mixed martial arts.

1602
01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:53.700
And I think one of the reasons is they're used to being really uncomfortable and

1603
01:33:53.701 --> 01:33:57.450
they're used to training on a regular basis,
like way past their limits.

1604
01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.390
Like I remember when I wrestled,
I wrestled in high school,

1605
01:34:00.391 --> 01:34:04.050
which is nothing in comparison to what they have to do in college and especially

1606
01:34:04.051 --> 01:34:07.760
what they have to do and like Olympic level or the amount of training and the,

1607
01:34:07.761 --> 01:34:11.970
the brutal preparation that's involved is if you haven't experienced it,

1608
01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:13.140
you really don't know.

1609
01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:17.190
But a big factor is that these guys are overtrained all the time.

1610
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:22.320
How does one know whether or not they're overtrained or whether or not you just

1611
01:34:22.321 --> 01:34:25.140
have to keep pushing and push through,

1612
01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:28.280
like whatever level of fatigue and your body will eventually respond to it?

1613
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:29.300
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1614
01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:33.740
I mean I think that an exercise physiology physiologists would probably be able

1615
01:34:33.741 --> 01:34:38.030
to answer that much better than me.
But just my insights on it would be,
I think,

1616
01:34:38.250 --> 01:34:40.700
you know,
measuring markers of muscle damage,

1617
01:34:40.701 --> 01:34:43.220
so your muscles release things when they start to be damaged.

1618
01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.840
So measuring these biomarkers of that like immediately after the training is a

1619
01:34:47.841 --> 01:34:51.620
way to quantitate it,
at least in terms of like muscle damage.
You can,

1620
01:34:51.621 --> 01:34:54.650
you can quantitate some of these things that are released when the muscles being

1621
01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:58.790
broken down and damaged by the,
by the immune system.
Um,

1622
01:34:58.791 --> 01:35:02.870
I think that would be one way to see,
to,
to actually quantitative.
We go,
okay,

1623
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:05.450
look,
this is what's going on after this type of workout.

1624
01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.960
You're actually causing more damage,
you know,

1625
01:35:08.961 --> 01:35:13.340
so you know that that would be my guess.
But I don't really,
I don't really know.

1626
01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:17.360
I'm sure people are using different things that they biomark to,

1627
01:35:17.361 --> 01:35:21.140
to measure if they're overtraining or not.
It's just not my UFC athletes.

1628
01:35:21.230 --> 01:35:24.020
It's very few people doing any kind of measuring of anything.

1629
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:26.300
They're just training hard.
I mean that's what they're doing.

1630
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:31.430
It's very caveman like in a way it's very old school in a lot of ways.

1631
01:35:31.431 --> 01:35:35.360
And I always wonder how much of that mental toughness is actually them tripping

1632
01:35:35.361 --> 01:35:38.600
over their own feet,
getting in the way of themselves actually recovering.

1633
01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:42.320
And would they be better off in some cases doing less.

1634
01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:46.220
And also does your,
your threshold,

1635
01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:50.480
does it build up over time with harder working out?

1636
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:53.570
Do you get like a,
a higher capacity for work?

1637
01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:57.470
Cause you know as you get in better shape you can do more.
Yes.

1638
01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:02.540
And do you get your body to a level where it can just physically respond better

1639
01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:06.770
to training,
recover better,
to training,
do more.

1640
01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:11.960
And then is there a boundary that you cross where that's no longer the case and

1641
01:36:11.961 --> 01:36:14.960
now you're doing damage?
I think so.
I,
and,
and that's been,

1642
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:18.950
and it has been shown that the more you train,
you know,

1643
01:36:18.951 --> 01:36:22.760
or the more stressed you do and do it on your body because you're activating a

1644
01:36:22.761 --> 01:36:24.890
lot of those hormetic signaling pathways.

1645
01:36:24.891 --> 01:36:28.880
And a lot of those have to do with heat shock proteins.
Those get activated,

1646
01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:33.020
those protect from muscles from getting damaged,
they protect from a lot,

1647
01:36:33.021 --> 01:36:36.040
you know,
a lot of types of damage.
The more you train they've,

1648
01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.660
and they've shown this an athletes,
the more ads,
the more trained athletes,

1649
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.460
the more highly activated this is all the time and the person and when they have

1650
01:36:43.461 --> 01:36:46.130
this activated,
they can actually endure more stress.

1651
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:48.530
So and including injury and that's,

1652
01:36:48.531 --> 01:36:51.880
and that's been shown even with heat training.
So if you'd like to,

1653
01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:53.600
in addition to your,
your workout,

1654
01:36:53.601 --> 01:36:57.260
you also use the sauna and you to activate these heat shock proteins,

1655
01:36:57.530 --> 01:37:01.340
then you can endure more stress the next time.
That's absolutely true.

1656
01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.260
Now the threshold into,
okay,

1657
01:37:03.261 --> 01:37:06.110
at what point then do we cross over into damage again?

1658
01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:10.310
Well that happens when you're doing too much of this stress and then something

1659
01:37:10.311 --> 01:37:14.060
else,
stress full happens again.
So the stress plus the stress,
you know,

1660
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:18.320
equals death cell death muscle cells or,
or what have you.

1661
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.620
So there,
you know,
and I,

1662
01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.230
I think it depends on the person in order to determine that threshold.

1663
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:27.560
You know,
it's,
it depends on how much they've trained,
how,

1664
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.940
how much they've already built up those stress response mechanisms like heat

1665
01:37:31.941 --> 01:37:34.670
shock proteins and other things that are,
that are,

1666
01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:38.570
that are activated from exercise.
And also,
you know,

1667
01:37:38.571 --> 01:37:42.140
exercise causes you to build more Mitochondria.
So,
you know,

1668
01:37:42.141 --> 01:37:43.400
more trained athletes can,

1669
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:46.580
they can endure more because they are basically can make more energy.

1670
01:37:46.581 --> 01:37:51.240
And so it has all these things happening.
Um,
but I do absolutely think that that,

1671
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:54.020
that has been shown and that the more stress that you do enjoy,

1672
01:37:54.021 --> 01:37:56.250
the better you can deal with.
Steve Maxwell,

1673
01:37:56.250 --> 01:38:00.150
<v 0>who's a good friend of mine,
is also a really well respected,
a personal trainer,</v>

1674
01:38:00.151 --> 01:38:01.920
a physical trainer.
He says,

1675
01:38:01.921 --> 01:38:05.610
measuring your heart rate is a big indicator that if you measure your heart rate

1676
01:38:05.611 --> 01:38:09.150
every morning,
you're waking heartbreak as you wake up.
When it starts going up,

1677
01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.030
when your,
your heart rate is up five to 10 beats per minute in the morning,

1678
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:16.350
it's more than likely that your overtrained and he advocates not training at all

1679
01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:19.590
when it happens.
Whereas,
you know,
a lot of coaches will like,
come on,

1680
01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:22.500
don't be a bitch.
Like get up.
You got to work out.
You know,

1681
01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:24.660
you gotta you gotta be tough,
you gotta be mentally tough.
He's like,

1682
01:38:24.661 --> 01:38:26.250
that's nonsense.
You can't do that.

1683
01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:30.060
If your heart rate is 10 beats above the normal resting heart rate,

1684
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:33.690
it means there's an issue.
And if you break your body down more,

1685
01:38:33.691 --> 01:38:36.630
you're going to get sick or you're going to get injured or something's going on,

1686
01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.510
something's going on

1687
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:41.080
<v 1>break.
Yeah.
And the,
and I've,
I've noticed that in myself.
Like when I really,</v>

1688
01:38:41.081 --> 01:38:44.050
really push it like in the gym and you check your heart rate.

1689
01:38:44.230 --> 01:38:46.810
I don't check my heart.
I'm going to have checked right heart,
my heart rate,

1690
01:38:46.811 --> 01:38:49.720
but I don't do it like when I wake up in the morning.
Um,

1691
01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:54.280
but I do notice that I will,
I will be more susceptible to getting sick.

1692
01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:58.930
Like if I really,
really try and like push it really hard with my workout,

1693
01:38:58.990 --> 01:39:03.730
like just over the top,
uh,
I will,
I will end up getting killed.
I put,

1694
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:06.550
I usually don't get sick a lot.
Like I,
I once a year,

1695
01:39:06.551 --> 01:39:11.080
maybe not even once you're like,
uh,
it's,
it doesn't,
it doesn't hit me very often.

1696
01:39:11.410 --> 01:39:12.191
But if I really,

1697
01:39:12.191 --> 01:39:15.310
really work out in the gym and then I'm stressed for work or something else,

1698
01:39:15.311 --> 01:39:18.880
it's like boom,
those things to push me into the,
the sickness.

1699
01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:22.090
<v 0>Gut Health for me has been a huge,</v>

1700
01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:26.230
huge improvement on my immune system in drink,
just drinking Kombucha.

1701
01:39:26.231 --> 01:39:30.610
I drink two of those a day,
usually on a regular basis.
I eat a lot of Kimchi,

1702
01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.240
which is most people find disgusting,
but I love that stuff.
Fermented cabbage,

1703
01:39:35.241 --> 01:39:36.850
so spicy,
fermented Korean.

1704
01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:39.160
<v 1>I love calorie to hear it all time.</v>

1705
01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:42.230
I mean that makes perfect sense because when you,

1706
01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:46.600
when you know gut health is poor and you have this chronic inflammation,

1707
01:39:47.050 --> 01:39:51.560
then all the energy that is,
you know,
you're generating,
it's getting slightly,

1708
01:39:51.610 --> 01:39:52.510
we've talked about this before,

1709
01:39:52.511 --> 01:39:56.470
it's like getting triaged into resolving that inflammation.
Well guess what,

1710
01:39:56.471 --> 01:39:59.320
your immune cells,
they sacrifice,

1711
01:39:59.650 --> 01:40:03.280
they sacrifice things and they are basically not getting all the energy they

1712
01:40:03.281 --> 01:40:07.330
need to make sure they're going to fight off this infection because they're this

1713
01:40:07.331 --> 01:40:10.320
other infection over here,
this chronic inflammation.
Well that's more important.

1714
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:11.140
You know,
that's,
that's,

1715
01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:14.890
that was there before and that's going on and it's not stopping.
So I think that,

1716
01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:17.140
you know,
gut health and the immune system,

1717
01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:22.060
there's a very intimate connection between your gut health and your overall

1718
01:40:22.061 --> 01:40:26.710
health,
your,
your heart health,
you know,
your,
your immune health.
Just,

1719
01:40:26.711 --> 01:40:27.401
just everything.

1720
01:40:27.401 --> 01:40:31.060
I think that gut health is indicative of your health status and brain function

1721
01:40:31.061 --> 01:40:34.840
as you mentioned.
I mean that it really blows my mind.

1722
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And there's been just study after study coming out showing that gut health is

1723
01:40:40.331 --> 01:40:43.390
linked to depression,
anxiety.

1724
01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:47.330
<v 0>And is VSL three that you took the 30 days of yet,</v>

1725
01:40:47.331 --> 01:40:49.250
did you notice any effect on your mind?

1726
01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:54.190
<v 1>I didn't.
I really didn't try to focus on that,</v>

1727
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.130
so I have no idea.
I was,

1728
01:40:57.131 --> 01:41:00.280
I was really just trying to see if there were anything that was irritating my

1729
01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:04.510
gut,
you know?
So I was really focusing more on the guy to deal with.

1730
01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:07.780
You're inflamed bowel issues.
Yeah.

1731
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:11.320
And has it had any effect?
I mean,

1732
01:41:11.321 --> 01:41:16.240
has it benefited you and then the tangible ways it has?
Yes.
It has benefited me.

1733
01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.060
You know,
I don't get a lot of flare ups.
You know,

1734
01:41:19.061 --> 01:41:22.130
when I'm traveling and I don't get to eat,
I,

1735
01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.080
I drank this smoothie every single day that's like got tons of fiber because

1736
01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:29.460
it's got vegetables and know when you're on the road,
do you bring it with you?

1737
01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:32.410
And so that's when I'm more suited my guts more susceptible.

1738
01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.350
But I've noticed that I'm,

1739
01:41:34.351 --> 01:41:39.351
I'm a little more resilient now and the BSL number three has,

1740
01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:44.610
I think it has helped me become more resilient because it's increased the amount

1741
01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:46.630
of the goods,
good things that are,

1742
01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:49.450
that are helping my gut cells and my gut cells have been damaged.

1743
01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:53.680
And also when they're,
when they're prone to activation easily,

1744
01:41:53.681 --> 01:41:58.030
then the pains stuff happens and there's lots of neurons in your gut,
you know,

1745
01:41:58.031 --> 01:41:59.380
so that you're,
you're basically,

1746
01:41:59.381 --> 01:42:03.120
you're just hyperactive and the pain signals start to get activated and it's

1747
01:42:03.121 --> 01:42:07.360
just a big mess.
But,
um,
I have noticed that it has helped with,

1748
01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.610
helped melt my gut become more resilient.

1749
01:42:09.611 --> 01:42:13.210
So I found out about probiotics through Jujitsu because a lot of people in

1750
01:42:13.211 --> 01:42:17.170
Jujitsu,
they get all sorts of weird skin conditions.
Like,
um,

1751
01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:22.030
ringworms a big one.
Staff is a big one.
And I,
I had both of those.

1752
01:42:22.031 --> 01:42:26.100
I had staff twice and I didn't get MRI.
M S Mrs,

1753
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:31.580
I didn't get Marissa,
but I did get a regular staff and uh,

1754
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:36.910
took some ungodly antibiotic that made me a Zombie.

1755
01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.490
I felt so dumb.
It was weird.
It was like,

1756
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:45.040
like it had a weird effect on my brain.
Like I took it and I remember it was,

1757
01:42:45.041 --> 01:42:47.920
I was out to dinner with some friends and I was telling him that I'm on this

1758
01:42:47.921 --> 01:42:51.340
medication for staff and I'm like,
when I feel like I'm so out of it,

1759
01:42:51.341 --> 01:42:56.070
I'm just like my,
everything,
I'm drained.
I feel like I've,

1760
01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.240
I'm a half full glass and uh,
my brain is just not firing.
Right.

1761
01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:06.010
And that's been shown,
you know,
so when you're taking antibiotics,
you know,
your,

1762
01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.930
you're wiping out a lot of your,

1763
01:43:07.931 --> 01:43:11.350
your gut bacteria or microbiome as it's called,

1764
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:14.260
you're wiping out the bad stuff,
you're wiping out the good stuff,

1765
01:43:14.261 --> 01:43:15.460
you're wiping out lots of things.

1766
01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:20.050
And what's really interesting is that there is this connection between the gut

1767
01:43:20.051 --> 01:43:23.950
and the brain and between the bacteria and your gut and the brain.
And you know,

1768
01:43:23.951 --> 01:43:26.320
so it's so interesting to me that,
you know,

1769
01:43:26.321 --> 01:43:31.321
there's some studies that have shown in mice when you take a mouse that's for

1770
01:43:31.481 --> 01:43:36.290
example,
anxious,
take the gut bacteria like a poop,
like,

1771
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:40.240
and you do a fecal transplant and transplant it into a mouse that's not anxious.

1772
01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.720
The mouse becomes anxious and vice versa.
You can take,
you know,

1773
01:43:43.721 --> 01:43:47.800
possibly he's anxious because you're messing with,
no,

1774
01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.080
I think it's been shown in other ways as well.
Timid versus not timid.
Um,

1775
01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:56.120
and this has been shown in people.
So I mean,
what's going on there,
right?

1776
01:43:56.750 --> 01:44:00.770
These mice have different gut bacteria and you're taking one from this mouse and

1777
01:44:00.771 --> 01:44:04.370
transplant to one another and all of a sudden it starts to become more anxious

1778
01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:07.630
and things like that.
Um,
and the one that trend,
you know,

1779
01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:08.930
the one that's not anxious,

1780
01:44:08.931 --> 01:44:11.930
you transplant that into it and that usually is anxious.

1781
01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:16.550
You transplant the not anxious gut bacteria and it becomes not anxious.
So,
um,

1782
01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:20.780
it's,
it's,
there's,
there's a few things going on here and people actually,

1783
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:21.320
there's been,

1784
01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:25.070
there's been clinical trials where people have supplemented with various strains

1785
01:44:25.071 --> 01:44:26.810
of probiotics.
So like for example,

1786
01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:32.020
there was a trial where people took lactobacillus Casey and they took it for

1787
01:44:32.571 --> 01:44:33.980
some amount of time,
I don't remember,

1788
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:39.400
but they became less depressed and also had to rely less on if they were taking

1789
01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:44.480
some sort of,
you know,
drug to help with the depression,

1790
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:47.270
stopped having to take it.
Um,

1791
01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:50.480
and then another study showed that people that were anxious that supplemented

1792
01:44:50.481 --> 01:44:54.970
with another type of lactobacillus called black toe vesselis Rehmann nooses,

1793
01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:59.960
they,
uh,
became less anxious after taking it for some amount of time.

1794
01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.670
And so,
you know,
we really don't know why that is,
but there's some speculation,

1795
01:45:04.671 --> 01:45:08.630
you know,
one is that,
you know,
these types of bacteria that are producing,

1796
01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.400
you know,
lactate and your gut will lack.

1797
01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:14.390
Lactobacillus reminiscence also produces a neurotransmitter in the gut called

1798
01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:16.610
Gaba,
which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter,

1799
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:18.580
which a lot of people take as a supplement.
But a lot of,

1800
01:45:18.630 --> 01:45:20.720
I've heard that it's not the effect.
So,
yeah,

1801
01:45:20.721 --> 01:45:25.700
it's not supposed to cross over the blood brain barrier as far as I know.

1802
01:45:26.210 --> 01:45:30.980
Uh,
maybe there's some studies showing that it can,
but I don't think it can.

1803
01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:32.480
I as far as far as I've read,

1804
01:45:32.481 --> 01:45:34.520
it's not very good at crossing over the blood brain barrier.

1805
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000
But in the guts it actually inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines.

1806
01:45:41.331 --> 01:45:42.770
All this stuff we've been talking about.

1807
01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.190
And that would have an effect because inflammation,

1808
01:45:46.191 --> 01:45:49.220
inflammatory cytokines kinds crossover with the blood brain barrier and they

1809
01:45:49.221 --> 01:45:52.610
stopped serotonin from being released.
They cause all sorts of problems.

1810
01:45:52.670 --> 01:45:56.060
So even though the Gaba is not breaking through the blood brain barrier,

1811
01:45:56.061 --> 01:45:59.870
it's having effect on the gut,
which is influencing the mind.
It's exactly,

1812
01:45:59.871 --> 01:46:04.430
and the other thing is there's a direct line from the gut to the brain.

1813
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:07.640
It's called the vagal nerve.
And we're really trying,

1814
01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:11.030
starting to scratch the surface on understanding how this works.
We don't know,

1815
01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:14.480
when I say we,
I mean scientist,
I'm not actually doing this research.

1816
01:46:14.481 --> 01:46:15.314
I should clarify that.

1817
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:19.910
But scientists are starting to scratch the surface that we're trying to

1818
01:46:19.911 --> 01:46:21.500
understand.
But literally it's a,

1819
01:46:21.501 --> 01:46:26.501
it's a line that goes to the brainstem and it extends into the gut and there's

1820
01:46:27.021 --> 01:46:31.760
some kind of connection and communication going on there where the bugs in the

1821
01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:35.030
gut or sending signals to the brain via this Bagel nerve,

1822
01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:36.810
we don't know exactly how it works,
but,

1823
01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:41.900
but it's doing it and that's another possible way that certain gut micro,

1824
01:46:41.901 --> 01:46:43.400
you know,
certain gut bugs are,

1825
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:47.830
which are producing these neurotransmitters may be affecting brain function.
Uh,

1826
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:50.070
so I think there's two ways is the,
you know,

1827
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:52.480
<v 0>inflammation where there lowing the anti,
you know,</v>

1828
01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:56.160
they're basically lowering the production of these bad things that cross over

1829
01:46:56.161 --> 01:47:00.120
the brain and can cause all sorts of problems by like decreasing Serotonin to,

1830
01:47:00.121 --> 01:47:02.750
is there like communicating with this vagal nerve?
I mean,

1831
01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.940
it's just an incredible,
when you think about that term,

1832
01:47:05.941 --> 01:47:10.380
follow your gut instinct that your gut really is communicating with your brain

1833
01:47:10.410 --> 01:47:11.970
or even following your heart.

1834
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:16.950
And they've found that there's all sorts of neurons in the heart.
Really.
Yeah.

1835
01:47:16.951 --> 01:47:20.670
There was some study that found neurons in the human heart.

1836
01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:22.700
They were trying to,
uh,

1837
01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.720
in the heart they were trying to make some sort of a correlation between the,

1838
01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.230
the,

1839
01:47:28.230 --> 01:47:33.230
the actual heart here is the heart overlooked is that there's a ted talk on it.

1840
01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:36.030
Is the heart overlooked when it comes to intelligence?

1841
01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:38.340
The center of the nervous system.
The brain has been popular,

1842
01:47:38.341 --> 01:47:42.000
defined as a fundamental core of intellectual activity yet and biochemistry

1843
01:47:42.001 --> 01:47:46.640
class bioelectricity class by electricity class with Professor Nina Tandon.

1844
01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:50.190
We learned about recent research suggesting that the information processing in

1845
01:47:50.191 --> 01:47:52.890
the body may in fact be more distributed.
For example,

1846
01:47:52.891 --> 01:47:56.250
they're increasing evidence suggesting that the will boys,
a big word,

1847
01:47:56.490 --> 01:48:01.410
cardio electromagnetic field can actually affect human beings in close
proximity.

1848
01:48:01.411 --> 01:48:06.411
These signals are stronger and amplitude when in direct contact but are still

1849
01:48:06.541 --> 01:48:10.170
detectable up to several feet away from the source,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1850
01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:14.190
Where's the fucking thing about the heart?
Yeah,

1851
01:48:14.191 --> 01:48:18.270
that's fascinating.
Yeah.
I mean this reminds me of this,

1852
01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:22.440
this study that just came out where we found the brain cells in the heart.
Yeah.

1853
01:48:22.770 --> 01:48:27.420
I'm sorry.
This is another one now.
Neurological blog.

1854
01:48:27.421 --> 01:48:31.860
Have you ever read that now?
Yeah.
Um,
but it's,
uh,
it's,
it's,

1855
01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:35.910
this is they're saying that certain flavor of misconception that occurs when a

1856
01:48:35.911 --> 01:48:40.140
cultural belief intersects with scientific factoid at superficially seems to

1857
01:48:40.141 --> 01:48:43.710
support to believe powerful meme emerged to the effect of science.

1858
01:48:43.711 --> 01:48:47.070
Now provides what we have known,
believed all along,
uh,

1859
01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:52.100
grooves latch onto this idea to provide a parent credibility to their mysticism.

1860
01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:53.820
The media heats it up.

1861
01:48:53.821 --> 01:48:57.630
One such meme has been around for awhile at the heart contains brain cells and

1862
01:48:57.631 --> 01:49:01.320
therefore has a mind of its own,
at least a part of the human mind.

1863
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:06.350
This is something probably look into that might be too complicated to read off

1864
01:49:06.661 --> 01:49:06.961
of this,

1865
01:49:06.961 --> 01:49:11.961
but what I have understood what I've read something about neurons and it's

1866
01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:13.410
talking about neurons.

1867
01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.310
It says not all neurons contribute directly to the mine,

1868
01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:22.470
but they are saying that there are neurons in the human heart.
Well,

1869
01:49:22.471 --> 01:49:26.280
I mean in neurons making certain,
you know,
neuro transmitter,

1870
01:49:26.290 --> 01:49:28.590
depending on if they're in the gut or whether at,
you know,

1871
01:49:28.610 --> 01:49:30.600
that that does affect the brain,
you know,

1872
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:33.360
either through an indirect or if it's the guy,

1873
01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:37.260
a direct mechanism to the vagal nerve.
But these indirect mechanisms just by,

1874
01:49:37.261 --> 01:49:37.861
like I said,

1875
01:49:37.861 --> 01:49:41.550
the inflammatory cytokines that are produced and that has an indirect effect on

1876
01:49:41.551 --> 01:49:45.480
the brain.
So,
um,
it,
it's,
you know,

1877
01:49:45.481 --> 01:49:48.430
recently we found that brain is to the immune system.

1878
01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:51.250
<v 1>Like literally the lymphatic system,
you know,</v>

1879
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:55.270
is connected to the brain and that's like something that was never,

1880
01:49:55.271 --> 01:49:56.470
it was thought to never exist.

1881
01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:58.440
<v 0>What does it say here?
Short answer,</v>

1882
01:49:58.441 --> 01:50:01.860
the heart isn't made of neurons but a different type of cell with some neuron

1883
01:50:01.861 --> 01:50:03.270
like characteristics,

1884
01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:09.800
cardiomyocytes to understand what this means.
Okay.
This is probably not

1885
01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:12.670
<v 1>well,
those are stem cell cardiomyocytes are like the muscle.</v>

1886
01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1887
01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.630
<v 1>Like the muscle cells in the,
in the heart.</v>

1888
01:50:17.850 --> 01:50:18.683
<v 2>Hm.</v>

1889
01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:23.950
<v 0>There's another thing about here,
okay.
Second brain is in your heart.
Neurons.</v>

1890
01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:27.220
Hmm.
Trust your gut feelings.

1891
01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:29.920
A second brain in the heart is now much more than a hypothesis.

1892
01:50:29.921 --> 01:50:31.540
Prominent medical expert,

1893
01:50:31.541 --> 01:50:35.380
Doctor Maurice Renard and others have discovered that recipients of heart

1894
01:50:35.381 --> 01:50:40.381
transplants or unheard inheriting donor donors memories and consequently report

1895
01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:43.120
huge changes in their tastes,
their personality,

1896
01:50:43.121 --> 01:50:47.100
and most extraordinarily their emotional memories.
Okay.
That might be nonsense.

1897
01:50:48.970 --> 01:50:52.120
I don't know if that's true or not,
but that's so anecdotal.

1898
01:50:52.150 --> 01:50:57.150
And also you're dealing with the massive traumatic incident of having your chest

1899
01:50:57.521 --> 01:51:02.521
ripped open with a fucking double rake machine and they operating your fucking

1900
01:51:03.041 --> 01:51:04.690
heart.
Wow.
Shit,
go on there.

1901
01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:07.780
<v 1>I think.
I think that gut definitely could be the second brain.</v>

1902
01:51:07.781 --> 01:51:10.270
I don't know about the heart,
but the gut is definitely,

1903
01:51:10.290 --> 01:51:13.690
well I think becoming woods against,
I think there's,

1904
01:51:13.691 --> 01:51:18.250
there's probably a symbiotic relationship to all the cells of the body and I

1905
01:51:18.251 --> 01:51:21.160
think our idea that the way we feel is all in the brain,

1906
01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:26.230
you know that it's all in the mind that seems to be not true and it seems to be,

1907
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:29.770
we know that the,
the human body as a whole

1908
01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:33.540
<v 0>has some sort of a symbiotic relationship with all the other cells.</v>

1909
01:51:33.541 --> 01:51:37.290
We know that when things go bad and certain parts it can affect other parts,

1910
01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.160
but we kind of want to like dissect things and minimalize and look,

1911
01:51:41.190 --> 01:51:45.240
look at things like and break things down to like the lowest common denominator

1912
01:51:45.241 --> 01:51:48.720
or one one area and say,
wow,
you,
if you just fix this,

1913
01:51:49.090 --> 01:51:53.950
<v 1>stop it.
This is interesting because,
um,
I think it goes both ways as well.</v>

1914
01:51:53.951 --> 01:51:58.120
Like things that are good for the mind are also good for the body.

1915
01:51:58.121 --> 01:51:59.470
And I kind of,

1916
01:51:59.471 --> 01:52:03.310
I've been getting into this meditation recently because I had my first flotation

1917
01:52:03.311 --> 01:52:07.420
tank experience Oh,
couple of days ago,
I guess it was.
Yeah.

1918
01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.070
But which thing?

1919
01:52:09.370 --> 01:52:14.370
I found that it was a very easy way for me to meditate.

1920
01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:20.230
Uh,
it provide more of a structure for me to meditate and you know,

1921
01:52:20.231 --> 01:52:22.650
that makes sense because you know,

1922
01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:26.260
it's dark and I'm not like hearing things and seeing,

1923
01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:29.950
I think seeing things is the big for me.
Like if I see things,

1924
01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:34.030
it's visual stimulation.
And so like I,
my mind wanders to other things,

1925
01:52:34.031 --> 01:52:36.590
but I found that it was a very,
uh,

1926
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:41.110
I find it's hard for me to meditate in general.
It's hard for everybody,
right?

1927
01:52:41.110 --> 01:52:45.740
Yeah.
I mean I think the more you do it,
it becomes,
supposedly it becomes easier.

1928
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:50.530
But I've been very interested in the benefits of meditation and so the,

1929
01:52:50.531 --> 01:52:54.530
the flotation was a interesting experience because I felt like it was definitely

1930
01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:57.980
easier to think about,
you know,

1931
01:52:57.981 --> 01:52:59.570
whatever I was thinking about the time,

1932
01:52:59.630 --> 01:53:04.190
which is I tend to analyze my intense and things like why I'm doing,

1933
01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:06.530
why I behave the way I behave.
And I,
you know,

1934
01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:10.580
start to get into this whole analytical breakdown where I tried to think about

1935
01:53:10.581 --> 01:53:14.090
why I do things and then it helps affect my future decisions.

1936
01:53:14.091 --> 01:53:17.380
It helps me understand other people,
things like that.
Um,

1937
01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:22.220
but you know,
there's a lot of brain benefits to meditation that are known.

1938
01:53:22.221 --> 01:53:25.220
I mean,
it's been shown to slow cognitive aging.
You know,

1939
01:53:25.221 --> 01:53:28.520
there's one study where they looked at like 50 year olds brains that,

1940
01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:34.300
that if people that have meditated for some years and they looked like a 25 year

1941
01:53:34.311 --> 01:53:36.680
old brain.
So I mean you might say,

1942
01:53:36.681 --> 01:53:38.420
well they're probably doing other things as well.

1943
01:53:38.421 --> 01:53:41.300
And a followup study showed that if you just take normal people after eight

1944
01:53:41.301 --> 01:53:44.330
weeks of like making them do this mindful type of meditation,

1945
01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:49.250
they increase the volume of brain matter in five different regions of the brain.

1946
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:50.661
So,
you know,

1947
01:53:50.661 --> 01:53:55.661
meditation is affecting the brain and how it's doing that there's a variety of

1948
01:53:55.911 --> 01:53:56.810
possibilities.

1949
01:53:57.230 --> 01:54:02.150
But something that I found very interesting was that it also affects the,

1950
01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:05.150
the aging process in general,
not just bring the aging.

1951
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:09.950
So meditation is actually been shown to short,
uh,
to,
uh,

1952
01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:12.110
prevent the shortening of Telomeres,

1953
01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.840
which is super interesting cause that's talking,

1954
01:54:14.841 --> 01:54:17.990
you're talking about slowing aging in general.
Um,

1955
01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:22.010
and the way it does that is by activating the enzyme telomerase,

1956
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:25.760
which usually is not active in most of ourselves and meditation's able to

1957
01:54:25.761 --> 01:54:28.460
activate that enzyme to slow.

1958
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:32.810
So tila mirrors the reason tilama shorten each year.

1959
01:54:32.811 --> 01:54:36.710
Each day is because every time you make a new cell,
your cell has to,

1960
01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:40.370
the telomere is,
um,
it's got DNA,
you know,

1961
01:54:40.371 --> 01:54:43.100
and just like anything else in your body when you're,

1962
01:54:43.130 --> 01:54:47.210
when you're a cell is replicating everything in the south,
the whole genome,

1963
01:54:47.211 --> 01:54:49.700
it has to replicate the DNA of the telomere.
Well,

1964
01:54:49.701 --> 01:54:53.360
there's like the structural defect and the way the DNA is that the machinery

1965
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:57.200
that replicates it,
it like can't get to this little piece at the very end.

1966
01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.250
So the cell machinery goes,
okay,
well I've replicated that this far.

1967
01:55:01.251 --> 01:55:03.200
I can't do the rest.
And so it's like,
screw it.

1968
01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:06.590
So there's a little piece of telomere DNA doesn't get replicated.

1969
01:55:06.591 --> 01:55:09.890
So the next cell has a telemere that's just a little bit shorter.

1970
01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.950
And this keeps happening every time your cells divide and replicate.

1971
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:16.550
So eventually,
you know,
decades later you have really,

1972
01:55:16.551 --> 01:55:17.510
really short Taylor mirrors.

1973
01:55:17.511 --> 01:55:22.310
And then the cell can either undergo cell death or it can become senescent,

1974
01:55:22.311 --> 01:55:24.890
which means it's basically not dead,

1975
01:55:24.891 --> 01:55:27.860
but it's sitting around and it's to creating all this bad stuff that damages

1976
01:55:27.861 --> 01:55:32.270
other cells.
So,
okay,
so long story short,

1977
01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:36.980
kind of is that your telling are getting shorter and that's happening just in

1978
01:55:36.981 --> 01:55:39.940
all of us.
Things that make it worse or inflammation,
these,
you know,

1979
01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:42.980
things that damage our DNA that we talked about.

1980
01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:46.740
But you can rebuild those Tila mirrors by activating telomerase and telomerase.

1981
01:55:46.741 --> 01:55:48.390
Then even though the tumor is short,

1982
01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:53.750
it will rebuild that piece that wasn't copied so it can,

1983
01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:57.420
it can make it longer.
That's not active and most of ourselves,

1984
01:55:57.421 --> 01:55:58.590
it's active in our stem cells.

1985
01:55:58.591 --> 01:56:03.591
But meditation activates that gene that makes telomerase and the telomerase,

1986
01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:08.340
it becomes active and it rebuilds telomeres.
I find that fascinating.

1987
01:56:08.341 --> 01:56:13.200
That's just that meditation can do that.
So meditation,
isolation,
tank,
cold,

1988
01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:17.970
Hot gut health,
all these things.
You live to a thousand,
right?

1989
01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:22.830
Exercise.
What about ta 65 we talked,
did we talk about that?

1990
01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:23.664
We talked about,

1991
01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:26.820
we talked about it and that and that has some sort of an effect on telomeres,

1992
01:56:26.821 --> 01:56:29.520
but people aren't really like embracing that.
Well,
it,

1993
01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:33.450
it also activates telomerase much more robustly than meditation does.

1994
01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:38.400
And the pea thing that people are worried about is that,
you know,

1995
01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:39.870
you're talking about,
you know,

1996
01:56:39.871 --> 01:56:42.540
if you have a person that doesn't have a good lifestyle,

1997
01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:46.440
a person that's eating a bunch of refined carbohydrates,
refined sugars,

1998
01:56:46.441 --> 01:56:49.470
they're causing all this endotoxin to be released from their gut,

1999
01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:53.480
which is damaging all this stuff.
Those people.
Um,

2000
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:56.400
if you have a bunch of damage in your cell,

2001
01:56:56.460 --> 01:57:00.450
it can lead to mutations and the mutations eventually can cause cancer.
Well,

2002
01:57:00.451 --> 01:57:04.010
what happens is that your cell will decide to die as,

2003
01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:06.900
as a sacrifice.
It's like,
no,
I don't want to get cancer.

2004
01:57:06.930 --> 01:57:11.220
I don't want to get cancer,
so I'm just going to pop and explode and you know,

2005
01:57:11.221 --> 01:57:14.310
die.
But,
uh,
and,
and this,

2006
01:57:14.370 --> 01:57:16.950
this also happens as we age and our telomeres get shorter.

2007
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:19.890
But if you have something that can activate telomerase,

2008
01:57:19.891 --> 01:57:24.891
cancer cells actually use this mechanism to overcome our inherent death signals.

2009
01:57:25.771 --> 01:57:28.680
That is like an adaptive mechanism to getting damaged.

2010
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:33.720
They overcome it by activating telomerase all the time.
So then they're like,
no,

2011
01:57:33.721 --> 01:57:36.120
I'm going to live forever.
My two limiters aren't going to get short.

2012
01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.420
I've all this damage in the cell and I'm just going to keep on going.

2013
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:43.650
So that's why people are worried about things like ta 65 and until there's like

2014
01:57:43.651 --> 01:57:48.240
long term studies done,
you know it's still,
it's out there.

2015
01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:51.810
I mean people are using it.
Well I know one guy that used it,

2016
01:57:51.811 --> 01:57:56.040
he was working for the company that made it and then he sued them cause he got

2017
01:57:56.041 --> 01:58:00.030
cancer.
I mean obviously it's one incident and who knows if he was getting cancer

2018
01:58:00.031 --> 01:58:03.690
anyway,
I don't know.
But I read that and I was like,
Ooh,

2019
01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:08.370
that probably is the case where if you have someone that already has cancer,

2020
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:13.320
it's not a good idea to take tic 65,
but you know,
if you already have cancer,

2021
01:58:13.321 --> 01:58:16.230
it's also not a good idea to supplement with high doses of folic acid.

2022
01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:20.130
It's again to down to that,
that situation,
that person to person experience.

2023
01:58:20.131 --> 01:58:23.760
So if you already have cancer and you already have cells that are mutated that

2024
01:58:23.761 --> 01:58:27.990
are damaged and you take something that's going to allow their telomeres to get

2025
01:58:27.991 --> 01:58:29.450
longer,
uh,

2026
01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:33.540
then you're going to overcome that cell death mechanism that usually is like die

2027
01:58:33.730 --> 01:58:36.300
and,
and now a cancer cell isn't going to die.

2028
01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:39.750
My friend Bobby's dad took it and this is work.
A weird is done.

2029
01:58:39.751 --> 01:58:41.980
I believe his dad's in his sixties his vision

2030
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:44.410
<v 0>got better and I was like,
whoa.</v>

2031
01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:47.900
<v 1>Yeah,
that's fucking crazy.
I mean,
that's cool.</v>

2032
01:58:47.930 --> 01:58:52.520
I mean it maybe when you're 60 you're like,
fuck it,
let's roll the dice and see.

2033
01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:57.710
You know,
I think when you're 60 you still have quite a few years later.

2034
01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:03.110
I mean the average lifespan of,
you know,

2035
01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:06.770
in the United States is like 79 I think.
And then,

2036
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:08.780
and that's people that eat like shit.
Yeah.

2037
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:10.970
I mean that's like the standard American diet.
Yeah.

2038
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:14.470
<v 0>And that's the thing that really drives me nuts when they,</v>

2039
01:59:14.490 --> 01:59:17.160
they put out these studies,
say vitamins don't increase your life.

2040
01:59:17.170 --> 01:59:21.480
They're useless.
Don't,
it's not people live just so same amount.
First of all,

2041
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:24.690
optimization is what everybody's after.

2042
01:59:24.691 --> 01:59:27.030
What everybody wants to do is feel the best that they possibly can.

2043
01:59:27.031 --> 01:59:30.900
And if you say that vitamins don't make you feel better than not having
vitamins,

2044
01:59:31.050 --> 01:59:34.350
that means to me that you're not taking vitamins or you're not supplementing

2045
01:59:34.351 --> 01:59:37.980
your diet and you're not eating healthy if you don't think that it has an effect

2046
01:59:37.981 --> 01:59:42.040
that he optimizing the way you eat and the things that you put into your body,

2047
01:59:42.041 --> 01:59:44.730
it doesn't have an effect on the way you feel and the way your body moves

2048
01:59:44.731 --> 01:59:48.780
through this world.
I again,
I don't buy that.
It just doesn't make any sense.

2049
01:59:48.781 --> 01:59:52.380
And I also don't think there's been enough longterm studies on people who have

2050
01:59:52.381 --> 01:59:55.200
been optimizing their health and nutrition cause I don't,

2051
01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:57.900
I don't know how many people are really doing it.
Right.
All right.

2052
01:59:57.901 --> 02:00:00.570
I'm barely doing it right.
And I fucking focus on it a lot.

2053
02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:05.030
<v 1>I've actually been really diving into this topic recently because there,</v>

2054
02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:09.980
when you say doing it right,
to me that means,
you know,
there were all different,

2055
02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:13.850
right?
And,
and we all have a different genetic makeup.
So doing it right.
Varies.

2056
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:15.710
It does.
And,
and you know,

2057
02:00:15.711 --> 02:00:20.690
like there are so many polymorphisms in genes that affect vitamins and minerals.

2058
02:00:20.691 --> 02:00:21.524
For example,

2059
02:00:21.590 --> 02:00:26.590
like I know three people already that have a gene polymorphism in the vitamin D

2060
02:00:27.591 --> 02:00:28.424
pathway,

2061
02:00:28.490 --> 02:00:33.490
so they're unable to convert vitamin D three into the,

2062
02:00:34.110 --> 02:00:37.220
the pre hormone.
They don't do it very well.

2063
02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:41.990
So what that means is that they actually have to take higher doses of vitamin D

2064
02:00:41.991 --> 02:00:46.991
three then I would take to get the vitamin D three they be converted into that

2065
02:00:47.781 --> 02:00:49.610
precursor for Vitamin D,

2066
02:00:49.611 --> 02:00:53.300
which is a steroid hormone that's controlling so many different processes in the

2067
02:00:53.301 --> 02:00:57.470
body.
I talk about it all the time.
Um,
but you know,
it's,

2068
02:00:58.250 --> 02:01:01.040
if you never get your vitamin D levels tested or if you don't look at your

2069
02:01:01.041 --> 02:01:02.750
genetic data,
which we can do now,

2070
02:01:02.751 --> 02:01:07.670
there's consumer tools available like 23 and me that allow you to,
you know,

2071
02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:12.700
spit in a tube and that send it off to this company that will then sequence all

2072
02:01:12.951 --> 02:01:17.030
these different gene polymorphisms that are common.
And you know,

2073
02:01:17.031 --> 02:01:18.320
and from there you can,

2074
02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:23.660
you can actually interpret the data by using other tools that allow you to do

2075
02:01:23.661 --> 02:01:25.720
that.
Prometheus is one.
Um,

2076
02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:30.470
it's a tool that's $5 and it lets you like export you're 23 and me data into

2077
02:01:30.471 --> 02:01:31.304
this.
Um,

2078
02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:34.850
it basically matches it against this huge database that has all these different

2079
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:38.540
publications on different gene polymorphisms and allows you to understand what's

2080
02:01:38.541 --> 02:01:41.420
going on.
But I think it's really important not,
you know,
vitamin.

2081
02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:45.440
So these vitamin D polymorphisms are associated with all lower,
I'm sorry,

2082
02:01:45.441 --> 02:01:50.040
higher all cause mortality.
So people that have this form of the,
the,

2083
02:01:50.290 --> 02:01:53.090
the gene that converts vitamin D three into the pre hormone,

2084
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:54.530
that doesn't do it well,

2085
02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:59.330
they actually are more likely to die of all sorts of diseases with the exception

2086
02:01:59.331 --> 02:02:03.080
of accidents sooner than people that don't have it,
which to me says,

2087
02:02:03.081 --> 02:02:07.010
and they also have much,
much lower circulating levels of Vitamin d they need,

2088
02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:10.430
they actually need more vitamin D than,
than people that don't have it.

2089
02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:13.400
There's other ones like full eight.
I mean this is very,
very common.

2090
02:02:13.401 --> 02:02:15.980
Both my mother in law has it.
My mom,

2091
02:02:16.490 --> 02:02:19.130
a couple of friends that I've looked at their,
their data,

2092
02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:24.290
it's so common where they're not able to use full eight to make this certain

2093
02:02:24.291 --> 02:02:28.250
precursor for epigenetics,
which is,
uh,
how,

2094
02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:31.940
how genes get activated or deactivated.
And this changes in our environment.

2095
02:02:31.941 --> 02:02:35.390
So full eight is in Greens,
you know,
and it's,

2096
02:02:35.630 --> 02:02:39.140
we get it from eating green plants.
It's important to make new DNA,

2097
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:43.040
but it's also important,
it was like,
like a fork.
It's important to make new DNA,

2098
02:02:43.041 --> 02:02:46.430
so it provides precursors for that which you need to make new cells.

2099
02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:49.300
It's also important to make these precursors to,

2100
02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.550
to make epigenetic factors that regulate and you know,

2101
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:56.720
turn genes on when they're supposed to and turn genes off,
you know,

2102
02:02:56.721 --> 02:02:59.390
when they're supposed to be turned off.
And,
uh,
you know,

2103
02:02:59.391 --> 02:03:02.420
40% of the population has one polymorphism where they're not doing it

2104
02:03:02.421 --> 02:03:05.090
efficiently.
So I have,
I'm not making,

2105
02:03:05.091 --> 02:03:08.510
I'm not making these precursors as efficiently as I could be.

2106
02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:12.840
My mom is much,
much worse.
She's got one that she's like,

2107
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:16.100
like at 10% of her efficiency social.

2108
02:03:16.101 --> 02:03:20.120
She's only doing this like at 10% is opposed to 100%,

2109
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:21.260
but there's a way around it.

2110
02:03:21.261 --> 02:03:25.060
You can supplement with something called methyl full late.
So,
you know,
it's a,

2111
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:29.870
it's an easy solution.
Uh,
there's other things like,
um,
the vitamin a pathway.

2112
02:03:29.871 --> 02:03:33.320
For example,
you know,
most,
most people take Beta carotene.

2113
02:03:33.321 --> 02:03:35.480
Beta carotene can be converted into vitamin A,

2114
02:03:35.481 --> 02:03:39.950
which is very important for your immune cells to work.
Right?
Um,
but,

2115
02:03:39.951 --> 02:03:43.220
and Beta carotene also does things on its own.
It's an antioxidant,

2116
02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:48.230
but like a lot of people have a variation in the gene that converts Beta

2117
02:03:48.230 --> 02:03:50.690
Carotene into vitamin a where they can't do it.
So,

2118
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:54.670
so they may be low on vitamin A and as a consequence,
your immune,
you know,

2119
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:57.110
cells aren't working well,
then we get sick a lot or something like that.

2120
02:03:57.111 --> 02:04:00.710
So I think finding out certain things.
And there's also,
you know,

2121
02:04:00.711 --> 02:04:05.270
interactions with dietary,
like macro nutrients as well.
So,

2122
02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:06.441
you know,
there's,

2123
02:04:06.441 --> 02:04:10.820
I've seen a couple of people that have a polymorphism and this is also common in

2124
02:04:10.821 --> 02:04:12.950
a gene that doesn't allow them to,

2125
02:04:13.810 --> 02:04:16.910
to basically metabolize a saturated fat as well.

2126
02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:20.570
And so these people actually when they go on like a ketogenic diet,

2127
02:04:20.571 --> 02:04:24.140
instead of losing weight,
they actually gain weight and they actually do worse.

2128
02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.960
Whereas most people,
meaning like the Atkins Diet,

2129
02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:31.460
meaning like a diet that's high in fat and like 10% protein,
very,

2130
02:04:31.461 --> 02:04:35.080
very low carbohydrate.
But,
um,
yeah,
so the,
so you know,

2131
02:04:35.090 --> 02:04:38.310
these people have a certain variation in this,
um,

2132
02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:43.110
and that regulates like how they're like utilizing fat.
Like,
so,

2133
02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:48.690
you know,
I think it's,
it's to,
in order to optimize,
you know,
your diet,

2134
02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:52.760
your,
your lifestyle,
like the supplements are taking,
um,

2135
02:04:52.890 --> 02:04:54.030
I think it's the future.

2136
02:04:54.031 --> 02:04:59.031
We'll also be looking at this interaction between your genes and you know,

2137
02:04:59.910 --> 02:05:03.420
what,
what these genes mean and what you can do to kind of overcome this.
Well,

2138
02:05:03.421 --> 02:05:06.690
let's say I have this vitamin D one take more vitamin D.
You know,
let's hit,

2139
02:05:06.691 --> 02:05:08.020
let's say I have this,
you know,

2140
02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:11.610
one that doesn't convert Beta carotene and vitamin a well,
what do I do?
Well,

2141
02:05:11.611 --> 02:05:15.870
I make sure I get foods that are rich in vitamin A,
like organ meats or uh,

2142
02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:18.560
or I sit,
take a supplement.
You don't want to take too much cause vitamin A,

2143
02:05:18.561 --> 02:05:22.440
it could be toxic.
Uh,
there's another common one in Faustel Coleen,

2144
02:05:22.770 --> 02:05:27.770
which is what are our livers make a to basically secrete fatty acids and

2145
02:05:27.841 --> 02:05:31.200
triglycerides and stuff out of the liver to be transported by cholesterol,

2146
02:05:31.201 --> 02:05:34.770
LDL and things like that.
Um,
people have it,

2147
02:05:34.771 --> 02:05:38.070
they can't do that very well and they end up getting fatty liver.
Um,

2148
02:05:38.071 --> 02:05:41.250
not only that phosphatidylcholine is important for,
you know,

2149
02:05:41.251 --> 02:05:44.570
all cells and for your brain and low levels have been associated with als.

2150
02:05:44.610 --> 02:05:45.600
It's actually a biomarker.

2151
02:05:45.601 --> 02:05:50.160
Low phosphatidylcholine levels are associated with increased Alzheimer's disease

2152
02:05:50.161 --> 02:05:53.610
risk.
But you know,
this simple solution,
you can fall,

2153
02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:57.090
you can supplement with phosphatidylcholine or you can increase your cooling

2154
02:05:57.091 --> 02:05:59.100
intake cause it can be converted into phosphatidylcholine.

2155
02:05:59.590 --> 02:06:03.870
Things like that I think are really interesting to kind of look at your unique

2156
02:06:03.871 --> 02:06:07.080
makeup and how you can optimize your nutrient,

2157
02:06:07.081 --> 02:06:11.430
your micro nutrient intake and your match macronutrient intake based on your own

2158
02:06:11.431 --> 02:06:14.760
genetic makeup.
And,
and I've seen like even with my mother in law,

2159
02:06:14.761 --> 02:06:18.930
she's been taking methyl full late,
uh,
because she's had,
you know,

2160
02:06:18.931 --> 02:06:21.780
she's one of those people that don't use full a very well to make those

2161
02:06:21.781 --> 02:06:25.320
precursors for epigenetics and her,
she's always had really,

2162
02:06:25.321 --> 02:06:26.460
really high blood pressure.

2163
02:06:26.730 --> 02:06:30.180
Well part one of the consequences of having this gene is that homocysteine

2164
02:06:30.181 --> 02:06:34.450
builds up in your,
in your blood vessels and that can have a,
uh,

2165
02:06:34.590 --> 02:06:38.970
effect of increasing blood pressure.
And so,
you know,
and this is an n of one,

2166
02:06:38.971 --> 02:06:41.850
but it's possible that that's helped and she's never been able to lower her

2167
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:44.130
blood pressure.
So it's really kind of exciting for her.

2168
02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:49.700
So I've been like diving into this recently and I also have made a a free tool

2169
02:06:50.071 --> 02:06:53.820
on my website where people can export their 23 and me data and I'm going to

2170
02:06:53.821 --> 02:06:56.460
allow them to like look at all the genes that I'm interested,

2171
02:06:56.461 --> 02:07:00.450
that I've been researching and finding that are interesting in terms of gene

2172
02:07:00.451 --> 02:07:04.890
nutrient interactions and ways to come around,
bypass that and get around it.
Uh,

2173
02:07:04.891 --> 02:07:07.560
that you can find a coming very,
very soon.

2174
02:07:07.561 --> 02:07:11.310
I think in a couple of days I'm going to be uploading that.
So move,

2175
02:07:11.311 --> 02:07:14.870
let me know as soon as it's own and I'll tweet it.
Two other things.

2176
02:07:15.090 --> 02:07:18.660
One of the thing,
well two other things actually.
Cholesterol.

2177
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:24.720
Does cholesterol all come from animal protein or from animals were,

2178
02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:29.490
where do you get cholesterol if you want to eat a Vegan Diet?
Um,
I mean,

2179
02:07:29.491 --> 02:07:32.550
so LDL cholesterol,
you know,
you,
you,

2180
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:36.670
you make cholesterol in your body and,
and you do get cholesterol from,

2181
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:40.720
from dietary cholesterol,
but you also can make cholesterol.

2182
02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:44.290
Um,
so like in your brain,

2183
02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:47.650
the dietary cholesterol that you take in doesn't get into your brain.

2184
02:07:48.070 --> 02:07:50.530
You actually make all the,
you make everything in your brain.

2185
02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:55.000
What are the precursors for the precursors for that,
um,
are,

2186
02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:58.480
for example,
Acetol Coa.
Really all you need is a steel Kobe.

2187
02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:03.600
So you can actually make,
make it from,
from having Acetol Coa,

2188
02:08:03.610 --> 02:08:08.470
which is what you can get from even sugar carbohydrates,
glucose,
uh,

2189
02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:13.120
is it'll Kobe is made from,
from those things as well.
So having a subtle Kobe,

2190
02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:15.070
um,
is an essential part of that.

2191
02:08:15.071 --> 02:08:17.950
And then from there you can go on and there's all these other enzymes that can

2192
02:08:17.951 --> 02:08:22.360
make that.
Uh,
but that's,
that's really how people can make it like that.

2193
02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:26.690
Don't eat any fat at all.
So people who,

2194
02:08:26.890 --> 02:08:27.500
<v 0>uh,</v>

2195
02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:31.360
have a Vegan diet where they don't eat any animal protein and they don't take in

2196
02:08:31.361 --> 02:08:36.080
any animal food,
that it's still possible to have healthy cholesterol levels,

2197
02:08:36.081 --> 02:08:37.640
healthy LDL cholesterol levels.

2198
02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:42.010
<v 1>Well,
I think that it's,
it's more done.</v>

2199
02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:46.750
I think it's easy or for those people to have lower levels of Ldl,

2200
02:08:47.170 --> 02:08:51.820
which like I said,
you need LP LDL cholesterol to repair damage.

2201
02:08:51.821 --> 02:08:54.370
And so it's possible that their wound healing is slowed.

2202
02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.530
It's possible that there,
yeah,

2203
02:08:55.570 --> 02:08:59.020
<v 0>they don't repair damage as well or as quick dummy.
I don't really know.</v>

2204
02:08:59.230 --> 02:09:02.350
Travis Barker.
Do you know that guy?
No.
Blink one eight two drummer.

2205
02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:06.250
I know believe when I did too,
but I didn't go.
Travis Barker,
very famous tremor.

2206
02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:11.370
He was in a very famous plane crash and he was a Vegan and uh,

2207
02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:15.340
apparently was having a hard time with the skin graphs and then he got off the

2208
02:09:15.341 --> 02:09:18.850
Vegan diet to try to fix that and it helped him.
So does that,

2209
02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:19.990
what do you think that would be,

2210
02:09:19.991 --> 02:09:22.600
but you also need protein and things like that to repair damage.
But yeah,

2211
02:09:22.601 --> 02:09:23.411
that would make sense.

2212
02:09:23.411 --> 02:09:27.220
Would you can get protein obviously from plant sources and as long as you take

2213
02:09:27.221 --> 02:09:28.300
in the right amount,

2214
02:09:28.301 --> 02:09:33.301
like is it especially like hemp hearts or a keen Moi or complete proteins that

2215
02:09:34.061 --> 02:09:38.380
are in plant form?
You can,
like,
you can live a healthy life.

2216
02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:39.550
There's a big misconception,
right?

2217
02:09:39.551 --> 02:09:43.780
You just need a lot of work to live a healthy life and be Vegan.
Yeah.

2218
02:09:43.781 --> 02:09:47.650
You also get,
can get a lot of fat.
I mean Ricardo's Cahtos olives,
olive oil,

2219
02:09:47.651 --> 02:09:52.030
peanut,
yeah,
there's lots of,
I get a lot of my fat from,
from plants.

2220
02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:55.360
I eat a lot of Avocados.
I you probably two a day.
I eat at least one a day.

2221
02:09:55.361 --> 02:09:56.470
I put one in my smoothie.

2222
02:09:56.730 --> 02:10:00.250
Avocado is actually increase the absorption of light carotinoids like Beta

2223
02:10:00.251 --> 02:10:02.950
carotene,
Lutein,
Zeaxanthin,
which are good for the eyes.

2224
02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:07.930
So like that I put one in my smoothie like everyday.
I love Avocados,
but that's,

2225
02:10:07.931 --> 02:10:11.330
that's definitely one of my sources.
Yeah.
I still like the way they taste too.
Um,

2226
02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:15.790
the other thing I want to say ask you about is acidity and the gut.
Oh,

2227
02:10:15.791 --> 02:10:19.630
you were talking about lactic acid and acidity and a,
what was it?

2228
02:10:19.631 --> 02:10:24.040
A certain types of bacteria that cannot live in that environment that are

2229
02:10:24.041 --> 02:10:27.970
negative.
When people talk about like there's this,

2230
02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:32.850
there's this way that people talk about cancer and they always say that cancer

2231
02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:36.710
can't live in an alkaline environment and you have to make your blood alkaline.

2232
02:10:36.711 --> 02:10:41.030
And I'm,
I was like,
boy,
that sounds like fucking hokum.
I hear that all the time.

2233
02:10:41.031 --> 02:10:41.420
And I'm like,

2234
02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:46.420
how can you really affect your body that much that you make your blood alkaline

2235
02:10:46.731 --> 02:10:48.760
or acidic and has that number?

2236
02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:49.550
<v 1>It's not,</v>

2237
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:54.530
the reason people talk about that in terms of cancer is because cancer cells are

2238
02:10:54.531 --> 02:10:55.760
making lactic acid.

2239
02:10:56.270 --> 02:11:01.270
So one of the changes that occurs in a cancer cell is that it goes from using

2240
02:11:02.361 --> 02:11:06.980
oxygen and you know the diff carbohydrate or protein or fat,

2241
02:11:06.981 --> 02:11:11.030
whatever source as energy it goes.
And that happens in your Mitochondria,

2242
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:16.190
that coupled process of oxygen plus the food to make energy will cancer cells,

2243
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:21.710
they stopped doing that and they just use the energy part.

2244
02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:23.090
So they don't need oxygen,

2245
02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:26.900
they just use glucose to make energy.

2246
02:11:26.901 --> 02:11:31.670
And that biproduct is lactic acid lactate,
which then can form lactic acid.

2247
02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:36.680
And so I think that's where people get this whole conception a be like that

2248
02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:38.840
acidity.
And because they're like,
oh,

2249
02:11:38.841 --> 02:11:41.600
well the cancer cells are making this acidic environment and so they must want

2250
02:11:41.601 --> 02:11:45.500
to be in an acidic environment.
Really.
I mean it all comes,
that's just,

2251
02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:49.490
it's people not understanding what's really going on is,
is what it is.

2252
02:11:49.491 --> 02:11:53.960
And you know,
the cancer cells are making this metabolic change,

2253
02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:58.190
uh,
for a few reasons.
One is because the,
if you have an,

2254
02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:02.030
if you have oxygen in your,
your Mitochondria are working and using the oxygen,

2255
02:12:02.330 --> 02:12:05.510
you're going to make those damaging byproducts that we talked about,

2256
02:12:06.110 --> 02:12:08.360
the super oxide hydrogen peroxide,

2257
02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:13.100
and those will kill a cancer cell.
So,
you know,

2258
02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:16.220
and that's one of the things when you actually have a cancer cell and you force

2259
02:12:16.221 --> 02:12:19.790
it to activate its Mitochondria,
the cancer cell will die.
And that's,

2260
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.030
it's used like there's,
there's certain chemo drugs that do that,

2261
02:12:23.031 --> 02:12:27.920
that are used effectively to,
you know,
kill these cancer cells.
But you know,
it's

2262
02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:33.020
the,
the,
the reason that they make this lactic acid,
you know,
isn't,

2263
02:12:33.170 --> 02:12:36.290
it has nothing to do with it can't live in an alkaline environment.
It's just,

2264
02:12:36.291 --> 02:12:38.600
that's just people making associations.
It's,

2265
02:12:38.601 --> 02:12:42.140
it's because they're basically using glucose and that's that.

2266
02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:44.750
That's why if you starve a cancer cell up glucose,

2267
02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:48.200
it can also dramatically slow its progress.

2268
02:12:48.201 --> 02:12:51.740
And sometimes it kills it,
you know,
if it doesn't have glucose at,
can't,

2269
02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:54.020
can't make energy,
it's still can,

2270
02:12:54.021 --> 02:12:55.650
I mean it's still will use this mitochondria but the,

2271
02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:59.210
but when it uses its mitochondria,
it's more likely to kill it.

2272
02:12:59.750 --> 02:13:02.090
So that's,
that's kind of,

2273
02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:05.340
<v 0>so that's where that's coming from.
I think that's where that's coming from.</v>

2274
02:13:05.341 --> 02:13:06.180
That's what I call Yoga.

2275
02:13:06.181 --> 02:13:10.120
People hold talk cause yoga people always like to say things like that.
You know,

2276
02:13:10.121 --> 02:13:12.990
like a cancer can't live in an alkaline environment.

2277
02:13:13.230 --> 02:13:16.080
If you only pines and vegetables,
your blood will be alkaline.

2278
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:18.900
And you can I get you,
I'm like Whoa.
I don't fucking think you're right.

2279
02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:23.340
And I think this is how much research have you done?
This is some shady talk.

2280
02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:24.120
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2281
02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:27.960
Well there those yoga people are gonna like the meditation telomerase thing that

2282
02:13:27.961 --> 02:13:30.530
I talked about though.
But that's real science.
So,
right.

2283
02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:32.190
The other I wanted to ask you about

2284
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:36.660
<v 0>is hot yoga.
Like the effect of hot exercise.
Um,</v>

2285
02:13:36.661 --> 02:13:39.000
whether or not that mimics what you were talking about,

2286
02:13:39.001 --> 02:13:42.870
about core body temperature that's going on in Sauna.
Um,
the CROC,

2287
02:13:42.871 --> 02:13:46.410
Jim's a legendary boxing gym and Emanuel Steward,

2288
02:13:46.420 --> 02:13:48.390
who was one of the greatest boxing trainers of all time,

2289
02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:53.370
used to force his fighters to train with the heat cranked way up.

2290
02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:57.000
So it was just unbelievably hot in there.
And people would go there to work out,

2291
02:13:57.001 --> 02:14:01.900
they'd be like Jesus Christ.
And he just had this real belief that there was a,

2292
02:14:01.901 --> 02:14:06.780
a massive benefit of training and that sort of an environment and then pushing

2293
02:14:06.781 --> 02:14:08.970
yourself in that really,
really hot environment.

2294
02:14:09.230 --> 02:14:12.540
And when you were out of there and you left,
it would pay dividends.

2295
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:14.190
Does that make any sense?
And Yeah.

2296
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:18.180
Do you think that that's what's going on with hot yoga as well?
I,
you know,

2297
02:14:18.181 --> 02:14:21.870
I just got into that over the last three months or so.
I love it.

2298
02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:24.960
It's one of my favorite things to do.
I fucking hate it while I'm in there,

2299
02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:27.180
but when I get out of there,
God damn,
I feel,
yeah.

2300
02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:30.950
<v 1>Good.
Right?
Yeah.
So,
okay.
To address your first question.
Okay.
Uh,</v>

2301
02:14:30.951 --> 02:14:32.510
and that has been shown,
yes.

2302
02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:37.540
Like training in heat has been shown to improve before,

2303
02:14:38.211 --> 02:14:40.010
like have performance enhancements,

2304
02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:44.620
at least in the studies that I've read with endurance training.
Um,

2305
02:14:44.770 --> 02:14:48.170
and that's partly because you are,
you are,

2306
02:14:48.230 --> 02:14:50.810
there's all these mechanisms that are in play.
You're,
you know,

2307
02:14:50.811 --> 02:14:53.660
you're able to increase blood flow to your heart,

2308
02:14:53.661 --> 02:14:55.490
which then your heart does less work.

2309
02:14:55.610 --> 02:14:58.520
You're also increasing the heat shock proteins,
which then you know,

2310
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:59.540
prevent all the damage,

2311
02:14:59.541 --> 02:15:02.930
which can then too much damage can affect your performance.

2312
02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:04.910
All these things are happening and the more you do that,

2313
02:15:04.911 --> 02:15:07.700
so when you train in the heat,
it's,
it's harder.

2314
02:15:07.701 --> 02:15:10.970
And also those things are getting activated even more and it's been shown that

2315
02:15:10.971 --> 02:15:14.780
the next time you train,
if it's not in the heat,
then your,

2316
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:16.850
you're sweating at a lower,
lower body temperature,

2317
02:15:16.851 --> 02:15:20.480
so your body is cooling down quicker.
Um,
those,

2318
02:15:20.481 --> 02:15:24.020
those same enhancements with the increased blood flow kick in,

2319
02:15:24.170 --> 02:15:28.720
you're also able to tolerate,
uh,
exercising harder,
which generates this,
you know,

2320
02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:31.180
heat and increases your core body temperature.
Yay.

2321
02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:34.570
So you're able to tolerate that better as well.
So I mean,

2322
02:15:34.670 --> 02:15:38.690
I think that makes sense.
Why people like in,
in the boxing gyms would do that.

2323
02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:40.600
<v 0>And it's really only one that I've heard of.</v>

2324
02:15:40.601 --> 02:15:42.220
I don't know of anybody else who does that,

2325
02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:46.570
but I would think that if that's the case,
like MMA gyms,
Jujitsu gyms,

2326
02:15:46.571 --> 02:15:48.250
all of them should crank the heat way up.
Right?

2327
02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:50.980
<v 1>Yeah.
It's also been shown,
it's very interesting.</v>

2328
02:15:50.981 --> 02:15:55.981
It's also been shown that that heat stress protects neurons from cell death,

2329
02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:00.070
like in mice at least where you,
if you put them,

2330
02:16:00.071 --> 02:16:03.640
if you expose them to heat stress like 24 hours before a traumatic event where

2331
02:16:03.641 --> 02:16:07.750
they like puncture the skull and,
uh,
they have much,
much less cell death.

2332
02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:10.510
So it protects in,
and again,
it's part of that you're,

2333
02:16:10.511 --> 02:16:13.480
you're increasing all those stress response mechanisms and they're active and

2334
02:16:13.481 --> 02:16:17.680
they're active for like days,
days,
and days later.
So when the next stress comes,

2335
02:16:17.681 --> 02:16:20.620
your,
your body's like,
boom,
bring it on.
I'm ready to handle it.
You know,
let's,

2336
02:16:20.621 --> 02:16:24.520
let's do this.
Um,
and so the,

2337
02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:29.500
the t to address your Bikram Yoga,
I like it as well,
by the way.
Um,
I,

2338
02:16:29.501 --> 02:16:32.170
it's,
they,
they typically use,

2339
02:16:32.710 --> 02:16:35.410
I think it's like a hundred or so degrees Fahrenheit,
right?
Something like that.

2340
02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:38.590
And they increase the humidity depending on where you're at,
you know,

2341
02:16:38.591 --> 02:16:39.700
up to like 40%.

2342
02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:42.730
And then you're like doing all these poses that you said you're exerting

2343
02:16:42.731 --> 02:16:46.600
yourself so it's absolutely hard and you,
you know,

2344
02:16:46.601 --> 02:16:50.230
your heart rate's going and you're hot and so all the same mechanisms are

2345
02:16:50.231 --> 02:16:53.020
kicking in that would kick in when you're just sitting in the sauna.

2346
02:16:53.170 --> 02:16:58.030
That's 170 degrees Fahrenheit.
So it's like a dry sauna.
But,

2347
02:16:58.090 --> 02:17:01.280
um,
you know,
whether or not they're as robust,
I don't know.

2348
02:17:01.281 --> 02:17:03.040
No stays of compare them.
I think that they,

2349
02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:06.430
that there are similar benefits from it,
from training and in like,

2350
02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:09.610
or from doing Bikram yoga or from training and heat.
I mean,

2351
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:11.980
runners do that all the time.
Bikers as well.
I mean,

2352
02:17:11.981 --> 02:17:15.680
that's part of their training method is to,
to like train and heat,
uh,

2353
02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:18.730
because they're,
they're also,
it also hasn't performance enhancements.

2354
02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:19.810
They're able to,
you know,

2355
02:17:19.870 --> 02:17:24.690
endure a longer periods of like longer running periods better than you.

2356
02:17:24.750 --> 02:17:26.800
If they didn't train the heat.
Um,

2357
02:17:27.430 --> 02:17:31.420
so I think that's definitely translatable to things like Bikram Yoga.

2358
02:17:31.421 --> 02:17:34.850
I just did a steam shower this morning and you know,
I,

2359
02:17:34.970 --> 02:17:37.360
my heart rate was getting up and you know,

2360
02:17:37.630 --> 02:17:40.540
it wasn't quite as difficult to stay in as it is in the sauna.

2361
02:17:40.541 --> 02:17:44.500
Like the difficult part is your body making dynorphins and I've talked about

2362
02:17:44.501 --> 02:17:47.470
this before,
that dynorphins is that thing that feels terrible.

2363
02:17:47.471 --> 02:17:51.160
Like you were saying,
it feels awful,
but then when you're done you feel really,

2364
02:17:51.161 --> 02:17:51.994
really good.

2365
02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:57.160
And that's partly because dynorphins which is the sort of counter to endorphin,

2366
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:58.743
um,
it,

2367
02:17:59.090 --> 02:18:04.090
it cause it's signals to your brain to make more receptors which bind to Beta

2368
02:18:05.231 --> 02:18:07.920
endorphins and desensitize them.
So like with,

2369
02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:11.560
you're also releasing Beta endorphins when you exercise and when you're in heat

2370
02:18:12.010 --> 02:18:16.150
or whenever,
whatever you're doing in the day,
uh,
so you actually feel better.

2371
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:19.480
And that's how I actually became very interested in the sauna is I was using it

2372
02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:20.951
in graduate school.

2373
02:18:20.951 --> 02:18:25.270
I started using it and I started to notice that I felt really,
really good.

2374
02:18:25.271 --> 02:18:28.570
Like if I used it in the morning and I went into the lab,
I was just like,

2375
02:18:29.290 --> 02:18:31.270
I felt really good.
I could handle all the stress,

2376
02:18:31.271 --> 02:18:33.520
I could handle people putting more work on me,

2377
02:18:33.521 --> 02:18:35.980
I could handle all the crap and just,
you know,

2378
02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:39.070
stuff that would really irritate me.
Usually I was,

2379
02:18:39.460 --> 02:18:42.940
I was more able to just deal with it.
And so that's when I became real.
I'm like,

2380
02:18:42.941 --> 02:18:43.900
something's going on here.

2381
02:18:43.901 --> 02:18:47.730
And I became very interested in the brain effects and the hormonal effects with

2382
02:18:47.731 --> 02:18:50.050
a sauna.
And so it's just your own anecdotal experience.

2383
02:18:50.051 --> 02:18:53.840
You just needed to try to figure out what the mechanism was.
That's what's got,

2384
02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:58.150
that's what sparked my interest was my own anecdotal evidence.
Yeah.
Wow.

2385
02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:01.140
And also on,
I noticed when I was injured,
um,

2386
02:19:02.170 --> 02:19:06.550
I would go into the sauna and doing this and also Dan notice this as well.

2387
02:19:06.551 --> 02:19:10.480
Like I lost less muscle mass.
Like usually if I'm injured and I can't work out,

2388
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:11.980
first of all I'd go crazy.

2389
02:19:11.981 --> 02:19:16.270
And so that helped me not go crazy because the endorphins and two,
um,

2390
02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:18.580
I lost less muscle mass.
Like,
usually,
you know,

2391
02:19:18.610 --> 02:19:21.550
if I don't work out I will start to lose muscle quick.

2392
02:19:21.551 --> 02:19:24.520
Like I would think there would be a big benefit to people that are going through

2393
02:19:24.521 --> 02:19:28.160
surgery,
maybe to repair something with knee surgery,
something along those lines.

2394
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:29.930
The only caveat is,

2395
02:19:29.931 --> 02:19:33.530
and my concern is that because it is a stress,

2396
02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:35.481
if you already,

2397
02:19:35.481 --> 02:19:39.230
if you already like are are you stressing your body and then another stress
like,

2398
02:19:39.231 --> 02:19:42.110
I don't know,
surgery seems like it's pretty stressful.
Um,

2399
02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:44.660
sometimes this two stresses together it can be bad.

2400
02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:48.350
So I was talking about it protecting against,
you know,

2401
02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:49.820
cell death with traumatic brain injury.

2402
02:19:49.821 --> 02:19:53.210
Well that was when it was done before 24 hours before the traumatic injury.

2403
02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:56.540
If you have a traumatic brain injury and then you get into the sauna,

2404
02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:00.280
you're going to cause more cell death,
you're going to do more damage.
So it's,

2405
02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:04.760
I'm a little hesitant about saying,
Oh yeah,
just apply it to like any recovery.

2406
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:07.550
I don't,
you know,
possibly if you're not,

2407
02:20:07.710 --> 02:20:11.600
it depends on like the amount of damage that was done during the surgery and you

2408
02:20:11.601 --> 02:20:15.020
know,
like amount of time from the surgery at a time out from the surgery.

2409
02:20:15.021 --> 02:20:18.380
Exactly,
exactly.
I want you to wait a couple months.
I was definitely,

2410
02:20:18.530 --> 02:20:20.270
I definitely would.
I mean a couple of months would be,

2411
02:20:20.271 --> 02:20:21.410
I think plenty of time to wait.

2412
02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:23.650
<v 0>What about cold therapy?</v>

2413
02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:28.680
What about either cold water immersion or cryotherapy post any sort of an

2414
02:20:28.751 --> 02:20:29.240
injury?

2415
02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:32.930
<v 1>Now that's actually good.
So,
um,
you know,
the,</v>

2416
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:35.450
well obviously you need,

2417
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:40.070
you want some sort of inflammatory mechanisms to,
you know,

2418
02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:43.130
help with,
uh,
repairing the damage.

2419
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:46.520
And so because that activates all the anti inflammatory ones,

2420
02:20:46.521 --> 02:20:48.340
we're talking about that.
So I,
I,

2421
02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:53.050
but people do use cold cold therapy has been used to help with at least damage

2422
02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:55.070
to the brain that's been shown.
I mean,
that's,

2423
02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:58.820
that's pretty standard that it's used to help with like ischemic stroke,

2424
02:20:58.821 --> 02:21:01.190
traumatic brain injury also.
Um,

2425
02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:05.060
whether or not you should use it right after an injury.
You know,

2426
02:21:05.090 --> 02:21:08.300
I think if your immune system is going out of control,

2427
02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:13.130
it seemed like it would be good,
you know,
because then,
and like I said,

2428
02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:17.900
it's been shown to help with people that are
prone to overtraining.

2429
02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:23.150
So I dunno,
I think it's,
it's hard to say it'll help everyone.

2430
02:21:23.390 --> 02:21:26.980
I think it depends on it a little better factors as well.
Like how,

2431
02:21:26.981 --> 02:21:30.860
how injured you are,
how much of the,
how much are you,

2432
02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:34.680
are you just continually producing these proinflammatory cytokines or,
you know,

2433
02:21:34.690 --> 02:21:37.010
is it kind of out of control?
Do we need to stop that?

2434
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:40.850
So there's a lot of factors.
Yeah.
I mean,

2435
02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:44.390
that's in my mind and I'm not an expert on that.
So,
you know,

2436
02:21:44.391 --> 02:21:47.590
maybe someone else that's spent a lot of time doing research on that would know.

2437
02:21:48.530 --> 02:21:53.220
<v 0>We need you to know we don't have time.
There's no time to learn all this.
Um,</v>

2438
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:58.010
another thing that I saw you tweet about that I've been really fascinated about,

2439
02:21:58.011 --> 02:22:02.360
especially because there's been some concern that they're actually doing this to

2440
02:22:02.361 --> 02:22:06.170
people now is myostatin inhibitors.
Um,

2441
02:22:06.171 --> 02:22:09.800
you tweeted about these myostatin inhibited pigs.

2442
02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:13.070
There's a,
what are they doing?
Like what are they doing?
These,

2443
02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:18.180
I know that this is a natural occurrence in whippets is a dog and sometimes when

2444
02:22:19.281 --> 02:22:20.270
they breed them,

2445
02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:24.980
this happens is gene gets fucked up and they develop these hulk dogs.

2446
02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:26.040
And if you haven't seen

2447
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.100
<v 1>them before,
uh,</v>

2448
02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:30.350
folks Google it and I swear to God you'll think you're being photo-shopped.

2449
02:22:30.390 --> 02:22:33.480
You think someone's joking because these dogs are insane.

2450
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:36.030
They their dogs with like double,

2451
02:22:36.031 --> 02:22:38.850
triple the amount of muscle that a normal dog would normally have.

2452
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:42.570
Like there's one right there,
like come on.
That does,
does not look real,

2453
02:22:42.690 --> 02:22:44.400
but it is absolutely real.

2454
02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:49.260
And that is all because of just a,
a gene variance.
Right?

2455
02:22:49.770 --> 02:22:54.600
And,
and these random mutations also occur in people dogs.

2456
02:22:55.350 --> 02:22:58.050
So they do,
the random mutation does occur.
In fact,

2457
02:22:58.410 --> 02:23:00.840
you're the first one that brought my sound to my attention.

2458
02:23:00.841 --> 02:23:04.530
I remember the first time I came on and I was like,
what is milestone?
Uh,

2459
02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:06.860
but you know,
since then I had it,

2460
02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:10.480
it's been on my radar and it's come up and a few other studies.
And so,

2461
02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:13.710
so inhibiting Myo San inhibits a muscle.

2462
02:23:13.890 --> 02:23:17.330
So basically like muscle growth.
And so if you inhibit Myostatin,

2463
02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:20.370
we'll then you get rid of that negative inhibitor that's inhibiting muscles from

2464
02:23:20.371 --> 02:23:25.170
growing.
What's really interesting is that in mice,

2465
02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:27.570
when they do this,
when they like can inhibit my,
Oh son,

2466
02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:30.780
it's been shown to actually increase longevity.
So these mice are like,

2467
02:23:30.781 --> 02:23:32.810
they live longer.
I mean it's,

2468
02:23:32.811 --> 02:23:36.330
it's really fascinating to oppose it in front of the mirror all the time.
Yeah.

2469
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:41.190
Because you know,
now this engineering technology is getting better and better.

2470
02:23:41.191 --> 02:23:45.710
And so the,
so that's what they've been using with the pigs,
that,
that,
uh,

2471
02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:48.750
I tweeted about where they're now able to,
um,

2472
02:23:49.350 --> 02:23:54.060
specifically take a gene and say,
okay,

2473
02:23:54.061 --> 02:23:58.380
I want to take this gene and I want to like either turn it into another,

2474
02:23:58.430 --> 02:24:00.000
you know,
I want to put a mutation in it.

2475
02:24:00.001 --> 02:24:03.690
The either makes it not active or I want to change it to make it better.

2476
02:24:03.900 --> 02:24:07.550
Things like that.
And so we have this new system,
we can do that called crisper.

2477
02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:11.010
Uh,
the one that was used in that study,
actually,
it was another one called Talon,

2478
02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:14.180
which is very similar.
But basically what happens is that they take these,

2479
02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:17.190
these proteins that are able to recognize a certain sequence.

2480
02:24:17.191 --> 02:24:20.520
And when you have a certain gene with it,
it'll recognize that sequence.

2481
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:25.380
When you stick it into the cell and it will cut out the gene and then replace it

2482
02:24:25.381 --> 02:24:26.460
with whatever you'd give it.

2483
02:24:26.461 --> 02:24:30.840
So it replaces it with let's say a nonactive Myostatin.
So now you take a pig,

2484
02:24:30.841 --> 02:24:31.291
for example,

2485
02:24:31.291 --> 02:24:36.291
it has normal myostatin and then you give it this technology that can kind of

2486
02:24:37.321 --> 02:24:41.970
cut out the,
the,
the gene and then put it with a nonactive.
So now you've got,

2487
02:24:42.050 --> 02:24:45.930
uh,
you know,
mindset and it's not working.
So it's like constantly inhibited,

2488
02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:49.230
which means now these muscles are just growing like out of control.

2489
02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:51.810
And they can do this with a pig that's already adult.

2490
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:54.000
So that's a little different.
Um,

2491
02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:58.380
they were doing it with embryos to do it with.

2492
02:24:58.410 --> 02:25:00.960
So if you do it with an adult,

2493
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:04.710
it's a little different because you have to like get it to the right tissue.

2494
02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:05.730
I mean,
you know,

2495
02:25:05.731 --> 02:25:10.470
so it complicates things more and the technology is getting better and better.

2496
02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:13.530
But you know,
you have to give it a targeting sequence and say,
okay,

2497
02:25:13.531 --> 02:25:17.430
go to the liver,
go to the heart,
you know,
go to the kidneys,

2498
02:25:17.431 --> 02:25:20.700
like whatever organ we're talking about.
And then once it goes there,

2499
02:25:20.701 --> 02:25:24.830
then it finds that gene like and cuts it out and then,
you know,

2500
02:25:24.850 --> 02:25:27.490
can replace it with whatever you give it.
I mean,
this,

2501
02:25:27.491 --> 02:25:32.491
this has implications for genetic genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia,

2502
02:25:32.621 --> 02:25:34.000
things like that where you're like,
okay,

2503
02:25:34.001 --> 02:25:37.030
we know what the screwed up gene is and we know what the good one is.

2504
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:40.030
Let's give it the good one.
Send it there,
cut out the,

2505
02:25:40.031 --> 02:25:44.170
screwed up one and blood cells and then,
you know,
give it this good one.
Um,

2506
02:25:44.171 --> 02:25:46.090
and that's,
that's actually being done in blood cells.

2507
02:25:46.091 --> 02:25:48.120
It's the easiest because you can,
it's,
you know,

2508
02:25:48.130 --> 02:25:51.040
you can take blood out and you can change things and then you can transplant it

2509
02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:54.430
by again.
And they're doing this now with actually,
um,
they're making,

2510
02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:57.790
they're genetically engineering cancer cells to,
sorry,

2511
02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.000
immune cells to have a protein that's able to recognize a cancer cell and kill

2512
02:26:03.551 --> 02:26:06.750
it.
So they're taking people that have cancer or they're taking out their immune

2513
02:26:06.751 --> 02:26:08.110
municipal,
this is the clinical trials,

2514
02:26:08.111 --> 02:26:13.111
but they're going to take out their immune cells and then they're going to

2515
02:26:13.810 --> 02:26:16.570
genetically engineer them with this new system to make a protein that they don't

2516
02:26:16.571 --> 02:26:19.090
normally make that can recognize a cancer cell and then kill it.

2517
02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:22.000
I'm going to transplant it back into the person and see if it works.

2518
02:26:22.001 --> 02:26:25.180
It's been shown to work in mice.
So the next step is,
you know,

2519
02:26:25.181 --> 02:26:28.140
seeing if it works in humans with the mild stat and thing.
It's,

2520
02:26:28.141 --> 02:26:31.180
it's interesting and I,
you know,
doing this in humans,

2521
02:26:31.181 --> 02:26:34.450
there's going to be all sorts of like FDA regulations and all that stuff that

2522
02:26:34.451 --> 02:26:37.240
you have to get by.
China's already doing it.
Of course,

2523
02:26:37.241 --> 02:26:39.730
they're already experimenting with human embryos.

2524
02:26:39.731 --> 02:26:41.500
They've already published a paper

2525
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:47.230
<v 0>experimenting with human embryos that they bring to the make actually bring to</v>

2526
02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:48.450
<v 1>birth.</v>

2527
02:26:48.450 --> 02:26:53.450
So they're experimenting with a in vitro fertilized embryos that failed.

2528
02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:58.680
So there were,
they were going to throw them out anyways,
like at a,

2529
02:26:58.681 --> 02:27:01.650
at a stage before they were the embryo.
It's like it's a blastocyst.

2530
02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:05.970
And so they're taking this cell that's going to become an embryo and they're,

2531
02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:07.320
they're starting to just,
they're trying,

2532
02:27:07.321 --> 02:27:09.810
they were trying to change a certain gene and I think it was,

2533
02:27:10.170 --> 02:27:12.940
I think it was for sickle cell.
And uh,

2534
02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:14.760
what they found was that when they were doing this,

2535
02:27:14.761 --> 02:27:18.930
so they were taking this blastocyst that that's going to be an embryo and they

2536
02:27:18.931 --> 02:27:21.620
cut out the sickle cell gene and,

2537
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:23.310
and we're trying to replace it with another one.

2538
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:27.930
They found that it caused all sorts of mutations in other genes.
Like,

2539
02:27:27.931 --> 02:27:31.830
so it was like this clearly stuff going on and we don't understand,
you know,

2540
02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:34.320
but I think in the,
you know,

2541
02:27:34.321 --> 02:27:37.710
things are getting better and better and as more scientists are researching this

2542
02:27:37.711 --> 02:27:41.190
and figure up figuring out what's going on,
why it's causing,
you know,

2543
02:27:41.191 --> 02:27:42.360
these random mutations,

2544
02:27:42.361 --> 02:27:44.970
then we'll start to have new technology and eventually it will be able to be

2545
02:27:44.971 --> 02:27:47.340
done.
Eventually we'll be able to do that.

2546
02:27:47.430 --> 02:27:51.460
<v 0>There's an excellent radio lab,
a podcast rather,
uh,</v>

2547
02:27:51.470 --> 02:27:56.350
on this very method called CRISPR and a,
if you're that one.
Yeah.

2548
02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:59.290
<v 1>Actually someone tweeted at me and because I've been</v>

2549
02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:04.280
<v 0>crazy about CRISPR for a while and someone tweeted at me and I heard part of it,</v>

2550
02:28:04.310 --> 02:28:04.920
it's amazing.

2551
02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:08.090
They did a really good job of explaining it for the layman to where they

2552
02:28:08.130 --> 02:28:10.610
explained with CRISPR.
Yes.
Yeah.

2553
02:28:10.611 --> 02:28:14.350
Because I am a huge radio lab fan and listen that all the time.
Yeah.
Um,

2554
02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:18.740
so explain to people what Crispr is and how it was developed and how they

2555
02:28:18.741 --> 02:28:22.280
figured out how to manipulate genes with this.

2556
02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:26.900
<v 1>Yeah.
So that's,
I mean,
I can try to explain that.
I'm just saying a little late,</v>

2557
02:28:26.901 --> 02:28:29.690
but just enough to get them to listen to the radio lab one.
Yeah.

2558
02:28:29.691 --> 02:28:34.040
So basically they found it in bacteria and you know,
in bacteria what they,

2559
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:39.050
what they found was that Thursday circle certain sequences of DNA that were

2560
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:41.390
there were like,
had a certain repetitive sequence to it.

2561
02:28:41.391 --> 02:28:45.260
So it had a certain like,
you know,
code,
but it wasn't,

2562
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:46.870
it wasn't the bacterial DNA.
They,

2563
02:28:46.871 --> 02:28:50.900
if they found it was actually like DNA sequences that were similar to viral.

2564
02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:54.020
It was actually viral DNA.
And so they were like,
well,

2565
02:28:54.021 --> 02:28:56.960
what is viral DNA doing in this bacterial sequence?

2566
02:28:57.290 --> 02:29:01.350
And it turns out one of the scientists had hypothesized the reason it was there,

2567
02:29:01.351 --> 02:29:05.840
it was because it was a response to be able to fight off the virus.

2568
02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:08.300
So they had these certain sequences,

2569
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:11.930
like a viral DNA with that could then recognize the virus and then PR create

2570
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:15.060
antibodies and things against it to bite off the Bible,

2571
02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:19.940
like captured a sequence of this virus.
The virus is actually infected the DNA.

2572
02:29:19.941 --> 02:29:24.470
I think that's,
that's the,
the idea.
Um,

2573
02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:27.990
but what's really interesting is that these sequences are conserved like it.

2574
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:32.540
So there's a certain protein that we all make in ourselves that recognize these

2575
02:29:32.541 --> 02:29:36.320
sequences.
And that protein is like,
it's a caspase nine.
It's,

2576
02:29:36.470 --> 02:29:38.460
so it's basically,
uh,

2577
02:29:38.570 --> 02:29:43.520
something that's evolutionary conserved from bacteria to viruses to humans,

2578
02:29:43.521 --> 02:29:45.890
mice,
and we all,
we all like have a certain form of it.

2579
02:29:46.490 --> 02:29:48.410
So I think that was kind of how it was discovered.

2580
02:29:48.411 --> 02:29:51.990
And what happens when this caspase recognizes it?
Is it like cleaves?

2581
02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:56.720
So like cuts.
So this woman,
um,
at UC Berkeley,

2582
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:59.000
which is kind of down the street from me,
she's a scientist,

2583
02:29:59.270 --> 02:30:01.430
she liked thought of this brilliant way to,
to,

2584
02:30:01.480 --> 02:30:06.480
to harness that system and use it as a technology to be able to genetically

2585
02:30:07.431 --> 02:30:10.670
engineer things with more precision.
So it used to be like,

2586
02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:14.420
and when I did a lot of research,
I mean when I was doing a lot of research with,

2587
02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:17.840
you know,
making a mouse have a certain gene that doesn't usually have,

2588
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:21.300
the way we would do it was we'd blast this,
you know,

2589
02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:26.060
mouse with virus that that basically brings the gene into the cell.

2590
02:30:26.061 --> 02:30:27.350
But it goes like anywhere.

2591
02:30:27.351 --> 02:30:31.070
It randomly just goes to a piece of the chromosome so it doesn't go exactly

2592
02:30:31.071 --> 02:30:32.360
where the gene is supposed to go.

2593
02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:35.480
So this technology now is able to recognize this,

2594
02:30:35.481 --> 02:30:40.130
these little patterns cut out,
you know where that gene is.

2595
02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:44.390
Usually I'm putting a new one and so it's very precise as opposed to we're going

2596
02:30:44.391 --> 02:30:47.000
to blast the cell with its gene and we're going to give more of it and it's

2597
02:30:47.001 --> 02:30:49.010
going to be,
we don't know where it's going to be,

2598
02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:51.950
where it's going to be incorporated into the genome.
It's just going to be there.

2599
02:30:51.951 --> 02:30:52.460
And it's,

2600
02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:56.000
so there's all sorts of other side effects that could happen if you're trying to

2601
02:30:56.001 --> 02:30:59.390
study the effect of what having more of a certain gene does.

2602
02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:03.470
You may be studying in addition to what more of that gene does.

2603
02:31:03.471 --> 02:31:07.270
You may maybe also looking at,
you know,
it'd be it changing,
you know,

2604
02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:11.060
other things that are going on because it's being expressed in certain places.

2605
02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:13.010
It's not.
So things like that.

2606
02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:16.670
So it's really like a more precise way to genetically engineer things.

2607
02:31:16.671 --> 02:31:20.010
And this is going to be used for for a lot of things.
And what,
how

2608
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:22.590
<v 0>long ago did she develop this?
Like couple of years ago,</v>

2609
02:31:22.591 --> 02:31:27.420
I think it was like 2012 the first publication was 2012 maybe that's what the

2610
02:31:27.421 --> 02:31:30.300
Mayans were talking about.
December 21st,

2611
02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:32.430
2012 being the end of the world maybe just takes a long time.
How was it?

2612
02:31:32.431 --> 02:31:34.980
2012 but that's what they thought.
Well not really.

2613
02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:38.700
It was just the end of the long count of their calendar and just the really

2614
02:31:38.701 --> 02:31:42.480
loony toons people decided it was the end of the world.
Cause it's fun.

2615
02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:43.493
It's fun to think.

2616
02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:47.340
What's interesting to think is what it will happen with Crispr if we do start

2617
02:31:47.341 --> 02:31:48.174
trying to clean engineering.

2618
02:31:48.180 --> 02:31:51.030
We'll also interesting to think what's going to happen next if they just

2619
02:31:51.031 --> 02:31:54.450
developed CRISPR three years ago,
what's the three year from now?

2620
02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:55.800
Things are going to come up with,

2621
02:31:56.130 --> 02:32:01.130
cause it seems like this stuff increases exponentially and then each individual

2622
02:32:01.170 --> 02:32:05.850
discovery and innovation gives birth to all these new improvements and other new

2623
02:32:05.851 --> 02:32:07.950
ones that weren't possible without that.
Oh,

2624
02:32:07.951 --> 02:32:11.520
so what CRISPR gives birth to now what?
What comes out of that?

2625
02:32:11.521 --> 02:32:12.630
It's going to be really kind of crazy.

2626
02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:17.320
<v 1>What I see coming out soon is that we'll be able to,</v>

2627
02:32:18.430 --> 02:32:20.500
we'll be able to take stem cells and,

2628
02:32:20.530 --> 02:32:24.580
and then make the stem cell have a certain,
you know,
for example,

2629
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:29.860
I've got a form of the ape gene that is,
you know,
very,
very,
uh,

2630
02:32:29.861 --> 02:32:30.910
associated with Alzheimer's.

2631
02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:35.410
And it's just a sequence of DNA that's a little different than someone that

2632
02:32:35.411 --> 02:32:38.680
doesn't have this variant.
But it really increases my risk for Alzheimer's.

2633
02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:43.510
So you take the stem cells and then you say,
I don't want that person.

2634
02:32:43.540 --> 02:32:47.200
I want to get rid of that apo e four and I want to give it another sequence

2635
02:32:47.201 --> 02:32:50.290
where it's like the April we three version.
So just change the,

2636
02:32:50.291 --> 02:32:53.800
sequence the DNA a little bit and then transplant it back into the person.

2637
02:32:54.100 --> 02:32:56.500
Or you do that with Parkinson's disease.
These people have,

2638
02:32:56.501 --> 02:33:00.340
some of them have something called Alpha,
Cigna,
Cigna,
Nicholean where there,

2639
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:01.000
you know,
it's,

2640
02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:05.290
it's basically producing this out of control and it causes aggregates to form

2641
02:33:05.291 --> 02:33:06.460
and that leads to cell death.

2642
02:33:06.670 --> 02:33:09.430
So then take the stem cells and you can make it so that they don't have that

2643
02:33:09.820 --> 02:33:12.940
form and you give them the right form and then transplant back in.
You know?

2644
02:33:12.941 --> 02:33:17.140
So there's,
I think there's,
and we're now able to make stem cells from any cell,

2645
02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:18.400
which is really,
really cool.

2646
02:33:18.430 --> 02:33:22.480
So the fact that we can take our skin cells and basically give them the right

2647
02:33:22.481 --> 02:33:26.380
signals,
the right cytokines,
the right environment to say,
here,

2648
02:33:26.410 --> 02:33:30.130
I want you to become a neuron.
I know right now you're a skin cell,

2649
02:33:30.490 --> 02:33:33.010
but I'm going to give you all these other things that usually happen in the

2650
02:33:33.011 --> 02:33:35.830
brain.
And I'm going to make you become a neuron.

2651
02:33:36.100 --> 02:33:38.590
So then we'll be able to take a person's own skin cell,

2652
02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:41.980
make it into a dopaminergic neuron,
for example,

2653
02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:46.450
once we figure out exactly what the right cocktail is.
So you know,

2654
02:33:46.451 --> 02:33:48.460
there's a certain environment around these,

2655
02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:52.540
these cells in your brain and that environment is what causes them to become a

2656
02:33:52.541 --> 02:33:56.590
dopaminergic neuron,
for example.
And then they're going to,
uh,

2657
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:59.980
figure that out and then take the skin cell and make it become a dopaminergic

2658
02:33:59.981 --> 02:34:04.000
neuron and then transplant back into,
you know,
someone that has Parkinson's.

2659
02:34:04.330 --> 02:34:09.330
<v 0>I got a stem cell injection recently in my shoulder from women's placenta.</v>

2660
02:34:10.930 --> 02:34:15.880
They take a hook.
You're going to see,
I'm all excited.
Yeah.
Um,
I have,
uh,

2661
02:34:15.940 --> 02:34:20.590
some small on my labor room and a small tear in my rotator cuff.

2662
02:34:20.980 --> 02:34:25.930
And,
um,
apparently my shoulder's been dislocated and I didn't know.

2663
02:34:26.350 --> 02:34:29.860
And uh,
there's,
there had been some damage.
I knew that my shoulder was,

2664
02:34:30.310 --> 02:34:32.980
it bugged me when I exercise a lot,

2665
02:34:33.490 --> 02:34:37.480
but I'm not enough that I thought it was anything really wrong with it until I

2666
02:34:37.481 --> 02:34:38.950
want up getting an MRI.
And there's like,

2667
02:34:38.951 --> 02:34:41.200
you got a bunch of tears in there and they were saying,

2668
02:34:41.201 --> 02:34:44.380
you might have to get shoulder surgery eventually,

2669
02:34:44.740 --> 02:34:49.690
but let's just see what we can do here.
And a,
so I'd gone through a round of,

2670
02:34:49.691 --> 02:34:54.190
um,
Regina King,
uh,
which helps a lot,
reduced inflammation,

2671
02:34:54.191 --> 02:34:58.420
made it feel a lot better.
But this,
uh,
this stem cell shot,

2672
02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:02.860
I just got it.
Uh,
it's still see some of the bruising like see here,

2673
02:35:02.861 --> 02:35:05.050
which is actually a blood not from here,

2674
02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:08.450
but from up here where they shot it and it was fucking really painful.

2675
02:35:08.451 --> 02:35:09.460
It was a big ass needle.

2676
02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:13.360
And they just shoved it right into the tendon and right into the,

2677
02:35:13.361 --> 02:35:15.790
the area where there's damage.
And they said,
well,

2678
02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:17.650
let's take a look at this and six weeks,

2679
02:35:17.651 --> 02:35:20.860
we're not exactly sure what's going to happen and we're not exactly sure.

2680
02:35:20.861 --> 02:35:24.070
We're not exactly sure,
uh,
how it works.
So good luck.

2681
02:35:24.430 --> 02:35:29.000
<v 1>So,
so I,
a couple of questions for you.
For one,
for wine.
I actually,</v>

2682
02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:33.080
a colleague of mine that I work with at Children's Hospital in Oakland,

2683
02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:36.900
he actually published a paper where he,

2684
02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:41.940
he was the one that discovered that the placenta was a very rich source of stem

2685
02:35:42.741 --> 02:35:45.800
cells,
much,
much more than like the umbilical cord.

2686
02:35:46.370 --> 02:35:49.670
And it's also these,
these placental stem cells,

2687
02:35:50.270 --> 02:35:54.080
they're able to form almost every cell type in the body.

2688
02:35:54.081 --> 02:35:58.460
So not only can they form,
you know,
blood cells,

2689
02:35:58.550 --> 02:36:02.990
hematopoietic stem cells,
but they can form neurons,
they can form like other,

2690
02:36:03.050 --> 02:36:06.100
other cell types in the body,
liver cells,
heart muscle,
I think he's,

2691
02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:10.340
he published are quite a few different cell types.
And so,
um,

2692
02:36:10.850 --> 02:36:14.510
but this isn't being,
this is not being used very frequently.
I mean,
peep,

2693
02:36:14.511 --> 02:36:19.511
there are some people that are banking their placenta and like I wasn't aware.

2694
02:36:20.181 --> 02:36:23.180
I know there's maybe one company or two companies that are our banking,

2695
02:36:23.181 --> 02:36:23.631
the placenta,

2696
02:36:23.631 --> 02:36:27.740
but I wasn't aware of anyone that is like allowing you to use someone else's

2697
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:32.810
placenta.
So you have to find a match.
Like,
so you just,
you want what company?

2698
02:36:33.470 --> 02:36:37.530
<v 0>It's,
it's in Vegas.
I'll give you all the information.
Once I,
uh,
well off the air,</v>

2699
02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:39.570
I don't have it on,
I'll have to search for it.

2700
02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:44.370
<v 1>I mean that's,
that's super,
super cool to me.
I'm an exciting because like I've,</v>

2701
02:36:44.390 --> 02:36:48.890
I actually did a podcast on this where I interviewed him frons frons Kuypers is

2702
02:36:48.891 --> 02:36:51.000
a name and um,
you know,

2703
02:36:51.001 --> 02:36:54.660
he was talking all about how we made the discovery and how,
you know,

2704
02:36:54.661 --> 02:36:56.820
how he wants to have these huge,
you're like,

2705
02:36:56.821 --> 02:37:00.120
we have blood banks where people bank their blood and so that you can like,

2706
02:37:00.150 --> 02:37:01.830
you know,
if you need blood transfusion,

2707
02:37:01.831 --> 02:37:06.180
you find a donor that matches what he wants to have these placenta banks where,

2708
02:37:06.181 --> 02:37:09.560
you know,
people just throw the placenta out and you know,
that's,

2709
02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:14.190
it's a huge like source of stem cells.
So,
you know,
that's,
that's a big waste.

2710
02:37:14.490 --> 02:37:16.130
You're talking,
being able to tune people

2711
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:20.690
<v 0>up for injuries or for nerds,
general diseases for,
for most,
I mean,</v>

2712
02:37:20.810 --> 02:37:24.530
anything.
Well,
Dr. Davidson,
who's one of the doctors that works for the UFC,

2713
02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:29.660
he had a shoulder surgery and a was still having some pretty significant issues

2714
02:37:29.661 --> 02:37:32.000
after surgery.
It was just really painful.

2715
02:37:32.001 --> 02:37:34.970
And he had bone on bone arthritis and it was just really sore,

2716
02:37:36.050 --> 02:37:40.460
got a stem cell injection and he said literally within less than two months he

2717
02:37:40.461 --> 02:37:44.330
was healed.
Wow.
Yeah.
He says his arm feels amazing now with no pain at all.

2718
02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:45.740
I mean I think depending on,

2719
02:37:45.741 --> 02:37:49.730
so there's lots of techniques that are around in terms of like how you present,

2720
02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:52.580
how you preserve those,
the placenta source.

2721
02:37:52.581 --> 02:37:55.430
So it's best to like preserve the whole tissue.

2722
02:37:55.431 --> 02:37:59.060
You don't want to isolate the stem cells from the placenta and then freeze the

2723
02:37:59.061 --> 02:38:02.840
stem cells because they're going to be more likely to die and less likely to be

2724
02:38:02.841 --> 02:38:07.430
able to form whatever cell they need to,
you know,
when you thaw them,
you know.

2725
02:38:07.430 --> 02:38:11.240
So I think that at least fronds was telling me there's a certain procedure

2726
02:38:11.241 --> 02:38:14.450
that's really important.
You follow.
So,
depending on what,
who's doing this,

2727
02:38:14.451 --> 02:38:15.580
what company,
you know,

2728
02:38:15.581 --> 02:38:20.540
you may find a lot of variation in terms of the efficacy of this stem cell

2729
02:38:20.541 --> 02:38:24.530
injection from one versus another because the buyability of the stem cells,

2730
02:38:24.770 --> 02:38:27.140
you know,
also,
you know what you're doing.

2731
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:31.610
Is it putting the stem cell that basically is unprogrammed so it doesn't have a

2732
02:38:31.611 --> 02:38:32.444
program yet.

2733
02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:36.830
What I mean by that is the program happens with the environment that it's in.

2734
02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:39.630
And so different cytokines that are present,
you know,

2735
02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:43.430
in your shoulder or your connective tissue are different from the environment

2736
02:38:43.431 --> 02:38:44.800
that's in your brain,
you know,

2737
02:38:44.810 --> 02:38:49.640
so that certain micro environment then gives it signals to become whatever

2738
02:38:49.641 --> 02:38:53.810
connective tissue or whatever it is.
Uh,
so you know,

2739
02:38:53.811 --> 02:38:56.210
there's so they just injected the stem cell.

2740
02:38:56.210 --> 02:39:00.860
Like the placental stem cell takes 10 seconds.
It's crazy.

2741
02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:03.500
Hurts like hell.
But I got to tell you,

2742
02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:06.020
it's hard to figure out what's going on again,

2743
02:39:06.021 --> 02:39:08.840
because I do so many different things between the Regena keen in this,

2744
02:39:08.841 --> 02:39:12.170
but my shoulder feels great.
I mean I worked out today,
no pain at all,

2745
02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:15.320
did kickboxing,
so I was using it a lot.
Um,

2746
02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:18.110
it seems still have issues when I press,

2747
02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:22.640
so I'm avoiding like overhead pressing and bench pressing and things along those

2748
02:39:22.641 --> 02:39:23.360
lines.

2749
02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:27.110
I might eventually have to get it fixed because there was a tear in the labor

2750
02:39:27.111 --> 02:39:30.020
room and I have a feeling of this terror is like years old.

2751
02:39:30.190 --> 02:39:35.180
The one of the problems with Jujitsu is that you learn to ignore joint pain.

2752
02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:38.120
He just learned to sort of ignore it because everything's always hurting.

2753
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:42.080
Your elbows hurt,
your wrists hurt,
your knees hurt,
everything hurts cause you're,

2754
02:39:42.081 --> 02:39:46.400
the whole goal of the art of Jujitsu is to damage joints.

2755
02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:51.820
So you're constantly tapping or avoiding being tapped and when you're avoiding

2756
02:39:52.101 --> 02:39:55.220
being tapped,
sometimes you probably really should just tap,
you know,

2757
02:39:55.221 --> 02:39:58.370
meaning you give up because you're,
you're stressing your joint.

2758
02:39:58.371 --> 02:40:01.760
Like sometimes you'll get caught in what's called an Americana where your arm

2759
02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:06.140
gets pinned down like that and then they torque it like this and it's a lot of

2760
02:40:06.141 --> 02:40:09.290
pressure on your shoulder or Kimora,
which is like the other way.

2761
02:40:09.291 --> 02:40:10.910
And it's a lot of pressure on your shoulder.

2762
02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:15.690
That's probably to me hundreds of times.

2763
02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:18.450
I just don't even know how many times it's happened because I've been doing

2764
02:40:18.451 --> 02:40:23.451
Jujitsu since 1996 so it's just all those years of getting yanked on,

2765
02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:26.580
like who knows what the fuck's going on in there.
But um,

2766
02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:29.010
just having those shots,

2767
02:40:29.070 --> 02:40:32.070
just having that one shot and then Magenta keen shots as well made a big

2768
02:40:32.071 --> 02:40:34.270
difference in like the way it feels.
It feels great.
You know,

2769
02:40:34.271 --> 02:40:37.930
it's so clicking and stuff,
it makes them weird.
You also take Omega three fatty.

2770
02:40:37.970 --> 02:40:42.180
Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah,
that helps.
Sure.
Yeah.
Vitamin d seems to help too.

2771
02:40:42.181 --> 02:40:46.020
Like whenever I have anything injury or [inaudible] and vitamin D seems to have

2772
02:40:46.021 --> 02:40:48.480
some sort of an effect on how I recover too.

2773
02:40:48.930 --> 02:40:50.120
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean it,
it,</v>

2774
02:40:50.310 --> 02:40:54.150
it activates a lot of chains that are involved in wound healing and recovery,

2775
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:59.220
repairing things.
You just wrote a paper on vitamin D and what was it?
Yeah.

2776
02:40:59.221 --> 02:41:04.221
So I just had a paper published last February on how important vitamin D and the

2777
02:41:06.061 --> 02:41:09.900
marine omega three fatty acids,
EPA and Dha are in,

2778
02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:15.240
in brain health and specifically in preventing and modifying the severity of

2779
02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:22.590
neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia,
Adhd,

2780
02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:27.750
autism,
and like impulsive behavior,
impulsive behavior.

2781
02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:31.050
Yes,
really very,
very important and impulsive.
And that's in fact,

2782
02:41:31.051 --> 02:41:34.800
that's one of the main,
uh,
main things,
um,

2783
02:41:34.830 --> 02:41:38.100
that vitamin D and Omega three are important for and that's through the

2784
02:41:38.101 --> 02:41:39.030
serotonin pathway.

2785
02:41:39.250 --> 02:41:39.761
<v 0>Wow.</v>

2786
02:41:39.761 --> 02:41:44.761
So maybe perhaps I can be used to help people with gambling disorders or maybe

2787
02:41:45.130 --> 02:41:47.290
people that so risky behavior,

2788
02:41:47.310 --> 02:41:49.500
<v 1>your alcoholism,
gambling,</v>

2789
02:41:49.501 --> 02:41:51.950
I don't know how much of it's impulsive versus addiction.

2790
02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:55.560
There's probably some overlap and dopamine plays a role in that,
but you know,

2791
02:41:55.561 --> 02:41:58.980
Serotonin does affect dopamine as well.

2792
02:41:59.070 --> 02:42:01.380
<v 0>What about like sexual addictions and things like that?</v>

2793
02:42:02.010 --> 02:42:03.960
There's not like a lot of his impulse control.

2794
02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:06.560
<v 1>I've,
I've seen studies with Serotonin.</v>

2795
02:42:06.590 --> 02:42:11.590
So specifically the paper is talking about the role of these micronutrients in

2796
02:42:12.141 --> 02:42:16.020
the serotonin pathway because vitamin D increases the,

2797
02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:21.160
the gene or activates the gene that converts Tryptophan into serotonin and Omega

2798
02:42:21.261 --> 02:42:22.220
three fatty acids.

2799
02:42:22.730 --> 02:42:27.730
They prevent the inflammatory molecules that are made called e two series

2800
02:42:28.641 --> 02:42:33.260
prostaglandins which are generated by inflammation,
stress,
you know,

2801
02:42:33.261 --> 02:42:36.440
things like that generate those that get into the brain and they stopped

2802
02:42:36.441 --> 02:42:40.360
Serotonin from being released.
So,
and also the,

2803
02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:44.390
the Omega threes affect the Serotonin receptor function.
So there was there.

2804
02:42:44.510 --> 02:42:48.260
So the vitamin D and Omega threes are affecting pretty much every part of the

2805
02:42:48.261 --> 02:42:53.261
serotonin pathway and know Serotonin is very important for,

2806
02:42:53.690 --> 02:42:56.270
you know,
executive function and for impulsive behavior when they,

2807
02:42:56.300 --> 02:42:59.480
when they deplete people of Serotonin by getting rid of their,

2808
02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:00.830
by depleting trip to fan.

2809
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:04.790
So they basically suck away all their trip to found by a,

2810
02:43:04.791 --> 02:43:07.700
from getting into their brain,
by giving them this branch chain amino acids,

2811
02:43:07.701 --> 02:43:09.920
which outcompete Tryptofan from getting into the brain.

2812
02:43:10.190 --> 02:43:15.190
People become extremely impulsive and they're running red lights like bowls.

2813
02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:17.800
Like what are they trying to do?

2814
02:43:18.190 --> 02:43:22.150
They do certain tests for impulsive behavior and people just like,

2815
02:43:22.151 --> 02:43:26.480
instead of thinking like stopping and thinking about the decision they're going

2816
02:43:26.481 --> 02:43:31.060
to make,
like what the longterm effects are,
things like I did just do,
do,
do,
do,

2817
02:43:31.061 --> 02:43:33.480
do.
So they just,
you know,
go guns for as an example.

2818
02:43:33.490 --> 02:43:38.020
I've found that in my life when I've made the most impulsive like errors as

2819
02:43:38.021 --> 02:43:42.600
people when I'm exhausted,
when I worked too hard,
like working too hard for me,

2820
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:47.050
doing too much seems to be like the seems to correspond with either

2821
02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:50.500
irresponsible or impulsive behavior.
That makes sense.

2822
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:53.560
I food like eating shitty food when I'm exhausted.
Yeah,

2823
02:43:53.950 --> 02:43:57.010
that actually makes sense for multiple reasons.
But you know,

2824
02:43:57.011 --> 02:44:00.220
also when you're exhausted,
meaning you're,
you're kind of overstressed.

2825
02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:03.550
You've stretched yourself a lot.
You know,
you actually tripped,

2826
02:44:03.551 --> 02:44:07.800
a fan gets metabolized by this other pathway.
So tryptofan in your body,

2827
02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:10.430
when you eat protein,
that's Tryptophan.

2828
02:44:10.690 --> 02:44:14.710
Tryptophan can either get into the brain to make serotonin or it can be

2829
02:44:14.711 --> 02:44:17.650
converted into something that regulates the immune system.

2830
02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:21.520
And so when you're stressed or inflamed,
uh,

2831
02:44:21.521 --> 02:44:24.580
the trip defend gets sucked into that pathway.
And it doesn't get into the brain.

2832
02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:29.170
So,
and then there's also studies that have shown that like when you overwork

2833
02:44:29.171 --> 02:44:33.710
yourself,
like if you're not sleeping that affects the uh,

2834
02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.820
addictive mechanisms in the brain and Dick Addictive behavior.

2835
02:44:36.821 --> 02:44:39.640
And I don't remember exactly how cause it's been a while since I read that
study,

2836
02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:43.360
but I do remember that like not getting enough sleep,

2837
02:44:43.390 --> 02:44:47.980
which I think would happen when you're overworking yourself as well.
Um,
you know,

2838
02:44:47.981 --> 02:44:52.060
something's happening in the brain where you're more likely to engage in

2839
02:44:52.061 --> 02:44:56.680
addictive type of behavior or bad behaviors I guess.
So.
Um,

2840
02:44:57.250 --> 02:45:00.670
but yeah Saratonin totally regulates the impulsive behavior and the thing that I

2841
02:45:01.060 --> 02:45:05.440
was talking about in this paper was the interaction between people that have

2842
02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:09.490
variations in genes that are related to serotonin.
For example,

2843
02:45:09.491 --> 02:45:10.780
the serotonin transporter,

2844
02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:15.700
which is what metabolizes serotonin and after it's been released and people that

2845
02:45:15.701 --> 02:45:18.970
have these variations are that are make,

2846
02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:23.680
they basically make serotonin get metabolized quicker so you release it,
boom.

2847
02:45:23.681 --> 02:45:26.140
It's like before it can do its function,
its getting metabolized.

2848
02:45:26.141 --> 02:45:29.620
So like it's like a vacuum just getting sucked up and those people are prone to

2849
02:45:29.650 --> 02:45:32.050
depression,
impulsive behavior or things like that.

2850
02:45:32.051 --> 02:45:35.890
And my mom has that variation and I looked at her jeans and she's very prone to

2851
02:45:35.891 --> 02:45:38.470
impulsive behavior and depression.
Um,

2852
02:45:38.471 --> 02:45:43.420
and so the point that I tried to drive home in that paper was that,
you know,

2853
02:45:43.421 --> 02:45:44.560
people that have these,

2854
02:45:44.590 --> 02:45:49.590
these gene polymorphisms where there their serotonin pathway isn't working as

2855
02:45:50.021 --> 02:45:52.270
good as it could or should.

2856
02:45:52.900 --> 02:45:57.900
Those people are the most prone to vitamin D and Omega three deficiencies

2857
02:45:58.601 --> 02:46:03.550
because those micronutrients are important for various parts of the Serotonin

2858
02:46:03.551 --> 02:46:06.330
pathway that I just explained there.

2859
02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:08.900
They're the people that actually need to get the vitamin D and Omega three at

2860
02:46:08.901 --> 02:46:09.800
the most.
And in fact,

2861
02:46:09.801 --> 02:46:12.290
it turns out that most of the time those are the people that are most efficient

2862
02:46:12.291 --> 02:46:14.540
as well.
So,
you know,

2863
02:46:14.541 --> 02:46:19.541
I think that people that supplement with vitamin D and Omega three can modulate

2864
02:46:19.991 --> 02:46:24.240
the severity of some of this impulsive behavior or some of this,
uh,

2865
02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:27.380
depression or you know,
other things that are,

2866
02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:30.170
that are as a consequence of having low serotonin.

2867
02:46:30.171 --> 02:46:34.430
I think that tuning up your vitamin D and Omega three and that's been shown in

2868
02:46:34.431 --> 02:46:38.090
clinical studies,
like the mechanism for why isn't really known,

2869
02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:42.230
and I think it's through the serotonin pathway,
but you know,
people that,

2870
02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:42.951
you know,

2871
02:46:42.951 --> 02:46:47.510
kids that are taking a Omega three supplements ranging from one gram a day to

2872
02:46:47.511 --> 02:46:51.200
three grams a day,
you know,
there that have ADHD,

2873
02:46:51.201 --> 02:46:56.201
there's symptoms are improved or depression or schizophrenia.

2874
02:46:56.330 --> 02:46:59.660
These things have all been shown to help with symptoms of these disorders.

2875
02:46:59.661 --> 02:47:01.190
And Vitamin D has been shown as well.

2876
02:47:01.790 --> 02:47:05.390
And so I think there's a lot of overlap between these two and I think they both

2877
02:47:05.391 --> 02:47:10.280
would be good,
both vitamin D and Omega three.
Um,
so that's,
and that's,
and I've,

2878
02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:12.480
I've gotten people that have emailed me and told me that,
that,

2879
02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:15.770
that's helped with their depression and you know,
things like that.

2880
02:47:16.030 --> 02:47:17.750
And you never know.
It could be a placebo effect,

2881
02:47:17.751 --> 02:47:21.830
but there are studies showing that it does,
it does improve those,

2882
02:47:21.831 --> 02:47:26.510
those functions,
impulsive behavior,
um,
depression and things like that.
So,

2883
02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:28.573
so there,

2884
02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:33.730
<v 0>they're amazing.

Ferriss.
So check it out.
It's awesome.
We Geek out on that.
Um,
I also have,

2893

I'm trying to do this more often so I'm trying to,
you know,

2894
02:48:06.170 --> 02:48:09.200
basically boost up my crowdfunding which is helping me do this and I'm really

you can also find out about my podcast there.

2898
02:48:19.420 --> 02:48:23.120
I found my fitness.com as well as that new trick that I'm genetics tool I was

2899
02:48:23.121 --> 02:48:27.320
talking about.
So found my fitness.com has all information.
