00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It's one of most common traits,</v>

3
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:03.451
<v Speaker 1>much humans,</v>

4
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I have a really tough time and there are some really cool people down here,</v>

6
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>but I have a lot of trouble with LMN.</v>

7
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.090
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>

8
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>San Cisco is superior.</v>

9
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody in San Francisco has Asperger's,</v>

11
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>so they'd just say what's on their mind,</v>

12
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>whether it's appropriate or not.</v>

13
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

14
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>which is is really refreshing but can be frustrating.</v>

15
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>But the converse in la,</v>

16
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:23.731
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

17
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like Jesus,</v>

18
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>like how many layers to this onion of a person to have to peel back to know what</v>

19
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you're actually trying to say to me.</v>

20
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:29.911
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

21
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>that is a huge issue.</v>

22
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's an issue because of the entertainment industry.</v>

23
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>The entertainment industry fosters bullshit because you have to pretend to be</v>

24
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>something a unique and different.</v>

25
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile you're just another fucking person who's going to pretend to be a</v>

26
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.070
<v Speaker 1>killer in a movie or pretend to be a princess or pretend to be at.</v>

27
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>You're pretending you're faking it.</v>

28
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>So like you to be the best at it,</v>

29
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to be fake.</v>

30
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a big fake person.</v>

31
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.743
<v Speaker 1>Good at lying.</v>

32
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>It's really bananas.</v>

33
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

34
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>you start to embody this.</v>

35
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.991
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

36
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

37
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example.</v>

38
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Sean Penn is a brilliant actor.</v>

39
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>He's very good at that.</v>

40
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Most likely because Sean Penn is fucking crazy.</v>

41
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

42
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>And Chris Rock was hosting the Academy Awards once and he was making fun of Jude</v>

43
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>law about how Jude law's and everything.</v>

44
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:17.221
<v Speaker 1>What have we got?</v>

45
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:17.431
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

46
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Can I see move without Jude luck?</v>

47
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.553
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty funny.</v>

48
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.453
<v Speaker 1>It was just joking.</v>

49
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a subject because Jude law is very prolific and he's excellent.</v>

50
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>So He's used it a lot of movies.</v>

51
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>So fucking Sean Penn takes the microphone afterwards and says,</v>

52
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Jude loves and all these movies because he's an amazing actor.</v>

53
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

54
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:32.911
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

55
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to beat you to death.</v>

56
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I want to beat you to death for,</v>

57
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 1>for getting literal about a fucking Chris rock joke about a prolific actor.</v>

58
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

59
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>You fucking pretentious cock sucker.</v>

60
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Did you really say that you have friends at all?</v>

61
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you have anybody that busts your balls?</v>

62
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.981
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

63
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:57.981
<v Speaker 1>They take himself so God damn seriously and there were donkeys plus award show</v>

64
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>wherever.</v>

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.360

76
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.170

00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>we have no room for that here.</v>

89
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>We're helping the world,</v>

90
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>but providing the arts.</v>

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>You fucking Twat.</v>

94
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>We fucking like,</v>

95
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>this movie is pretty good.</v>

96
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>It plays a Mickey Cohen and this,</v>

97
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:44.041

00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>It looks like Horse Shit.</v>

100
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Sean Penn's very good at that,</v>

101
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>but most likely he's good at that because he's fucking crazy.</v>

102
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Which is why you had to explain a joke during the Academy Awards.</v>

103
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.430
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking brilliant world renounced standup comedian as the host of the</v>

104
00:02:59.431 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>award.</v>

105
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit to do a comedian make a joke.</v>

109
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I think in the same academy awards it was when Chris Rock was talking about 50</v>

110
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>cent and said this guy's had dealt with everything.</v>

111
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>He took more gunshots to the face than Jenna Jamison and they were both in the</v>

112
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.074
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

113
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Nobody got up and defended Jenna Jamison.</v>

114
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I was very offended.</v>

115
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed.</v>

116
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to say that.</v>

117
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

118
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:26.560

119
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but that's a free target.</v>

120
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I make fun of Jude Law Cause he's a brilliant actor.</v>

121
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So she's butchered laws in a lot of films cause he's a brilliant doctor.</v>

125
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>was unjust.</v>

126

<v Speaker 1>about my life and I got some thrills out of it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It drives me nuts and that is the one thing that I hate about this town and you</v>

165
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:00.761
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

166
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:05.220
<v Speaker 1>and being a person who lives in two very real worlds,</v>

167
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>the world of fighting in the world of standup comedy,</v>

168
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>being a cage fighting commentator,</v>

169
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I see the realist of the real shit.</v>

170
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Human character exposed,</v>

171
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>people cracking under pressure.</v>

172
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>People rise to the occasion.</v>

173
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I see the realist of the real shit.</v>

174
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.043
<v Speaker 1>And then comedy,</v>

175
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>nobody laughs,</v>

176
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>you're not funny.</v>

177
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:22.361
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

178
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>If your point doesn't work,</v>

179
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>they don't accept it into their mind.</v>

180
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>It has to really work and you have to be in that moment.</v>

181
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't think about something that's completely opposite and say something</v>

182
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 1>funny and have it be funny cause he won't work.</v>

183
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>There's something weird going on.</v>

184
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the words coming out of your mouth,</v>

185
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it's you thinking about those words as they come out of your mouth and people</v>

186
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>recognizing that you're in the moment,</v>

187
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>which makes it funny.</v>

188
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Those are two very real things.</v>

189
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>So when I see someone like pretentious and someone who just,</v>

190
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 1>someone who's like taking themselves way too fucking seriously or wants a lot of</v>

191
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>accolades and respect to something that's basically just,</v>

192
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're,</v>

193
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what you,</v>

194
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

195
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>you're really good at that.</v>

196
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>This guy's really good at fixing people's eyes.</v>

197
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>This guy's really good at driving cars.</v>

198
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't be an asshole.</v>

199
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.821
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple.</v>

200
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Don't take yourself too fucking seriously,</v>

201
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>cause you don't deserve any extra appreciation.</v>

202
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't deserve any extra respect.</v>

203
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 1>You don't deserve any extra attention.</v>

204
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>You deserve exactly what the fuck you've already gotten.</v>

205
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>And you should be super duper thankful for that.</v>

206
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>And anytime you want more than what you're getting,</v>

207
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you're a cunt.</v>

208
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>

209
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>If you demand respect,</v>

210
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>you're a,</v>

211
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.213
<v Speaker 1>you're a cunt.</v>

212
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>You're simply a cunt.</v>

213
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It's your problem.</v>
