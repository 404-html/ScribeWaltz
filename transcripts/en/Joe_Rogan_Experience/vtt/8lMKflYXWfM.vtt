119
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot more comedy clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more different comedians to like </v>

120
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.500
<v Speaker 1>to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of shit going on,</v>

121
00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:23.501
<v Speaker 1>a lot of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's way less action </v>

122
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:23.501
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh definitely.</v>

123
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:27.221
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot way less good guys coming up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>people coming up in general just seems </v>

124
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:27.860
<v Speaker 1>to be a smaller community.</v>

125
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.850
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

126
00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean nationwide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

127
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

128
00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:35.921
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a few places that are </v>

129
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:35.921
<v Speaker 2>really like when you go to you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

130
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.130
<v Speaker 2>this place has a good like comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

131
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Like within it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:43.580
<v Speaker 2>like I kind of felt that way and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Austin,</v>

133
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.800
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really trying to like develop </v>

134
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.270
<v Speaker 2>comics here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really feel that way in most</v>

135
00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:52.730
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most places it's just like a,</v>

136
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

137
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

138
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.750
<v Speaker 2>like the mall or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

139
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>fucking hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems a lot easier than it really is.</v>

140
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like once you get good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of becomes easy.</v>

141
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 1>You're just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand what,</v>

143
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.100
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to write a joke and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of putting in the </v>

144
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.100
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting the effort.</v>

145
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.640
<v Speaker 1>But to get to a point where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually funny is it's such a long </v>

146
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.880
<v Speaker 1>fucking process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't realize.</v>

147
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I see a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz.</v>

149
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz is a great example because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz is fucking hilarious.</v>

150
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.990
<v Speaker 1>But when I met Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz is not funny and that sounds </v>

151
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.461
<v Speaker 1>crazy because he's one of the funniest </v>
<v Speaker 1>people I've ever met in my life and he </v>

152
00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:37.451
<v Speaker 1>would say funny shit offstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could never be that funny on </v>

153
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:41.241
<v Speaker 1>stage and he could never make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somewhere along the line he just </v>

154
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He figured out how to be himself,</v>

155
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>who he is like in the parking lot at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>

156
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to be that guy on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and all of a sudden Bam.</v>

157
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he nailed it,</v>

158
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 1>knocked it out of the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's like the heart</v>

159
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 2>seem to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

160
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's super hard.</v>

161
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Like [inaudible] I made people now who </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

162
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.120
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked to them and you're like,</v>

163
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.140
<v Speaker 2>oh you're really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then it's like they're there too </v>

164
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.980
<v Speaker 2>forced and contrived on stage and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

165
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure out how to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who you are off stage just walk on.</v>

166
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy that was doing standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>or I thought was really funny,</v>

167
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.960
<v Speaker 1>but he was doing this weird thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking so fast to do take this </v>

168
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 1>breath in between his essays and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government if the government want to</v>

169
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:24.071
<v Speaker 1>do this Obama situation with gays in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>military and they and like he was going </v>

170
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:26.590
<v Speaker 1>so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he kept taking this like in,</v>

171
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 1>but it was like audible really loud like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a singer.</v>

172
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you're begged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could focus on something like </v>

173
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look for.</v>

174
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>You could forget exactly what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

175
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>He's saying it down five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

176
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.120
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

177
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I would just focus on his crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little breath thing that he does.</v>

178
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just Joey Diaz.</v>

179
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to him about it and I,</v>

180
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about it a bunch of times,</v>

181
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:54.290
<v Speaker 1>he says that what happened was he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized how to not give a fuck.</v>

182
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he said he was too concerned with </v>

183
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.750
<v Speaker 1>agents and managers and all that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was too concerned with people </v>

184
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>giving them advice and he said it took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.220
<v Speaker 1>like realizing somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just realizing that these guys were all </v>

186
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like seeing a bunch of them get fired,</v>

187
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.490
<v Speaker 1>seeing managers and agents fail </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserably and fall by the wayside and </v>

188
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.600
<v Speaker 1>executives get fired and the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hire people turn to drugs and become </v>

189
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>fucking chaos and mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he just had to realize like,</v>

190
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these aren't like intelligent.</v>

191
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>This isn't like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really like,</v>

192
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>well set up artistic environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what they want.</v>

193
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 1>They just want you to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and they can tell you all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to be squeaky clean,</v>

195
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you've got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're dirty and you destroy,</v>

196
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.420
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 1>so you've got like Katt Williams or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

198
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:46.541
<v Speaker 1>of course Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these different guys who have </v>

199
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:46.541
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kennison and dirty acts that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so hilarious that were,</v>

201
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>they were undeniable.</v>

202
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.490
<v Speaker 1>So even in the era back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was pre internet,</v>

203
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kennison days were all pre-internet,</v>

204
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>which is way harder to be dirty because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you only had hbo.</v>

205
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>That was your only outlet for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out who the fuck you were.</v>

206
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Which is scary if you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

207
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>The comparison to like what we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

208
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even then,</v>

209
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is be so good that </v>

210
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a fuck so good that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it go.</v>

211
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he figured out how to do that,</v>

212
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the longest time,</v>

213
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't do it.</v>

214
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to find a guy who gets it </v>

215
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:21.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hard.</v>

216
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>There was another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurt Metzger,</v>

217
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I worked with him in Montreal this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>

218
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very funny.</v>

219
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>He's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Funny,</v>

220
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.310
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

221
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just not enough.</v>

222
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough good guys out there </v>

223
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>and he's another guy probably awake when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw and you're like,</v>

224
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.890
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck's this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

225
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Ari had actually already told me he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

226
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>He's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

227
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>we were working this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little tiny club in Montreal.</v>

228
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

229
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 1>this theater called metropolis is like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand seats or something like that.</v>

230
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 1>And then the day before we did this </v>
<v Speaker 1>local club called the comedy works,</v>

231
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>which I used to do when I was living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston.</v>

232
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I was living in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my first road gigs.</v>

233
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I used to go up to the Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimbo owns this club in Montreal.</v>

234
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the best club ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

235
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:06.471
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking this tiny little room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only like maybe 100 people can </v>

236
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:12.111
<v Speaker 1>fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all stuffed into this place and </v>

237
00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>it's just old school man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The microphone sucks.</v>

238
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>The wall behind you.</v>

239
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Stupid fucking curtains over the windows</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind you.</v>

240
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:21.270
<v Speaker 1>And they have them covered with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>old dusty fucked up curtains.</v>

241
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best.</v>

242
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this little tight place and he</v>

243
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 1>was a headline in there this week,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Here's another comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>are you still in touch with them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will be like soldiers on the </v>

<v Speaker 1>battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.840
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got another one.</v>

256
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.230
<v Speaker 1>What people don't realize about </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians and it sounds,</v>

257
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 1>screw that we're talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and making a big deal out of it,</v>

258
00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>but there's not that many of them.</v>

259
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.380
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

260
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 1>look at the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just look at our country.</v>

261
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred million people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

262
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>How many comedians there might be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand,</v>

263
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>might be a thousand professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians at 300 million.</v>

264
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.190
<v Speaker 1>How many of them are actually funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be 300,</v>

265
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe 300 out of a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's being generous.</v>

266
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's 300 people at a $300 million.</v>

267
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.060
<v Speaker 1>That's one in a million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

268
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 1>that's bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said bananas again early.</v>

269
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.710
<v Speaker 1>I said bananas like Fifty Times last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

270
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:32.800
<v Speaker 1>And I said I wasn't gonna say it this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

271
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 1>that's my latest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

272
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Whenever anything is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go 19 sixties on myself.</v>

273
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

274
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I repeat the shit out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

275
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 1>out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say something's out of control.</v>

276
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And I say fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

277
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.160
<v Speaker 1>the problem is when you do it in a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour podcast once a week after a while,</v>

278
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 1>people like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shut the fuck up,</v>

279
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:56.871
<v Speaker 1>but the bananas are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to a guy like say the </v>

280
00:11:56.871 --> 00:11:56.871
<v Speaker 1>same words.</v>

281
00:11:56.871 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like you realize when you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this,</v>

282
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:01.440
<v Speaker 1>how important it is to vary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 1>your speech and not get locked into </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior.</v>

284
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever heard like rappers,</v>

285
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:06.800
<v Speaker 1>who y'all.</v>

286
00:12:06.801 --> 00:12:08.980
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying the Kimbo slice does.</v>

287
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every other word.</v>

288
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And I'm Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to put these things on,</v>

289
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:12.840
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

290
00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

291
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:18.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I've heard so many interviews </v>

292
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.071
<v Speaker 1>with athletes would say that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's know what I'm saying after </v>

293
00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:24.061
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's hilarious is when you hear </v>

294
00:12:24.061 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 1>comics used nigger like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rapper will use nigger.</v>

295
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:26.270
<v Speaker 1>And this Nigga tried to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

296
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Nigga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better get the fuck out my face </v>

297
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what the fuck's going on Nigga.</v>

298
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.430
<v Speaker 1>And like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say it's so many times and </v>

299
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.430
<v Speaker 1>they'll say it on stage.</v>

300
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.770
<v Speaker 1>The way guys will say it offstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.340
<v Speaker 1>there's something that gets lost when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that,</v>

302
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to recognize that like free </v>

303
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.130
<v Speaker 1>speech offstage is not good enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottled up and packaged.</v>

304
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sell it.</v>

305
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:51.661
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have a better economy of </v>

306
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:53.821
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll catch myself sometimes saying </v>

307
00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:56.071
<v Speaker 1>fuck too much on stage because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural because you do it in real life </v>

308
00:12:56.071 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 1>like this fucking guy in his stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking idea.</v>

309
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.800
<v Speaker 1>But you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

310
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

311
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 1>it fucks up the bits because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lows,</v>

312
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Speaker 1>any potential impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:09.790
<v Speaker 1>the concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You people get distracted by you saying,</v>

314
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 1>even though this is just how you express</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a natural,</v>

315
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 1>people will get distracted if you use </v>
<v Speaker 1>too many of the same words over and over</v>

316
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:17.800
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a swear like fuck,</v>

317
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you use it over and over and over </v>

318
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.090
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in like more than one sentence,</v>

319
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.480
<v Speaker 1>you could do it for one bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're just so ridiculously </v>

320
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:27.730
<v Speaker 1>upset at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you just.</v>

321
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's part of what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you have to make sure that you,</v>

322
00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:36.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a peak and a valley in your app.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make sure that once you hit </v>

323
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.141
<v Speaker 1>like all these extra fucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no fucks coming for awhile </v>

324
00:13:40.141 --> 00:13:40.141
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

325
00:13:40.141 --> 00:13:40.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>

326
00:13:40.141 --> 00:13:43.910
<v Speaker 2>then like when you do it a lot also like</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one bit,</v>

327
00:13:43.911 --> 00:13:47.540
<v Speaker 2>if you say fuck like 100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize that you're essentially,</v>

328
00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:52.430
<v Speaker 2>it's replacing other words that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>make that bit funnier.</v>

329
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's more like an ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a replacement for a,</v>

330
00:13:56.091 --> 00:13:58.330
<v Speaker 1>like this a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um ha.</v>

331
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you're just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitting that you don't have a cohesive</v>

332
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

333
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:08.210
<v Speaker 2>The other one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I used to do this all the time and </v>

334
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.731
<v Speaker 2>now I do it less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still catch myself going into it </v>

335
00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:13.520
<v Speaker 2>is saying like one of your saying a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>then going right at the end of it and </v>

336
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.700
<v Speaker 2>you don't realize you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying it,</v>

337
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.780
<v Speaker 2>but you're going because you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to basically validate what you're </v>

338
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:19.780
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

339
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.540
<v Speaker 2>like sort of subconsciously I would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sentence and be like,</v>

340
00:14:21.541 --> 00:14:22.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I walked in,</v>

341
00:14:22.981 --> 00:14:24.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was like,</v>

342
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I listen to it.</v>

343
00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds fucking like,</v>

344
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.140
<v Speaker 2>like an imposter</v>

345
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking idiot right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so important to listen </v>

346
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.200
<v Speaker 1>to your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

347
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.700
<v Speaker 1>So important to watch your stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to your stuff.</v>

348
00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:39.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's so painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people think that comedians like,</v>

349
00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:40.080
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me up there.</v>

350
00:14:40.081 --> 00:14:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm killing when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I watch my stuff,</v>

351
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.090
<v Speaker 1>even stuff that I did that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like watching it.</v>

352
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Like even talking monkey's in space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was like my best special.</v>

353
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't like watching that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

354
00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 1>It feels gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate watching man.</v>

355
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just a and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you start judging your bits and</v>

356
00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

357
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have the new tagline when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did this.</v>

358
00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you'll do a bit and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right after you come up with his bed,</v>

359
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:01.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

360
00:15:01.691 --> 00:15:06.691
<v Speaker 1>you think you've got it nailed and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on a cd and then like a week </v>

361
00:15:06.691 --> 00:15:07.790
<v Speaker 1>later you have the best fucking tagline.</v>

362
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It changes the whole bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it so much better.</v>

363
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 1>You want to like go back in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>

364
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>you want to rewind yourself and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

365
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 1>and not release it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

366
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:21.791
<v Speaker 1>I started on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already have like a few things I to </v>

367
00:15:21.791 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 1>too and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

368
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people who don't do it don't </v>

369
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:27.620
<v Speaker 1>understand how maddening that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like a lot of comics have a</v>

370
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:29.330
<v Speaker 1>hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you do your set,</v>

371
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.850
<v Speaker 1>you just want to get out of there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>move on with your life.</v>

372
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:36.851
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to like really objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go over all the beats and trying to </v>

373
00:15:36.851 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 1>figure out what you did wrong and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you did right.</v>

374
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

375
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:40.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

376
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just not as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as good.</v>

377
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.380
<v Speaker 1>You have to make sure that.</v>

378
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

379
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.770
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at your stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

380
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.850
<v Speaker 2>This is the hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't</v>

381
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:55.930
<v Speaker 1>volume meters or right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Up towards the red is like on the </v>

382
00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Austrian producer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you get it.</v>

383
00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.850
<v Speaker 1>As loud as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People still complain about this shit.</v>

384
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

385
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

386
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:05.711
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I have brian that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>records almost all my sets that's so </v>

387
00:16:05.711 --> 00:16:05.900
<v Speaker 1>huge for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's helped me so much</v>

388
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.310
<v Speaker 2>that I'm super and also like there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>little things that he does.</v>

389
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's just an all around </v>

390
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:14.370
<v Speaker 2>appraiser Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

391
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.640
<v Speaker 2>it's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always dug like the posters that you'd</v>

392
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:15.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

393
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

394
00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 2>All those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are awesome.</v>

395
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.260
<v Speaker 2>That makes those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they really know?</v>

396
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.410
<v Speaker 2>And he captured a lot of cool shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>offstage.</v>

397
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome man.</v>

398
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the best things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet is being able to connect </v>

399
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.570
<v Speaker 1>with people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Weirdo fucking creative people,</v>

400
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:36.170
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in Brian's case he brought up </v>

401
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.170
<v Speaker 1>working for me.</v>

402
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think like of all like the </v>

403
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.620
<v Speaker 2>working like big name comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably on top of it the most,</v>

404
00:16:40.621 --> 00:16:41.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like media,</v>

405
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.410
<v Speaker 2>like Internet stuff,</v>

406
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.250
<v Speaker 1>cooks probably better at it than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

407
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:52.450
<v Speaker 1>the whole like twitter shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason why I even got into that </v>

408
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:52.450
<v Speaker 1>is because I saw what it was doing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

409
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact for like I was feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>people compare,</v>

410
00:16:55.361 --> 00:16:58.790
<v Speaker 1>like try to compare him to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians with shady,</v>

411
00:16:58.791 --> 00:17:00.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reputations,</v>

412
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say Dan has done a lot more for comedy</v>

413
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:07.210
<v Speaker 1>then like I was like by a long shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's,</v>

414
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>he's like opened up people's eyes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you could do yourself.</v>

415
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because before that,</v>

416
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:17.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is none of us are the type </v>

417
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:17.430
<v Speaker 1>of guys that are going to be self </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoters.</v>

418
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Like comics are not self promoters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not normal.</v>

419
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.150
<v Speaker 1>He's an aberration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dane Cook is an unnatural thing,</v>

420
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:23.690
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

421
00:17:23.691 --> 00:17:28.691
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's an unnatural thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it goes contrary to what I was </v>

422
00:17:28.691 --> 00:17:28.691
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

423
00:17:28.691 --> 00:17:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I was doing the sit Rosenthal show on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the radio before I did this and we were </v>

424
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.651
<v Speaker 1>talking about like he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rank yourself amongst comedians and </v>

425
00:17:35.651 --> 00:17:39.280
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the last thing you ever want to </v>

426
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:39.280
<v Speaker 1>think about is where do I stand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

427
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>is this guy better than me or that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than me?</v>

428
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to judge yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to just try to concentrate</v>

429
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:48.970
<v Speaker 1>all your energy on doing the best shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing you want to concentrate </v>

430
00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>on is pumping up your own ego and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

431
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 1>just or even judging yourself at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>would judge the material.</v>

432
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Go over the material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>

433
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.920
<v Speaker 1>try to make it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but always be focused on that.</v>

434
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Like the like putting out the best shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're focused on.</v>

435
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Not like where you fit in with everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

436
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like an an enemy.</v>

437
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.410
<v Speaker 1>That's like the enemy of creativity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of ego shit.</v>

438
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 1>When you get involved.</v>

439
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:17.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's also like the one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I always feel like the one thing </v>

441
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.970
<v Speaker 2>you can control like for sure is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're writing and doing.</v>

442
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:25.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you really can't control the other </v>

443
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.851
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if somebody wanted to put you on </v>

444
00:18:27.851 --> 00:18:27.851
<v Speaker 2>the 10 best list of comics,</v>

445
00:18:27.851 --> 00:18:32.390
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or like the tendons right before you </v>

446
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.390
<v Speaker 4>that you hate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you hate,</v>

447
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.290
<v Speaker 4>like you think he sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's out of your control.</v>

448
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.700
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's absurd to even like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw,</v>

449
00:18:36.701 --> 00:18:40.870
<v Speaker 2>I just saw a list of the 10 comics to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch and it was like,</v>

450
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.190
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

451
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all subjective but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

452
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.400
<v Speaker 2>this is absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some of it was cool and so it was </v>

453
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:49.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is this?</v>

454
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Why are they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that one.</v>

455
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

456
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.680
<v Speaker 1>it's doing something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they,</v>

457
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's always got to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>

458
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking seven comments you want to </v>

459
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.031
<v Speaker 1>look out for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does do something on someone </v>

460
00:19:01.031 --> 00:19:01.031
<v Speaker 1>you think is funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

461
00:19:01.031 --> 00:19:03.470
<v Speaker 1>this whole like what's the best bands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bands that you like,</v>

462
00:19:03.471 --> 00:19:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably think fucking suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

463
00:19:05.481 --> 00:19:07.550
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of shit that I liked </v>

<v Speaker 1>So by that standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sock is pornographic.</v>

583
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Then my stomach is really pornographic.</v>

588
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that we're still living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this childish world.</v>

589
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:47.891
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to pretend that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>masturbate and if you're admitting the </v>

590
00:25:47.891 --> 00:25:47.891
<v Speaker 1>cms rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we all should,</v>

591
00:25:47.891 --> 00:25:51.190
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing fucking wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is way better than jerking off.</v>

592
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Can I see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

596
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

597
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:00.220
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not this one.</v>

598
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Not that I wouldn't do that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks man.</v>

599
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really soft.</v>

600
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>

601
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:10.770
<v Speaker 1>They have some sort of special patent on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the vagina and butthole rubber is </v>

602
00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:11.450
<v Speaker 1>made out of.</v>

603
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like some special fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great,</v>

604
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:16.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's outstanding.</v>

605
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.620
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 times better than beating off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not joking.</v>

606
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

607
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:21.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being a sell out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

608
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:26.350
<v Speaker 1>don't buy if you don't want to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that should go out and </v>

609
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.350
<v Speaker 1>buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

610
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.051
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that you'd probably need your </v>

611
00:26:29.051 --> 00:26:31.091
<v Speaker 1>life more than you need a rubber vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're in the market from rubber </v>

612
00:26:31.091 --> 00:26:32.690
<v Speaker 1>vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking highly recommended.</v>

613
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 1>If you're the type of dude who jerks off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we all,</v>

614
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>especially if you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't say like a daily thing to </v>

615
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's way better.</v>

616
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even,</v>

617
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.840
<v Speaker 1>without getting too graphic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even describe how much better it</v>

618
00:26:44.841 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm saying is lazy checks.</v>

619
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to pick up your </v>

620
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:53.300
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

621
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:53.300
<v Speaker 1>This is just the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

622
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Once they figured out this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they figured out that the most </v>

623
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.921
<v Speaker 1>difficult part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured out a way to master an </v>

624
00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:00.921
<v Speaker 1>artificial vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

625
00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 1>they mastered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fantastic.</v>

626
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting you.</v>

627
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not like some hard rubber thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a pleasant.</v>

628
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.440
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will sample one and we will get you </v>

629
00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 1>one and we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

630
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.570
<v Speaker 1>we'll get him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One will have a Chris from a fleshlight </v>

631
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 1>send one over to Tommy and Tommy will </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back on the broadcast in the future</v>

632
00:27:20.161 --> 00:27:22.470
<v Speaker 1>after he's fucked it up and it'll tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>us all about it.</v>

633
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

634
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

635
00:27:25.021 --> 00:27:26.820
<v Speaker 1>for the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was Chris,</v>

636
00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:31.821
<v Speaker 1>the guy who worked for the company was </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing it to me for the longest </v>

637
00:27:31.821 --> 00:27:35.301
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women always have vibrators and dildos </v>

638
00:27:35.301 --> 00:27:35.301
<v Speaker 1>and this and that and rabbits and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

639
00:27:35.301 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 1>the fucking Sybian no one ever had </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that for dudes.</v>

640
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.120
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

641
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

642
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:44.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're some kind of a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>loser if you go and buy any of that shit</v>

643
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:49.641
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those dudes who goes </v>

644
00:27:49.641 --> 00:27:51.471
<v Speaker 1>out and buys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rubber rubber pussy to fuck at </v>

645
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.740
<v Speaker 1>some sex shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

646
00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:00.140
<v Speaker 1>most guys are never gonna get past the </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassment of walking through those </v>

647
00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.460
<v Speaker 1>beads in a sex shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrifying.</v>

648
00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And trying out all the different rubber </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussies,</v>

649
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even know which ones for you,</v>

650
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:07.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

651
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:10.920
<v Speaker 1>this one vibrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really want your Dick to vibrate?</v>

652
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:11.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>

653
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:12.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>

654
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:14.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking a shaver.</v>

655
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

656
00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want it to vibrate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

657
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.460
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to like either that or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to go get what?</v>

658
00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:23.070
<v Speaker 1>A magazine that reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

659
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:26.400
<v Speaker 1>my name is Harry and I fucked everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is what I think,</v>

660
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking.</v>

661
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.840
<v Speaker 1>It was difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of the Internet now all you </v>

662
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.360
<v Speaker 1>have to do is you'd go to fleshlight.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever and you order it,</v>

663
00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:34.550
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

664
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 1>It makes total sense actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

665
00:28:36.151 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 1>is it easy to clean up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

666
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.940
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this thing is getting me off of </v>

667
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

668
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.040
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

669
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

670
00:28:47.591 --> 00:28:49.230
<v Speaker 1>it's super easy to clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

671
00:28:49.231 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you unscrewed the top,</v>

672
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you put it in the foss and cleans it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

673
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing.</v>

674
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like a total loser and once you</v>

675
00:28:57.001 --> 00:29:00.150
<v Speaker 1>just shot a load and post you never feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a winner.</v>

676
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.970
<v Speaker 1>But that's but actually goes along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all masturbation.</v>

677
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like a loser when my load </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting.</v>

678
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.020
<v Speaker 1>The whole joke about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole bit about no matter what,</v>

679
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.170
<v Speaker 1>like when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like relevance,</v>

680
00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.950
<v Speaker 1>no matter who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a loser.</v>

681
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You can be Michael Jordan when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sitting there with a load in your </v>

682
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.681
<v Speaker 1>stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that heavy breathing kind of </v>

683
00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:21.681
<v Speaker 1>comes to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

684
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I always say that I feel the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>after I jerk off as well as what I,</v>

685
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:31.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I play xbox for like nine hours in </v>

686
00:29:31.101 --> 00:29:31.101
<v Speaker 1>a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that same feeling,</v>

687

<v Speaker 1>morning and you have to go to bed and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you struggle with that big time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's definitely probably so hard when </v>

697
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.950
<v Speaker 1>no one's telling you what time you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get up.</v>

698
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:57.181
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard not to just get up at noon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just beat off all over yourself and go </v>

699
00:29:57.181 --> 00:29:57.181
<v Speaker 1>right back.</v>

700
00:29:57.181 --> 00:30:01.100
<v Speaker 2>You're describing like the last few </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of my life and I'm with that.</v>

701
00:30:01.101 --> 00:30:03.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm like that with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I like to.</v>

702
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.560
<v Speaker 2>It's all about like sleeping in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jerking off,</v>

703
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.400
<v Speaker 2>eating good food and anything that feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

704
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised I don't have needles in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>arms sometimes.</v>

705
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:18.260
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I were on the road once and we </v>

706
00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.040
<v Speaker 1>decided to get krispy Kreme donuts at </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 1:00</v>

707
00:30:19.041 --> 00:30:21.510
<v Speaker 1>in the morning we went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck was that man?</v>

708
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Was that Tampa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

709
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

710
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:24.620
<v Speaker 1>if it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

711
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Well it wasn't crispy cream though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

712
00:30:26.271 --> 00:30:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Or was it Krispy Kreme?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was or maybe it wasn't.</v>

713
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.920
<v Speaker 1>It was some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some awesome donuts.</v>

714
00:30:30.921 --> 00:30:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But dude,</v>

715
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:36.740
<v Speaker 1>we attack those bitches and we both knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we really shouldn't be doing it.</v>

716
00:30:36.741 --> 00:30:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And you had to slip like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

717
00:30:37.881 --> 00:30:38.540
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

718
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It was just like as if I asked you to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>go do some crank with me.</v>

719
00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fuck it.</v>

720
00:30:43.701 --> 00:30:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's go ahead,</v>

721
00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.130
<v Speaker 2>but then I'm most like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if somebody gives me permission,</v>

722
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:52.470
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of like going through life </v>

723
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.470
<v Speaker 2>waiting for somebody to give me </v>
<v Speaker 2>permission.</v>

724
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.550
<v Speaker 2>If somebody is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to do this because I'm going</v>

725
00:30:56.551 --> 00:30:57.600
<v Speaker 2>to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I go,</v>

726
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:58.620
<v Speaker 2>I have no control.</v>

727
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that man?</v>

728
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 1>What is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedians that just like I'm looking for</v>

729
00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 1>any excuse to do the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what feels good.</v>

730
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.270
<v Speaker 1>What feels good to do the wrong shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because what?</v>

731
00:31:10.271 --> 00:31:15.271
<v Speaker 1>Because what makes you become a comedian</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're resisting everything that </v>

732
00:31:15.271 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 1>everybody else wants you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're resisting resisting,</v>

733
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 1>being polite because you're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>route shit,</v>

734
00:31:19.571 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 1>which is why you're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that roots shit to get the</v>

735
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:24.430
<v Speaker 1>laughs from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're disturbing.</v>

736
00:31:24.431 --> 00:31:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Everybody know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

737
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.580
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're resisting.</v>

738
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Like the way to become good and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>become funny is to be the guy that's </v>

739
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.001
<v Speaker 1>willing to say that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why so many people say </v>

740
00:31:36.001 --> 00:31:36.001
<v Speaker 1>about comedians like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

741
00:31:36.001 --> 00:31:36.120
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

742
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.980
<v Speaker 1>You say shit that I think about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

743
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.420
<v Speaker 1>but I never have the guts to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

744
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:42.090
<v Speaker 1>how many times do people say it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely about,</v>

745
00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 1>especially if you nail some current </v>
<v Speaker 1>events issue they do.</v>

746
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.480
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't have the balls to say that,</v>

747
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:52.270
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that willingness to say shit that's like</v>

748
00:31:52.271 --> 00:31:55.180
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate or that other people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>think was offensive.</v>

749
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.760
<v Speaker 1>That's like what makes you a comic in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place?</v>

750
00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

751
00:31:58.601 --> 00:32:03.601
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all like a part of your whole </v>

752
00:32:03.601 --> 00:32:03.601
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

753
00:32:03.601 --> 00:32:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you want to your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like we're designed to like </v>

754
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.500
<v Speaker 1>not fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were designed to like just step away </v>

755
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.131
<v Speaker 1>from all of it and poke fun at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes it so hard to fucking get </v>

756
00:32:14.131 --> 00:32:14.131
<v Speaker 1>your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

757
00:32:14.131 --> 00:32:16.570
<v Speaker 1>it does man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so hard to be disciplined and to</v>

758
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.340
<v Speaker 1>just show up for anything on time.</v>

759
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.520
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to have like you have </v>

760
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:23.520
<v Speaker 2>discipline though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

761
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean as a,</v>

762
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>I have some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the best at it.</v>

763
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forced myself to do certain things </v>

764
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.970
<v Speaker 1>because I know that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with my body,</v>

765
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm a naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

766
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.370
<v Speaker 1>like I have a lot of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

767
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.870
<v Speaker 1>and I have a lot of aggressive energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

768
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 1>my whole life I've been doing martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts since I was a child,</v>

769
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.150
<v Speaker 1>so it's like literally there's</v>

770
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 6>been no time or I haven't done it that </v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

771
00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:45.010
<v Speaker 6>whether it's kickboxing or Jujitsu or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

772
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:50.020
<v Speaker 6>there's that explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like expenditure of energy has always </v>

773
00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.561
<v Speaker 6>been a part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if I take time off and I don't do it </v>

774
00:32:53.561 --> 00:32:54.020
<v Speaker 6>for like three or four days or something</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that,</v>

775
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 6>I started getting really antsy and I get</v>
<v Speaker 6>this buildup and I just fucking,</v>

776
00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just want to get it out and I get </v>

777
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:03.620
<v Speaker 6>annoyed and traffic and I snap at people</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I shouldn't be snapping.</v>

778
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.690
<v Speaker 6>I get upset about things that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't get upset at,</v>

779
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when I'm not doing that,</v>

780
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.540
<v Speaker 6>when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I'm training all the time and I'm,</v>

781
00:33:10.541 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm even down just so mellow.</v>

782
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 6>It's like I feel like I can be me now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go enjoy life more.</v>

783
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:22.091
<v Speaker 6>I feel like there's less stress in my </v>
<v Speaker 6>body so I can interpret the outside </v>

784
00:33:22.091 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 6>stress way better.</v>

785
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 6>So it's almost like dictated by your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by your,</v>

786
00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.890
<v Speaker 6>the way you operate to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

787
00:33:27.891 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's also,</v>

788
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:33.821
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way my mind developed to growing up </v>

789
00:33:33.821 --> 00:33:36.701
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we moved a lot around a lot and I don't </v>

790
00:33:36.701 --> 00:33:36.701
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my dad,</v>

791
00:33:36.701 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 6>I haven't talked to him since I was six </v>
<v Speaker 6>years old or seven.</v>

792
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:42.630
<v Speaker 6>I haven't seen him since I was six.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't talked to him since I was </v>

793
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.831
<v Speaker 6>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I was raised by my stepfather and we </v>

794
00:33:44.831 --> 00:33:44.831
<v Speaker 6>moved around a lot so I always had to </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

795
00:33:44.831 --> 00:33:47.930
<v Speaker 6>like fight against a lot of kids in </v>
<v Speaker 6>different neighborhoods.</v>

796
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:49.880
<v Speaker 6>There's always a lot of bullshit that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>had to fight against.</v>

797
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:54.881
<v Speaker 6>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my instincts are always to resist all </v>

798
00:33:54.881 --> 00:33:58.151
<v Speaker 6>the shit that's going on because people </v>
<v Speaker 6>are just going to say stupid shit and </v>

799
00:33:58.151 --> 00:33:58.151
<v Speaker 6>get you in bad situations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

800
00:33:58.151 --> 00:33:59.090
<v Speaker 6>so I grew up with that.</v>

801
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.310
<v Speaker 6>And then the physical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like fighting thing.</v>

802
00:34:01.311 --> 00:34:04.010
<v Speaker 6>So it's all was resisting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything's resisting,</v>

803
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:05.390
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

804
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:10.010
<v Speaker 6>terrible because then you resist your </v>
<v Speaker 6>own direction and your own ideas and you</v>

805
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:11.210
<v Speaker 6>can have like a plan like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

806
00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to take care of my body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to,</v>

807
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:18.251
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eat certain foods because they're </v>

808
00:34:18.251 --> 00:34:18.251
<v Speaker 6>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to work out,</v>

809
00:34:18.251 --> 00:34:21.971
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a certain time every day because </v>

810
00:34:21.971 --> 00:34:23.741
<v Speaker 6>that's what I really need to get done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to start writing material </v>

811
00:34:23.741 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Speaker 6>every day even though it's for you and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a good thing and you'll enjoy every</v>

812
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:30.401
<v Speaker 6>single moment of all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You still resist doing it because it's </v>

813
00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:33.881
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a plan and anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>a plan is like all the other stupid </v>

814
00:34:33.881 --> 00:34:33.881
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

815
00:34:33.881 --> 00:34:33.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

816
00:34:33.881 --> 00:34:34.230
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

817
00:34:34.231 --> 00:34:39.231
<v Speaker 2>And that's Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think every comic has that resistance </v>

818
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:43.920
<v Speaker 2>to for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is how this is the status quo,</v>

819
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.170
<v Speaker 6>a big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

820
00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:46.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

821
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.940
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of like why you're a standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>

822
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:49.800
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

823
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:55.130
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because like the resistance </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you a comic and at the same time </v>

824
00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.370
<v Speaker 2>to a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're resistant to too much,</v>

825
00:34:56.371 --> 00:34:58.140
<v Speaker 2>it will hold you back from doing well.</v>

826
00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that comedy,</v>

827
00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:04.260
<v Speaker 6>but you have to realize somewhere along </v>
<v Speaker 6>the line that the reason why you got </v>

828
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.011
<v Speaker 6>into comedy is probably a bad reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And for most of us it's like we want an </v>

829
00:35:08.011 --> 00:35:10.500
<v Speaker 6>unnecessary amount of adulation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We want an,</v>

830
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:11.620
<v Speaker 6>an,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

831
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.920
<v Speaker 6>we want more attention than the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people do because we feel like we didn't</v>

832
00:35:14.921 --> 00:35:16.070
<v Speaker 6>get it when we were young.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

833
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.960
<v Speaker 6>Crazy buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then somewhere along the line your </v>

834
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.661
<v Speaker 6>motivation has to switch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to kind of understand what it </v>

835
00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:24.661
<v Speaker 6>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

836
00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:28.650
<v Speaker 6>the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I always say about it is like at a </v>

837
00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:30.451
<v Speaker 6>certain point in time there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's got to be a transition in your </v>

838
00:35:30.451 --> 00:35:34.081
<v Speaker 6>life as a comedian where you start doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>it for the work and for the art and for </v>

839
00:35:34.081 --> 00:35:38.641
<v Speaker 6>the creation of something that joy and </v>
<v Speaker 6>making something that people enjoy </v>

840
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:38.641
<v Speaker 6>instead of</v>

841
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:43.610
<v Speaker 1>doing it so that people will like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it so that you can get all this </v>

842
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.160
<v Speaker 1>attention and adulation on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

843
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 1>because that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you won the beginning,</v>

844
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you just want to be the fucking man and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to get out there,</v>

845
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.460
<v Speaker 2>kill you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want approval?</v>

846
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:56.090
<v Speaker 2>We want people to be like your great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you have a great set and </v>

847
00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 2>people tell you stuff and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>how validating it was,</v>

848
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.970
<v Speaker 2>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you realize how desperate you were.</v>

849
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you feel so good,</v>

850
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.070
<v Speaker 2>like you're so valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so happy by that,</v>

851
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 2>that great show early on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just like,</v>

852
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 2>how bad did I need that rubbing that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking need people to be like,</v>

853
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the.</v>

854
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.430
<v Speaker 2>You're so amazing.</v>

855
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.520
<v Speaker 1>It's weird though because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing that really creates comedy </v>

856
00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:28.361
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you probably are not going to </v>

857
00:36:28.361 --> 00:36:28.361
<v Speaker 1>be motivated enough to go through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

858
00:36:28.361 --> 00:36:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

859
00:36:28.941 --> 00:36:30.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because how brutal the beginning.</v>

860
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.440
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awful,</v>

861
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:37.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't know how painful it is to </v>

862
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.401
<v Speaker 1>Obama on stage and how deserving it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you fucking deserved a bomb when </v>

863
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.820
<v Speaker 1>you know you really do deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're bombing,</v>

864
00:36:43.821 --> 00:36:48.821
<v Speaker 1>it's because you fucking really do suck </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're supposed to fill that shitty </v>

865
00:36:48.821 --> 00:36:49.700
<v Speaker 1>because you're not supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding attention.</v>

866
00:36:49.701 --> 00:36:52.820
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to be with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone with an amplified voice.</v>

867
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You're not hearing opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that interesting.</v>

868
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:58.610
<v Speaker 1>And all these people hear that and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just drives me fucking nuts,</v>

869
00:36:58.611 --> 00:37:00.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not well thought out you.</v>

870
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.910
<v Speaker 1>You haven't lived that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably if you started young enough,</v>

871
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that much experience.</v>

872
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

873
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Fucking 21 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you're smart,</v>

874
00:37:09.111 --> 00:37:10.020
<v Speaker 1>but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

875
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.080
<v Speaker 1>because like when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like being your age now.</v>

876
00:37:12.081 --> 00:37:13.610
<v Speaker 1>When you look back at yourself 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

877
00:37:13.611 --> 00:37:14.480
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking idiot.</v>

878
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything worse than 21 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids that think they have the fucking </v>

879
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.740
<v Speaker 1>political system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wired talk about politics on stage.</v>

880
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the worst man.</v>

881
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.790
<v Speaker 1>It really tears you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so silly.</v>

882
00:37:25.791 --> 00:37:30.791
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's one thing if they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid point or a silly point or </v>

883
00:37:30.791 --> 00:37:34.631
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they start telling you what's </v>

884
00:37:34.631 --> 00:37:36.020
<v Speaker 1>wrong with Republicans and the Democrats</v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to do this,</v>

885
00:37:36.021 --> 00:37:41.021
<v Speaker 1>but the Republicans are trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they're stopping them and </v>

886
00:37:41.021 --> 00:37:41.021
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you fucking what?</v>

887
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

888
00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.260
<v Speaker 1>it's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like I'm at a loss for words</v>

889
00:37:45.261 --> 00:37:48.170
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You asked me fucking old ass shit for me</v>

890
00:37:48.171 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 1>to take you serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to politics,</v>

891
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:55.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to know that you've been paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to this at least at least </v>

892
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:58.040
<v Speaker 1>abstractly for fucking decades because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be old</v>

893
00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.910
<v Speaker 2>in order to get to have even a somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective,</v>

894
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:05.960
<v Speaker 2>like unemotional opinion about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young people just go like,</v>

895
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.160
<v Speaker 2>this is fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

896
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not looking at it for what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

897
00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:14.740
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at it from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore bias towards one side or the </v>

898
00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.971
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not telling you what really is </v>

899
00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:18.971
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just like,</v>

900
00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I really disagree with what the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are doing.</v>

901
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your.</v>

902
00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:21.710
<v Speaker 2>That's just your fucking opinion.</v>

903
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys hear that water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that water annoying?</v>

904
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Rogan's running the fucking hose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially low red podcast situation.</v>

905
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Although let me tell her to stop taking.</v>

906
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy talked about your childhood.</v>

907
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.610
<v Speaker 2>My childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really bad.</v>

908
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 2>That was beaten and hit a lot and I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of drugs.</v>

909
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Stick to the script.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

910
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.480
<v Speaker 2>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

911
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:55.420
<v Speaker 2>That was quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

912
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:56.070
<v Speaker 2>no water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do</v>

913
00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:01.100
<v Speaker 1>near the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was water going on in the </v>

914
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.831
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from my days working on fear </v>

915
00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:06.240
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always have to check for sound issues</v>

916
00:39:06.241 --> 00:39:11.241
<v Speaker 1>in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like occasionally it'll be planes with </v>

917
00:39:11.241 --> 00:39:13.290
<v Speaker 1>flowers have to stop filming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear that sound that it starts to </v>

918
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.340
<v Speaker 1>distract the shit out of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how I run my house folks when</v>

919
00:39:14.341 --> 00:39:19.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking iron fist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right when I'm doing a podcast will be </v>

920
00:39:19.341 --> 00:39:19.341
<v Speaker 1>no watering the plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

921
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're talking about needy,</v>

922
00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.380
<v Speaker 1>being needy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a comedian.</v>

923
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.560
<v Speaker 1>The worst is when people don't recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they don't change and they keep</v>

924
00:39:27.601 --> 00:39:30.570
<v Speaker 1>that goofy fucking ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like into their thirties and forties,</v>

925
00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're still trying to be the </v>

926
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 1>fucking man.</v>

927
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:36.320

<v Speaker 2>like what I call the Rah Rah comics.</v>

929
00:39:39.451 --> 00:39:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have like a fake enthusiasm.</v>

930
00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

931
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.660

<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

947

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

948
00:40:20.481 --> 00:40:25.481
<v Speaker 2>you're running for office up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in his mind he is a brilliant </v>

949
00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:26.350
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

950
00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.800
<v Speaker 2>that's for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the most pain</v>

951
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.080
<v Speaker 1>once in the dude actually said this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience,</v>

952
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:34.540
<v Speaker 1>he said something stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something political.</v>

953
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And then he paused and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that usually gets an applause break.</v>

954
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.920
<v Speaker 1>He actually said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

955
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine even thinking that </v>

956
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.411
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like thinking like why are you not </v>

957
00:40:49.411 --> 00:40:49.411
<v Speaker 1>giving me my claps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I deserved claps.</v>

958
00:40:49.411 --> 00:40:50.830
<v Speaker 1>This is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to agree on this point.</v>

959
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.480
<v Speaker 1>We should all agree on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

960
00:40:52.481 --> 00:40:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pause,</v>

961
00:40:54.021 --> 00:40:57.070
<v Speaker 1>breaks have to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't expect them.</v>

962
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be the look and forum.</v>

963
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.130
<v Speaker 1>That's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

964
00:41:01.131 --> 00:41:01.390
<v Speaker 1>if it</v>

965
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.190
<v Speaker 2>ones that like I have gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are never ever like,</v>

966
00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:08.020
<v Speaker 2>did you think they were going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

967
00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 2>it's always like just a natural thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

968
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.560
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

969
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that's the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or that's the point of view that gets an</v>

970
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:20.641
<v Speaker 2>applause break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy that somebody like </v>

971
00:41:20.641 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 2>crafting them that craft and applause.</v>

972
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.130
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine when I was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was covered up,</v>

973
00:41:25.131 --> 00:41:27.920
<v Speaker 1>he used to say when people start </v>
<v Speaker 1>clapping,</v>

974
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.750
<v Speaker 1>you got to pause and just hold it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll keep clapping and a lot of times</v>

975
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 1>you'll get an applause</v>

976
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 4>break when you wouldn't have gotten one </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's holding the fuck.</v>

977
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Is that better for them because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>all in there together.</v>

978
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:42.140
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

979
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.860
<v Speaker 2>You'll see to the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

980
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:47.080
<v Speaker 2>the mugging for like when the punchlines</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that good.</v>

981
00:41:47.081 --> 00:41:52.081
<v Speaker 2>And then some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some comics will like say the punchline </v>

982
00:41:52.081 --> 00:41:55.920
<v Speaker 2>and then the crowd is like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing and then they'll give them the </v>

983
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:55.920
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

984
00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.780
<v Speaker 2>like their cause and a smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's where it was and see if </v>

985
00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.841
<v Speaker 2>they'll come along for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or the worst is like set is over and </v>

986
00:42:03.841 --> 00:42:06.190
<v Speaker 2>you'll see somebody kind of like force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm done.</v>

987
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Like let's force how much you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to respond at the end of my set.</v>

988
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:12.060
<v Speaker 2>And those kinds of stand there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the crowdfunding.</v>

989
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen a guy asked for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing ovation?</v>

990
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.190
<v Speaker 1>It was the funniest shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

991
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:23.080
<v Speaker 1>That's so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen guys like the stage to go.</v>

992
00:42:23.081 --> 00:42:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen last night I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>show wasn't even as good as this.</v>

993
00:42:26.021 --> 00:42:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I got a standing ovation so I don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how.</v>

994
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.980
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is this guy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like one of those singing </v>

995
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:37.400
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go up and sing songs.</v>

996
00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:39.740
<v Speaker 1>He would pretend he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

997
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even like really funny.</v>

998
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could sound like those guys.</v>

999
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last night I was like a silly thing to </v>

1000
00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:49.680
<v Speaker 1>worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1001
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.380
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1002
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:53.150
<v Speaker 1>why do you care about fake enthusiasm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1003
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:58.230
<v Speaker 1>why do you care about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why you care about that is </v>

1004
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:00.461
<v Speaker 1>because you realize that someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating on a level that only works </v>

1005
00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:03.500
<v Speaker 1>against someone who doesn't know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a trick,</v>

1006
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:06.470
<v Speaker 1>but to everybody else who does it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>

1007
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.950
<v Speaker 1>The only time it gets us is someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1008
00:43:09.951 --> 00:43:12.380
<v Speaker 1>really knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trick is it's got to be real.</v>

1009
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.740
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a real genuine thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this guy has.</v>

1010
00:43:15.741 --> 00:43:19.280
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny and well put together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it'll get us.</v>

1011
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:24.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's like when we see like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience laugh at something that's not </v>

1012
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:24.920
<v Speaker 1>funny to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's almost like insulting.</v>

1013
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1014
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.160
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1015
00:43:27.161 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 2>you fuck you trying to get me to laugh </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1016
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1017
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.630
<v Speaker 2>you know that it's a trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you can sense,</v>

1018
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he just did was he just,</v>

1019
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just waves his hands like that,</v>

1020
00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that it wasn't like genuine.</v>

1021
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing is that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1022
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.370
<v Speaker 2>when you do it long enough and you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>it long enough,</v>

1023
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:48.670
<v Speaker 2>you can tell when it's genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's really like somebody's point </v>

1024
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.670
<v Speaker 2>of view.</v>

1025
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.670
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1026
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:52.980
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirdest things about Tommy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is Tommy is actually married to a </v>

1027
00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.821
<v Speaker 1>comedian and she's fucking really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw her for the first time.</v>

1028
00:43:56.861 --> 00:43:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Was it like last Thursday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your wife's name again?</v>

1029
00:43:58.631 --> 00:43:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Christina [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jetski.</v>

1030
00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't keep Tommy [inaudible] name.</v>

1031
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's wearing the pants in the house?</v>

1032
00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me know.</v>

1033
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:12.740
<v Speaker 1>She name her last name is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last name is completely absurd to try </v>

1034
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.740
<v Speaker 1>and keep that stupid shit.</v>

1035
00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:17.800
<v Speaker 2>She's been doing standup for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.080
<v Speaker 1>eight years or something like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to lose that fucking giant.</v>

1037
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.930
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's her fucking list of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny.</v>

1038
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.340
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's what's been holding her </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

1039
00:44:26.341 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that amazing?</v>

1040
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1041
00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I've been to and I took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a really fucking hold her down,</v>

1042
00:44:30.511 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 2>like to check to get even</v>

1044
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:37.040
<v Speaker 1>all this because she was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of work.</v>

1045
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like</v>

1046
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.220
<v Speaker 2>fucking changed.</v>

1047
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1048
00:44:42.441 --> 00:44:45.620
<v Speaker 1>you bitch and no hype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that shit.</v>

1049
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.970
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weak.</v>

1050
00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I know a dude who was a comic in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York and he did the hyphen thing and he </v>

1051
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:53.870
<v Speaker 1>took her name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last ads,</v>

1052
00:44:53.871 --> 00:44:56.180
<v Speaker 1>fucking unforgivably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a comic.</v>

1053
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:59.030
<v Speaker 1>That's not just a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unestablished comic.</v>

1054
00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a guy who had a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>following.</v>

1055
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1056
00:45:02.691 --> 00:45:07.691
<v Speaker 1>You had a good following.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had done a bunch of TV shows he had </v>

1057
00:45:07.691 --> 00:45:08.660
<v Speaker 1>done like the evening at the Improv sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of circuit.</v>

1058
00:45:08.661 --> 00:45:10.820
<v Speaker 1>He could headline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would headline and clubs around town.</v>

1059
00:45:10.821 --> 00:45:15.821
<v Speaker 1>So he had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had like a real reputation of </v>

1060
00:45:15.821 --> 00:45:16.760
<v Speaker 1>following and this fucking guy took his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife's name last.</v>

1061
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:20.000
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the death of him,</v>

1062
00:45:20.001 --> 00:45:21.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

1063
00:45:21.061 --> 00:45:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Eventually she wanted to break it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and that was the death.</v>

1064
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:28.990
<v Speaker 1>It was even weirder still because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy used to get on stage and proclaimed </v>

1065
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:30.470
<v Speaker 1>himself to be a feminist.</v>

1066
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.400
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is ridiculous for women.</v>

1067
00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

1068
00:45:35.571 --> 00:45:40.160
<v Speaker 1>it's just as ridiculous to like be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>all into being an American,</v>

1069
00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in America for sure is the best </v>

1070
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But guess what?</v>

1071
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Douche bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.490
<v Speaker 1>you were born here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1073
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you didn't do anything to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country's awesome.</v>

1074
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1075
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.980
<v Speaker 1>what'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you do to make this the best,</v>

1076
00:45:51.981 --> 00:45:52.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

1077
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:54.710
<v Speaker 1>were you a part of the declaration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence?</v>

1078
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1079
00:45:55.850 --> 00:46:00.850
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're proud of being born a certain </v>

1080
00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:00.850
<v Speaker 1>patch of dirt that's so it makes no </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1081
00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.730
<v Speaker 1>You have respecting the ideals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>respecting what it,</v>

1082
00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.550
<v Speaker 1>what it is to you and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1083
00:46:04.551 --> 00:46:08.990
<v Speaker 1>and being proud to be a part of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be the civilization that,</v>

1084
00:46:08.991 --> 00:46:13.991
<v Speaker 1>that set the cost of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're supposed to be where </v>

1085
00:46:13.991 --> 00:46:13.991
<v Speaker 1>the people that moved from everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

1086
00:46:13.991 --> 00:46:16.610
<v Speaker 1>what America's supposed to be as were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people came from everywhere else and</v>

1087
00:46:16.611 --> 00:46:20.080
<v Speaker 1>came to this one spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ideal of it should be like,</v>

1088
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:25.300
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have some some pride in the </v>

1089
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.911
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that somehow or another </v>

1090
00:46:27.911 --> 00:46:29.321
<v Speaker 1>you're better because you're from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirt and you've got a problem with some </v>

1091
00:46:29.321 --> 00:46:31.190
<v Speaker 1>other dudes from that dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fuck</v>

1092
00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:34.000
<v Speaker 2>you have no credit or blame for where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're born ever.</v>

1093
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Like it's absurd to think that like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you can go,</v>

1094
00:46:36.731 --> 00:46:39.250
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people that are born in the Congo,</v>

1095
00:46:39.251 --> 00:46:40.810
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking sucks man.</v>

1096
00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.930
<v Speaker 2>That guy did nothing to deserve being </v>
<v Speaker 2>born in a horrible place.</v>

1097
00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:49.290
<v Speaker 2>But also like you didn't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing to be born in fucking New York.</v>

1098
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great</v>

1099
00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.400
<v Speaker 1>to have a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't,</v>

1100
00:46:52.401 --> 00:46:53.960
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't ask to be a woman.</v>

1101
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.980
<v Speaker 1>It's all by chance to be a feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to only like being like feminine </v>

1102
00:46:59.961 --> 00:47:04.961
<v Speaker 1>values and pushing forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that you think that you're </v>

1103
00:47:04.961 --> 00:47:04.961
<v Speaker 1>fighting against something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand that,</v>

1104
00:47:04.961 --> 00:47:08.120
<v Speaker 1>but we should all be against oppression </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everyone,</v>

1105
00:47:08.121 --> 00:47:11.090
<v Speaker 1>not just oppression for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like to concentrate on that.</v>

1106
00:47:11.091 --> 00:47:16.091
<v Speaker 1>Just as a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every feminist I've ever met to a </v>

1107
00:47:16.091 --> 00:47:18.040
<v Speaker 1>woman and I've only met two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been really fucking annoying habit.</v>

1108
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Probably went more than two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they were horrendous.</v>

1109
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I had an argument with the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some crazy lady who started insulting </v>

1110
00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.170
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to be like super nice to her and</v>

1111
00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:32.220
<v Speaker 1>she is a video of it online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like a performance artist slash </v>

1112
00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.480
<v Speaker 1>feminist and she like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she fucking turned on me.</v>

1113
00:47:34.481 --> 00:47:39.481
<v Speaker 1>I tried to like just talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was asking me questions and she </v>

1114
00:47:39.481 --> 00:47:40.900
<v Speaker 1>actually interrupted the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>than I was having with somebody else and</v>

1115
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:43.960
<v Speaker 1>she started talking to me and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line she was telling</v>

1116
00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:46.380
<v Speaker 1>me to look in her eyes when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to her and I just got,</v>

1117
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I got annoyed and I just started with </v>
<v Speaker 1>happier,</v>

1118
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.570
<v Speaker 1>which is what I tend to do.</v>

1119
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:54.520
<v Speaker 2>It's people or Douchey there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that whole like,</v>

1120
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean just I'm totally for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1121
00:47:57.851 --> 00:48:02.851
<v Speaker 2>nobody being discriminated against but </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people who really subscribed to</v>

1122
00:48:03.071 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 2>like when it's a woman that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribed.</v>

1123
00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.710
<v Speaker 2>So I got to be a champion of women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find for the most part,</v>

1124
00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:13.740
<v Speaker 2>most of the time it's women that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>not ever like pursued like guys didn't </v>

1125
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:19.501
<v Speaker 2>really want them and they go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never a really attractive woman </v>

1126
00:48:19.501 --> 00:48:22.970
<v Speaker 2>that men like climbing all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1127
00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.960
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get to her and if she is,</v>

1128
00:48:24.961 --> 00:48:26.950
<v Speaker 1>she's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's out of her mind,</v>

1129
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:32.400
<v Speaker 1>her mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I always feel about the same </v>

1130
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.570
<v Speaker 1>way I was feeling about guys like Al </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharpton or guys like Jesse Jackson that</v>

1131
00:48:33.571 --> 00:48:36.570
<v Speaker 1>are only involved in black and white </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

1132
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.720
<v Speaker 1>only involved in black people issues I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking really,</v>

1133
00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:45.410
<v Speaker 1>really meant and they're only involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their only motivation fit and their only</v>

1134
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:51.210
<v Speaker 1>motivation is they love being on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being on camera is the reason why we're </v>

1135
00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.750
<v Speaker 1>going to expensive suits and driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful cars.</v>

1136
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.350
<v Speaker 1>They have become the voice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination.</v>

1137
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:02.990
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking ridiculous to have one </v>
<v Speaker 1>person or two people and one of them.</v>

1138
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.160
<v Speaker 1>How about Al Sharpton?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He starts his whole career,</v>

1139
00:49:05.161 --> 00:49:09.360
<v Speaker 1>started out over a false rape accusation</v>
<v Speaker 1>by some crazy chick that he got behind.</v>

1140
00:49:09.361 --> 00:49:11.550
<v Speaker 1>They blamed it on white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Tawana Brawley case,</v>

1141
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:16.730
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She smeared shit on her own body and </v>

1142
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.730
<v Speaker 1>claimed that she got raped and another </v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

1143
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:18.150
<v Speaker 1>You got to look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>

1144
00:49:18.151 --> 00:49:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Tawana Brawley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Sharpton.</v>

1145
00:49:20.161 --> 00:49:25.161
<v Speaker 1>It's a hilarious story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like she falsely accused people of </v>

1146
00:49:25.161 --> 00:49:25.161
<v Speaker 1>rape and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1147
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:29.460
<v Speaker 1>made his career out of getting in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public eye and you know,</v>

1148
00:49:29.461 --> 00:49:32.850
<v Speaker 1>and making a big deal out of this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning into this gigantic rape issue</v>

1149
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:38.250
<v Speaker 2>that guy loves when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when any black person has something like</v>

1150
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:42.500
<v Speaker 1>scandalous half he loves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you get to come on and be like,</v>

1151
00:49:42.501 --> 00:49:45.770
<v Speaker 1>this is a travesty and he gets to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking bullshit,</v>

1152
00:49:45.771 --> 00:49:47.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

1153
00:49:47.391 --> 00:49:48.400
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1154
00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:53.570
<v Speaker 1>there's two guys that are at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront of any like public issue that </v>

1155
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.030
<v Speaker 1>has to do with race and let's do a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>and white people,</v>

1156
00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 1>but it does not race either because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some gigantic Vietnamese and </v>

1157
00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:03.370
<v Speaker 1>white person issue this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking doubt you're gonna.</v>

1158
00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.170
<v Speaker 1>See Jesse Jackson on TV trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support these Vietnamese people.</v>

1159
00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that like they asked Al Sharpton one </v>

1160
00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:11.180
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey you.</v>

1161
00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Because he came to the rescue of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1162
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can speak out because some kid I got </v>

1163
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:17.120
<v Speaker 1>kicked out of school for fighting at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and as a black kid,</v>

1164
00:50:17.121 --> 00:50:22.121
<v Speaker 1>of course I wouldn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't show up if it wasn't a black </v>

1165
00:50:22.671 --> 00:50:24.260
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they go words,</v>

1166
00:50:24.261 --> 00:50:25.640
<v Speaker 1>will you fucking would you do?</v>

1167
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Would you care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you show if like if it was a white</v>

1168
00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:29.510
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1169
00:50:29.511 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they were to reach out to me,</v>

1170
00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's complete bullshit.</v>

1171
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.720
<v Speaker 1>He will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not sharpton.</v>

1172
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:40.960
<v Speaker 1>He's so horesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he might go on just for the </v>

1173
00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.650
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to show that he's not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>about black,</v>

1174
00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:44.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's never happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody invites them.</v>

1175
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.790
<v Speaker 1>If a white kid gets in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's gonna Invite,</v>

1176
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>

1177
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Next time something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling and I'm going to ask him.</v>

1178
00:50:52.561 --> 00:50:54.860
<v Speaker 1>The police show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we fix that?</v>

1179
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:59.890
<v Speaker 1>How do we fix this ridiculous idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>black people and white people and that </v>

1180
00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:00.320
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1181
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:05.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a group of them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>against a group of us and men against </v>

1182
00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:08.741
<v Speaker 1>women against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say there's three types of </v>

1183
00:51:08.741 --> 00:51:08.741
<v Speaker 1>people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morons,</v>

1184
00:51:08.741 --> 00:51:13.030
<v Speaker 1>assholes and people you can hang out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and that's reality and there might </v>

1185
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 1>be some people in those people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can hang out that you truly love.</v>

1186
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:17.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a broad spectrum and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you can just tolerate.</v>

1187
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the group.</v>

1188
00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:23.801
<v Speaker 1>It's morons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes and people can hang out with </v>

1189
00:51:23.801 --> 00:51:24.160
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you can hang out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes if you know him well enough.</v>

1190
00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 1>He grew up with them and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of people that I grew up</v>

1191
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:32.171
<v Speaker 1>with but I still keep in touch with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably would never talk to if I </v>

1192
00:51:32.171 --> 00:51:35.861
<v Speaker 1>didn't grow up with them because I used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do martial arts with and stuff and </v>

1193
00:51:35.861 --> 00:51:39.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of dudes that I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to talk to them and I'm happy </v>

1194
00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:39.550
<v Speaker 1>to run my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is if I met him today,</v>

1195
00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:41.510
<v Speaker 1>then we wouldn't be such close friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1196
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1197
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:47.530
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that we still do this in </v>

1198
00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:48.020
<v Speaker 1>2010,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is that going to change ever?</v>

1199
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:52.850
<v Speaker 1>We ever kind of like melt together to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>one fucking big giant Mocha race,</v>

1200
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the like a combination of everybody and </v>

1201
00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.080
<v Speaker 1>just drop all the nutty diversity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes problems.</v>

1202
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I think in this country it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come pretty fucking close.</v>

1203
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:03.640
<v Speaker 1>People's love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity.</v>

1204
00:52:03.641 --> 00:52:04.840
<v Speaker 1>You don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people say,</v>

1205
00:52:04.841 --> 00:52:06.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity doesn't cause problems.</v>

1206
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Racism comes problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1207
00:52:07.821 --> 00:52:11.050
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a challenge to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and judge them not by,</v>

1208
00:52:11.051 --> 00:52:12.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Martin Luther King said,</v>

1209
00:52:12.591 --> 00:52:14.810
<v Speaker 1>by the color of their skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the content of the character.</v>

1210
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a challenge and that's a good </v>

1211
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:20.080
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1212
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:20.080
<v Speaker 1>and I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1213
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:20.080
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it is.</v>

1214
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I like having a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1215
00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:26.321
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if like as a race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can figure out a way as a human </v>

1216
00:52:26.321 --> 00:52:28.790
<v Speaker 1>race to not differentiate because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way we look.</v>

1217
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's unknown it like people's </v>

1218
00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.760
<v Speaker 1>natural instinct is to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm adjusting well it's the judge,</v>

1219
00:52:36.761 --> 00:52:39.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's also to be drawn to people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1220
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.700
<v Speaker 1>That's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not even,</v>

1221
00:52:40.701 --> 00:52:41.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to,</v>

1222
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:42.710
<v Speaker 1>not totally true because white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a white,</v>

1223
00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:46.910
<v Speaker 1>a black guys like the fuck so many white</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls sad about that.</v>

1224
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:51.260
<v Speaker 1>But they only go for the pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know the ones they can get.</v>

1225
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

1226
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:57.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of black dudes out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a lot of white girls don't get </v>

1227
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.430
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1228
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1229
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they actually athletes like you ever</v>

1230
00:52:59.571 --> 00:53:02.270
<v Speaker 1>seen like Michael Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always with tents everywhere.</v>

1231
00:53:02.271 --> 00:53:02.860
<v Speaker 1>He goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1232
00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:04.410
<v Speaker 1>but that's not Michael Jordan in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

1233
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:05.140
<v Speaker 1>the 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1234
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're all white.</v>

1235
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:11.560
<v Speaker 1>He's got a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think she's a Cuban bitch right </v>

1236
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:11.560
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's out.</v>

1237
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Look at tiger woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1238
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 1>hot white chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1239
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1240
00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:18.470
<v Speaker 1>But tiger woods a amalgamation himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>

1241
00:53:18.471 --> 00:53:19.430
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're out,</v>

1242
00:53:19.431 --> 00:53:22.100
<v Speaker 1>you usually see the brothers with like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chick.</v>

1243
00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1244
00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to the really good places,</v>

1245
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.530
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1246
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.540
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's running really good places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1247
00:53:29.541 --> 00:53:31.290
<v Speaker 4>I usually see them with fluff and </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals,</v>

1248
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.470
<v Speaker 4>like the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1249
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:37.910
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll be like a chick who is driving him</v>

1250
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:43.370
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got to get some shoes and like a </v>

1251
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.370
<v Speaker 4>bad deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:44.430
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think water seeks its own level and if</v>

1253
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:49.431
<v Speaker 4>that other chick and get a good looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>black man of fuck the shit out of her </v>

1254
00:53:49.431 --> 00:53:49.431
<v Speaker 4>every week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what if he robs her every now and</v>

1255
00:53:49.431 --> 00:53:52.560
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't even deal with that.</v>

1256
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:57.561
<v Speaker 4>But why do you think though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you were to walk into like a </v>

1257
00:53:57.561 --> 00:53:57.990
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a room somewhere and there and it was at</v>

1258
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
<v Speaker 4>worst there were segregated when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be the inclination that you </v>

1259
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.670
<v Speaker 4>would go towards the white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I wouldn't,</v>

1260
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:11.040
<v Speaker 4>but it depends on where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's a group of people,</v>

1261
00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:12.890
<v Speaker 4>like if it's a group of comedians or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1262
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:13.790
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1263
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.390
<v Speaker 4>it's like a group of comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's all the same.</v>

1264
00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you feel like that you walk into a</v>

1265
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:22.170
<v Speaker 4>group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't know them,</v>

1266
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:23.820
<v Speaker 4>if you don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>

1267
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might go towards a white guy.</v>

1268
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:30.800
<v Speaker 4>Black guy would walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It depends on how the black guys are </v>

1269
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.691
<v Speaker 4>dressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dressed in suits and ties and they </v>

1270
00:54:32.691 --> 00:54:32.691
<v Speaker 4>looked like a businessman and I might go</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them,</v>

1271
00:54:32.691 --> 00:54:37.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what if they all had on blue or red </v>

1272
00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:37.740
<v Speaker 4>caps and Bandanas and then I will go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the white guy,</v>

1273
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:43.280
<v Speaker 4>I'll go the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fattest white guy that stabbed behind </v>

1274
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.940
<v Speaker 4>him real close to the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to angle myself trying to light up</v>

1275
00:54:46.291 --> 00:54:47.440
<v Speaker 4>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1276
00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:49.770
<v Speaker 4>but I think like if you go in somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you'll see like,</v>

1277
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:54.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Asians will be with Asians and Latin </v>

1278
00:54:54.771 --> 00:54:54.771
<v Speaker 4>people and that's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1279
00:54:54.771 --> 00:54:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1280
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:59.840
<v Speaker 1>a part of our natural inclination from </v>
<v Speaker 1>back when we were know tribes of monkey </v>

1281
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.951
<v Speaker 1>people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to select a group and just stay with </v>

1282
00:55:03.951 --> 00:55:04.380
<v Speaker 1>that group and to assume that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other groups are against you.</v>

1283
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:05.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1284
00:55:05.221 --> 00:55:08.940
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do with sports teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do with state pride,</v>

1285
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:13.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do in the north versus </v>

1286
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:13.970
<v Speaker 1>the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really all the same thing.</v>

1287
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's all team shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1288
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1289
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:18.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a theory that we talked about on</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1290
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:23.100
<v Speaker 1>on the show before that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropologist came up with,</v>

1291
00:55:23.101 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 1>it's called Dunbar's number and Dunbar's</v>
<v Speaker 1>number is,</v>

1292
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.140
<v Speaker 1>it's all about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1293
00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:33.141
<v Speaker 1>the number of people that you're capable</v>
<v Speaker 1>of remembering and having stable </v>

1294
00:55:33.141 --> 00:55:36.180
<v Speaker 1>relationships with and it's like 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is the most.</v>

1295
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theories.</v>

1296
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right or not,</v>

1297
00:55:38.851 --> 00:55:41.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty close in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing a lot of people,</v>

1298
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 1>50 people sounds about right.</v>

1299
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:47.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't have that many more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in your life because if you do,</v>

1300
00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:50.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just too confusing and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the capacity to remember it.</v>

1301
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:55.430
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like our culture has evolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far that it's an operating system </v>

1302
00:55:55.621 --> 00:55:56.400
<v Speaker 1>that our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1303
00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.270
<v Speaker 1>our hard drive isn't capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing like,</v>

1304
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 1>well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what our operating system is,</v>

1305
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:08.540
<v Speaker 1>is our operating system in our memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our hardware is set up for living,</v>

1306
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fucking,</v>

1307
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

1308
00:56:11.791 --> 00:56:16.470
<v Speaker 1>BC throwing sticks with rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sharp rocks at the end of it.</v>

1309
00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:21.471
<v Speaker 1>As at moving animals aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our hardware has barely evolved past </v>

1310
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:22.650
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But our,</v>

1311
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:28.410
<v Speaker 1>our culture is just fucking light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 300 million of us all in this </v>

1312
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:34.111
<v Speaker 1>one continent and all supposed to be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same team and there's so much </v>

1313
00:56:34.111 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 1>disconnection that we try to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections,</v>

1314
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 1>like little small connections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tribe itself is too massive,</v>

1315
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I think like thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1316
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1317
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 1>when people had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1318
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:49.780
<v Speaker 1>we were tribes of hunters and gatherers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're nomadic and everything like </v>

1319
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:53.131
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the bond between people in those </v>

1320
00:56:53.131 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 1>tribes must've been so fucking intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really so much better and more,</v>

1321
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cooperation,</v>

1322
00:56:56.831 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 1>more love for each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more community than we have today.</v>

1323
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you even fucking know your neighbors </v>

1324
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.950
<v Speaker 1>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1325
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.950
<v Speaker 1>But I think partner not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not actually.</v>

1326
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:06.400
<v Speaker 1>This guy who lives over here is a Douche</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>

1327
00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I know that he lets his dogs go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they bite other people's dogs and then,</v>

1328
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this guy up the street.</v>

1329
00:57:11.831 --> 00:57:16.831
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a pain in the ass and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lady's weird and always asked weird </v>

1330
00:57:16.831 --> 00:57:19.890
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I barely know these fucking </v>

1331
00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:19.890
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wave to a few of them.</v>

1332
00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Some of them I like to see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like it used to be man.</v>

1333
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:27.660
<v Speaker 1>He used to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived two doors down from other than </v>

1334
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:27.660
<v Speaker 1>department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1335
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Like I live like a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1336
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:29.420
<v Speaker 1>the people next to another names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1337
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.280
<v Speaker 1>You live in it like a hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1338
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1339
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 1>part of it is that I feel like today </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like,</v>

1340
00:57:34.721 --> 00:57:36.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>

1341
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:40.930
<v Speaker 1>we kind of almost in a weird way </v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage people to be selfish.</v>

1342
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.350
<v Speaker 1>We tell people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't waste your time with that,</v>

1343
00:57:44.351 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 1>don't do this and that for so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like,</v>

1344
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.170
<v Speaker 1>look out for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1345
00:57:49.171 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's kind of like,</v>

1346
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:55.620
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like that's because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>too many of us don't go out of your way </v>

1347
00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:55.620
<v Speaker 1>for somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1348
00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.770
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the way it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our culture has evolved,</v>

1349
00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:01.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this weird place to deal with the </v>

1350
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:01.900
<v Speaker 1>fact that there's so many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1351
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:02.410
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is.</v>

1352
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 1>There's just too fucking many human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings in this one place.</v>

1353
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1354
00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.590
<v Speaker 1>for the way we're wired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too many beans.</v>

1355
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's not sustainable if we </v>

1356
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:13.720
<v Speaker 1>keep growing at this rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rate route,</v>

1357
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.640
<v Speaker 1>like right now we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have enough food if we concentrate on</v>

1358
00:58:15.641 --> 00:58:17.140
<v Speaker 1>everything and do mean we're feeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1359
00:58:17.141 --> 00:58:18.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are getting it done right now,</v>

1360
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

1361
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:23.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're set up for much smaller groups.</v>

1362
00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.340
<v Speaker 1>That shit will hypnotize me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't look at the.</v>

1363
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got distracted.</v>

1364
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you won't be able to have a </v>

1365
00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.481
<v Speaker 1>conversation in the chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will will blind you with its </v>

1366
00:58:33.481 --> 00:58:33.481
<v Speaker 1>retardation.</v>

1367
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 1>There's some cool people in that trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's some monsters in.</v>

1368
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:41.260
<v Speaker 1>There are some fucking monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1369
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:46.320
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the way we got onto this subject </v>

1370
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.951
<v Speaker 1>was feminism and the idea that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this poor fuck who changed his name was </v>

1371
00:58:49.951 --> 00:58:52.010
<v Speaker 1>actually a male feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1372
00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:52.830
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1373
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:54.180
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so depressing.</v>

1374
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He catch a woman being a woman,</v>

1375
00:58:57.251 --> 00:58:58.530
<v Speaker 1>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1376
00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 1>a mail list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a,</v>

1377
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:01.720
<v Speaker 1>is that a word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1378
00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.570
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine a woman who likes </v>
<v Speaker 1>ticks up for men's rights?</v>

1379
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:09.870
<v Speaker 1>That would be just a whore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you would think about that </v>

1380
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.870
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can rationalize all day and,</v>

1497
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:45.090
<v Speaker 1>and there's gonna be times when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>make phone calls.</v>

1498
01:03:45.091 --> 01:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>They should not fucking make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1499
01:03:47.431 --> 01:03:48.720
<v Speaker 1>it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll have to,</v>

1500
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:49.860
<v Speaker 1>if I just call her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

1501
01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe I never expressed myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I never did it the right way.</v>

1502
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you call it and then as that </v>
<v Speaker 1>empty feeling where you're talking to </v>

1503
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.010
<v Speaker 1>them and they really don't want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

1504
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.170
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1505
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I think I need to be by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1506
01:04:00.391 --> 01:04:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just try.</v>

1507
01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:02.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1508
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I am with someone right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1509
01:04:04.561 --> 01:04:06.210
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there what?</v>

1510
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

1511
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you hang up and then you can't </v>

1512
01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>sleep and you're devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what a trick,</v>

1513
01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:17.570
<v Speaker 1>what a terrible trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look back on some of the </v>

1514
01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Times you've had those situations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how fucking happy you are that they,</v>

1515
01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:21.170
<v Speaker 1>you broke up with that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure man.</v>

1516
01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.400
<v Speaker 1>How many times does that happen when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look back on?</v>

1517
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:28.401
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was 21 and my girlfriend </v>

1518
01:04:28.401 --> 01:04:28.401
<v Speaker 1>broke up with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so sad for like a week.</v>

1519
01:04:28.401 --> 01:04:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought she was going to be the one,</v>

1520
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have babies together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1521
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.290
<v Speaker 1>But now I think back on what if I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck with her.</v>

1522
01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1523
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I think about just like times where like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a without even,</v>

1524
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:43.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was like wanting to pursue </v>

1525
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:44.680
<v Speaker 1>somebody in like maybe went out with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few times and it didn't work out.</v>

1526
01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:46.680
<v Speaker 1>It didn't evolve and how that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1527
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:47.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like depressing.</v>

1528
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:48.240
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1529
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you've met and then you get to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of get to know the person from </v>

1530
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:55.500
<v Speaker 1>a distance you're like you imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ended up like if it had worked out,</v>

1531
01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I would be miserable today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had an angry girlfriend?</v>

1532
01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1533

<v Speaker 1>I've had a few anger ones to angry ones </v>

1534
01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.750
<v Speaker 1>are so strange because you just tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>this yelling and this craziness in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1536
01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Tolerate people getting pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tolerate negativity and then you </v>

1537
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.420
<v Speaker 1>realize one day like you break up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you go,</v>

1587
01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:17.731

<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>

1607
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:04.700
<v Speaker 1>like you can't have a good relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of personal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a regular job.</v>

1681

1684
01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.941
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in the beginning when you </v>

<v Speaker 1>really don't know what the fuck you're </v>

<v Speaker 1>financial devastation.</v>

1700

<v Speaker 1>fucking snow.</v>

1739
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.010
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hit.</v>

1740
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.550
<v Speaker 1>She hit a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tree,</v>

1742
01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:25.500
<v Speaker 1>snowy roads drive in the snow at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She grew up in Texas and like after the </v>

1743
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.590
<v Speaker 1>second time it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go on the road too much.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>isn't it amazing here in la or </v>

1761
01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:13.230
<v Speaker 1>California even</v>

1762
01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:15.400
<v Speaker 6>I guess how people react to rain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they fucking panic,</v>

1763
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:18.010
<v Speaker 6>like really lose their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No idea how to drive,</v>

1764
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.960
<v Speaker 6>no idea that well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only that,</v>

1765
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:24.961
<v Speaker 6>it gets slippery as fuck when the rain </v>
<v Speaker 6>first starts and people don't realize </v>

1766
01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:28.411
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially if you have shitty tires and </v>

1767
01:14:28.411 --> 01:14:29.911
<v Speaker 6>shitty breaks is because the oil in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ground is a from driving and people's,</v>

1768
01:14:30.181 --> 01:14:31.480
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>engines leaking.</v>

1769
01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.060
<v Speaker 6>It never gets rinsed off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it doesn't enormous city.</v>

1770
01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:39.450
<v Speaker 6>It just builds up because it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't rain here for like fucking </v>

1771
01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:42.650
<v Speaker 6>months and months and months and months </v>
<v Speaker 6>of millions and millions of cars every </v>

1772
01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:43.360
<v Speaker 6>day going over the same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Drip,</v>

1773
01:14:43.361 --> 01:14:43.930
<v Speaker 6>drip,</v>
<v Speaker 6>drip,</v>

1774
01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.900
<v Speaker 6>drip oil gets everywhere and as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 6>it rains,</v>

1775
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:52.020
<v Speaker 6>the first couple of hours is dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 6>as fuck because that shit is just like </v>

1776
01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 6>ice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's terrible.</v>

1777
01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:54.730
<v Speaker 6>Panic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People really truly panic.</v>

1778
01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:59.910
<v Speaker 6>There's so many fucking people here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was the number one reason why I </v>

1779
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.910
<v Speaker 6>wanted to get out of call or get out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>California,</v>

1780
01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:00.640
<v Speaker 6>moved to Colorado.</v>

1781
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.370
<v Speaker 6>And the reason why I moved to such a </v>
<v Speaker 6>remote place in the mountains,</v>

1782
01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:06.670
<v Speaker 6>because I think that it's not healthy to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be around this many people.</v>

1783
01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:11.940
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen these studies that they did </v>

1784
01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.891
<v Speaker 6>with rat population density studies </v>
<v Speaker 6>where they increase the amount of rats </v>

1785
01:15:13.891 --> 01:15:15.040
<v Speaker 6>in an area and they get fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>and start biting each other.</v>

1786
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:20.050
<v Speaker 6>Like the reason why people don't like </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other as much as like what we </v>

1787
01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:20.680
<v Speaker 6>talked about before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're supposed to be in groups,</v>

1788
01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:22.330
<v Speaker 6>small groups where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody,</v>

1789
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:23.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1790
01:15:23.251 --> 01:15:28.251
<v Speaker 6>and we're only wired for like 150.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get a place like la where you're </v>

1791
01:15:28.251 --> 01:15:30.370
<v Speaker 6>dealing with $20 million people plus </v>
<v Speaker 6>Mexicans.</v>

1792
01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:32.710
<v Speaker 6>Nobody knows how many people there </v>
<v Speaker 6>really are.</v>

1793
01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.040
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they sent me the census and I'm </v>

1794
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.931
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get the fuck out of here with this says </v>

1795
01:15:39.931 --> 01:15:41.851
<v Speaker 6>this is a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't how any Mexicans I know that </v>

1796
01:15:41.851 --> 01:15:41.851
<v Speaker 6>are illegal.</v>

1797
01:15:41.851 --> 01:15:42.760
<v Speaker 6>I know a ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know a bunch of dudes.</v>

1798
01:15:42.761 --> 01:15:45.800
<v Speaker 6>I know dudes that I work out with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know I,</v>

1799
01:15:45.810 --> 01:15:48.790
<v Speaker 6>I know dudes at certain stores that I go</v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

1800
01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.070
<v Speaker 6>dudes that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>run businesses,</v>

1801
01:15:51.071 --> 01:15:56.071
<v Speaker 6>they run their own businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all Mexicans and they know a </v>

1802
01:15:56.071 --> 01:15:58.831
<v Speaker 6>bunch of cooks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Guys at work at this Mexican restaurant </v>

1803
01:15:58.831 --> 01:15:58.831
<v Speaker 6>that I go to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's fucking awesome.</v>

1804
01:15:58.831 --> 01:16:00.440
<v Speaker 6>They're all the illegals and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>never going to answer that census.</v>

1805
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.110
<v Speaker 6>We're never gonna have the right number </v>
<v Speaker 6>on it.</v>

1806
01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 6>Just shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know.</v>

1807
01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.170
<v Speaker 6>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1808
01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.540
<v Speaker 6>there's no way to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no way to tell this.</v>

1809
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:12.630
<v Speaker 6>Well the only one that's going to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but by the time they can tell we're </v>

1810
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:14.950
<v Speaker 6>going to be so far fucked with our loss </v>
<v Speaker 6>of privacy.</v>

1811
01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:16.060
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is coming.</v>

1812
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:21.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's going to be the next stage is </v>

1813
01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.861
<v Speaker 6>going to be some sort of a drastic </v>
<v Speaker 6>decrease in the amount of privacy that </v>

1814
01:16:22.861 --> 01:16:22.861
<v Speaker 6>we have.</v>

1815
01:16:22.861 --> 01:16:26.640
<v Speaker 6>The point where either it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because technology brings this on </v>

1816
01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:31.770
<v Speaker 6>because it's just the technology that is</v>
<v Speaker 6>created is so immense and powerful that </v>

1817
01:16:32.591 --> 01:16:36.490
<v Speaker 6>you really do have like an instant </v>
<v Speaker 6>access to where everyone is sort of like</v>

1818
01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:38.280

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1819
01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.320

1820
01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.200
<v Speaker 6>of question you have on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can immediately find out at least an</v>

1821
01:16:47.201 --> 01:16:52.201
<v Speaker 6>idea of what the argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pro and con and then start researching </v>

1822
01:16:52.201 --> 01:16:56.161
<v Speaker 6>into it instantly will eventually we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to have something along those </v>

1823
01:16:56.161 --> 01:16:57.730
<v Speaker 6>lines where you're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 6>know how many people are here,</v>

1838
01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just the really vulnerable </v>

1839
01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.941
<v Speaker 2>feeling like you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You realize that like even now things </v>

1840
01:17:31.941 --> 01:17:32.570
<v Speaker 2>you do get tracked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1841
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:37.590
<v Speaker 2>like your credit card purchases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're surfing can be humble when you </v>

1842
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:41.481
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever use like yahoo email or </v>

1843
01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:41.481
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1844
01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1845
01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:45.360
<v Speaker 2>you have like certain keywords and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>email and it'll show you like ads on the</v>

1846
01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:48.260
<v Speaker 2>right hand side you have to do with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the email that somebody sent you.</v>

1847
01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:52.040
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck and how much more is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to see?</v>

1848
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.590
<v Speaker 2>How much better or more invasive is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be?</v>

1849
01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.090
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be much more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1850
01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:57.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1851
01:17:58.150 --> 01:18:00.550
<v Speaker 6>About last week we talked about a smart </v>
<v Speaker 6>dust.</v>

1852
01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:05.551
<v Speaker 6>It's a new technology that they've </v>
<v Speaker 6>created these little tiny things that </v>

1853
01:18:05.551 --> 01:18:08.581
<v Speaker 6>are literally the size of a grain of </v>
<v Speaker 6>sand and they will have the ability to </v>

1854
01:18:08.581 --> 01:18:10.210
<v Speaker 6>transmit and receive data and they will </v>
<v Speaker 6>have their own power supply.</v>

1855
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:15.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And HP is working on a whole project </v>

1856
01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:15.610
<v Speaker 6>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just Google if you want to.</v>

1857
01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:16.540
<v Speaker 6>We were not going to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

1858
01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:19.210
<v Speaker 6>but if you're interested in the idea and</v>
<v Speaker 6>what it's all about,</v>

1859
01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:24.330
<v Speaker 6>just google smart dust.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fascinating in hps involved in it </v>

1860
01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:27.250
<v Speaker 6>and this is where they're going to put </v>
<v Speaker 6>trillions of sensors all over the world,</v>

1861
01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:30.790
<v Speaker 6>trillions of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So literally they'll be able to tell you</v>

1862
01:18:30.791 --> 01:18:32.140
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where cars are parked,</v>

1863
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:33.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that this house is on fire,</v>

1864
01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:35.200
<v Speaker 6>there'll be a grid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1865
01:18:35.201 --> 01:18:40.201
<v Speaker 6>people will have access to information </v>
<v Speaker 6>far beyond the reach that we have now.</v>

1866
01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.310
<v Speaker 6>I already fit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>feel like it's</v>

1867
01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:43.760
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1868
01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:45.830
<v Speaker 2>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1869
01:18:45.831 --> 01:18:47.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like upsetting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1870
01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it's necessary in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of like,</v>

1871
01:18:49.881 --> 01:18:52.700
<v Speaker 2>it makes me uncomfortable that so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>places have cameras,</v>

1872
01:18:52.701 --> 01:18:52.980
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1873
01:18:53.490 --> 01:18:55.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But look at how that helped,</v>

1874
01:18:55.141 --> 01:18:56.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what I'm saying.</v>

1875
01:18:56.311 --> 01:18:58.230
<v Speaker 6>I know that it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a necessary thing,</v>

1876
01:18:58.231 --> 01:19:03.231
<v Speaker 6>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sorry to walk away from the microphone </v>

1877
01:19:03.231 --> 01:19:05.451
<v Speaker 6>and get my notepad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but look at how that worked in New York </v>

1878
01:19:05.451 --> 01:19:05.750
<v Speaker 6>with that guy that tried to blow up that</v>
<v Speaker 6>car and comscore and.</v>

1879
01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.380
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

1880
01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.400
<v Speaker 6>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go,</v>

1881
01:19:08.401 --> 01:19:13.401
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like our cameras watching me everywhere </v>

1882
01:19:13.401 --> 01:19:13.401
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1883
01:19:13.401 --> 01:19:16.070
<v Speaker 6>Well that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then there's the tin foil and put </v>

1884
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.070
<v Speaker 6>that shit on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You say,</v>

1885
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.070
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

1886
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:17.520
<v Speaker 6>that guy's dead car didn't even blow up </v>
<v Speaker 6>match.</v>

1887
01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.920
<v Speaker 6>What they did was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's all black ops do.</v>

1888
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:22.890
<v Speaker 6>That's all fucking cow cointelpro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What they do is,</v>

1889
01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:24.570
<v Speaker 6>you know Alex Jones style.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well they do,</v>

1890
01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:28.980
<v Speaker 6>but the guy that is in that van is </v>
<v Speaker 6>working for the federal government.</v>

1891
01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:30.480
<v Speaker 6>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have the papers,</v>

1892
01:19:30.481 --> 01:19:32.760
<v Speaker 6>we have the documents,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he works for the government.</v>

1893
01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:35.880
<v Speaker 6>He sets up a faulty bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't work.</v>

1894
01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.210
<v Speaker 6>It's not scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

1895
01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.410
<v Speaker 6>it lights on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They arrest him,</v>

1896
01:19:40.411 --> 01:19:45.411
<v Speaker 6>they get him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they tell you they got him because of </v>

1897
01:19:45.411 --> 01:19:48.420
<v Speaker 6>covert video cameras and they need to </v>
<v Speaker 6>protect you to protect us.</v>

1898
01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.860
<v Speaker 6>They're going to put video cameras </v>
<v Speaker 6>everywhere,</v>

1899
01:19:49.890 --> 01:19:51.720
<v Speaker 6>ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a scam.</v>

1900
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.000
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1901
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:58.030
<v Speaker 6>it's the new world order.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did he really say all that about this </v>

1902
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:59.000
<v Speaker 6>made up?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was what he was saying.</v>

1903
01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:00.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was really good.</v>

1904
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:03.160
<v Speaker 6>So I could see his one of you to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1905
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.060
<v Speaker 6>that he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1906
01:20:05.061 --> 01:20:07.170
<v Speaker 6>it's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you think that's nonsense.</v>

1907
01:20:07.190 --> 01:20:09.480
<v Speaker 6>You think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's how the government thinks.</v>

1908
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.130
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying that they did that with </v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

1909
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying they would do that though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think with this guy,</v>

1910
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:16.430
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty documented.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guys will retard and you know,</v>

1911
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.820
<v Speaker 6>he was all upset at the world and went </v>
<v Speaker 6>to Pakistan and met with the Taliban the</v>

1912
01:20:20.821 --> 01:20:23.580
<v Speaker 6>whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guys legitimately retarded and he's</v>

1913
01:20:23.581 --> 01:20:27.120
<v Speaker 6>not some sort of a plant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's very possible.</v>

1914
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.790
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people that believe </v>
<v Speaker 6>that Oklahoma City,</v>

1915
01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:34.791
<v Speaker 6>that the reason why Oklahoma City was </v>
<v Speaker 6>blown up or was allowed to be blown up </v>

1916
01:20:34.791 --> 01:20:37.140
<v Speaker 6>was so that they could pass new,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stricter anti terrorism laws.</v>

1917
01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's,</v>

1918
01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:41.380
<v Speaker 2>here's my only problem with like point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of views like that.</v>

1919
01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean like with all of them,</v>

1920
01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:48.570
<v Speaker 2>when it's like a really something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>big is the magnitude of the conspiracy,</v>

1921
01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:52.780
<v Speaker 2>if it were to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1922
01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too big.</v>

1923
01:20:55.090 --> 01:20:57.400
<v Speaker 2>You would have to have too many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping secrets.</v>

1924
01:20:57.550 --> 01:21:01.870
<v Speaker 2>People are naturally reluctant to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>secrets for the most part.</v>

1925
01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:05.860
<v Speaker 2>When you have people have like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsion to want to share,</v>

1926
01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:08.720
<v Speaker 2>especially when it's something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not supposed to share.</v>

1927
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like if we're talking about </v>

1928
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:16.441
<v Speaker 2>something that big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have literally there would </v>

1929
01:21:16.441 --> 01:21:18.700
<v Speaker 2>have to be hundreds of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost homeless setting.</v>

1930
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oklahoma City.</v>

1931
01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1932
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.040
<v Speaker 6>just to play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you know that the FBI removed several</v>

1933
01:21:24.041 --> 01:21:26.520
<v Speaker 6>and detonated bombs outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>building.</v>

1934
01:21:26.521 --> 01:21:30.120
<v Speaker 6>They pulled them out of the building </v>
<v Speaker 6>after it happened and this is.</v>

1935
01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:35.200
<v Speaker 6>This was reported on the news and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Oklahoma and that the bomb itself that </v>

1936
01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:37.110
<v Speaker 6>they made at a fertilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're literally like,</v>

1937
01:21:37.111 --> 01:21:38.670
<v Speaker 6>if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the evidence,</v>

1938
01:21:38.671 --> 01:21:43.671
<v Speaker 6>like how the building was blown up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no way a fertilizer bomb did </v>

1939
01:21:43.671 --> 01:21:43.671
<v Speaker 6>that kind of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only that,</v>

1940
01:21:43.671 --> 01:21:47.130
<v Speaker 6>the building blew outward,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it didn't blow from the center down.</v>

1941
01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:49.320
<v Speaker 6>There wasn't like a big crater </v>
<v Speaker 6>underneath the truck.</v>

1942
01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:54.740
<v Speaker 6>And the idea is that there were bombs </v>
<v Speaker 6>inside the building and at this guy who </v>

1943
01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.280
<v Speaker 6>blew up this bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1944
01:21:56.281 --> 01:21:57.420
<v Speaker 6>there's this truck bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1945
01:21:57.421 --> 01:22:02.421
<v Speaker 6>he blew up a truck bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's not responsible for all that </v>

1946
01:22:02.421 --> 01:22:04.881
<v Speaker 6>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea is that the damage was done by </v>

1947
01:22:04.881 --> 01:22:07.461
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of bombs that were inside the </v>
<v Speaker 6>building and all of them didn't go off </v>

1948
01:22:07.461 --> 01:22:08.310
<v Speaker 6>and that's the reason why the FBI pulled</v>
<v Speaker 6>them out of the building,</v>

1949
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:13.610
<v Speaker 6>pulled a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an unexploded ones out of the building </v>

1950
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.610
<v Speaker 6>and that could get.</v>

1951
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:15.000
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't necessarily mean the </v>
<v Speaker 6>government was involved with it.</v>

1952
01:22:15.001 --> 01:22:15.920
<v Speaker 6>Could have been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was that the,</v>

1953
01:22:15.921 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1954
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.410
<v Speaker 6>that he was working with other people </v>
<v Speaker 6>and not only did he have this fertilizer</v>

1955
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:24.411
<v Speaker 6>bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he had these other bombs in the </v>

1956
01:22:24.411 --> 01:22:25.911
<v Speaker 6>building and maybe his fertilizer bomb </v>
<v Speaker 6>is supposed to detonate those other </v>

1957
01:22:25.911 --> 01:22:28.731
<v Speaker 6>bombs and blow up the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a bunch of different </v>

1958
01:22:28.731 --> 01:22:30.741
<v Speaker 6>possibilities of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's very rarely talked about and </v>

1959
01:22:30.741 --> 01:22:30.741
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the footage of,</v>

1960
01:22:30.741 --> 01:22:35.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of all these different people that were </v>

1961
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:37.461
<v Speaker 6>involved at these different fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>Muslim guys that were supposed to be </v>

1962
01:22:37.461 --> 01:22:37.461
<v Speaker 6>there that had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1963
01:22:37.461 --> 01:22:39.300
<v Speaker 6>worked for a Saddam Hussein and Iraq and</v>
<v Speaker 6>all these different,</v>

1964
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.760
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>various organizations.</v>

1965
01:22:41.761 --> 01:22:42.440
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all,</v>

1966
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:44.040
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a tricky little story.</v>

1967
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:45.270
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you start looking into it,</v>

1968
01:22:45.271 --> 01:22:45.840
<v Speaker 6>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1969
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:48.200
<v Speaker 6>that still doesn't mean that there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of conspiracy.</v>

1970
01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:51.900
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they've done shit in the past.</v>

1971
01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:57.050
<v Speaker 6>And when you look at the stuff that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>government has done that would require </v>

1972
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060
<v Speaker 6>hundreds of people to keep their mouth </v>
<v Speaker 6>shut.</v>

1973
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:58.830
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you know about the Gulf of Tonkin?</v>

1974
01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:00.720
<v Speaker 6>Do you know about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that the,</v>

1975
01:23:00.721 --> 01:23:03.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Viet a fake?</v>

1976
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:09.270
<v Speaker 6>That moon has been proven now and this </v>
<v Speaker 6>is something that they did to get us </v>

1977
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:13.711
<v Speaker 6>into the Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they did that and they got away with </v>

1978
01:23:13.711 --> 01:23:13.711
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1979
01:23:13.711 --> 01:23:14.140
<v Speaker 6>we went through with the Vietnam war </v>
<v Speaker 6>operation.</v>

1980
01:23:14.141 --> 01:23:17.140
<v Speaker 6>Northwoods is another one that we've </v>
<v Speaker 6>talked about this on the podcast before,</v>

1981
01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:20.260
<v Speaker 6>but for those people who haven't heard </v>
<v Speaker 6>this google operation,</v>

1982
01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:22.330
<v Speaker 6>northwoods would operation northwoods </v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

1983
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:27.540
<v Speaker 6>was a plan that was drafted by the Joint</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chiefs of staff in 1962 and vetoed by </v>

1984
01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:33.091
<v Speaker 6>Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was signed by the Joint Chiefs of </v>

1985
01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:34.921
<v Speaker 6>Staff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the plan was to attack American </v>

1986
01:23:34.921 --> 01:23:34.921
<v Speaker 6>civilians and blame it on the Cubans.</v>

1987
01:23:34.921 --> 01:23:39.330
<v Speaker 6>So we would go to war with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's they were going to blow up a jet </v>

1988
01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:42.390
<v Speaker 6>that was part of the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to blow up a jet and pull </v>

1989
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:45.121
<v Speaker 6>the people out of the jet and fly the </v>
<v Speaker 6>jet and move the people to another </v>

1990
01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:45.190
<v Speaker 6>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then they were going to blow the jet</v>

1991
01:23:45.191 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 6>up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say all these people died.</v>

1992
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.130
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1993
01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.160
<v Speaker 6>This was in 1962.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a plot by the joint chiefs of </v>

1994
01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.741
<v Speaker 6>staff did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only did they say that they were </v>

1995
01:23:55.741 --> 01:23:57.871
<v Speaker 6>going to bomb Guantanamo Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were the lob mortars on Guantanamo </v>

1996
01:23:57.871 --> 01:24:00.190
<v Speaker 6>Bay and assume civilian or military </v>
<v Speaker 6>casualties.</v>

1997
01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:05.340
<v Speaker 6>So they were going to kill American </v>
<v Speaker 6>military to blame it on the Cubans so </v>

1998
01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:09.451
<v Speaker 6>that people would get all fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's not like they haven't done shit </v>

1999
01:24:09.451 --> 01:24:09.451
<v Speaker 6>like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2000
01:24:09.451 --> 01:24:09.451
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2001
01:24:09.451 --> 01:24:11.140
<v Speaker 6>you started talking to them about </v>
<v Speaker 6>conspiracies.</v>

2002
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.010
<v Speaker 6>The real problem is when you get into </v>
<v Speaker 6>him and you start researching them,</v>

2003
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:15.700
<v Speaker 6>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

2004
01:24:15.701 --> 01:24:17.140
<v Speaker 6>look at all the shit they have done.</v>

2005
01:24:17.170 --> 01:24:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2006
01:24:17.771 --> 01:24:18.340
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2007
01:24:18.341 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2008
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:20.740
<v Speaker 2>and I don't say like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2009
01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that the government or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody for that matter.</v>

2010
01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:29.470
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have the capacity to be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>morally corrupt or evil.</v>

2011
01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.300
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my just,</v>

2012
01:24:31.301 --> 01:24:35.050
<v Speaker 2>my natural inclination is to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2013
01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 2>when these things start to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really massive is to go,</v>

2014
01:24:37.961 --> 01:24:42.961
<v Speaker 2>like how can we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how in this day and age especially can </v>

2015
01:24:42.961 --> 01:24:43.210
<v Speaker 2>that secret be kept?</v>

2016
01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.270
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

2017
01:24:44.490 --> 01:24:46.910
<v Speaker 6>The one one way that it's kept.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you fall,</v>

2018
01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:51.920
<v Speaker 6>put your tinfoil hat on tight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One way it's kept is by putting out </v>

2019
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:55.500
<v Speaker 6>information that's correct and mixing it</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a bunch of stuff that's ridiculous.</v>

2020
01:24:56.250 --> 01:24:57.080
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's,</v>

2021
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:59.700
<v Speaker 6>that's how they processed this </v>
<v Speaker 6>information.</v>

2022
01:24:59.701 --> 01:25:04.701
<v Speaker 6>What they do is they attach all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>legitimate ideas to something that's so </v>

2023
01:25:05.071 --> 01:25:10.071
<v Speaker 6>outrageous that it makes the legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea seem ridiculous because they're </v>

2024
01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:11.850
<v Speaker 6>connected to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But by relationship,</v>

2025
01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:13.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's,</v>

2026
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:16.050
<v Speaker 6>that's a strategy that is well </v>
<v Speaker 6>documented.</v>

2027
01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:16.890
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2028
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:18.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you look at the,</v>

2029
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:23.270
<v Speaker 6>in the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the CIA wrote papers about this kind of </v>

2030
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.270
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2031
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.940
<v Speaker 6>cointelpro and the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2032
01:25:23.941 --> 01:25:25.470
<v Speaker 6>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2033
01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:30.180
<v Speaker 6>put out dumb stories that attach </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves to the real store.</v>

2034
01:25:30.181 --> 01:25:31.590
<v Speaker 6>So it makes it ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2035
01:25:31.591 --> 01:25:36.591
<v Speaker 6>people have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have actually had jobs where they're </v>

2036
01:25:36.591 --> 01:25:39.480
<v Speaker 6>disinflation agents and their prior to </v>
<v Speaker 6>go on blogs and websites,</v>

2037
01:25:39.481 --> 01:25:41.010
<v Speaker 6>this is going on right now.</v>

2038
01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:44.610
<v Speaker 6>This is real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or they're hired to argue certain points</v>

2039
01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.980
<v Speaker 6>they're hired to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2040
01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:48.570
<v Speaker 6>stand up for government ideas and offer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2041
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.010
<v Speaker 6>very well thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2042
01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:50.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2043
01:25:50.611 --> 01:25:55.611
<v Speaker 6>arguments and they do it under these </v>
<v Speaker 6>anonymous assumed names and sometimes </v>

2044
01:25:55.611 --> 01:25:59.031
<v Speaker 6>it's several people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These are real government jobs that </v>

2045
01:25:59.031 --> 01:25:59.310
<v Speaker 6>actually exist and it's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's been talked about.</v>

2046
01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:03.000
<v Speaker 6>We find the shit that the government has</v>
<v Speaker 6>done and it makes you go,</v>

2047
01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:08.020
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what have they done that I don't know </v>

2048
01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:08.020
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2049
01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:08.210
<v Speaker 6>you gotta be pretty elaborate and be </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy.</v>

2050
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:09.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's see.</v>

2051
01:26:09.061 --> 01:26:12.680
<v Speaker 6>So that's where the argument of 100 </v>
<v Speaker 6>people would have to be in,</v>

2052
01:26:12.681 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 6>on the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's where it doesn't work.</v>

2053
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:17.000
<v Speaker 6>The reason why it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's because they have been,</v>

2054
01:26:17.290 --> 01:26:22.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's been a lot of secrets that you </v>

2055
01:26:22.290 --> 01:26:24.801
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>were processed that we didn't find out </v>

2056
01:26:24.801 --> 01:26:24.801
<v Speaker 6>about the operation.</v>

2057
01:26:24.801 --> 01:26:25.220
<v Speaker 6>Midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Climax is another one.</v>

2058
01:26:25.221 --> 01:26:28.370
<v Speaker 6>We've talked on this show about before </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's a the 19 fifties,</v>

2059
01:26:28.371 --> 01:26:33.371
<v Speaker 6>the government ran the CIA ran brothels </v>
<v Speaker 6>in New York and in San Francisco and </v>

2060
01:26:34.071 --> 01:26:39.071
<v Speaker 6>they dosed people with Lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had John's would come in and they </v>

2061
01:26:39.071 --> 01:26:40.600
<v Speaker 6>would try to get lay these poor folks </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they would,</v>

2062
01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.640
<v Speaker 6>they would blast them with acid whether </v>
<v Speaker 6>in there trying to get their free </v>

2063
01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:45.640
<v Speaker 6>content is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's so far.</v>

2064
01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:50.230
<v Speaker 6>They did it because they wanted to test </v>
<v Speaker 6>the effects of LSD and they couldn't </v>

2065
01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:50.510
<v Speaker 6>find willing patients anymore or you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

2066
01:26:50.511 --> 01:26:53.510
<v Speaker 6>a few people did it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they fucking dose people,</v>

2067
01:26:53.511 --> 01:26:55.370
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They like a little bit.</v>

2068
01:26:55.371 --> 01:26:57.410
<v Speaker 6>They're giving you like mad doses to see</v>
<v Speaker 6>what happened</v>

2069
01:26:57.450 --> 01:27:02.450
<v Speaker 4>when they did the original,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the what's the famous one where they </v>

2070
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.140
<v Speaker 4>were going to see if it could be like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth serum where the CIA had.</v>

2071
01:27:04.141 --> 01:27:09.141
<v Speaker 4>They killed people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They accidentally killed one of their </v>

2072
01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:09.141
<v Speaker 4>own agents.</v>

2073
01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:13.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave him too much and he fucking </v>

2074
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.470
<v Speaker 4>like they because they didn't know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of dosages.</v>

2075
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:16.690
<v Speaker 4>There's just have another little tablet </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he fucking.</v>

2076
01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.440
<v Speaker 4>He lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2077
01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:18.760
<v Speaker 4>he died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2078
01:27:18.761 --> 01:27:23.761
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense that they would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that would be possible because if </v>

2079
01:27:23.761 --> 01:27:23.761
<v Speaker 4>you think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2080
01:27:23.761 --> 01:27:24.310
<v Speaker 4>experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2081
01:27:24.311 --> 01:27:29.311
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like we had like a whole </v>

2082
01:27:29.311 --> 01:27:30.850
<v Speaker 4>database on an lsd experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2083
01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.470
<v Speaker 4>we could pull from like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2084
01:27:32.471 --> 01:27:35.290
<v Speaker 4>don't do more than this amount or you'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking blow your,</v>

2085
01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.820
<v Speaker 4>your own chemistry is also different </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the next person.</v>

2086
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:39.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like alcoholics.</v>

2087
01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:41.620
<v Speaker 4>Some dudes can't drink at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other dudes can,</v>

2088
01:27:41.621 --> 01:27:43.480
<v Speaker 4>you just drank and somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't even get drunk.</v>

2089
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:44.510
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like an old,</v>

2090
01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:47.920
<v Speaker 4>like some guys just pound it to all day </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some dudes do that with an asset.</v>

2091
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:51.010
<v Speaker 4>There's some dudes that gobble that shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and take like fucking five,</v>

2092
01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:55.150
<v Speaker 4>six tabs and they're fine and they seem </v>
<v Speaker 4>to like be better than other dudes.</v>

2093
01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:58.510
<v Speaker 4>They get a high dose and they'll never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're never the same again.</v>

2094
01:27:58.570 --> 01:28:01.090
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy like that.</v>

2095
01:28:01.330 --> 01:28:02.230
<v Speaker 4>Who Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's his name?</v>

2096
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:04.150
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't say what happened,</v>

2097
01:28:04.151 --> 01:28:05.080
<v Speaker 4>what happened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He took,</v>

2098
01:28:05.081 --> 01:28:06.550
<v Speaker 4>he took a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he took a dose.</v>

2099
01:28:06.551 --> 01:28:06.950
<v Speaker 4>This is like,</v>

2100
01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:09.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2102
01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.290
<v Speaker 2>13 years,</v>

2103
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:13.530
<v Speaker 4>years ago about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2104
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:14.340
<v Speaker 4>And that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

2105
01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:15.240
<v Speaker 4>That was it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2106
01:28:15.810 --> 01:28:17.250
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2107
01:28:17.251 --> 01:28:17.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2108
01:28:17.911 --> 01:28:22.911
<v Speaker 4>he was chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was in college and just partying is </v>

2109
01:28:22.911 --> 01:28:22.980
<v Speaker 4>like doing regular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2110
01:28:22.981 --> 01:28:24.390
<v Speaker 4>drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what was the effect?</v>

2111
01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.350
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2112
01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:26.760
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he took it like,</v>

2113
01:28:26.761 --> 01:28:28.470
<v Speaker 4>let's say like on a Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2114
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:29.180
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2115
01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:34.980
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seemingly wore off like the way any </v>

2116
01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:34.980
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2117
01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:35.800
<v Speaker 4>when you drink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do drugs with wood</v>

2118
01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:40.270
<v Speaker 2>and then he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went like the next week,</v>

2119
01:28:40.810 --> 01:28:45.810
<v Speaker 2>went into like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the school and walked through the </v>

2120
01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:47.320
<v Speaker 2>cafeteria and went into the kitchen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>started like,</v>

2121
01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:52.330
<v Speaker 2>like asking the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking the chef to like if he could swim</v>

2122
01:28:52.331 --> 01:28:53.320
<v Speaker 2>in the water supply,</v>

2123
01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.340
<v Speaker 4>like from the sink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he was like,</v>

2124
01:28:57.341 --> 01:29:00.220
<v Speaker 4>can I go into the pipes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were just like,</v>

2125
01:29:00.221 --> 01:29:00.610
<v Speaker 4>Huh,</v>

2126
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.300
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing back here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2127
01:29:03.301 --> 01:29:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Then I go into the pipes and swim to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

2128
01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.940
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then it was like,</v>

2129
01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:11.860
<v Speaker 2>we need to check this kid out and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they should've let them try.</v>

2130
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To this day though,</v>

2131
01:29:13.711 --> 01:29:14.610
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2132
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:16.710
<v Speaker 2>he's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2133
01:29:16.711 --> 01:29:18.150
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's off,</v>

2134
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.090
<v Speaker 2>like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's able to work and do things,</v>

2135
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:24.930
<v Speaker 2>but he's not the same guy that he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something happened,</v>

2136
01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.870
<v Speaker 2>some shit was disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was he like before and what does he</v>

2137
01:29:27.871 --> 01:29:28.380
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2138
01:29:28.890 --> 01:29:31.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he was like,</v>

2139
01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:35.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I would say thoughtful,</v>

2140
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:36.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty articulate,</v>

2141
01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:41.930
<v Speaker 2>reserved and now he's like quirky and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little more like,</v>

2142
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:44.700
<v Speaker 2>like he's like artsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a kind of an artsy guy.</v>

2143
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like peculiar,</v>

2144
01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:52.341
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when says things that like don't </v>

2145
01:29:52.341 --> 01:29:52.341
<v Speaker 2>make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2146
01:29:52.341 --> 01:29:53.120
<v Speaker 2>And he's like a percentage insane.</v>

2147
01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2148
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:54.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2149
01:29:54.541 --> 01:29:55.870
<v Speaker 2>I would say now and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2150
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:57.290
<v Speaker 2>and more inclined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

2151
01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:02.300
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see something else happening </v>

2152
01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:02.300
<v Speaker 2>where you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2153
01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Like you're watching something went </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

2154
01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.710
<v Speaker 2>You're on the edge right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're about,</v>

2155
01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:06.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see,</v>

2156
01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I could see you falling in the tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty pretty simple,</v>

2157
01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.370
<v Speaker 2>crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing is before that,</v>

2158
01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:13.980
<v Speaker 2>there was no evidence of that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero,</v>

2159
01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:19.040
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was totally normal as far as I knew </v>

2160
01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:19.770
<v Speaker 2>and I knew him like I wasn't good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good friends,</v>

2161
01:30:19.771 --> 01:30:20.880
<v Speaker 2>but I knew him fairly well.</v>

2162
01:30:21.610 --> 01:30:24.400
<v Speaker 6>The radical change,</v>
<v Speaker 6>radical change.</v>

2163
01:30:24.490 --> 01:30:25.360
<v Speaker 6>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

2164
01:30:25.361 --> 01:30:30.361
<v Speaker 6>I believe it just because of A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hadn't experienced one of the last </v>

2165
01:30:30.361 --> 01:30:33.400
<v Speaker 6>times I did dmt the last time I did dmt </v>
<v Speaker 6>where it was a a few years ago,</v>

2166
01:30:33.610 --> 01:30:38.610
<v Speaker 6>where for like two weeks after I did it </v>
<v Speaker 6>this way I was describing it was very </v>

2167
01:30:39.521 --> 01:30:44.521
<v Speaker 6>difficult to describe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I say that reality got very </v>

2168
01:30:44.521 --> 01:30:46.060
<v Speaker 6>slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like reality just didn't seem.</v>

2169
01:30:46.930 --> 01:30:50.140
<v Speaker 6>Didn't seem like A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could bang on it really anymore.</v>

2170
01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:55.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seemed like it seemed like the dmt </v>

2171
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:59.191
<v Speaker 6>experience is so powerful and so </v>
<v Speaker 6>incredibly beautiful and overwhelming </v>

2172
01:30:59.861 --> 01:31:04.861
<v Speaker 6>and shocking that when you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems more real than reality itself.</v>

2173
01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:08.650
<v Speaker 6>It seems like you're taking a look into </v>
<v Speaker 6>a better,</v>

2174
01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:13.030
<v Speaker 6>more pure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>efficient next stage reality.</v>

2175
01:31:13.031 --> 01:31:16.930
<v Speaker 6>It's like you feel like you're taking </v>
<v Speaker 6>this look into what's next.</v>

2176
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:21.990
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like an afterlife type of </v>

2177
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:21.990
<v Speaker 6>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's really what it feels like and</v>

2178
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:24.810
<v Speaker 6>then I would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would come back or I did come back for</v>

2179
01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:27.100
<v Speaker 6>him from it and then for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 6>weeks this,</v>

2180
01:31:27.101 --> 01:31:30.910
<v Speaker 6>this life just didn't seem like it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to hold up.</v>

2181
01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.900
<v Speaker 6>And so it felt like all this shit that </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm seeing everything around me.</v>

2182
01:31:34.901 --> 01:31:37.630
<v Speaker 6>It's like I'm assuming that this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>real.</v>

2183
01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:40.900
<v Speaker 6>I'm assuming that this is hard and this </v>
<v Speaker 6>is reality and this is life.</v>

2184
01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:46.260
<v Speaker 6>But after doing the dmt experience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that seems so much more real than </v>

2185
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:46.990
<v Speaker 6>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what the fuck is this?</v>

2186
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:48.310
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I started.</v>

2187
01:31:48.311 --> 01:31:49.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2188
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:54.080
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I started getting these weird ideas </v>

2189
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:54.080
<v Speaker 6>about like the structure of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2190
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.880
<v Speaker 6>of life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the pattern of,</v>

2191
01:31:55.881 --> 01:32:00.881
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of human existence and of everything </v>

2192
01:32:00.881 --> 01:32:03.121
<v Speaker 6>that's going on on the planet the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>time that it was really like much less </v>

2193
01:32:03.121 --> 01:32:05.230
<v Speaker 6>tangible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much less real than I thought it was.</v>

2194
01:32:05.231 --> 01:32:08.980
<v Speaker 6>And that perhaps the sleeping time when </v>
<v Speaker 6>your brain is producing dmt,</v>

2195
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:10.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when you're in heavy rem sleep,</v>

2196
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:14.410
<v Speaker 6>that might be just a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a much more intense version of life that</v>

2197
01:32:14.411 --> 01:32:16.000
<v Speaker 6>we only get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like in small doses.</v>

2198
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.640
<v Speaker 6>And that might be real life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this might be the crazy dream.</v>

2199
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.730
<v Speaker 6>Sounds Banana.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oop,</v>

2200
01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 6>I almost said it sounds fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

2201
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:24.910
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and rightly so,</v>

2202
01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.650
<v Speaker 6>but what are the alternatives?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2203
01:32:26.651 --> 01:32:29.160
<v Speaker 6>the alternative is any,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anytime you start talking about what,</v>

2204
01:32:29.170 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 6>what life could be or what drugs could </v>
<v Speaker 6>be or what hallucinations really mean,</v>

2205
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:36.070
<v Speaker 6>you open yourself up to ridicule.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rightly so,</v>

2206
01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.840
<v Speaker 6>because most of the time when you talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the subjects,</v>

2207
01:32:37.841 --> 01:32:40.480
<v Speaker 6>that sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what is the alternative?</v>

2208
01:32:40.481 --> 01:32:45.481
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the alternative is that we're just this </v>

2209
01:32:45.481 --> 01:32:46.540
<v Speaker 6>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fleshy thing that lives for 65 years.</v>

2210
01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:49.090
<v Speaker 6>Then you fucking die and you move on and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you breed while you're here.</v>

2211
01:32:49.091 --> 01:32:54.091
<v Speaker 6>And eventually there'll be too many of </v>
<v Speaker 6>us will blow the world up because </v>

2212
01:32:54.091 --> 01:32:54.091
<v Speaker 6>there's too many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the alternative,</v>

2213
01:32:54.091 --> 01:32:54.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that this,</v>

2214
01:32:54.521 --> 01:32:56.520
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing means anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2215
01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:59.710
<v Speaker 6>there is no purpose for any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unlike everything else in nature.</v>

2216
01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:01.810
<v Speaker 6>I mean everything else in nature is </v>
<v Speaker 6>building something,</v>

2217
01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:03.610
<v Speaker 6>supplying to something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2218
01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:08.611
<v Speaker 6>a part of an ecosystem has a very vital,</v>
<v Speaker 6>vital part in the whole process,</v>

2219
01:33:09.941 --> 01:33:14.941
<v Speaker 6>the natural process of life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything that we see from volcanoes </v>

2220
01:33:14.941 --> 01:33:18.871
<v Speaker 6>and fires and predators and prey all </v>
<v Speaker 6>seems to fit into this entire system </v>

2221
01:33:18.871 --> 01:33:21.050
<v Speaker 6>that except for human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2222
01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:25.330
<v Speaker 6>except for how we view our life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think we're just a really advanced</v>

2223
01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:27.720
<v Speaker 6>form of all that shit and that what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we're,</v>

2224
01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.760
<v Speaker 6>we're doing here and in this life is </v>
<v Speaker 6>setting us up somehow or another for </v>

2225
01:33:32.861 --> 01:33:37.861
<v Speaker 6>this next stage of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why every single culture is had </v>

2226
01:33:37.861 --> 01:33:41.101
<v Speaker 6>this idea of heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every single culture has had this idea </v>

2227
01:33:41.101 --> 01:33:43.741
<v Speaker 6>of a better place that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>go to somewhere where it's going to be </v>

2228
01:33:43.741 --> 01:33:45.910
<v Speaker 6>more pure or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there it'd be all love or be.</v>

2229
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:48.040
<v Speaker 6>There's all these different various </v>
<v Speaker 6>versions of it.</v>

2230
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:53.070
<v Speaker 6>I think it's because there's a part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>us instinctively that understands that </v>

2231
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:57.811
<v Speaker 6>this is a stage and that like everything</v>
<v Speaker 6>else in the universe from the big bang </v>

2232
01:33:57.811 --> 01:34:02.431
<v Speaker 6>to the formation of stars to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>formation of planets to life forming on </v>

2233
01:34:02.431 --> 01:34:06.001
<v Speaker 6>planets to life evolving and getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>more advanced that are all keeps moving </v>

2234
01:34:06.001 --> 01:34:06.670
<v Speaker 6>on towards some new,</v>
<v Speaker 6>better,</v>

2235
01:34:06.671 --> 01:34:08.230
<v Speaker 6>more improved,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2236
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:11.770
<v Speaker 6>more advanced thing and that that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>what's going to happen to us too.</v>

2237
01:34:12.650 --> 01:34:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does your,</v>

2238
01:34:13.521 --> 01:34:16.220
<v Speaker 2>did your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did that last dmt experience though?</v>

2239
01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Like that was last time you did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was last time I did it.</v>

2240
01:34:18.171 --> 01:34:23.171
<v Speaker 2>Did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does your experience afterwards also </v>

2241
01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:23.450
<v Speaker 2>kind of make you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I should do</v>

2242
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.460
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or.</v>

2243
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:25.300
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2244
01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:26.380
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2245
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:31.410
<v Speaker 6>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reason why I haven't done it since </v>

2246
01:34:31.410 --> 01:34:31.410
<v Speaker 6>then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's because I still,</v>

2247
01:34:31.410 --> 01:34:32.950
<v Speaker 6>I still think I'm still trying to </v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly process,</v>

2248
01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:36.370
<v Speaker 6>like honestly process what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I could do it now again,</v>

2249
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:38.410
<v Speaker 6>I might be willing to do it now again if</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had some,</v>

2250
01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:43.740
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's just as important to </v>
<v Speaker 6>try to honestly process what happened in</v>

2251
01:34:44.891 --> 01:34:49.891
<v Speaker 6>the last experience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to try to learn as much from it as you </v>

2252
01:34:49.891 --> 01:34:49.891
<v Speaker 6>can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2253
01:34:49.891 --> 01:34:54.600
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the one of the things you do experience </v>

2254
01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.870
<v Speaker 6>when you have any like really extreme </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic experience,</v>

2255
01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:58.550
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you this complete dissolving</v>

2256
01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:00.980
<v Speaker 1>of your ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything like you've built yourself up</v>

2257
01:35:00.981 --> 01:35:03.380
<v Speaker 1>to be everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're your language,</v>

2258
01:35:03.381 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 1>the way you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your social structure,</v>

2259
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:10.810
<v Speaker 1>how you fit in with your friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family and your dog and all that </v>

2260
01:35:10.810 --> 01:35:10.810
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yourself.</v>

2261
01:35:10.810 --> 01:35:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Definition all dissolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything dissolved and your definition</v>

2262
01:35:14.601 --> 01:35:17.000
<v Speaker 1>of the world of earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human beings.</v>

2263
01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:22.060
<v Speaker 1>All that dissolves too and you start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at things in this almost like this </v>

2264
01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:25.750
<v Speaker 1>alien perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I always say that like when </v>

2265
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.750
<v Speaker 1>you're taking mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like,</v>

2266
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:29.510
<v Speaker 1>and even damn it feels like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the universe through the eyes</v>

2267
01:35:29.511 --> 01:35:34.511
<v Speaker 1>of an alien of like a super advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>organic light form.</v>

2268
01:35:34.581 --> 01:35:35.720
<v Speaker 1>That's far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

2269
01:35:35.721 --> 01:35:40.721
<v Speaker 1>far evolved from where we are at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time and you get to see the </v>

2270
01:35:40.721 --> 01:35:43.970
<v Speaker 1>whole thing objectively and clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the context of any of the things</v>

2271
01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:47.470
<v Speaker 1>you already understand and know about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like language and accents and you know,</v>

2272
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.480
<v Speaker 1>jobs and all that bullshit you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it all like in some weird sort </v>

2273
01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:52.580
<v Speaker 1>of way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you do that,</v>

2274
01:35:52.581 --> 01:35:53.900
<v Speaker 1>the problem is a fucking.</v>

2275
01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you have a crazy dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2276
01:35:57.051 --> 01:36:02.051
<v Speaker 1>a crazy dmt sort of trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem is reassembling </v>

2277
01:36:02.051 --> 01:36:06.491
<v Speaker 1>back into the regular world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem as the like being </v>

2278
01:36:06.491 --> 01:36:10.601
<v Speaker 1>around like regular people in mundane </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and try to take it all seriously </v>

2279
01:36:10.601 --> 01:36:11.750
<v Speaker 1>and trying to focus on all the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do.</v>

2280
01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:13.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2281
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:18.250
<v Speaker 1>you do have to do as I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences are useless if </v>

2282
01:36:18.591 --> 01:36:23.591
<v Speaker 1>you can't bring something back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't learn something that you </v>

2283
01:36:23.591 --> 01:36:26.381
<v Speaker 1>can apply to this world because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world where you're spending most of </v>

2284
01:36:26.381 --> 01:36:26.381
<v Speaker 1>your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2285
01:36:26.381 --> 01:36:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2286
01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

2287
01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.860
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of your time is spent in the waking</v>

2288
01:36:30.861 --> 01:36:31.700
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2289
01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:36.701
<v Speaker 1>so if you're having these psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>trips and that's what you really enjoy </v>

2290
01:36:36.701 --> 01:36:36.701
<v Speaker 1>it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's all,</v>

2291
01:36:36.701 --> 01:36:37.730
<v Speaker 1>you're all enjoying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2292
01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:42.080
<v Speaker 1>these experiences and you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not enjoying the regular world at</v>

2293
01:36:42.081 --> 01:36:43.070
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's out there.</v>

2522
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I've already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already applied that data to my </v>

2523
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:33.671
<v Speaker 1>view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to see more and more </v>

2524
01:46:33.671 --> 01:46:36.311
<v Speaker 1>evidence of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that there are some extreme </v>

2525
01:46:36.311 --> 01:46:39.581
<v Speaker 1>examples of fucked up shit out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially going online and just go </v>

2526
01:46:39.581 --> 01:46:41.600
<v Speaker 1>online changes your whole fucking view </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

2527
01:46:41.650 --> 01:46:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who don't go online to imagine </v>

2528
01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:48.881
<v Speaker 1>how dumb are parents were much less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew about the big picture about </v>

2529
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:50.520
<v Speaker 1>what's possible.</v>

2530
01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.220
<v Speaker 1>What's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

2531
01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:59.260
<v Speaker 1>If you try to tell them like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times it doesn't even have to be </v>

2532
01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:02.140
<v Speaker 1>something too outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama would.</v>

2533
01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:07.160
<v Speaker 1>A Bama said he was talking about fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>ipods and x boxes and IPADS and Xbox,</v>

2534
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:14.490
<v Speaker 1>none of which I know how to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate all that.</v>

2535
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:15.720
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate all that,</v>

2536
01:47:15.721 --> 01:47:17.550
<v Speaker 1>none of which I know how to use what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying,</v>

2537
01:47:17.551 --> 01:47:22.551
<v Speaker 1>that these things provide information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's too much information and it's </v>

2538
01:47:22.551 --> 01:47:25.020
<v Speaker 1>difficult to discern what's factual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not and that crazy ideas can gain</v>

2539
01:47:25.021 --> 01:47:30.021
<v Speaker 1>traction and become problematic and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying that it's actually makes it </v>

2540
01:47:30.021 --> 01:47:31.350
<v Speaker 1>hard on democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was hilarious.</v>

2541
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Makes it hard to run the country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad for the country somehow or </v>

2542
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:39.281
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that line just appeals to like a </v>

2543
01:47:39.281 --> 01:47:39.390
<v Speaker 1>certain generation when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when none of which I know how to use.</v>

2544
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:40.620
<v Speaker 1>This is what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

2545
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:43.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ipos and xboxes and playstations,</v>

2546
01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:48.920
<v Speaker 1>none of which I know how to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fucking two year old daughter knows </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And don't brag about about being stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Accept that and just be yourself.</v>

2559
01:48:16.321 --> 01:48:18.540
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fucking pretend you don't know how</v>

2560
01:48:18.541 --> 01:48:20.100
<v Speaker 1>to work an Ipod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2561
01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2562
01:48:21.381 --> 01:48:22.980
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gross.</v>

2563
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking dumb,</v>

2564
01:48:24.811 --> 01:48:25.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2565
01:48:25.631 --> 01:48:28.290
<v Speaker 1>like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's putting on an act.</v>

2566
01:48:28.291 --> 01:48:30.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's like a comic that we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier.</v>

2567
01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:32.970
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about comics that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>disingenuous.</v>

2568
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a phone.</v>

2569
01:48:34.361 --> 01:48:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2570
01:48:35.131 --> 01:48:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2571
01:48:36.281 --> 01:48:39.180
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to say that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another,</v>

2572
01:48:39.210 --> 01:48:41.400
<v Speaker 1>all this access to information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have.</v>

2573
01:48:41.401 --> 01:48:46.401
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that these crazy ideas </v>

2574
01:48:46.401 --> 01:48:49.230
<v Speaker 1>can gain traction and then it become a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes more of a distraction than it is</v>

2575
01:48:49.290 --> 01:48:53.580
<v Speaker 1>a useless a source of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's ridiculous.</v>

2576
01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:56.550
<v Speaker 1>So who's the use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the useful source of information?</v>

2577
01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:59.370
<v Speaker 1>How come there's so much shit that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the news that we don't hear about?</v>

2578
01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:04.450
<v Speaker 1>How about how can we have to go online </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find out what's happened in Liberia </v>

2579
01:49:04.450 --> 01:49:06.960
<v Speaker 1>to get real information about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking oil spill in the Gulf?</v>

2580
01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:12.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting that shit from the </v>

<v Speaker 1>put it up and showed how massive it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how they're being.</v>

2586
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.540
<v Speaker 1>They're not being honest about what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe it is.</v>

2633
01:51:18.850 --> 01:51:22.630
<v Speaker 1>He just fucking gave Halliburton some </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant $500,</v>

2634
01:51:22.631 --> 01:51:24.470
<v Speaker 1>million dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bid contracts.</v>

2635
01:51:24.570 --> 01:51:28.600
<v Speaker 1>His whole fucking platform was that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to end no bid contracts.</v>

2636
01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just doesn't,</v>

2637
01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:30.790
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2638
01:51:30.791 --> 01:51:32.950
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's no more lobbyists.</v>

2639
01:51:32.951 --> 01:51:35.140
<v Speaker 1>We only hires a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2640
01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:40.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea behind being a president </v>

2641
01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:44.490
<v Speaker 1>is that you're supposed to be some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a leader and what you promise us is </v>

2642
01:51:44.490 --> 01:51:45.910
<v Speaker 1>supposed supposed to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

2643
01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:48.400
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna when you get an office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to change shit.</v>

2644
01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:51.040
<v Speaker 1>You're going to make it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one does.</v>

2645
01:51:51.070 --> 01:51:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest hustle ever,</v>

2646
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:58.470
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I think nobody ever </v>

2647
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.470
<v Speaker 1>admits is that neither side ever does </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever like ever,</v>

2648
01:51:58.470 --> 01:52:03.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Republicans good get criticized by </v>

2649
01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:03.220
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats when they do certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2650
01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:04.410
<v Speaker 1>but once the Democrats get in office </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

2651
01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:09.220
<v Speaker 1>there's not nearly as many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing Obama for sending 30,000</v>

2652
01:52:09.221 --> 01:52:12.100
<v Speaker 1>troops over to Afghanistan after winning</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nobel prize.</v>

2653
01:52:12.190 --> 01:52:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Not nearly as many as were criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>George Bush.</v>

2654
01:52:14.650 --> 01:52:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Of course not nailing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2655
01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:20.560
<v Speaker 1>they're all just spokesperson because </v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides are completely full of shit.</v>

2656
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they're full of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you think they say whatever the </v>

2657
01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.431
<v Speaker 1>fuck they have to say to get the job and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then once they get the job they realize </v>

2658
01:52:29.431 --> 01:52:30.400
<v Speaker 1>that they don't have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a say.</v>

2659
01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:35.610
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the ones who get to dictate </v>

2660
01:52:35.610 --> 01:52:35.610
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2661
01:52:35.610 --> 01:52:36.500
<v Speaker 1>it's that and it's also that the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself of,</v>

2662
01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:39.520
<v Speaker 1>of politics is so already dictated for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2663
01:52:39.521 --> 01:52:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this idea that like we can elect</v>

2664
01:52:43.601 --> 01:52:45.250
<v Speaker 1>somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like Obama,</v>

2665
01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 1>like it's going to change</v>

2666
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:46.760
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna,</v>

2667
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:49.130
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna actually the system will </v>
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

2668
01:52:49.131 --> 01:52:53.270
<v Speaker 2>like he's going to be a certain way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>no more like spinning stuff,</v>

2669
01:52:53.271 --> 01:52:55.670
<v Speaker 2>but you realize that it's already laid </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2670
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:58.430
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a spin thing in effect job,</v>

2671
01:52:58.490 --> 01:53:01.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a job and so it's like being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2672
01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:04.550
<v Speaker 2>It's really just like being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prospective professional spokesperson.</v>

2673
01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:09.640
<v Speaker 2>It is and there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>distortions of truth and manipulations </v>

2674
01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:11.460
<v Speaker 2>and lies no matter who gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2675
01:53:11.490 --> 01:53:13.580
<v Speaker 2>it's too big of a thing and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

2676
01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:18.740
<v Speaker 2>There's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too many people that you would have to </v>

2677
01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:18.740
<v Speaker 2>try to please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be impossible.</v>

2678
01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:20.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the way it is.</v>

2679
01:53:20.121 --> 01:53:23.390
<v Speaker 2>People are going to lie and no matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>who is in the office,</v>

2680
01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:24.020
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter</v>

2681
01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.610
<v Speaker 6>who were the real problem is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>corporate.</v>

2682
01:53:25.611 --> 01:53:27.680
<v Speaker 6>If you ever seen like movies on </v>
<v Speaker 6>corporations,</v>

2683
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:31.730
<v Speaker 6>especially the document,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the documentary of the corporation where</v>

2684
01:53:31.731 --> 01:53:36.731
<v Speaker 6>they talk about like a corporation as </v>
<v Speaker 6>like associate sociopath or they don't </v>

2685
01:53:36.731 --> 01:53:40.091
<v Speaker 6>worry at all about their.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really interesting because they </v>

2686
01:53:40.091 --> 01:53:42.880
<v Speaker 6>basically concentrate on what the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what sociopaths do is very similar to </v>

2687
01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.170
<v Speaker 6>what corporations do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't worry about who their actions</v>

2688
01:53:45.171 --> 01:53:50.171
<v Speaker 6>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that being in a corporation is sort </v>

2689
01:53:50.171 --> 01:53:52.871
<v Speaker 6>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a diffusion of responsibility </v>

2690
01:53:52.871 --> 01:53:52.871
<v Speaker 6>because there's so many other people </v>
<v Speaker 6>that are doing the same thing.</v>

2691
01:53:52.871 --> 01:53:57.190
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I wonder like when when you get a </v>

2692
01:53:57.190 --> 01:53:59.381
<v Speaker 6>guy like Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if they start out with the </v>

2693
01:53:59.381 --> 01:54:02.771
<v Speaker 6>right intentions and they start out </v>
<v Speaker 6>really thinking that they're going to </v>

2694
01:54:02.771 --> 01:54:03.500
<v Speaker 6>make a change,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but once they get an office,</v>

2695
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:08.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once they get in there maybe then it's </v>

2696
01:54:08.530 --> 01:54:08.530
<v Speaker 6>like they realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2697
01:54:08.530 --> 01:54:09.290
<v Speaker 6>like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't get to change shit,</v>

2698
01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:09.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't,</v>

2699
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:14.890
<v Speaker 6>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what they changed a few social </v>

2700
01:54:14.890 --> 01:54:14.890
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

2701
01:54:14.890 --> 01:54:17.030
<v Speaker 6>It changed like the gay marriage thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they're getting rid of don't ask,</v>

2702
01:54:17.031 --> 01:54:17.690
<v Speaker 6>don't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2703
01:54:17.691 --> 01:54:22.691
<v Speaker 6>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be able to say that </v>

2704
01:54:22.691 --> 01:54:22.691
<v Speaker 6>you're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2705
01:54:22.691 --> 01:54:22.910
<v Speaker 6>and he's also like the medical marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

2706
01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.620
<v Speaker 6>they said that they're not going to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>after,</v>

2707
01:54:24.621 --> 01:54:29.621
<v Speaker 6>they're only going to go after the dea </v>
<v Speaker 6>will only go after medical marijuana </v>

2708
01:54:29.621 --> 01:54:31.340
<v Speaker 6>dispensaries that violate both state and</v>
<v Speaker 6>federal law.</v>

2709
01:54:31.610 --> 01:54:33.820
<v Speaker 6>So the federal law is all marijuana is </v>
<v Speaker 6>illegal,</v>

2710
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:38.830
<v Speaker 6>the state law is very clearly defined </v>
<v Speaker 6>what you're allowed to do medically and </v>

2711
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:42.370
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people don't operate within </v>
<v Speaker 6>those parameters and they sell a bunch </v>

2712
01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:42.920
<v Speaker 6>of shit to people that don't have </v>
<v Speaker 6>licenses.</v>

2713
01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:45.140
<v Speaker 6>So the idea was they're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>after those people,</v>

2714
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:46.730
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2715
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:48.530
<v Speaker 6>There's a few things that do change,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2716
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:49.270
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2717
01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they hang their hat on.</v>

2718
01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:55.900
<v Speaker 6>What are those things that do change?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are they because they have to give </v>

2719
01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.870
<v Speaker 6>something other than otherwise people </v>
<v Speaker 6>will fucking just rage up,</v>

2720
01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:04.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do they like give you a little just to </v>

2721
01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:06.001
<v Speaker 6>keep democracy in tact and just resist </v>
<v Speaker 6>the change as much as possible resists </v>

2722
01:55:06.071 --> 01:55:08.560
<v Speaker 6>giving the people what they want as much</v>
<v Speaker 6>as possible.</v>

2723
01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.180
<v Speaker 6>Is it consciously thought out?</v>

2724
01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the way that the system is set </v>

2725
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:17.100
<v Speaker 2>up is that this is what bothers me the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most about politics,</v>

2726
01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:22.340
<v Speaker 2>is for some reason you're not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>admit fault in politics.</v>

2727
01:55:23.630 --> 01:55:26.730
<v Speaker 2>You can't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did something.</v>

2728
01:55:27.570 --> 01:55:32.570
<v Speaker 2>This didn't work out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the system that set up and that </v>

2729
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:33.590
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that part is like,</v>

2730
01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:35.940
<v Speaker 2>it is thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever decision you made,</v>

2731
01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:39.000
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make it look like it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right decision.</v>

2732
01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the major flaw in,</v>

2733
01:55:43.670 --> 01:55:47.550
<v Speaker 2>in like the political public system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't admit to any floor,</v>

2734
01:55:47.650 --> 01:55:48.570
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

2735
01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:53.620
<v Speaker 6>If you do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to lose traction and you </v>

2736
01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:53.620
<v Speaker 6>and you become a flip flopper or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

2737
01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:57.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's always like what I did was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right thing and that is meticulous.</v>

2738
01:55:58.011 --> 01:55:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's methodical.</v>

2739
01:55:59.511 --> 01:56:00.050
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2740
01:56:00.110 --> 01:56:01.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very well,</v>

2741
01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:02.140
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2742
01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:04.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's outlined.</v>

2743
01:56:04.011 --> 01:56:09.011
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking the most depressing thing </v>

2744
01:56:09.011 --> 01:56:09.011
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

2745
01:56:09.011 --> 01:56:09.011
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is.</v>

2746

<v Speaker 2>like he was a very independent,</v>

2782
01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:54.040
<v Speaker 2>like sort of a loner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a super athlete.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2862
02:01:26.850 --> 02:01:29.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time I saw two girls,</v>

2863
02:01:29.951 --> 02:01:34.120
<v Speaker 4>one cup was very alarming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one guy,</v>

2864
02:01:34.121 --> 02:01:37.390
<v Speaker 4>one cup definitely was more like get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck outta here.</v>

2865
02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:39.470
<v Speaker 4>And then one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one cup,</v>

2866
02:01:39.471 --> 02:01:41.390
<v Speaker 4>the most disturbing thing was the scars </v>
<v Speaker 4>around his.</v>

2867
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

02:01:42.741 --> 02:01:47.741
<v Speaker 4>he's been doing this for awhile or his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about his basically non-reaction to </v>

2869
02:01:47.741 --> 02:01:52.360
<v Speaker 4>what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take the cream and how or even quiver </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even buckle.</v>

2872
02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Homeboys got giant chunks of glass and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood coming out of his asshole and he's</v>

2873
02:01:58.631 --> 02:02:00.640
<v Speaker 1>just fine with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you haven't seen it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

02:02:02.021 --> 02:02:03.550
<v Speaker 1>don't go to one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Cup.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mrs Hanson.</v>

2882
02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:22.530
<v Speaker 4>The things that I don't like the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that I can't react to or like</v>

2883

<v Speaker 1>They're too big,</v>

2891
02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not built like Arabs.</v>

02:02:47.831 --> 02:02:52.831
<v Speaker 1>They're like big bulky fat fucking be </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding American psychos and really </v>

2893
02:02:52.831 --> 02:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>invested in the idea is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's doing what he's not supposed to be </v>

2896
02:03:03.151 --> 02:03:03.151
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going in a place where he's not supposed</v>

2897
02:03:03.151 --> 02:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>to be going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they jacked him,</v>

2898
02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:09.180
<v Speaker 1>arrested him and cut his fucking head </v>
<v Speaker 1>off so that he could act as a deterrent </v>

2899
02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:14.520
<v Speaker 1>for people that want to go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate this and can get people </v>

<v Speaker 1>tool.</v>

2905
02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Like Samsung guy finds out some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not supposed to find out or go </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an award that's not a very popular war</v>

<v Speaker 2>could kill somebody.</v>

2923
02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2924
02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you're going to react if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>crosses a certain line where it happens.</v>

2925
02:04:17.590 --> 02:04:20.160
<v Speaker 2>But to cut someone's head off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be a savage mother.</v>

2926
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Especially with a little knife.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2938

<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many fucking people have been killed</v>

2939
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:54.660

<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

02:04:54.661 --> 02:04:56.850
<v Speaker 6>how many people are in Guantanamo Bay </v>

<v Speaker 6>buildings and shit at a certain number?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A certain.</v>

2943
02:05:04.151 --> 02:05:05.910
<v Speaker 6>Certainly you see a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 6>casualties.</v>

2944

<v Speaker 6>I think life starts to get real cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2945
02:05:08.351 --> 02:05:12.180
<v Speaker 6>we see it a certain amount of collateral</v>
<v Speaker 6>damage that happens.</v>

2946
02:05:12.181 --> 02:05:15.180
<v Speaker 6>It's just a part of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think for a lot of these guys,</v>

2947
02:05:15.181 --> 02:05:17.190
<v Speaker 6>life just starts to get started to get </v>

<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>scary shit.</v>

2951
02:05:21.031 --> 02:05:24.930
<v Speaker 6>The idea that someone is willing to cut </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone's head off for a video,</v>

2952
02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:27.930
<v Speaker 6>but if you look at like operation </v>
<v Speaker 6>northwoods,</v>

2953
02:05:28.170 --> 02:05:33.170
<v Speaker 6>if you look at that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of attacking Americans and </v>

2954
02:05:33.170 --> 02:05:34.050
<v Speaker 6>blaming on Cubans so that we can go to </v>
<v Speaker 6>war.</v>

2955
02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:38.280
<v Speaker 6>It really fits into the whole like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>past scheme of things.</v>

2956
02:05:38.710 --> 02:05:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you have to get the American people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your side for shit like this.</v>

2959
02:05:45.731 --> 02:05:47.830
<v Speaker 2>So that's why there's always a big push,</v>

<v Speaker 6>and it didn't look in the replay like it</v>

2975
02:06:24.681 --> 02:06:25.640
<v Speaker 6>hit him at all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it looked like.</v>

2976
02:06:26.380 --> 02:06:28.730
<v Speaker 6>And he went down and it was like making </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2977
02:06:28.731 --> 02:06:31.580
<v Speaker 6>like he was really badly hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he was hurting.</v>

2978
02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:34.310
<v Speaker 6>He says he was so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it didn't look real.</v>

2979
02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:37.340
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it might've been part of his strategy to</v>

2980
02:06:37.341 --> 02:06:39.410
<v Speaker 6>fuck with this dude because he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>relentless.</v>

2981
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:41.860
<v Speaker 6>He taunting and tormenting them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he would take them down.</v>

2982
02:06:41.890 --> 02:06:44.840
<v Speaker 6>He was talking shit to him while I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>on top of him beating him up and the guy</v>

2983
02:06:44.841 --> 02:06:47.630
<v Speaker 6>just could not get up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And every time he wanted to he took them</v>

2984
02:06:47.631 --> 02:06:52.631
<v Speaker 6>down in the last 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's just talking shit to this dude </v>

2985
02:06:52.631 --> 02:06:56.290
<v Speaker 6>while he's on top of him always trying </v>
<v Speaker 6>to gouge his eyes when he's on the </v>

2986
02:06:56.290 --> 02:06:56.300
<v Speaker 6>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was crazy,</v>

2987
02:06:56.301 --> 02:06:57.650
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he was just like,</v>

2988
02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:02.680
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but whatever he said it was driving him </v>

2989
02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:02.680
<v Speaker 6>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So anyway,</v>

2990
02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:05.100
<v Speaker 6>the bell ends to the round.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He gets off the students,</v>

2991
02:07:05.110 --> 02:07:10.110
<v Speaker 6>starts to walk away and Paul daily walks</v>
<v Speaker 6>up behind him like when like walks up </v>

2992
02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:15.071
<v Speaker 6>behind the referee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>walks up to him and sucker punches him </v>

2993
02:07:15.071 --> 02:07:15.140
<v Speaker 6>after the fight was over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2994
02:07:15.141 --> 02:07:18.330
<v Speaker 6>it gets booted from the UFC for life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which you know,</v>

2995
02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:20.360
<v Speaker 6>can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know that,</v>

2996
02:07:20.361 --> 02:07:25.361
<v Speaker 6>that you can't have a fight and then try</v>
<v Speaker 6>to sucker punch a guy because you didn't</v>

2997
02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:30.371
<v Speaker 6>get to hit them for 15 minutes because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he was too good because it was taking </v>

2998
02:07:30.371 --> 02:07:31.550
<v Speaker 6>you down and he was imposing his game </v>
<v Speaker 6>plan on you and they sucker punch.</v>

2999
02:07:31.550 --> 02:07:33.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm daily as booted for life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For Life.</v>

3000
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:35.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He fucked up you and,</v>

3001
02:07:35.351 --> 02:07:38.240
<v Speaker 6>and Dana White got really Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He asked him a question like,</v>

3002
02:07:38.290 --> 02:07:40.120
<v Speaker 6>you asked him apparently after the fight</v>
<v Speaker 6>was over,</v>

3003
02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:41.190
<v Speaker 6>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3004
02:07:41.230 --> 02:07:43.020
<v Speaker 6>do you still want to fight in the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

3005
02:07:43.021 --> 02:07:48.021
<v Speaker 6>like why are you doing shit like this is</v>
<v Speaker 6>like any like shrug his shoulders and </v>

3006
02:07:48.021 --> 02:07:48.021
<v Speaker 6>walked away and Dana White was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good,</v>

3007
02:07:48.021 --> 02:07:50.260
<v Speaker 6>well now you want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll make that decision for you and just</v>

3008
02:07:50.261 --> 02:07:51.820
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't do shit like that if you do,</v>

3009
02:07:52.350 --> 02:07:57.350
<v Speaker 6>you've got to keep your composure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you talk a lot of shit before the </v>

3010
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.350
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And He,</v>

3011
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:59.080
<v Speaker 6>this guy talks mad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that's his thing.</v>

3012
02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:04.320
<v Speaker 6>And cost check talks mad shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So Paul Dale and construct which is </v>

3013
02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:06.370
<v Speaker 6>going back and forth and back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it generated an incredible amount of</v>

3014
02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:07.360
<v Speaker 6>interest in the fight.</v>

3015
02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:12.630
<v Speaker 6>But it also put an incredible amount of </v>
<v Speaker 6>pressure on him and when he was getting </v>

3016
02:08:12.630 --> 02:08:15.691
<v Speaker 6>his ass kicked and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and when it was over and it just got </v>

3017
02:08:15.691 --> 02:08:16.750
<v Speaker 6>molested for fucking three rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like an end of the knee,</v>

3018
02:08:16.751 --> 02:08:18.520
<v Speaker 6>which may or may not have hit cost </v>
<v Speaker 6>check.</v>

3019
02:08:18.521 --> 02:08:20.620
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it made it look like a big deal.</v>

3020
02:08:20.621 --> 02:08:25.621
<v Speaker 6>And Kasha Globe was lying on her stomach</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it was like making it look like he </v>

3021
02:08:25.621 --> 02:08:26.410
<v Speaker 6>was out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then when the referee said to him,</v>

3022
02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:28.090
<v Speaker 6>referee said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get up.</v>

3023
02:08:28.091 --> 02:08:30.310
<v Speaker 6>I saw the replay Denberg Eliade goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get up.</v>

3024
02:08:30.311 --> 02:08:31.450
<v Speaker 6>I saw the replay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It didn't hit you.</v>

3025
02:08:31.451 --> 02:08:31.960
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3026
02:08:31.961 --> 02:08:33.280
<v Speaker 6>can you give us vaseline?</v>
<v Speaker 6>None of my eye.</v>

3027
02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:37.510
<v Speaker 1>And he gets the vaseline was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to fighting like normal.</v>

3028
02:08:37.511 --> 02:08:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened if you were almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead just a few seconds ago.</v>

3029
02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:46.100
<v Speaker 6>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that was all part of his </v>

3030
02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:47.370
<v Speaker 6>psychological strategy to just fuck that</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude's head up and it works.</v>

3031
02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:48.150
<v Speaker 6>Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 6>line and sinker.</v>

3032
02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:50.010
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end of the fight,</v>

3033
02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3034
02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Montreal's in the middle of this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>playoff.</v>

3035
02:08:53.670 --> 02:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>The Canadians against Pittsburgh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes and he grabs the microphone,</v>

3036
02:08:58.170 --> 02:09:03.170
<v Speaker 1>who's don't worry about it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked going to kick your fucking ass </v>

3037
02:09:03.170 --> 02:09:03.170
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go nuts.</v>

3038
02:09:03.170 --> 02:09:08.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never seen anybody like a sport or </v>

3039
02:09:08.151 --> 02:09:09.840
<v Speaker 1>love hockey more than the Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3040
02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Do they go nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he said Nafta,</v>

3041
02:09:12.210 --> 02:09:15.390
<v Speaker 1>that I'm going to beat GSP and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fucking losses.</v>

3042
02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>And they went nuts and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3043
02:09:17.341 --> 02:09:22.341
<v Speaker 1>and he leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile the dude is a fucking </v>

3044
02:09:22.341 --> 02:09:22.790
<v Speaker 1>master strategist when it comes to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3045
02:09:22.791 --> 02:09:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3046
02:09:23.311 --> 02:09:24.000
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

3047
02:09:24.001 --> 02:09:27.790
<v Speaker 1>he's playing the heel and everyone will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be so excited to see his friends.</v>

3048
02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's fucking brilliant man </v>
<v Speaker 1>generates so much more interest and made</v>

3049
02:09:32.191 --> 02:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>himself a great villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3050
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:36.450
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the black hat and the business,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But dude,</v>

3053
02:09:38.881 --> 02:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>the fucking disappointment in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadians when he goes,</v>

3054

<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it because is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick your fucking ass next week.</v>

3055
02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:51.140
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like you said something about </v>

<v Speaker 6>They were so upset.</v>

3059
02:09:54.931 --> 02:09:59.931
<v Speaker 6>I've never seen a crowd more universally</v>
<v Speaker 6>excited about a sport and a team than </v>

3060
02:10:01.711 --> 02:10:03.500
<v Speaker 6>the Canadians are about their hockey </v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

3061
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:05.700
<v Speaker 6>When they won,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we got there Thursday night and they won</v>

3062
02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:09.330

<v Speaker 6>It came from behind them one and when we</v>

3063

<v Speaker 6>They want to fund the leader to the hood</v>

3067

<v Speaker 6>They could not hold him back.</v>

3068
02:10:20.850 --> 02:10:21.670
<v Speaker 6>He took the mic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the go.</v>

3069
02:10:21.671 --> 02:10:26.671
<v Speaker 6>They tried to stop him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He couldn't stop him and he's fucking </v>

3070
02:10:26.671 --> 02:10:29.091
<v Speaker 6>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's beeping his arm and everybody </v>

3071
02:10:29.091 --> 02:10:29.091
<v Speaker 6>else's beeping alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a fucking party down the street.</v>

3072
02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:33.090
<v Speaker 6>Every car was honking their horn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People were jumping on top of the hoods,</v>

3073
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 6>cars and screaming</v>

3074
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:39.160
<v Speaker 2>and yelling and everyone in a big smile </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their face like you've never seen so </v>

3075
02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:43.241
<v Speaker 2>many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>united people that weren't at the game </v>

3076
02:10:43.241 --> 02:10:43.241
<v Speaker 2>because people that were leaving the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

3077
02:10:43.241 --> 02:10:44.660
<v Speaker 2>they were fine up to everybody on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

3078
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:46.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like your family.</v>

3079
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

3080
02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:52.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a level of love for a sport and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>

3081
02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:55.160
<v Speaker 2>They must take it hard though when those</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys lose.</v>

3082
02:10:55.190 --> 02:10:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3083
02:10:56.700 --> 02:10:59.450
<v Speaker 2>That's devastating to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in Vancouver when like,</v>

3084
02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:01.700
<v Speaker 2>I think it wasn't even like the an NHL </v>
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>

3085
02:11:01.701 --> 02:11:04.520
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a club league team was playing,</v>

3086
02:11:04.521 --> 02:11:07.640
<v Speaker 2>like their club team was playing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses shut down.</v>

3087
02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:09.760
<v Speaker 2>People were on the streets for a game </v>
<v Speaker 2>like there.</v>

3088
02:11:10.090 --> 02:11:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Everything's going to be different </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight.</v>

3089
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:12.620
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3090
02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:14.540
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see that in America,</v>

3091
02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:15.520
<v Speaker 2>but not more.</v>

3092
02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:18.090
<v Speaker 1>At least when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the red sox,</v>

3093
02:11:18.091 --> 02:11:20.810
<v Speaker 1>when the red sox won the world series </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the bill buckner when the,</v>

3094
02:11:20.811 --> 02:11:23.420
<v Speaker 1>when the ball went through his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a big goddamn deal.</v>

3095
02:11:23.421 --> 02:11:28.421
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole city was into that and people </v>

3096
02:11:28.421 --> 02:11:28.820
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been a very similar situation.</v>

3097
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:32.180
<v Speaker 1>They had won the world series back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe it's still like that.</v>

3098
02:11:32.181 --> 02:11:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not in Boston anymore,</v>

3099
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:38.770

<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it ever being the </v>

3100
02:11:38.770 --> 02:11:38.770
<v Speaker 1>intensity level that it wasn't Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Canada.</v>

02:15:44.781 --> 02:15:47.090
<v Speaker 1>He was working on a tower over in Abu </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ghraib.</v>

3202
02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.600
<v Speaker 1>He took digital pictures of inside Abu </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ghraib,</v>

3203
02:15:50.601 --> 02:15:55.601
<v Speaker 1>hence the kidnapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why they killed that guy and </v>

3204
02:15:55.601 --> 02:15:57.020
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously a conspiracy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my man rivalries.</v>

3205
02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:59.480
<v Speaker 1>But that would make sense if that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>had witnessed,</v>

3206
02:15:59.510 --> 02:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Abu Ghraib,</v>

3207
02:16:01.250 --> 02:16:05.590
<v Speaker 1>a atrocities before we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who got his head cut off when he</v>

3208
02:16:05.591 --> 02:16:09.140
<v Speaker 1>said that he was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his head was cut off by CIA guys.</v>

3209
02:16:09.170 --> 02:16:10.470
<v Speaker 1>It totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3210
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I think they'd be willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3211
02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:15.330
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

3212
02:16:16.330 --> 02:16:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't got no solutions folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only got questions.</v>

3213
02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:21.350
<v Speaker 1>You got any solutions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Vaughn answers to anything.</v>

3214
02:16:21.351 --> 02:16:23.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the goddamn problem is that there</v>

3215
02:16:23.991 --> 02:16:28.991
<v Speaker 1>are no answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need a radical restructuring of our </v>

3216
02:16:28.991 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 1>entire fucking society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our entire</v>

3217
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:35.250
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's not going to happen anytime </v>

3218
02:16:35.250 --> 02:16:35.250
<v Speaker 6>in our lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what do we.</v>

3219
02:16:35.250 --> 02:16:35.380
<v Speaker 6>Did we put a patch on things?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3220
02:16:35.650 --> 02:16:39.040
<v Speaker 6>you try to control your micro world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what you do,</v>

3221
02:16:39.041 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 6>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is my advice.</v>

3222
02:16:41.170 --> 02:16:46.170
<v Speaker 6>You want some advice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>control all the people that are around </v>

3223
02:16:46.170 --> 02:16:46.170
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>control what you do for a living,</v>

3224
02:16:46.170 --> 02:16:48.490
<v Speaker 6>control your body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>control your mind,</v>

3225
02:16:48.491 --> 02:16:53.491
<v Speaker 6>control how you treat other people and </v>
<v Speaker 6>what kind of treatment you'll accept </v>

3226
02:16:53.491 --> 02:16:54.880
<v Speaker 6>from other people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you do that,</v>

3227
02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:58.660
<v Speaker 6>and if that shit spreads and if people </v>
<v Speaker 6>learn by your example,</v>

3228
02:16:58.661 --> 02:17:01.240
<v Speaker 6>then you really can make a change and a </v>
<v Speaker 6>difference right there.</v>

3229
02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:02.980
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Make a small change,</v>

3230
02:17:02.981 --> 02:17:05.710
<v Speaker 6>a small difference locally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of like politics,</v>

3231
02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:07.300
<v Speaker 6>local politics,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you can choose to,</v>

3234
02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:16.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>put up a stop sign in an area where the </v>

3235
02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:16.860
<v Speaker 6>people need to stop because there's some</v>

3237
02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:20.960
<v Speaker 6>actually happen and it'll actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>become something.</v>

3238
02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:20.960
<v Speaker 6>State,</v>
<v Speaker 6>state politics.</v>

3239
02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:22.500
<v Speaker 6>There's state laws that can get changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3240
02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:25.390
<v Speaker 6>the medical marijuana law in California </v>
<v Speaker 6>is a clear example of that.</v>

3241
02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:26.850
<v Speaker 6>They voted like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3242
02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:29.620
<v Speaker 6>the medical marijuana is helpful for </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

3243
02:17:29.710 --> 02:17:31.690
<v Speaker 6>Let's vote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's make it a real announcer reality.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and you can make changes in your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people's lives around you too.</v>

3248
02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:45.190
<v Speaker 2>If you want to fucking like talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you can,</v>

3249
02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:49.210
<v Speaker 2>you can get away from shit that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>affecting you in a good way and get away</v>

3250
02:17:49.211 --> 02:17:51.010
<v Speaker 2>from the people that are not good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3251
02:17:51.011 --> 02:17:51.910

<v Speaker 6>can control.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

3255
02:17:57.860 --> 02:17:59.840
<v Speaker 6>You can control all that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3256
02:17:59.870 --> 02:18:04.870
<v Speaker 6>the real problem with us is that we have</v>
<v Speaker 6>so much more access to human beings and </v>

3257
02:18:05.001 --> 02:18:07.190
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to connecting to each other than we ever</v>

3258
02:18:07.191 --> 02:18:09.470
<v Speaker 6>had in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why people or they feel like they</v>

3259
02:18:09.471 --> 02:18:13.550
<v Speaker 6>can be so douchey on message boards </v>
<v Speaker 6>because there's no social consequence.</v>

3260
02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:18.760
<v Speaker 6>There's no consequence to emailing </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone on my space and just saying </v>

3273
02:18:36.361 --> 02:18:41.361
