<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.041
<v Speaker 1>she was in there.</v>

5
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I never worked with shoes in there.</v>

6
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>

7
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.373
<v Speaker 1>great person.</v>

8
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Freak freak.</v>

9
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy how this fucking sport just chews people up.</v>

10
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You think you're on top and then it's gone and it's over.</v>

11
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 1>But the casual fan doesn't kill.</v>

12
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>That's why that paper you a cell because the casual fan goes,</v>

13
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.301
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

14
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>that's the girl who worked Ronda Rousey.</v>

15
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the argument from a Gregor versus Floyd Bates fucking happening.</v>

16
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.763
<v Speaker 1>That's happening,</v>

17
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to happen.</v>

18
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.843
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

19
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.150
<v Speaker 1>so McGregor,</v>

20
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>it held a press conference last night,</v>

21
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.901
<v Speaker 1>sold out arena.</v>

22
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>5,000 tickets sold out the on the mic.</v>

23
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

24
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>fuck the UFC.</v>

25
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Fuck everything.</v>

26
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:39.811
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

27
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>fuck boxing you.</v>

28
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>And he goes to the next fight,</v>

29
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.913
<v Speaker 1>the next fight.</v>

30
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Me Verse Floyd.</v>

31
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>He was fully get it fucking done.</v>

32
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.131
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes,</v>

33
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it with or without the UFC.</v>

34
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>And they told Dana that.</v>

35
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

36
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.503
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that.</v>

37
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Good luck getting that done with that.</v>

38
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>He believes it with the Ali Act.</v>

39
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>He can actually do it because it's a different sport.</v>

40
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>He has the money to hire the lawyers to try it.</v>

41
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

42
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it is an interesting argument because it's not MMA boxing.</v>

43
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>So if it's boxing it's not,</v>

44
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have a contrast.</v>

45
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>She should just promote it anyways and work together with Floyd and say,</v>

46
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.041
<v Speaker 1>well done.</v>

47
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not just with Floyd,</v>

48
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>it's with McGregor promotions now that he's got his own thing.</v>

49
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the key to promote because they don't want it.</v>

50
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to have a third middleman in Dana white cause you have Conor</v>

51
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.541
<v Speaker 1>McGregor promotions,</v>

52
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:25.171
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather it,</v>

53
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>and then the UFC,</v>

54
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to give the,</v>

55
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>you is going to become what boxing is.</v>

56
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It's going to become that because it's star driven.</v>

57
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Like all things like music,</v>

58
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:36.191
<v Speaker 1>hate,</v>

59
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:36.961
<v Speaker 1>like comedy,</v>

60
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:37.531
<v Speaker 1>like everything.</v>

61
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>It's going to stay star driven.</v>

62
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>And when it's star driven like that,</v>

63
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>guys like Connor who are legitimate stars,</v>

64
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>they have the leverage and they're going to manipulate that leverage.</v>

65
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna utilize that leverage and we're going to see what happened.</v>

66
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Especially right now I just started,</v>

67
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>we've ever had,</v>

68
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a reality star driven,</v>

69
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>but it is a reality.</v>

70
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.291
<v Speaker 1>Why is it?</v>

71
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:55.951
<v Speaker 1>Why do you hate that?</v>

72
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Because it's always been like that in boxing.</v>

73
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

75
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how they make the hundred million dollar paydays.</v>

76
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a purist and real quick.</v>

77
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

78
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

79
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>But I would love to see Conor was Floyd.</v>

80
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Rob,</v>

81
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>rob and I were talking about fights.</v>

82
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>This dude said he's never seen a fight.</v>

83
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't lie.</v>

84
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.023
<v Speaker 1>Every single fight.</v>

85
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I've hated a lot of fun.</v>

86
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>You see Kimbo and Donna.</v>

87
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

88
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>That you got right to it.</v>

89
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:18.811
<v Speaker 1>Quick.</v>

90
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Right to the point that maybe there maybe.</v>

91
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I did see one seen some shitty fight,</v>

92
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

93
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.961
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

94
00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:26.311
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

95
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.144
<v Speaker 1>I liked</v>

96
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.063
<v Speaker 1>each other out.</v>

97
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Gracie's last bite on Bella coil cable.</v>

98
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.911
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about it.</v>

99
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:35.744
<v Speaker 1>I liked it too.</v>

100
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>This is what I liked about that all bullshit aside.</v>

101
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>How Gracie fought a fucking killer.</v>

102
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy knocked out Joe Schilling twice.</v>

103
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.470
<v Speaker 1>He knocked him out and kickboxing and he knocked him out in MMA.</v>

104
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking beast.</v>

105
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>He's a very dangerous striker.</v>

106
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>He's a very big guy and he's fucking scary.</v>

107
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>He's a blaster and how it,</v>

108
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

109
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

110
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

111
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

112
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>He avoided getting knocked down.</v>

113
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Your boy who's a beast in new mouth because he scared.</v>

114
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.160
<v Speaker 1>He was worried about getting taken down.</v>

115
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>It was scary to get strangled.</v>

116
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>And what were you scared of is what happened in the last minute of the last</v>

117
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>round when I did take him down past his garlic butter,</v>

118
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking mounted him and had him in a bad spot.</v>

119
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Haluk was going to fuck him up if that fight kept going,</v>

120
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>if that was in the first minute of the first round,</v>

121
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Speaker 1>how might fight with fuel to do it because he hit the guy that you guys think</v>

122
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>that was entertaining fight.</v>

123
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.113
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

124
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.033
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

125
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.443
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

126
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.383
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

127
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>And you hated Kim overs.com that was more hate it.</v>

128
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.301
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hate him,</v>

129
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>but it was not a high level fight.</v>

130
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I hated the fact that people were watching it on TV and both guys were severely</v>

131
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>unconditioned.</v>

132
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>There were severely out of shape.</v>

133
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.763
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

134
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

135
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.363
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

136
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.630
<v Speaker 1>His heartbeat stopped the hip Revit enough.</v>

137
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.981
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

138
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Is that some of that is him,</v>

139
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.863
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

140
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.111
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

141
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:53.201
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

142
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:53.861
<v Speaker 1>when I think about it,</v>

143
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:54.221
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

144
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>I hated what the fight was about,</v>

145
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>but I love the fight,</v>

146
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.230
<v Speaker 1>the dynamic of what's happening between these two human beings in combat.</v>

147
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean dot.</v>

148
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>And Kimbo.</v>

149
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Even that one,</v>

151
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>the dynamic between them is different than every other fight in their case,</v>

152
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

153
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>because chose Mike.</v>

154
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

155
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>If it was my student out until I was about,</v>

157
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>are you intrigued by the,</v>

158
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>by the time Mcgregor,</v>

159
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:16.331
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather.</v>

160
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I said as if Conor McGregor could actually box with Floyd Mayweather.</v>

161
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor cannot box with Floyd Mayweather,</v>

162
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>but Conor Mcgregor's what?</v>

163
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>The only goal that he could have the workable idea as a backdoor hack.</v>

164
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Something where being unwilling to make it a boxing match.</v>

165
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>He is fighting him with two hands.</v>

166
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>But boxing is not the definition of fighting with two hands.</v>

167
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Find a hack,</v>

168
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:37.721
<v Speaker 1>find a back door.</v>

169
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>What would Tim Ferriss do if Tim,</v>

170
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>if you said,</v>

171
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.331
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

172
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Tim Ferris,</v>

173
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.370
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

174
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>how do you beat Floyd Mayweather with a guy who's never pushed him off the stand</v>

175
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.163
<v Speaker 1>yet?</v>

176
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 1>You'd want someone else's idea and regurgitate.</v>

177
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy.</v>

180
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.841
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

181
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:53.381
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

182
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>But Mcgregor has found the disruption.</v>

183
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
