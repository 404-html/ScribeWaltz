41
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.670
Blue Apron is a a fantastic new product or service,

43
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:41.760

44
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.200
Excellent.
Healthy,
five to 700 calories per serving.
But if you eat it,

45
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:48.870
you would think it would be a lot more than that because it's really good stuff.

46
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.620
Um,

47
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.360
they have a whole bunch of really groovy recipes for all sorts of different

48
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:56.220
things and they send you new stuff every week.

Gumbo with chicken sausage and Okra pan seared scallops with sauteed Sungolds.

I don't even know when the sun gold is,
but it sounds often awesome.

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.730
I don't know what this is either.

56
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.870

Attach.
This is awesome stuff and easy to do.
I mean,

57
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.470
I cook a lot,
but um,
you know,
I don't really follow recipes.

58
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.930
I mostly cooked meat like a fucking cave man,

59
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.550
but I've been using blue apron and uh,
even making like complex things,

60
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:40.420
it's not difficult and made these awesome a ground beef,
stuffed peppers.

61
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.470
They were fantastic.
It was really good and it's fun.
It's exciting to do.

62
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.790
It excites me.
That's right.
I said,

63
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.630
Blue Apron excites me,
and here's how it works.

65
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:59.440

66
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.270
Blue Apron includes step by step instructions with pictures,
so it's idiot proof.

67
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.290
It's super easy to do.

68
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.350
They work around your schedule and your dietary preferences to cook.

69
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.410
Cooking takes about a half an hour and shipping is always free.

70
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.240
They never send you the same meal twice.
Short Rib Burgers on Pretzel Buns,

71
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.180
Kung Pao,

You got to remember to buy razors.
Folks,
that Shit's annoying.

80
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.480
The last thing you want to do is we'd go into your,

81
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.190
the cabinet where you keep all your pills,

82
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.820
your medicine kept looking for a razor.
It doesn't exist.
Like you mother fucker.

83
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.420
I forgot to buy razors.
And especially if you have one of those dickhead bosses,

84
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.240
Brian Read Ben.
What's with all the stubble?

85
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.900
You present an unprofessional appearance.
You have to use her girls.

86

Raise her with all her hair in it and,

87
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.510
you don't want to go to the store for anything more.

plastic fortress.

91
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:29.420
When you go to the fucking pharmacy where they keep all the,
all the,

92
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.350
all the way locked.

93
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.380
I want you to cutting your throat right there in front of him.

94
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.550
I can't take fucking buying razors anymore.

95
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.530

to me.
Do you know how to do it?
Yeah,
it's not working for some reason.

119
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.090
Maybe because you weren't ready.
Here we go.

120
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.150
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

<v 0>wow.
That's the worst one ever.
Congratulations.</v>

122
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.760
I didn't think you could fuck it up any more than that.

123
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.310
I mean it started off bad.
The middle was bad.

124
00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:35.130
There was fucking two of them playing at the same time and it ended abruptly.

125
00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:39.010
Everything was wrong.
Congratulations.
If you did that in a movie,

126
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:42.590
if you planned out the worst intro music for a podcast and a movie,
you fucking,

127
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.520
it sounded like you just took a random part out of like a prime.

128
00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:49.590
Is it sound like a snippet from a prime song where it would have made sense in

129
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:53.610
the whole picture,
but just this,
the clip you're like,
it doesn't make sense.
Yeah.

130
00:07:53.611 --> 00:07:55.980
Well it's a kind of funny story that one up getting resolved.

131
00:07:55.981 --> 00:08:00.930
But Jamie called me the other day to tell me that one of my videos got taken

132
00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:05.931
down from the Internet because someone used my words like my voice in a song and

133
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:12.120
then copywrote it.
Really?
Yeah.
The cop wrote my voice.
So when my voice,

134
00:08:12.121 --> 00:08:14.340
the original version of that was online,

135
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.480
they put a copyright hit against me for my own voice.

136
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.010
That is unbelievable.
It was so hilarious.
I mean,
it got resolved.

137
00:08:23.011 --> 00:08:26.290
Like when I started tweeting about it,
like,
what the fuck man?
Like this,

138
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.340
I don't know the details.
I don't know what to do.

139
00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:32.640
And was thinking how he thought he could copyright my own voice.

140
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.030
What was his song?
It's like,
I don't know.
I didn't even listen to the song.

141
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.190
I heard the beginning of it where it sounds,
you know,
you,

142
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.140
there's a video that this guy,
um,
did,
uh,
called

143
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.020
American.
What is it called?
The American war machine.
American war machine.

144
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.280
Paradigm shift on Youtube.
Really cool guy.
I met him in Vancouver.
Very nice guy.

145
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.160
Very talented guy too.
Did this video.
It's really

146
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.691
<v 2>cool.
It's a,</v>

147
00:08:56.691 --> 00:09:01.691
it's combining a bunch of rats with all this video of war stuff and the stuff

148
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:05.820
about us history and how crazy the military industrial complexes and the

149
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:10.320
beginning of it is this,
this rant that this guy took and put on a song.

150
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.700
Then it copywrote it

151
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.910
like he didn't even change the fucking music that my friend Tosh had put on the

152
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:21.120
thing.
He didn't even change it.
He just took that chunk,

153
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.370
put it in his song and then said,
this is mine.

154
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.240
It's like the shittiest version of buying a domain name to resell it.

155
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.180
I own your domain name.
Pepsi Spice.
Ah,

156
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.400
Brian owned Pepsi Spice Dotcom.
You remember when Pepsi Spice came out?

157
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.500
This is one of his best pranks.
I swear to God.

158
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:39.750
I thought it was one of the spice girls when you said that,

159
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.960
I didn't know what the fuck is.
Pepsi,

160
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.300
Pepsi spice was this horrendous idea.
It's like someone decided to like,

161
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:51.720
let's make Pepsi but spicy,
like a spicy Pepsi.

162
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.910
So here's a Thanksgiving for Thanksgiving because that's still up.

163
00:09:56.911 --> 00:10:00.510
Is it up anywhere?
Can you see your all that stuff that he did,
pieces of it.

164
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.000
Damn Dude,
you got to put that up in a blog.

165
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.130
You should put put it up in a blog and we'll,

166
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.200
I think we shot it with a heart with a gun.
Oh,
did we?

167
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.060
Will we blew up the hard drive?

168
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.850
This is what he did.
Let me,
I'll tell,
I'll tell you the whole story.

169
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.870
He took Pepsi spice.com he bought the domain name because this is in like,

170
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.790
what was it like 2000 it was a long time.
10 years ago or something like that.

171
00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:24.110
It might've been earlier.
It might've been before.
Fearful.

172
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.970
I don't think you were working for me,
man.
No,
I was just right when I moved here.

173
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.740
Okay,
so this is what he did.

174
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:33.741
He bought Pepsi spice.com before they did and then he started putting up a daily

175
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:36.420
blog about how he's eating nothing but Pepsi has placed,

176
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.850
his health was rapidly deteriorating.
He's hysterical.

177
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:45.900
Cataclysmic ways.
It was so funny,
man.

178
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.380
We were going to it every day and the Pepsi Spice people were fucking shitting

179
00:10:49.381 --> 00:10:54.210
their pants
and it was before anyone understood the internet.

180
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.630
No high level executives in Pepsi or any of those major corporations.

181
00:10:58.631 --> 00:11:00.720
There were very few of them understood the Internet.
If they did,

182
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:03.200
they would've bought Pepsi spice.com way before they were leaving.

183
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.890
But they didn't break his fucking blog up about him shitting blood and he's down

184
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:14.691
to 120 pounds now it's open when it's one of the things that you said you

185
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.360
remember,

186
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.590
<v 3>I remember I had open sores everywhere and I was really good at Photoshop back</v>

187
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:22.930
then said no one even knew that there was fake photos with as much,
you know,

188
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.470
so I had like pictures of me but these big bloody things,

189
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:28.890
I was hanging out with Lindsay Lohan snorting mushrooms like it was called

190
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.210
Mccain where we would like crush up mushrooms and snort.
I love it.
So,

191
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:36.810
so ridiculous.
Would you,
would you write the blog like,
like if you were like,

192
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:41.811
like the way a stranded island diary like day 36 I did.

193
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.910
It was just,
it was,
cause it was after soup,
that movie super size me.

194
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:48.330
So I pretty much just made it like this.
Like the seventh day I,
I've,

195
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:52.110
I'm starting to cough up a lot of stomach acid and stuff like that.

196
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.040
And then it just got worse

197
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.290
<v 2>and worse.
And I think I ended up dying at the end.</v>

198
00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:00.850
I never finished it because did they ever buy the domain from,

199
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:03.880
you know,
I owned it for a while,

200
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:07.100
but then after a while you have a domain that no one even knows what Pepsi

201
00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:09.220
spices anymore.
But yeah,
like here's what,

202
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:12.010
I never purchased it from you or told you to take it down now because they

203
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:15.250
stopped selling Pepsi spice.
I didn't mean anything.
Here's,
here's what,

204
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.230
here's some of it that

205
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.370
I can't read it.
It's blurry on that cane.

206
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:26.410
And then I just finished my last two liter,

207
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.050
got to skip will keep for health reasons.

208
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.390
It was really funny,
man.
That's really great.
It was really funny,
man.
It was all,

209
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.250
I got clogged armpits,
so that was one I
couldn't sweat.

210
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.400
Oh,
that's great.
I was believable.
Like nothing was too over the top.

211
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.860
At first effort.
It seems so normal.

212
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.850
And then as his journal got deeper and deeper,

213
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:58.990
it got more and more fucks up.
I love it.
It was really ridiculous.

214
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:02.770
That's incredible.
And it was,
it was a spicy,
it was a holiday spice.

215
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:05.120
She not like a buffalo wing.
Yeah,
right.

216
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.610
It was like a cinema need kind of a thing yet too much ginger.
So it was nasty.

217
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.080
I hate spiced anything.

218
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:14.590
I think spiced rum is like if I'm drinking with somebody and they're like,

219
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:18.010
I'll take a captain and coke.
I'm just like,
get out of my face.
You fucking idiot.

220
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.110
You gave me the other day at the icehouse that's super spicy liquor shot that we

221
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:27.290
did.
What the hell was that?
Oh,
fireball.
Fireball.
Yeah.

222
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.420
Disgusting.
I kind of like,
it's great and it is great because you know,

223
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:33.570
you take one before you hit the road and it's like you,

224
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.150
your how it helps your breath and everything.
Yeah,
yeah.

225
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.300
Just keep showing the glove compartment for you.
Get pulled over.

226
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.320
I mean,
you know,
hold on a second officer.

227
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.210
Yet people think that that stuff makes your breath taste good,

228
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:51.550
but basically anything that's alcohol makes you bread,

229
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:54.880
tastes like shit because once it goes in your stomach,
your stomach is like,

230
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:58.840
what is this?
And that's when the disgusting breath comes up.

231
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.050
I don't like any of those.
Like here's the weird part.

232
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:06.430
I love Jaeger Meister Jaeger masters.
My favorite shot on the planet earth.

233
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.640
Jaeger bombs like the white trash and I truly am really Jaeger bombs are my

234
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:15.000
favorite shot.
[inaudible] planet.
What do we have here right now?
Jimmy?

235
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.320
Let's do some shots.
Oh my God,
I'm off the booze.

236
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.710
Are you totally a hundred percent not forever.
I have fatty liver right now,

237
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:26.170
so I had to stop drinking.
All right,
we won't do shit.
God Damn it.

238
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:30.830
You guys can do one though.
Brian and I will do one shot.
Oh,
what you're doing.

239
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.560
You want to do one Jamie?
All right,
Jamie,
let's,

240
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:35.830
we're going to really regret not doing this with you in a week when I fall off

241
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:39.250
the wagon,
drank with the guys like what's fatty liver?

242
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:44.320
I mean just fat in your liver and it happen probably from drinking and eating

243
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:48.280
poorly for all these years.
I mean this is,
this was my,
I mean the,

244
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:52.520
and I'm not in great shape.
This is the best I've ever been in right now.

245
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.170
Like what?
You see?
Funny.
Why you laughing?

246
00:14:57.171 --> 00:15:00.530
This demand is making progress.
And Brian's like,

247
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.250
yeah,
this is,
this is the best shape I've ever been in a,
which isn't saying much,

248
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.740
but uh,
I mean for years,
dude,
for years,

249
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:14.741
like my lifestyle was get completely shit faced four or five nights a week,

250
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.120
go home,
get,
and I would do this night after night,
get like a double meat cheese,

251
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:23.630
steak,
Doritos chocolate cake and a soda and literally lay in my bed,

252
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.400
wasted eating it and just pass out.

253
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.990
I would do that night after night after night I smoked,
you know,
it was,

254
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.150
it was just,
I think after a while,
you know,

255
00:15:32.151 --> 00:15:34.310
I dabbled in the drugs here and there,
you know,

256
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:38.240
I think after a while it just kind of a little bit,
little bit,
but it catches up.

257
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.320
I'll try some Jamison since it's got a bunch of signatures on it.
Who wrote,

258
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:45.680
who signed on that thing?
Oh,
it's Christ.

259
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:49.370
You're brought it over your rights on the bottle.
So,
you know,

260
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.260
getting your hammered.
Um,
New York is kind of like that though,
right?

261
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.420
New York is a place where a lot of people already,

262
00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:57.800
and I were talking about this last night,

263
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.460
people go out after the shows and they drink.
It's fucking greatest.

264
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.080
I missed it dude.
It was such an adventure,
man.
It was such an adventure.

265
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.520
I remember having nights in New York,
we're literally at like,

266
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.720
you do a set,
it'd be a Tuesday and you do a set,

267
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.490
you'd finish,
it'd be like nine 30 you'd be like,
that's Tuesday.
It's,

268
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:22.340
there's nothing going on.
This is,
this is done.
I'm going to go home.

269
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.000
And then somebody would be like,
hey,
you know though,

270
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.220
I heard so and so might be having a little,

271
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.220
do you want to just go over real quick and just check out what's happening?

272
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.450
You know,
across the,
you know,
across the way at the such and such bar.

273
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.680
And you'd go over and the next thing you know,
dude,

274
00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:44.150
it's 5:00 AM and there's been,
you know,

275
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:49.151
blow and whiskey and you're wasted and you're fucking a girl and it's greatest

276
00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:51.020
man.
Fuck that sounds good.

277
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:54.050
It's the greatest [inaudible] below and I want to do it now.

278
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.930
He just like,
where did this come from?
It's just that never happens in la.

279
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.350
Oh yes it does.
You need to hang around at the comedy store.
You fucking crazy.

280
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:07.820
When does a wild night happen out here?
You gotta drive Goddamn home every night.

281
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:11.270
You can't,
oh,
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.
It's a different animal.

282
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.740
And the bars close at two,
you know,
it's,
it's definitely a different animal.

283
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.910
But like,
uh,
I mean Dan was like the whole deal about the store was coke,
right?

284
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.590
I mean those,
the Kennison days.

285
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.140
I talked to Martin again last night cause Marin was at a,

286
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:25.970
Ari's a TV show taping our,

287
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:28.680
he's got a new TV show on comedy central called this is not happening.
Yeah,

288
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:29.260
I know.

289
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.780
And Marin did a story last night and him and I talked again about the Kennison

290
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:36.290
days about doing blow with Kennison to the point where he heard voices in his

291
00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:40.150
head for a year.
She uses Christ Christ.

292
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.530
What the fuck
kid.

293
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.050
He was a young kid hanging out at the store and he was partying with Kinison and

294
00:17:48.051 --> 00:17:50.050
working at the store,
you know?
And

295
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.470
<v 4>that's the difference between,
and I'm not trying to shit on ally,</v>

296
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.640
but that's different city la drugs in New York drugs,

297
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.880
New York drugs are like wolf of Wall Street.
Hey,
it's a fucking party for it.

298
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.440
We're at the beach,
we're going to the Hamptons,
right.
A Bar,
Go and pass out,

299
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:09.150
get up,
hit your job tomorrow.
La Drugs are,
it's like,
feels like river Phoenix.

300
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.580
There's a darkness,
there's a darkness to it.
It's something.

301
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:19.581
There's something like out to here that feels much more like stripper fucking cc

302
00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:21.430
does

303
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.300
<v 0>bill,
you know bill,</v>

304
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.040
he pulls out a poison reference.
Yeah,

305
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.060
<v 4>it's,
I don't know and I'm not,
I'm not doing it in New York versus La thing,</v>

306
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.370
but like it's different for sure.
New York.

307
00:18:36.371 --> 00:18:38.730
Did it feel like that New York just felt way more just like,

308
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.330
like age in the neighborhood?
Right.
Fuck it.

309
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.020
<v 0>He never lived in the city.</v>

310
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.800
So I didn't get that thing out of New York because when I first moved to New

311
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.130
York I needed a car because I was doing road gigs and the only way I can make a

312
00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.450
living was to do the road.

313
00:18:52.451 --> 00:18:56.230
Like I couldn't do the whole 15 shows in a night,

314
00:18:56.231 --> 00:18:59.500
like do a seven minute spot here and seven and then add up the $10,

315
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.800
whatever the fuck you would get from each set.
Cause a lot,

316
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.590
a lot like a tell you to do that.
He would do 10 15 sets a night,

317
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:10.180
all these little seven minute sets and run all over the place and do it and just

318
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.060
take cabs and stuff.
And that was life.
But I,

319
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.570
I was getting these road gigs and that was the only way I was paying my money or

320
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.130
paying my bill.
So I lived in new Rochelle.
So for me I didn't do that,

321
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.400
that whole live in the city.
Take cabs or take the subway everywhere.

322
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.470
I could totally get that though.

323
00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.940
<v 4>Oh Dude,
it was,
yeah,
it was just yet New York,
New York.</v>

324
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.900
Like when you live because I lived all over New York for nine years.
I was,

325
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.550
I started in Queens,
then it was up in Harlem and Harlem.
Fuck.

326
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.430
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Not because of Harlem,
just because,
talk to daddy.

327
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.333
<v 0>What do you want to know?</v>

328
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.500
I've bagged them all shapes and sizes.
Powerful.
John,

329
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.530
Jada Rosa kept the kids get around.

330
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.560
What's your favorite spot to live?

331
00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:03.040
<v 4>Uh,
I had a great time in every place that I lived.
My least favorite was queens,</v>

332
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.280
not because of Queens,
but I had a fun time in Queens.

333
00:20:06.281 --> 00:20:11.020
I lived with Jay Oakerson out there and it was fun,
but we lived in like a very,

334
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.680
he was,

335
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.680
he was like living with his baby's mother at the time and they had a kid and I

336
00:20:16.751 --> 00:20:18.910
was living with them,
which was fine.
It was actually very nice,

337
00:20:18.911 --> 00:20:20.840
but we were in it like a very like sort of neighborhood.

338
00:20:20.841 --> 00:20:24.610
He suburban part of Queens.
There wasn't anything you could like walk to or do.

339
00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.490
So that's the only reason I didn't like it.
Um,

340
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.440
Harlem was fun because it was my first time being on the island and it was wild.

341
00:20:32.441 --> 00:20:33.880
I these Irish neighbors,

342
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.290
and I mean any night of the week you just knock on their door and it,
you know,

343
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.040
and it's 4:00 AM and they know,
oh did,
it was nuts.

344
00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.930
It was fucking crazy.
The Irish and they were crazy.
They were so crazy.
Rachel,

345
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.460
who's one of my close friends and a really funny comic and obviously Jewish,

346
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.730
I brought her out one night.
One of the Irish guys used to live next door to it.

347
00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:56.500
I'm like,
you're gonna love this guy.
He's great.
He's nuts.

348
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.440
And we're hanging out for a while at this bar.
And she comes over to me.

349
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:02.830
She's like,
okay,
I'm going to go.
And I go,
why?
And she's like,

350
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.460
you're Irish friend is telling me that the numbers of the Holocaust were greatly

351
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:11.080
exaggerated.
That's he a Irish from Ireland.

352
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.070
Is that no,
so high.
The fucking Jews is a little bit,
a bunch of laser,

353
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.650
but just shite.
He wasn't saying it like that.
He was,
well,

354
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.930
he wasn't saying it like,
like you fucking liars.

355
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.200
There was some somehow a strange sense of sympathy in his voice as he was also

356
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:31.540
saying he thought the numbers were exaggerated,
but,
but it was,
the point is,

357
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.810
is that he was just a fucking lunatic.

358
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.710
There was no filter on his brain.
He wasn't saying it like,
God dammit,

359
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.300
I'm sick of hearing about it.
It was just shit would just leak out of his mouth,

360
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.170
you know?
He was saying it like,
have you ever really thought about it?

361
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:49.510
Let's think about.
It's like,
no,
let's not think about it.

362
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:52.840
Like let's just not talk about it.
That's when you can't fuck with no

363
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.870
<v 0>dude sent me this fucking email.
Can you refute this video with this?</v>

364
00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.100
Whenever someone sends you a youtube video on anything,
you got to go,
okay,

365
00:22:01.101 --> 00:22:03.050
is there,
is there other shit out there?
Are there

366
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.360
<v 4>books?
Have scientists look at this and scholars study this.</v>

367
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.060
<v 0>He sent me a youtube video.
You know I'm going to,
I'm going to listen to it,</v>

368
00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:11.130
but since I'm not an expert on the Holocaust,

369
00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:15.090
I dunno what the fuck exactly what's wrong in this video.

370
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.210
But it was like they're talking about different places.

371
00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:22.830
Couldn't be actually used for gas chambers and it was bullshit.
They actually,

372
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.540
a guy ruined his career because of this.
I watched that documentary death.

373
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.080
That documentary is amazing.
Fantastic documentary.
It's called Dr Death.

374
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.320
And it's about this guy who was a,

375
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:39.350
he was an engineer for these execution devices and these,

376
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.370
I don't know,
let's,
you know,
holocaust deniers,

377
00:22:44.371 --> 00:22:47.550
holocaust revisionists,
whatever you'd want to call them.
I mean,

378
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:49.230
I don't think they were denying the Holocaust,

379
00:22:49.231 --> 00:22:50.860
but they were saying that it was exaggerated.
Yeah.

380
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.080
And this guy went over there and because of these people,

381
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.450
he gave this really fucked up,
inaccurate,

382
00:22:57.451 --> 00:23:02.280
unscientific assessment of certain famous sites.
We're fucking,

383
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.400
hundreds of thousands of people documented were murdered.

384
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.580
And he was saying that it couldn't have happened.
And then it just,
his,
you know,

385
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.170
he went to court over that.
Yeah.

386
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.140
<v 4>And then he lost his family.
It was his whole life.
It was,
it.
He was devastated.</v>

387
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:19.780
It can be wrong about now.
No,
you don't want to roll the dice on the Holocaust,

388
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.633
but you know what I mean?
It's

389
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.720
<v 0>man,
you know what's fucked.</v>

390
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.930
There's other holocausts that people don't even know about like the Armenian

391
00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:26.190
genocide,
right.

392
00:23:26.191 --> 00:23:29.640
Like I didn't even know about the Armenian genocide is a true story until I was

393
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.560
in the octagon interviewing Manny GAM Burean and I think you could tell by Manny

394
00:23:34.561 --> 00:23:39.150
Gambhir Ian's name,
he might be Armenian and man,
he's uh,
you know,

395
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.000
great MMA fighter and uh,
he's,
you know,

396
00:23:42.001 --> 00:23:47.001
he's very proud to be from Armenia and was talking about the anniversary.

397
00:23:47.151 --> 00:23:47.780
It was like he,

398
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:52.170
he won on the anniversary of the Armenian genocide and he was talking about
like,

399
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.710
like raising awareness for Armenian genocide.
And I was like,

400
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:56.750
I didn't even know what this is.
And then I looked into it.

401
00:23:56.751 --> 00:24:00.200
It's just fucking horrible.
Horrible.
I didn't know about that either.

402
00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.800
Million dead.
I mean,
it just terrible,
terrible,
terrible story.

403
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.070
<v 4>Yeah.
I was driving,
I live on the east side and I was driving,</v>

404
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.230
I was riding on a TV show for a little while and I was driving to work one

405
00:24:12.231 --> 00:24:16.790
morning and I couldn't get to work because there was so much traffic and I was

406
00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:21.560
just like,
what the fuck is going on?
It's,
it's 9:45 AM on Hollywood boulevard.

407
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:22.820
Why is this so backed up?

408
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.690
And then I saw people like walking around with these shirts on that said our

409
00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:31.610
wounds are still open.
And um,
I feel like a real,

410
00:24:31.611 --> 00:24:33.560
I know I'm an asshole before I say this.

411
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.870
I thought it was some kind of record release

412
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.070
<v 2>and I was getting so mad.
I thought like a rapper,</v>

413
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.060
like a release day is going on.

414
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.940
It was still open.
Our mouth,

415
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:52.340
I'll close is moving.
I rustled my toes.

416
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.880
Oh

417
00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.100
my teeth is gold.
You're trying to buy my album.

418
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:04.220
But the shit's already sold out.

419
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.650
Free style.
2014.
Well,
much love.

420
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.330
Guess what?
That's not what it was,
dude.
It was

421
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.270
<v 4>the anniversary of the Armenian genocide because I was driving through little</v>

422
00:25:21.271 --> 00:25:24.690
Armenia and I didn't know.
And then I got to work and somebody was like,

423
00:25:24.691 --> 00:25:27.030
this is what this is.
And I was like,
oh Jesus,

424
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.640
<v 0>bad man.
It's scary shit man.
When you hear about stuff like that and you're like,</v>

425
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:32.180
wait a minute.

426
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:37.180
That was 1915 1915 Armenian civilians escorted by armed Ottoman soldiers are

427
00:25:38.901 --> 00:25:40.520
marched through,
uh,

428
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.270
to a prison in nearby Mesos rich present day.

429
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:49.370
[inaudible] it's impossible to pronounce it in 1915 between 1000001.5 million

430
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:56.450
people were murdered.
Wow.
Yeah.
24th of April,
1915

431
00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.150
<v 4>now do you think the other ones don't get mentioned like this one for instance,</v>

432
00:26:00.151 --> 00:26:00.840
because they,

433
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.840
they are so small in size compared to the number of deaths with the Jewish

434
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.910
Holocaust.
I Dunno cause Jewish how close like 6 million.

435
00:26:08.911 --> 00:26:13.290
This is a 1.5 which is a ton of people.
But I mean,
you know,

436
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.920
I don't know.
I wonder if that's why it gets,
they all get so overshadowed.

437
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:17.860
It's so good

438
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.520
<v 0>question.
I mean,
I don't look,
it's anytime it's,</v>

439
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.430
that's a lot of fucking people.
1.5 million people.

440
00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:26.440
I can't imagine how it could ever be overshadowed.

441
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.630
I just say I'm ashamed that I learned about it while I was talking to somebody.

442
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:32.970
<v 4>Yeah,
well that's,
that's even,</v>

443
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.850
that's why I asked the question because it's like I don't even,

444
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.050
I can't justify in my head how something like that would get overshadowed other

445
00:26:40.051 --> 00:26:44.060
than I guess maybe this other one was so much bigger.
I don't know,
man.
It's

446
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.590
<v 2>because the Jews control the media.
Jill.</v>

447
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.390
I know how to spread a story.
It's kind of like when like,

448
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.710
you know when Farrah Fawcett died with the Michael Jackson time the same day,

449
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.530
he got all the press and they died in the same day.

450
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.640
They die back on the same day and Farrah Fawcett got nothing.
Remember that?

451
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.440
Poor Fair.
No.
It's a trait parallel to draw,
but even fucking he kids allegedly,

452
00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:12.160
no,
I know.
I'm not convinced he did still.
I'm still not convinced you.

453
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.530
<v 0>I have a theory.
It's a very bad theory.
I'm going to tell you right now,</v>

454
00:27:15.531 --> 00:27:19.370
if you're Joe Rome is a moron.
I agree with you.
Okay.
I'm on your side.

455
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.840
I think I'm more on too,

456
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.570
but I think there's a possibility that he might have been what they call a cast

457
00:27:25.571 --> 00:27:30.020
Strada.
Do you know what a cast Trotta is?
No Caste Strada music,

458
00:27:30.021 --> 00:27:30.950
I think I'm saying it right,

459
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:35.610
is a type of music where they would castrate young boys and they would castrate

460
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.270
young boys so that they would sing this incredible pitch.

461
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.990
That didn't sound manly at all.
It's very bizarre.
It's very freaky.

462
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.670
You can hear it on,
why haven't we played it on the podcast before?

463
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.550
Let's play some just for Derosa so cause he's never heard it before.
Okay.

464
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.800
But there's a style of music that was created by castrating boys because when

465
00:27:55.371 --> 00:27:56.630
you're moved their testicles,

466
00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:01.670
they don't produce testosterone and they have this weird sort of,
you know,

467
00:28:01.671 --> 00:28:06.070
it's this,
I'm androgynous sort of sound to their voice and it's,
uh,
it's,

468
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.660
it's feminine,
but like a little bit masculine.

469
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.000
And it's very similar to how Michael Jackson is.

470
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.080
Have you seen Michael Jackson's brothers?
Yeah.
They look manly as fuck.

471
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.100
And they sound manly.
Yeah.
They sound manly.
He stayed really slender.

472
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.860
He stayed like a guy who had no testosterone.

473
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:26.390
He didn't look like a man who had testosterone.
He was Rick,
really slender.

474
00:28:26.391 --> 00:28:28.460
I think this is a great theory.
It's not a bad theory.

475
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.150
I think it might have happened to me by the way.
Well,

476
00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:34.520
it's also the thing about these men or these,
these,
they're men now,
but the,

477
00:28:34.521 --> 00:28:38.180
they say that they were molested by Michael Jackson.
No one says he fucked them.

478
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:42.920
No,
it was all like weird touching stuff.
Yeah,
and I,
I don't,

479
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.930
I don't think there was anything going on there.

480
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.340
I think that's why he longed for childhood needs a terrible theory.
Again,

481
00:28:49.341 --> 00:28:51.350
I'll tell you right now,
it's not backed by any facts.

482
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.890
I don't think it's a terrible theory.
But listen,
this is a cast Strada.

483
00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.460
This is a long time ago,
by the way.

484
00:29:00.461 --> 00:29:04.990
This is like ninth was in 19 early 19 hundreds these recordings,

485
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.540
I mean you don't do this anymore unless I don't know about it,

486
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.110
but there's,

487
00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.740
there's something to Michael Jackson's voice when you listen to the way he would

488
00:29:14.741 --> 00:29:18.370
sing that.
Fuck man,
that doesn't sound like any guy I've ever heard.

489
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.610
<v 2>No,
no.</v>

490
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.270
<v 5>It's why tell him that it's human nature.</v>

491
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.490
I guess she didn't feel that way.

492
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:32.710
<v 2>I tried to do thriller once a Karaoke and I almost shit a fucking aneurysm.</v>

493
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.360
Yeah,
it's so high.
It's so like you can't try to sing it.

494
00:29:37.361 --> 00:29:40.480
Try to sing the chorus
without

495
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.270
<v 6>the bat strike.
Yes,</v>

496
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.080
<v 0>but do it without doing the false shadow.
Just try.</v>

497
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.650
I can't fucking sing anyway.
Okay.
Here's this terrible,
here we go.

498
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.793
<v 6>Because</v>

499
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:05.770
<v 0>no,
I can't say,
well,
I can't do anything else.
That's it.</v>

500
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.220
I can't say it's impossible.

501
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.460
It's impossible to hit those notes like it's dude,

502
00:30:11.461 --> 00:30:15.720
it's past Getty Lee [inaudible].
It's like way past.
Ready leave.
Well,

503
00:30:15.721 --> 00:30:19.770
Getty Lee,
who I love still sounds like an odd man.

504
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.580
I love rush.
But when you listen to like living in the limelight,

505
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.450
please singing that song.
He sounds like an odd man.

506
00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.940
It doesn't sound like something that can't be achieved when you hear Michael

507
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:31.680
Jackson saying,
you go,

508
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.620
something's going on here and I should have fucking put my finger on it.

509
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.140
It's not,
it's not mail.
No.
Yeah,

510
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.370
it sounds womanly and that's forever been the joke about him.

511
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:46.950
I think there might be something to my stupid theory and I think it's because I

512
00:30:46.951 --> 00:30:48.210
have this connection with,

513
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.480
I have this like weird thing about him because I've always wanted to know like

514
00:30:54.151 --> 00:30:58.920
what makes a person want to stay a child?
Because I've always been accused,

515
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:04.400
rightly so,
of being immature.
I'm very immature,
but it's almost on purpose,
right?

516
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.170
Because when I grew up,
I saw these people that were mature,

517
00:31:07.171 --> 00:31:11.120
that we're living these mature lives and they were fucking miserable man.
They,

518
00:31:11.121 --> 00:31:14.600
they suffered all day.
There was no reward that came home to a wife.
They hated,

519
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.400
they lived a shit life and a lot of them died young.
I just,

520
00:31:17.401 --> 00:31:20.140
I saw it in front of me.
I didn't want to do that.
So I,

521
00:31:20.141 --> 00:31:23.010
I tried to figure out every way I could to rebel against work.

522
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:28.460
And I remember seeing like this guy and seeing Michael Jackson how brilliant he

523
00:31:29.431 --> 00:31:29.761
was,

524
00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:34.650
but how odd it was and how he always had like these amusement park rides at his

525
00:31:34.651 --> 00:31:38.130
house and invited little kids over.
And I'm like,
what was wrong?

526
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.370
It's beautiful that the guy wanted to help kids.
It's beautiful.

527
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.800
The guy always work with these people that were sick and these kids that were

528
00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.210
dying.
It is beautiful.

529
00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:49.170
But what was it that connected him so much to childlike things?

530
00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:53.280
Like why was he so child?
Like why did he never have,
I mean,
he had children,

531
00:31:53.281 --> 00:31:55.650
but they weren't really his children.
There were white kids there.

532
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.380
They're fully white kids.
If you look at them today,
you can say,
well,

533
00:31:58.381 --> 00:32:02.220
these didn't come from his DNA.
They might've been as children.
But yeah,

534
00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.210
it's very odd.

535
00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:08.130
It's very odd also how much his children are out of the limelight there.
There,

536
00:32:08.131 --> 00:32:12.810
there's no connection with them to Michael Jackson.
None.
None whatsoever.

537
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.730
Which is good.
I mean,
they're just kids.
They don't,
you know,

538
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.370
they don't deserve it.
It,
I do think it is good,
but I mean,
even like with,

539
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.200
with other celebrities that attempted to keep the kid out of the spotlight,

540
00:32:25.201 --> 00:32:28.560
like,
you know,
m and m doesn't,
aside from talking about her,

541
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.050
doesn't like put his daughter out there.
Uh,

542
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:33.990
and he's like staunchly opposed to it yet.

543
00:32:33.991 --> 00:32:37.770
We all kind of know what she looks like.
We all know who she is.

544
00:32:37.771 --> 00:32:41.240
Like if you saw her the same with the Cobain and Courtney

545
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.390
<v 2>love's kid.
Um,
but Michael Jackson,</v>

546
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.050
it's like I couldn't pick those kids out of a fucking lineup.
Well,
that's good.

547
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.980
I hope that that's because the family sheltered the kids from all the crazy

548
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:54.740
people that,
I mean,
you want to talk crazy people.

549
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.950
Michael Jackson was a star on a level that we can't even begin to comprehend.

550
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.350
I mean,
this is a guy who couldn't leave the fucking house.

551
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:07.880
If he left the fucking house,
there would be a swarm of people.
Yeah.
I,
you know,

552
00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:12.740
I met a girl one more round,
sir.
He's,
yes,

553
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:16.160
Brian,
you're going in would be a pussy.
I knew a girl that,
uh,

554
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:20.540
that new a Brittany Spears.
Whoa.
Like in recent years.
I mean,

555
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:25.400
and she was,
I was like,
what's she like?
And she goes,

556
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.590
she goes,
she's really down to earth.
She goes,

557
00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:32.300
she's really cool considering especially who she is.
And she was like,
dude,

558
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:37.360
she literally can't go anywhere in the entire world without being known.

559
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.110
Like I can't even fathom that.
Stan hope is buddies with Johnny Depp.
Yeah,

560
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.300
Johnny Depp Sustain Hope.

561
00:33:43.301 --> 00:33:47.150
Then Johnny Depp contact to Stan hope about some project and got together and

562
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:50.090
started hanging out with them in England and he realized when they were hanging

563
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:53.210
out,
I was like,
he goes,
oh,
I can't go anywhere.
Like you can't,

564
00:33:53.211 --> 00:33:54.890
he can't go anywhere.
It doesn't go anywhere.

565
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:59.580
He has brings a chef over to his home when he was over at his house.
Um,
uh,

566
00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:03.540
not Keith Richards.
Who's in the rolling stones?
Keith Richards,
Jagger,

567
00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:04.910
Mick Jagger.
The other one was the other one.

568
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.950
I don't know who the fuck is in the rolling stones.
Who's the other guy?
Ron Wood.

569
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.920
Is that his name?
Shit.
What did we retarded?

570
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.980
How do we not know who's trying to remember the drummer's name and I can't

571
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:19.700
remember his name.
Yeah,
I'm trying to,
okay.

572
00:34:19.701 --> 00:34:23.810
Rollingstones who the fuck is in the rolling stones?
God,
isn't that funny?

573
00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:26.750
You only remember Keith Richards.
I was never a big stones guy,

574
00:34:26.751 --> 00:34:29.960
so I barely on the a bolt of you.

575
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.600
I love the logo though with the lips or the tongue or whatever the fuck was on

576
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:35.390
their website.
They just expect you to know who the fuck everybody is.

577
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.960
Back in the day that was sex sexual,
I was a kid growing up.
It's so weird kid.

578
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:44.570
The logos,
what stopped me from getting into the logos where it stopped for me.

579
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:45.681
Uh,
you know what?

580
00:34:45.681 --> 00:34:49.280
I should shut the fuck up right here because I probably shouldn't even say what

581
00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:52.880
happened.
I was about,
I'd probably,
it's probably good.
Okay.
Ron Wood,

582
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.190
that is his name.
Anyway,

583
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:58.790
the point is there were all hanging out and Stan hope realized,

584
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.050
oh Johnny Depp is two famous.

585
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.040
He's gotten way too famous and apparently it was from those pirates of the

586
00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:07.490
Caribbean movies.
From there on out,
there's no more going to restaurants.
Dude.

587
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:11.630
I when,
when Chappelle came back from Africa,
when he went,
when he like,

588
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:12.831
you know,

589
00:35:12.831 --> 00:35:16.310
ran off from the TV show and everything and when he came back he went on this

590
00:35:16.311 --> 00:35:18.590
tour and I toured with them.

591
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.540
And I know Dave isn't,
you know,
Johnny Depp,

592
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:27.830
but he's pretty fucking famous,
you know,
and uh,
he,
uh,

593
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:29.270
it was crazy man,

594
00:35:29.271 --> 00:35:32.000
because we were doing these shows and I was opening for him for like two weeks

595
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.440
and he'd literally just be like,
when I go to the mall,
man,
and I'd be like,
yeah,

596
00:35:36.441 --> 00:35:38.010
let's go.
He'd be like,
all right,

597
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.840
<v 4>let's go.
And literally I would walk to the mall with Dave Chappelle,</v>

598
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.850
no security,
nothing.

599
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:49.080
And cars were screeching in the fucking streets.

600
00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:51.930
People were jumping out of their cars.
They were running up to,

601
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.640
we went to a footlocker in the mall.

602
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.570
We had to leave through the back exit because so many people were flooding in

603
00:35:57.571 --> 00:35:58.990
because he was,
and I was,

604
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.720
the worst part was we went a pack of people followed us to the hotel.

605
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.820
Hip fouled him.
I was just there.
Uh,

606
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.870
but a pack of people like fucking dogs follow him

607
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.090
to the hotel.
Like I'm telling it all going,
I'm Rick James Bitch.
Yes,
yes.

608
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:19.680
They were backwards.
Baseball hats on.
Yeah.
No,
it's all,
it's all like,

609
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:23.100
it was like a lot of like fat white guys and uh,

610
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.020
and uh,
and uh,
they fought us.
There was like 30 people.
I'm not exaggerating.

611
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.370
We got to the hotel,
the,

612
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.650
the concierge at the hotel had to literally hold the people back so we could get

613
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:38.370
onto the hotel or the elevator.
And as the doors were shutting,

614
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:42.780
a guy got around the concierge and ran up and literally put his phone almost

615
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:46.200
against Chappelle's face and goes,
say something funny.

616
00:36:46.201 --> 00:36:49.110
My friends on the phone say something funny and Dave just kind of stared at this

617
00:36:49.111 --> 00:36:52.890
guy and we got on the elevator and the doors shut.
And I go,
dude,

618
00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.550
I don't know how you didn't just lay that dude out,
man.

619
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.670
That was like the rudest thing I've ever seen anybody do to a person.

620
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.810
And he was just like,
what are you going to do man?
That's,

621
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.410
that's why we're doing the time.

622
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.040
Why you need to stay high when you're that famous all day.

623
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:12.330
But he gave me the best advice ever,
uh,
that ever gotten comedy.

624
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.420
And I t I talk about this in my act a little bit like the,
I tell the story,

625
00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:19.590
but we were hanging out after we did a show one night in Cleveland at the,

626
00:37:19.591 --> 00:37:23.850
at this big amphitheater and after the show I'm talking to these two girls and

627
00:37:23.851 --> 00:37:27.160
they're like,
you're so funny.
And I'm like,
once you come back to the hook towel,

628
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:31.390
yeah,
come hang out.
Dave might stop by.
You know,
I was trying to say that.
Yeah,

629
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:32.940
yeah.
I was trying to pick up these chicks.

630
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.960
He actually wasn't going to stop by the imagine if you were in the middle of

631
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.110
boner and she heard Dave's voice and just like get off me.
Yeah,
exactly.

632
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.930
Imagine me,
his cock blocking anybody standing in the living room.

633
00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:49.260
I'm Rick James Bitch.
Oh my God.
Is it hell

634
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.300
I need to meet him.
He's not going anywhere.
I'm coming 30 seconds.

635
00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:01.980
He was awesome.
No rape.
He was an awesome wing man cause he was,

636
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:06.270
he was,
he's married and he was like a great dude about it.
He was just like,

637
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:09.100
you know,
he would sit there and like talk to you.
You know,

638
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.150
with the chicks and then like he'd peel off and then you'd be there with the

639
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:15.510
checks.
Man,
it was fucking beautiful.
And the chicks would go,
you must be special.

640
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:20.430
Oh Dude.
Well they also just saw you open for dude,
it was so,
oh,
look at you.

641
00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:24.840
You're glowing.
There's really,
it was nice.
It was nice.

642
00:38:24.841 --> 00:38:25.674
It was really nice.

643
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:29.940
So I was talking to these two girls after one of the shows in Cleveland and,
uh,

644
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.210
and I'm like,
come back to the hotel and they're,
they're being wishy washy.

645
00:38:33.211 --> 00:38:36.400
And I'm like,
all right,
whatever.
And they take my number and I,
I go backstage

646
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:41.140
<v 2>and I'm bitching to Dave and the,
the tour bus driver about the checks.</v>

647
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:41.651
And I'm like,
you know,

648
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:44.470
they fucking just being on wishy washy and I don't know this and I don't know,

649
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:46.450
it's just annoying.
Just fucking hanging out.

650
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:48.840
If you're gonna hang out and the bus driver goes,
Joe,

651
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.850
I'm a tell you what you need to do,
man.
You need to walk up to that girl,

652
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:56.080
look her dead in the eye and say,
do you want to suck my Dick or not?

653
00:38:56.870 --> 00:39:01.270
Right?
And I was like,
terrible advice.
I was like,
okay,
okay.
And uh,

654
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.080
I was considering it for a second and then Chappelle goes,

655
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.320
don't do that shit man.
Don't do it.
You're going to fuck around Joe.

656
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:10.870
You're going to get famous one of these days.
10 years from now,

657
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:12.420
that bitch will be on hardcopy going,

658
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.080
Joe Derosa told me to suck his dick and Cleveland once.
Well,

659
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:22.690
the reality is even if that didn't happen,

660
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:24.400
there's going to be a girl if you get famous,

661
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:29.401
that just remembers a story that never happened at all about Joe Derosa toner to

662
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.060
suck your cock,
right?
Right.

663
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:35.860
I've had fucking people tell me stories about me that absolutely didn't exist.

664
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.370
That never happened really about at fucking on the podcast.

665
00:39:39.371 --> 00:39:43.210
Remember crash was telling a story about a fight in New York that never took

666
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:47.140
place about how I told this guy,
can you handle that guy?
I'll take the other two.

667
00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:49.480
And I went over and kicked some guy in the head.
Never happened.

668
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.570
None of it happened real.
He was like arguing with me.
That happened.
I'm like,

669
00:39:52.571 --> 00:39:55.780
dude,
I am telling you I didn't.
I haven't fought anybody since.

670
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.170
I haven't had a street fight since I was in high school.
All right.

671
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:03.820
I've avoided every single physical altercation outside of competition since high

672
00:40:03.821 --> 00:40:06.430
school.
So this never happened.
It's impossible that it happened.

673
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:10.270
And it's a great like rumor though about your makes you sound like a killer

674
00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.770
sound like an asshole.
I don't think it makes you sound like an answer.

675
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:15.280
Totally makes me sound like an asshole.
Listen,

676
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:16.450
whenever you see a bunch of people and you're like,

677
00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:18.730
could you took dot I'll ticket,
why won't you just turn around,

678
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.710
get the fuck out of there.
That's the smart move.

679
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:25.510
The smart guy walks out of there.
I see.
I'm,
I'm a little fucking whisper.

680
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:27.700
Grasp that.
That can't fight at all.

681
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:35.230
Most fucking the weakest thing you ever been scanned up straight.

682
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.640
That's such a funny
of grass.

683
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.060
I remember seeing a tail once onstage and uh,
there were,

684
00:40:43.061 --> 00:40:46.300
there were three fat girls in the front row or no,
there was two,

685
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.460
I think it was two fingers and a fat girl in the middle.

686
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.520
And I don't remember why he said this to the fat girl,

687
00:40:51.521 --> 00:40:54.610
but it was something about how she didn't think she was fat.
And he goes,
oh,

688
00:40:54.611 --> 00:40:58.440
I know,
right?
You look at just sitting there like a little blade of grass,

689
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.490
a little blade of grass.

690
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:08.020
I think he's fat shaming that's outlawed now.
So cool guy on the Internet,

691
00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:10.120
fat shaming is fucking mail.

692
00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:14.620
Hypocrisy slash patriarchy slash privilege lash.

693
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.310
Keep going.
Uh,
I,
but I,
so I'm,

694
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:22.360
I would love a story like that.
I would like,
my point is,
is I'm a pussy.

695
00:41:22.361 --> 00:41:27.100
I would love to be in a situation where I literally go,
I can take this guy.

696
00:41:27.101 --> 00:41:29.980
Can you take that guy?
I would just never be in that situation.

697
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.920
People make stuff up like that.
Things that never happened.
I take,
since

698
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.970
<v 0>I had a guy come up to me at a party and he goes,
my Dennis played golf with you.</v>

699
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.900
And I go,
no,
no,
it wasn't me goes,
oh yeah,
you're the guy from fear factor.

700
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:43.430
My dentist played golf with you.
I go dude,

701
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.690
I've never played golf ever in my whole life.
I've never played golf.

702
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:51.620
It's pride that other Rogan that that sports newscaster and it's just like

703
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.950
probably not.
I mean he probably plays golf.
Fred Rogan.
Fred Rogan.
Yeah,

704
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:58.340
maybe it might be,
but he was insisting it was the fear factor guy.

705
00:41:58.341 --> 00:42:01.490
He was insisting.
Yeah,
it's a,
I don't know man.

706
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.860
I Dunno if I ever reach your level.

707
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.800
Like I'll be able to relate to these stories.

708
00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:10.510
I wish I had rumors floating around about me.
I got nothing going on right.

709
00:42:10.511 --> 00:42:12.350
As rumors from high school.
That never happened.

710
00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:16.850
That I talked to a friend who knew a friend of mine from high school things that

711
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:19.880
happened that never happened.
Like what?
It's just violent things.

712
00:42:19.881 --> 00:42:22.550
Mostly violent things.
You always this guy like a,

713
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:26.300
like a cut fucking MMA type dude.

714
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:30.650
Well in the hot from high school on I did martial arts like pretty religiously.

715
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:34.990
That was my whole life from like 15 on.
Am I crazy?
Cause I remember when,

716
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.310
see when I would see you on news radio,

717
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:40.490
I don't remember you being jack like this though,
where you cut up like that.

718
00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:43.940
It was a whole videos and me taking my shirt off,
I had to wrestle Andy.

719
00:42:43.941 --> 00:42:48.740
Dick wants and fucking number that find that.
Yeah.
I wasn't as big.

720
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.860
I didn't really lift weights until I started doing Jujitsu and I started doing

721
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:55.760
Jujitsu in 96 so that was when I started lifting weights and I started hanging

722
00:42:55.761 --> 00:42:59.060
out with Eddie Bravo,
my,
my good friend Eddie Bravo,
my best friend.

723
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:03.620
Like we're around 99 2000 somewhere around then.

724
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:07.010
And we started lifting weights pretty seriously right after that cause I started

725
00:43:07.011 --> 00:43:08.720
really getting into Jujitsu.
Okay.

726
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:13.370
And one of the things about Jujitsu is just protecting your joints and

727
00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:16.730
protecting your back and protecting your neck and all these different parts of

728
00:43:16.731 --> 00:43:21.731
your body and that adding muscle to your body keeps you from getting injured.

729
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:26.240
It's kind of important.
Okay.
And also gives you more strength to execute moves.

730
00:43:26.241 --> 00:43:27.920
It's just like Jujitsu is a very,

731
00:43:27.921 --> 00:43:31.790
very grueling activity and the stronger you are,
I mean it's good.

732
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.820
It's most important to be technical to understand the technique,

733
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:36.500
but the stronger you are the better.

734
00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:38.840
So I started lifting weights pretty seriously around that.

735
00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:43.490
So this is me when I didn't even lift weights.
Yeah.
This was like,

736
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.810
was this from the show?
This is from news radio.
Yeah.
I like how I asked that.
No,

737
00:43:47.811 --> 00:43:49.870
it's a real match between you and Andy Dick.

738
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.660
That's what I look like with no weight lifting at all.
That was just kickboxing.

739
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.390
<v 7>Jesus,
that was pretty good.
Yeah.</v>

740
00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:09.220
But then you click it tickles me and kicks my ass
like I would,

741
00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.780
I was just about to say the same thing to you.
Chat.
All right dude.
That's it.

742
00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:17.950
Yeah,
it is.
It tick,
tick.
It's so stupid.

743
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:21.210
<v 0>Shut it off now how dare you.
So</v>

744
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.830
I liked that show.
Yeah.
That was like probably 1990 it was Phil was alive.

745
00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.000
So it was before 90 s I think he was murdered in 98.

746
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:36.420
[inaudible] four that was probably 97 96 so no,

747
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:39.420
there was no lifting weights back then.
It was just the kickboxing.
Jesus,
man,

748
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:43.230
you were ripped,
dude.
Still are.
You want to talk about it?

749
00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.710
<v 4>I got nothing.
I got nothing to it.
I think I have any thing to say about,</v>

750
00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.870
well,
I went,
you know,
I don't understand it.

751
00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.730
I don't mean that in a derogatory way.

752
00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:58.130
<v 0>That was my life.
I went down a different path,
you know,
like uh,
you know,</v>

753
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.260
I don't understand.
I have a friends that do extreme sports,
you know,

754
00:45:02.261 --> 00:45:03.650
like do they do like a,

755
00:45:03.651 --> 00:45:07.000
the jumped bikes and shit like that and motorbikes and stuff like that and do

756
00:45:07.001 --> 00:45:11.050
flips and they're all busted up and like,
I know this dude Eric Apple,

757
00:45:11.051 --> 00:45:15.200
his wrist is,
he broke his wrist so bad.
It's like an inch shorter.
That's like,

758
00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:16.420
he's out.
Like all the ligaments.

759
00:45:16.421 --> 00:45:20.740
Which any anyone on from that to do MMA fighting?
She's just crazy,
crazy people.

760
00:45:20.741 --> 00:45:24.070
Like he's crying.
That's how he grew up.
You know,

761
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:28.900
I literally grew up doing martial arts competition.
So that was my,

762
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:33.580
I mean,
it made me a way more balanced person,
if that makes any sense.

763
00:45:33.581 --> 00:45:36.820
I would have worked way more fucked up given my circumstances.

764
00:45:36.821 --> 00:45:40.480
I needed something to throw all my energy and I just had so much anger and

765
00:45:40.481 --> 00:45:44.920
anxiety and insecurity.
I needed something and I found it in martial arts,

766
00:45:44.921 --> 00:45:49.860
but it just happened to be the thing for me at that time.
So that's why,
you know,

767
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:53.050
it's not like it makes perfect sense.
It's not for everybody.
You know?

768
00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:55.900
It can help you though if you're looking for something to do,

769
00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.240
to give you some physical exercise.

770
00:45:58.241 --> 00:46:03.040
And also it gives you a kind of understanding of your,
your body and fear.

771
00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:08.510
<v 4>I wish I had a,
I wish I had been pushed in that direction at a younger age,</v>

772
00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:13.430
at a young age.
Uh,
because I'm too old for it now.
And I told you I'm 37.

773
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:19.020
<v 0>My friend's dad started doing Jujitsu when he was 57.
Really got his black belt.</v>

774
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.930
I think it was like 65 or 66.
He got his black belt.

775
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:24.220
<v 4>Yeah.
Maybe I should,
I don't know.</v>

776
00:46:24.221 --> 00:46:28.050
I have such terrible anxiety and angst issue still.
And yeah,

777
00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.980
like therapy for it and stuff.
But

778
00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:33.370
<v 0>the main,
I mean if you want to talk about this,
but sure.</v>

779
00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.620
Do you have a main fear of thing that fucks with you?

780
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:40.590
<v 4>Uh,
my fear of death is pretty,
uh,</v>

781
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:45.720
tremendous,
pretty tremendous and extremely irrational.
Um,

782
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:48.680
it's,
it's almost crippling.
It's almost crippling.
Wow.

783
00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.750
<v 0>Have you done any psychedelics,</v>

784
00:46:50.751 --> 00:46:54.980
like heavy doses of mushrooms or heavy doses of yeah,

785
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.110
<v 4>I dunno what heavy doses are,
but I mean,
I,
you know,
I've,</v>

786
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:01.830
I took my share of mushrooms and acid through the years,
uh,

787
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:06.960
<v 0>but in your hand and show me what's the biggest dose you've ever taken?
You know,</v>

788
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:10.890
like,
no,
that's not good enough.
Sun,
you showing me a little tiny quarter

789
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:14.640
<v 4>size,
you know,
I remember tripping for like 11,
12 hours on acid,</v>

790
00:47:14.641 --> 00:47:15.474
like stuff like that.

791
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.140
<v 0>I don't have any experience with acid,</v>

792
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:21.100
but I do have experience with mushrooms and my experiences that there's a big

793
00:47:21.101 --> 00:47:26.101
difference between like a couple of caps and stems and a fucking handful.

794
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.320
It's a handful.
You want like five grams.
Oh,
you do the,

795
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:35.590
when you do like those big trips,
that's when you just go.

796
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:39.210
It just obliterates your ego and you,

797
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:44.240
you go just deep into the realm of perception and of understanding your position

798
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:52.720
in this great thing that you see in front of you and how much your position in

799
00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:55.450
this great thing,
this great thing being the entire universe itself.

800
00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.490
How much of your position is distorted by your own ability to recognize your

801
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:03.280
surroundings and your need to survive.
And then your ego,

802
00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:05.950
which comes into place and wants you to get laid,
wants you to be fed,

803
00:48:05.951 --> 00:48:08.470
wants you to stay alive and competitive.

804
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.410
Like all those variables they fuck with your,

805
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.440
your ability to understand the true nature of reality and sometimes a real ego

806
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:20.890
obliterating experience is what you need just to kind of put it in place.

807
00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.490
<v 4>See the problem is now for me,</v>

808
00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:28.540
I had some brushes with that in my time that I would do these heavier

809
00:48:30.031 --> 00:48:31.470
psychedelics.
Uh,

810
00:48:31.471 --> 00:48:35.460
but my problem is now is that my anxiety is such an issue that I wouldn't be

811
00:48:35.461 --> 00:48:38.460
able to handle it.
Wow.
I can't even handle pot now.
I mean,

812
00:48:38.461 --> 00:48:42.450
if I went into a hard trip like that,
I would start freaking out.

813
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.740
I turned to inward.
I'm a pretty lethargic guy,

814
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:50.310
so I've always been more of a fan of stimulants then.

815
00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:53.240
Then barbiturates and depressants,
um,

816
00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:56.550
which is what eventually pulled me away from marijuana because my problem with

817
00:48:56.551 --> 00:49:01.470
marijuana is I'll smoke it and I go deep into my head and it's bad.

818
00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:05.520
If I had,
if I had smoked any weed before I came in here today,

819
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:09.210
this would literally,
I would be panicking right now because I feel,

820
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:13.190
I feel a general anxiety just being here.
Yeah.
Why,

821
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.000
what is the general anxiety?

822
00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.980
Just anytime you're talking to people or that you're online?
Um,
I have,
I have,

823
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:24.600
I definitely have,
uh,
you know,
self esteem issues and,

824
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:27.960
and um,
uh,
excuse me,

825
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:31.650
a issues about my own achievement and worth.

826
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:36.030
So when I do something like this for the first time,
um,
I'm,

827
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:41.040
I got the first few times,
uh,
I am nervous because unlike,

828
00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:45.660
don't fuck it up.
Don't fuck this up.
This is a guy you don't know.

829
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.400
You know,
cause I don't really know you.
You know what I mean?
We,
we kind of

830
00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:53.330
<v 0>kind of,
but we're like,
I mean I consider you a like a comrade,</v>

831
00:49:53.331 --> 00:49:57.230
a colleague,
a fellow comic,
every comic that I know that's a comic.

832
00:49:57.231 --> 00:50:00.540
Like you get sanctioned by Jimmy Norton or any of those guys that you're,

833
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.020
you're in your,
you can stay at my house.
I don't even know you.

834
00:50:03.021 --> 00:50:04.820
But if you want to stay at my house,
he could stay at my house

835
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:06.750
<v 4>and I,
that's how I feel.
Thank you.</v>

836
00:50:06.751 --> 00:50:11.340
And I honestly feel the same way about you and not because I've known you from

837
00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:14.970
TV for longer than we've known each other personally.
Like I,
I feel the same way.

838
00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:18.900
I feel like we're part of a fraternity and not just because of comedy,

839
00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.360
but it's a little more specified for,
for us,

840
00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.830
I think because we're part of the LNA camp and you know,
that's a special camp.

841
00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.100
It was a special camp to be a part of.
So still

842
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:31.390
<v 0>does he know?
I don't know if they're going to ever going to sort that out,</v>

843
00:50:31.391 --> 00:50:33.070
but it's not the same.

844
00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.090
I love Jimmy and I love opie and they're great together and I listened to it all

845
00:50:37.091 --> 00:50:39.490
the time,
but God dammit,
I Ms. Anthony.

846
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.520
<v 4>It's,
it is,
it is a bummer.
It's a real bummer,
you know?
That's,
that's uh,</v>

847
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:50.110
well,
let me answer your question.
Yeah.
The,
uh,

848
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:55.590
but,
uh,
but so I feel like,
you know,
every,
everything I do,

849
00:50:55.620 --> 00:51:00.480
for instance right now in La,
and trust me,
it's not a terrible anxiety right now.

850
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.190
I was excited about this too.

851
00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:06.690
Like a lot of it is just excitement and interpreting the excitement.
But,
um,

852
00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:11.510
you know,
I'm doing that.
I'm doing a part of the TV show right now,
uh,

853
00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:15.600
that looks like it might last for a little while.

854
00:51:15.601 --> 00:51:17.850
I don't know yet because it's sort of episode episode,

855
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:22.230
but with something like that,
like every time I do it,

856
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.040
I'm like,
don't fuck this up dude.
This is your art.
You know what I mean?

857
00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:30.760
And that's what I do and it's terrible.
It's a terrible,
terrible anxiety.
Um,

858
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.050
it doesn't prevent me from performing.
It doesn't prevent me from delivering,

859
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:39.330
but it's there and it's the kind of thing where if something does go wrong,

860
00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.210
I have a very hard time just leaving it behind me and going,

861
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.760
it was a bad day at work,
dude,
let it go.
You know,

862
00:51:44.761 --> 00:51:49.761
I did a charity event last night and it wasn't a great show and this was a huge

863
00:51:51.151 --> 00:51:54.780
step for me today.
I woke up with anxiety about it at four 30 in the morning.

864
00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:57.750
Why did you do this bit?
Why did you do that?
And I was just like,
dude,

865
00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:01.170
you didn't do anything wrong.
You just weren't the best choice for that Gig.

866
00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.440
That's it.
It's okay.
You didn't do anything wrong.

867
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:09.090
And I think most people go down that road first and my whole life,

868
00:52:09.091 --> 00:52:12.720
I've never gone down that road first.
I go down the blaming myself road first.

869
00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.360
<v 0>Well,
let me be honest with you then.
Um,
I,</v>

870
00:52:15.361 --> 00:52:20.361
I've had shows where I had a great set for 90 minutes and I'll close badly,

871
00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.450
fuck up something and I can't sleep.

872
00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:28.470
I'll wake up in the middle of the night and I just,
in a hurricane,

873
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:31.890
a hurricane of anguish and being upset.

874
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:35.790
But I think that's because I care.
It's because I care.

875
00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:39.800
Because I don't want anybody leaving a show ever and feeling like,
ah,

876
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.850
I don't ever want,
I know they paid money.

877
00:52:41.851 --> 00:52:45.750
That drives me fucking crazy and terrible babysitters.
They planned it out.

878
00:52:45.751 --> 00:52:47.850
They saved their money for that.
You know,

879
00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:50.940
I don't want anyone to ever think that I ever take that for granted because that

880
00:52:50.941 --> 00:52:52.300
would drive me fucking crazy if,

881
00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:55.650
if I went to see someone and I knew they didn't give a shit and they took it for

882
00:52:55.651 --> 00:52:56.484
granted,

883
00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:59.480
that's one of the worst things that perform we can ever do with their audience.

884
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:02.370
It's disrespect their audience.
Right.
I brought this up before,

885
00:53:02.371 --> 00:53:05.720
but I'll bring it up again.
It's what I call the Joe Dimaggio principle,
right?

886
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.230
Cause I remembered this quote when I was a kid,

887
00:53:07.231 --> 00:53:10.740
Joe Dimaggio was like 40 years old,
sliding into third base and they,

888
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.170
the guy in the other team goes,
you know why you playing so hard?

889
00:53:13.171 --> 00:53:15.210
You're already in the hall of fame.
And he goes,

890
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:19.170
cause someone out there is someone in the audience that hasn't seen Joe Dimaggio

891
00:53:19.171 --> 00:53:21.000
play and I don't want to let them down.

892
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.900
<v 4>That's so great.
Lori.
Lori Kilmartin said once to me years,</v>

893
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.770
I was opening for her in Philadelphia.
And I said,
how do you,

894
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:33.360
how do you manage to go out and show the same enthusiasm every set?

895
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:36.540
Because I noticed throughout the weekend that she was doing that and I was

896
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:39.660
having a hard time with that at that point in my career.
And she said,

897
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:42.060
just think about it.
She's like,
you're a fan of comedy.

898
00:53:42.061 --> 00:53:44.880
Haven't you ever seen a comedian that makes you laugh so hard you want to fall

899
00:53:44.881 --> 00:53:45.810
over?
And I go,
yeah.
And she goes,

900
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:49.020
there's a chance somebody in the audience that's going to happen because of you

901
00:53:49.021 --> 00:53:51.690
tonight.
You should always have that in your head.
And that's,

902
00:53:51.691 --> 00:53:54.240
that's the Dimaggio thing you just said.
You know what I mean?

903
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:58.170
<v 0>It's a lot of times it's just a perception issue.
Like how you deal with things.</v>

904
00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:01.730
Like,
um,
I had a friend that came up to me once,
uh,

905
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.330
we were in Vegas and uh,
I brought him to some fights and uh,

906
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:10.410
after the fights it gets pretty fucking crazy.
It's,
you know,

907
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:13.530
there's 18,000 people there and try to wake your way through the casino.

908
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.020
Good luck,
you know,
you're going to get stopped every five seconds.

909
00:54:16.021 --> 00:54:17.700
And he was like,
does it get annoying?
I go,
well,

910
00:54:17.701 --> 00:54:20.520
there's certain times where I have things that I have to do where I have to

911
00:54:20.521 --> 00:54:24.270
leave.
Like I have to go to a show or I'm,
I have to meet someone for dinner.

912
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:27.030
I mean a half to be there by x amount of time.
I just have to say no.

913
00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:30.120
But for the most part it's just a bunch of people being nice.

914
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:34.140
But my attitude about it is always that every time I meet someone I reset

915
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:37.500
because it's like,
I don't ever think of it as like,
oh,
here's another person,

916
00:54:37.501 --> 00:54:39.960
here's another person.
Every time I meet someone I reset.

917
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.560
So it's a total new experience because I know it's a new experience for them.

918
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.460
And if I,
if I don't,
I don't accept that.
I can't always say yes.

919
00:54:47.461 --> 00:54:51.030
I can't always call your friend.
I can't always fucking take picture.

920
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:53.160
I have to go sometimes,
like sometimes it's unavoidable,

921
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:55.740
there's a hundred people and you gotta be out of there because you're supposed

922
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:59.700
to be somewhere in five minutes.
I can't be late for a show.

923
00:54:59.701 --> 00:55:03.060
I can't be late for an interview or an appearance and I have to do or whatever

924
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:04.040
the fuck that's right.

925
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:08.370
<v 4>Yeah.
No,
and I think that reset mentality is great.
Like,
you know,</v>

926
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:12.570
when I first started doing ona,
Burke told me years ago,

927
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:15.570
he was like,
listen,
here's what you do.
He goes,

928
00:55:15.571 --> 00:55:20.080
you're doing the show now guys are gonna start coming out to see you.
You,

929
00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:23.520
you sell your merch,
you shake everybody's hand.
And he goes and,

930
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:25.740
and talk and just talk.
He goes,
you know,

931
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:29.460
sometimes you can't spend a lot of time with everybody,
but talked to everybody,

932
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:32.500
say hello.
And he was like,
and that's what you do dude.
That like,
and,

933
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.290
and not that I would have done any different,

934
00:55:34.291 --> 00:55:38.040
but him saying that really cemented it into my head.
He's a great guy.
Yeah.

935
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:43.020
And I've seen him do it and I've always done it if there are fucking two people

936
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:44.850
in the audience that wanted to see me,

937
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:50.010
and it was a shitty show of all time because there were 98 that didn't give a

938
00:55:50.011 --> 00:55:52.350
fuck about who I was and heckling or whatever.

939
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:57.030
I spent time with those two guys and talk to them,
you know what I mean?

940
00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:01.260
And I talked to them like,
you know what I mean?
Like,
like talking to you.

941
00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.890
<v 0>Yeah.
That's how it should be.
You know,</v>

942
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:06.770
Burt said once that something that I thought was really cool,
he said,
uh,

943
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.490
we're were just talking about out,

944
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:12.150
everything's going really well for him and he's real happy.
And,
uh,
he sells,

945
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:16.980
you know,
I do.
I remember when I was a kid and,
uh,
I would,
uh,

946
00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:19.640
I'd go see a band and then,
uh,
you know,
they're,

947
00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:22.320
the new song sucked and I just wasn't into it.

948
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:25.120
They put on a bad show and it felt like they fucked me up.
And he goes,

949
00:56:25.121 --> 00:56:27.310
and I know that if people come out to see me,
their fans,

950
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.190
and I'm not going to fuck them.
I'm not going to fuck him.
I'm going to,

951
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:32.020
I'm going to write hard.
I'm gonna work hard.

952
00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:34.660
I'm going to get out there and give it my best.
I don't want to fuck them.

953
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.793
That's a great attitude.

954
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:40.240
<v 4>It is.
It is.
I mean,
he,
he works,
he works so hard and he,
and he gives his,</v>

955
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.720
he delivers to his fans what they deserve.
I think everybody,

956
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:48.940
excuse me,
I think everybody,
many comics do that.
But I think again,

957
00:56:48.941 --> 00:56:51.490
like what was always special to me about,

958
00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:54.420
or one of the things that was always special to me about being part of that ONA

959
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:59.700
fraternity was that those comics all did that everybody delivered.

960
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.940
You know,
everybody had the mentality of it's a new year.

961
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:06.640
I have to go back to the,
to that city again.

962
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:10.570
I better have a new hour or it better be the much,

963
00:57:10.571 --> 00:57:14.920
much better version of last year's hour cause I'm about to tape it or whatever

964
00:57:14.921 --> 00:57:16.390
it is,
you know.
But uh,

965
00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:21.900
and it was Patrice was like that obviously Norton uh,

966
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:27.040
uh,
Louis,
uh,
obviously you know,
like,
like these guys,
you know,
the,
the,

967
00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:31.060
you know for like that,
that's what they,
that's what they all did.

968
00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:31.460
<v 0>You know,</v>

969
00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:35.390
one of the great things about the opiate Anthony show was that it was a hangout.

970
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:39.800
Like even if like Ricky Gervais' came on or some big star came on,

971
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:41.000
if you and I were on the show,

972
00:57:41.001 --> 00:57:43.310
we would still be on the show and then we'd sit in there and everybody knew to

973
00:57:43.311 --> 00:57:47.000
lay back and let someone talk.
Or occasionally everybody would jump in.

974
00:57:47.001 --> 00:57:50.330
I mean it was completely free form.
And because of that,

975
00:57:50.331 --> 00:57:51.500
there was a lot of ball Boston.

976
00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:54.620
Like when Bob Kelly's on the guy gets fucking tortured when Voss is on,

977
00:57:54.621 --> 00:57:57.710
he gets tortured.
Yeah.
And because of that,
like getting tortured,

978
00:57:57.711 --> 00:58:01.070
like everybody has to like mind their p's and q's and be on the ball.

979
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:03.870
You've got to cover all your bases.
It's the snake pit man.
Yeah.

980
00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.890
Whereas if you do a lot of other radio shows,
even big shows,

981
00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.770
it's one guest at a time.
Right.
You know,
and you don't,

982
00:58:09.771 --> 00:58:14.771
you don't get tossed into like that sort of comedy cellar table sort of scenario

983
00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:15.651
or you know,

984
00:58:15.651 --> 00:58:20.120
the parking lot at the store or the bar at the Improv like this that

985
00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:24.960
<v 4>I always said when you,
when you went on ona and it was a packed room,
you know,</v>

986
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:29.310
when you walked in and it was depaulo Bobby,
you know,
we're,

987
00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:32.640
we're burned Patrice or whoever it,
when it was a packed room when ona,

988
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.430
I always said it was like getting dropped into the,

989
00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:38.550
it was like in Raiders of the lost Ark when he hits the ground in that fucking

990
00:58:38.551 --> 00:58:40.380
snake pit and it's just like,

991
00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:44.580
you better like have your torch up and be ready because they are coming at you

992
00:58:44.581 --> 00:58:46.250
from every fucking direction.
Yeah.

993
00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:50.100
<v 0>Snakes.
I hate snakes.
Yeah.</v>

994
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.950
Yeah.
Asked very dangerous,
but it was also just fun.
You know,

995
00:58:54.951 --> 00:58:58.970
it's like exciting to be in a room with Voss and Norton and everybody's like,

996
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:01.450
everyone's,
you know,
Norton say something fine,

997
00:59:01.451 --> 00:59:02.690
they'll vasile say something funny.

998
00:59:02.691 --> 00:59:06.470
And everybody's like chiming in and laughing and it's just,
it's so exciting.

999
00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:07.640
<v 4>It was,
it was those,</v>

1000
00:59:07.641 --> 00:59:12.641
those times where the hardest times I've ever laughed in my life.

1001
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:16.510
And I remember when I would have stints where I would quit drinking for awhile

1002
00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:17.660
and I,
I'd say like,

1003
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:22.010
how the fuck am I going to have fun if I'm not going out drinking?
You know?
Uh,
I

1004
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.900
<v 2>would go,
oh,
that's right.</v>

1005
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:28.930
I laughed the hardest I ever did in my entire life at six 45 in the morning the

1006
00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:32.570
other day,
dead sober because I was on opie and Anthony.

1007
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:37.550
Yeah,
yeah.
Watching Bobo Polish,
fucking pubes out or whatever.

1008
00:59:37.551 --> 00:59:41.720
You know what I mean?
Like literally crying,
laughing,
like to,

1009
00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:45.260
you couldn't breathe,
you know?
So it's like,
I was like,
okay,
it's possible.

1010
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:48.620
It's possible to have sober,
fun,
obviously.
Well,
hanging out with comedians.

1011
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:49.011
I mean,

1012
00:59:49.011 --> 00:59:52.640
that's the one thing me and Stan hope were talking once and he said I could quit

1013
00:59:52.641 --> 00:59:54.710
comedy but I can never quit hanging out with comics.

1014
00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:58.220
That's a great way to put it.
Yeah.

1015
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:02.480
We were just laughing and fucking around May and we were just being ridiculous

1016
01:00:02.481 --> 01:00:04.520
and making each other Howell.
And uh,

1017
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:06.800
we were just both shaking our head and he goes,

1018
01:00:06.801 --> 01:00:10.550
I could never stop hanging out with complex.
Uh,
it's great.
You know,
like he goes,

1019
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:14.510
I don't fucking quit comedy.
I could quit comedy.
He just stopped performing.

1020
01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.670
Fuck it.
I can just fucking smoke cigarettes and drink beer and watch football.

1021
01:00:19.671 --> 01:00:21.710
You know,
like,
Hey,
I could do that.
He goes,

1022
01:00:21.711 --> 01:00:23.750
but I don't want to stop hanging out with comedians.
Cause it's like,

1023
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.980
I think a guy like stand up also,
you get to a point where you realize,
I mean,

1024
01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:31.640
yeah,
it's fun to do shows and yeah,
it's,
but nothing's going to change.

1025
01:00:31.641 --> 01:00:33.110
You're not going to,
yeah.
Well,

1026
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.230
and the best thing about hanging out with comics to me is like,

1027
01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.450
it's like the rings of Hell because there's hanging out with comedians.

1028
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.790
Then there's hanging out with the comedians that are,
you know,
that are in,

1029
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.290
that are the real comics,

1030
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:52.430
not just general comedians that are the pro guys or whatever and girls.

1031
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:55.370
Then it's the ring below that which is like,

1032
01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.140
these are the pros that are fucking cool,
you know,
that aren't egomaniacs.

1033
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:02.420
Then there's the ring under that where it's like,

1034
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.710
these are the pros that are ready to trash anything you want to talk about.

1035
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:11.390
Everybody on the other three levels would scoff at what we're about to say,

1036
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.110
but we'll go after anything down here on this,
on this little ring,

1037
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.630
and it's the best.
It's the best,
you know?
Well,

1038
01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:22.631
this is an art form to saying fucked up shit that you don't even necessarily

1039
01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:23.511
really mean,

1040
01:01:23.511 --> 01:01:26.180
but especially when a bunch of comics are getting together and they're vibing

1041
01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:29.490
off of each other.
There's that thing that we do where you'll,

1042
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.460
I'll try to say something like Tony the other day,

1043
01:01:31.461 --> 01:01:34.940
what the fuck did he say about Joan Rivers when Joan Rivers died?

1044
01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.410
Oh,
if you hurry up,
you could still get in bed with it.

1045
01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:43.760
I was supposed to do in bed with Joan.
It was like she was doing a podcast,

1046
01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.860
which she would do it from her bed.
Yeah.

1047
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:49.490
And I was scheduled to do it and it got moved around and I was waiting to

1048
01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:52.450
reschedule it and then she died.
And it made me sad because,
uh,

1049
01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.470
I was a huge fan and Tony Hinchcliffe goes,
if you hurry up,

1050
01:01:57.471 --> 01:02:01.070
he could still get in bed with her.
It's not too late.

1051
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:04.470
She probably hasn't started rotting yet.
Oh my God,
he didn't,

1052
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:05.960
I don't think you said that,
but do,
I do,

1053
01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:11.180
but you can't say that in a normal company,
but amongst comedians,

1054
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:15.410
you know,
it was to me,
made me feel good that he said that,
you know,
God,

1055
01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:20.160
you know what I'm saying?
It's hilarious.
Yeah.
Like Ari and I were talking

1056
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.380
<v 0>last night,
we went to canter's Deli late after is a thing,
we're,</v>

1057
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:27.990
we're driving home and he was talking about how he thinks it's good to interact

1058
01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:30.000
with regular people because he goes,

1059
01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:33.870
I don't talk to anybody that's a comedian and I think I'm not getting a balanced

1060
01:02:33.871 --> 01:02:35.490
perspective.
And he was like,

1061
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:39.000
you know you do this sports commentary stuff where like you'll go a whole

1062
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:42.920
weekend where you don't do stand up and you talk to like athletes and you talked

1063
01:02:42.921 --> 01:02:46.470
to like newspeople and stuff like that.
Like that's probably good for you.

1064
01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:49.860
And he goes,
cause I'm all I'm talking to is psychos.
Cool.

1065
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:53.640
Also I could say something really fucked up and they're like ma'am,

1066
01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.570
<v 4>right?
Yeah.
Like well yeah when we all right.</v>

1067
01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:01.290
I feel like I learned this in therapy.
When somebody shares something with you,

1068
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:02.310
you need to share back.

1069
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.240
Oh so you know that we're like on the level together so I'm going to tell you a

1070
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:11.010
fucked up thing.
But I was hanging out.
I don't even,

1071
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:13.710
I feel bad cause David,
but I was hanging out with Pete Holmes.

1072
01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:16.440
He brought them in and it was right after,

1073
01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:20.940
it was right after a Robin Williams 11th it was right after Robin Williams thing

1074
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.910
right after the Holocaust.
And they were saying,

1075
01:03:23.911 --> 01:03:25.560
they're saying it's an apparent suicide.

1076
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:28.110
They found him with a belt around his neck and I was like,
pay.
Do you think he,

1077
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:31.870
you think it was a suicide?
Do you think he was jacking it?

1078
01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:36.090
The belt around this deck and we just started laughing,

1079
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.770
going apparent suicide always sounds way better in a newspaper.

1080
01:03:40.771 --> 01:03:43.890
Then definitely was jerking off with a belt around his neck.

1081
01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:50.580
Yeah.
Robin's case.
He cut his wrists too.
I know that part hadn't come out yet.

1082
01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.860
And uh,
you know,

1083
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:58.500
I mean there's a,
there's a,
I have a human side.

1084
01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:02.800
I don't want to sell it.
It's true.
It's,

1085
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:06.830
it's very sad to me that that happened and I respect that that happened.
And,

1086
01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.280
and if I was related to him,

1087
01:04:08.281 --> 01:04:11.970
I probably wouldn't want to hear a joke about it right now.
But,
but my point is,

1088
01:04:11.971 --> 01:04:13.290
is like,
you know,

1089
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.920
sometimes you're hanging out with comics and you can let those little thoughts

1090
01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:21.180
out with them,
uh,
that I think a lot of people,

1091
01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:25.110
a lot of other calm,
if I was on nine out of 10 other podcasts right now,

1092
01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:27.360
I wouldn't have felt comfortable sharing that.
But see,

1093
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.540
you shared the crazy Joan Rivers joke,
right?

1094
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:33.720
And then I share that back and it's like,
it's like we're,
here we are,

1095
01:04:33.721 --> 01:04:35.520
we're in the fucking ninth ring together.

1096
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:40.050
And Joan Rivers or Robin Williams I think would understand why those jokes were

1097
01:04:40.051 --> 01:04:40.560
funny.

1098
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.380
<v 0>I don't have the right to say this guy's name cause I wasn't there when it</v>

1099
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:43.861
happened,

1100
01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:48.540
but a very famous comedian came over to a table of comics at the,

1101
01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:52.500
uh,
at the seller and a right after Robin Williams died and went,

1102
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:56.130
he was a joke thief,
right?
Fuck them really?
And walked away.

1103
01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.330
And everybody was like,
Oh shit.
Like looked at everybody went,

1104
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:03.360
it was a joke thief.
Right?
Geez guys.
A joke thief.
Right.

1105
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:06.660
And everybody like nod their head and he goes,
fuck them.
Walked away.
Yeah,

1106
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:09.870
I don't,
I wasn't there.
So I don't know if it was funny.

1107
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.490
The guy's fucking hilarious.

1108
01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:15.190
So I'm sure it was probably pretty funny when he said it,
but uh,

1109
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:18.070
that's a real thing too with people.
That's a real

1110
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.610
<v 4>thing where some guys never want to let that shit go.
Um,
yeah,
no,</v>

1111
01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:22.950
that's a very real thing.
I'm socially,

1112
01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:27.220
it was your bit like if you had a bit and all of a sudden it's on Letterman.

1113
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.220
Look,
I'll tell Ya,
you know,
Mark's doing it.

1114
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:33.490
There's something to be said for that.
Don't die with a grudge thing.

1115
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.880
But I also do think it's bullshit a lot of the time,
you know,

1116
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:40.900
I mean you watched that Ramones documentary into the century and they start

1117
01:05:40.901 --> 01:05:44.080
talking to g,
uh,
Johnny Ramone after Joey died and they go,

1118
01:05:44.081 --> 01:05:47.410
did you go visit him in the hospital?
He goes,
no.
And they go.

1119
01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:50.860
Even when he was dying,
you didn't go see him.
You knew he was going to die.

1120
01:05:50.861 --> 01:05:53.680
And he goes,
no,
if I was dying,
I wouldn't want him to come see me.

1121
01:05:53.681 --> 01:05:58.000
I don't like the guy.
We don't like each other.
And I was just like,
you know what,

1122
01:05:58.001 --> 01:06:02.320
man?
In certain ways I tip my hat to that.
It's like,
yeah,
right.

1123
01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:05.590
This is what it is,
man.
Like,
let's not,
let's not stroke ourselves here.

1124
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:07.900
There's three levels.
There's levels,

1125
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.380
like there's some people that you have fallen out with.
We could,

1126
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.560
you could sort it out.
And there's some people you can't,

1127
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.490
there's some people I don't want to be around cause I just don't want to feel

1128
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:22.420
them.
I don't want to be in there.
I don't,
I think they're beyond my reach.

1129
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:27.730
I agree on my hope.
Their perception of reality is so different than mine.

1130
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:30.430
I don't,
I don't want to hate anybody,

1131
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:34.120
but I don't want to communicate with them either.
Right.
Well,
you know,

1132
01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:38.830
like my mom taught me a great lesson about that sort of thing and she said the

1133
01:06:38.831 --> 01:06:42.380
opposite of hate isn't love.
The opposite of hate is in different.
Hmm.

1134
01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:46.960
When you truly don't care about somebody.
That's,
that's how's love for,
I'm sorry,

1135
01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:51.430
I'm sorry.
Let me,
let me,
I phrased it wrong.
The opposite of love isn't hate.

1136
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.670
The opposite of love is indifference.
That's what it is.
Excuse me.

1137
01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:57.850
So where's hate fit in there?
Is it in the middle?
Hate means you still care.

1138
01:06:57.851 --> 01:07:01.600
Hate me.
And you still love the person.
It's not the opposite because if you hate,

1139
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.310
if you hate,
you're invested.
You know?
And I mean,

1140
01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:10.180
I guess that investment doesn't necessarily Nessa necessitate love every time.

1141
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.510
But hate is investment.

1142
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:16.360
I'm spending my energy on you right now.

1143
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.460
I'm wasting my energy on you.
You know,
you're my ex girlfriend.
You did me wrong.

1144
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:22.990
It's two years later.

1145
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.760
I can't pick up a mop without yelling the word content,

1146
01:07:27.761 --> 01:07:31.450
the ceiling,
because this is the fucking mop you bought when you lived here.

1147
01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:34.930
You know what I mean?
Like that's,
that's not the opposite of love.

1148
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.540
That's you're still invested.
There's party.

1149
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:42.100
You still in there somewhere that wishes everything was okay.
But indifference,

1150
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.630
when you truly say,
I don't give a fuck if you live,
die,
breathe,
whatever,

1151
01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:50.650
like I'm done.
I have no nothing in me for you.
You know?

1152
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:55.210
To me that is,
that's why they say what these fucking Twitter trolls.
You know,

1153
01:07:55.211 --> 01:07:58.840
I was arguing with people on Twitter for the last two days and people are going,

1154
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:01.900
why are you going after him?
Don't,
don't show them that you care.
Don't show them.

1155
01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:06.220
And that's what that's,
yeah.
Yeah.
Why am I showing them that I care?

1156
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:10.270
You know what I mean?
Like in differences.
What pisses off a Twitter troll?
Well,

1157
01:08:10.271 --> 01:08:13.210
sometimes it's fun.
I do.

1158
01:08:13.211 --> 01:08:15.620
I do think there's a gray area and um,

1159
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:18.860
and that's the gray area was where I was trying to exist because I didn't like

1160
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:19.870
what people were saying about,
yeah,

1161
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:22.160
<v 0>a friend of mine on there.
So I was trying to defend him.</v>

1162
01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.480
I know what you're saying.
I mean,

1163
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:26.930
there's times where it's worth your effort to communicate and there's times

1164
01:08:26.931 --> 01:08:27.321
where it's not,

1165
01:08:27.321 --> 01:08:31.190
it's a matter of how much emotionally you get invested in debating someone that

1166
01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:32.220
you don't even know.
I mean,
you,

1167
01:08:32.221 --> 01:08:34.880
you might meet them and they might be a fucking complete idiot.

1168
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.430
There's no reason whatsoever to even communicate with them.

1169
01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:39.740
Like what's the point?
And getting all riled up and upset.

1170
01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:42.170
You're not even involved with that person.

1171
01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:45.800
You don't know that you choose to be involved with them because of 140

1172
01:08:45.801 --> 01:08:49.370
characters that are on a page.
You don't have to,
you don't have to,
you know.

1173
01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:49.810
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1174
01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:54.100
There was a guy today that I stopped following that really came after me pretty

1175
01:08:54.101 --> 01:08:58.240
hard,
uh,
that I consider,
I wouldn't say a friend,
we didn't hang out,
but like,

1176
01:08:58.241 --> 01:09:01.870
we were friendly.
We were friendly.
Excuse me.
And,
um,

1177
01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.830
you know,
our,
our knowing of each other started in a weird way.

1178
01:09:05.831 --> 01:09:09.700
He was kind of like being a bit of a troll one day to me.

1179
01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:12.280
And I really went after him cause I was in a really bad mood.

1180
01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:16.920
And then I ended up meeting him at a party a year later and he came in,

1181
01:09:16.921 --> 01:09:19.150
he introduced himself and he was like,
hey man,
I was just joking.

1182
01:09:19.151 --> 01:09:22.510
I'm sorry that that got out of hand,
whatever you end up giving me a bag of weed,

1183
01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.290
you know,
he was really,
really cool.
And then we were cool.

1184
01:09:26.291 --> 01:09:28.450
And then like over these last two days,

1185
01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.840
he started tweeting me all this really fucking vicious shit about Andy kindler

1186
01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.030
and Andy's my friend.
And I was like,
dude,
I don't agree with you.

1187
01:09:37.031 --> 01:09:41.530
Stop saying that shit to me and stop putting my name in the fucking tweets like,

1188
01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.620
like you and me ride together and like,
and now my,

1189
01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.850
my friend is going to see his name getting smeared and my name's in the tweet

1190
01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:52.630
too and I'm just like,
dude,
you don't know what the fuck you talking about.
Stop.

1191
01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:57.660
And I was writing that back to him with both his and Andy's handling the tweets.

1192
01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.590
And he just kept doing it.
And I was just like,
you know what dude,
fuck it.

1193
01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.680
I'm not doing this.
And I wrote it.
I and other people chimed in,

1194
01:10:05.681 --> 01:10:06.640
we're saying the same dumb shit.

1195
01:10:06.641 --> 01:10:10.120
And I just wrote to everybody that I'm arguing with right now on Twitter,

1196
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:14.530
please stop following me.
I can't stand any of the shit you're saying right now.

1197
01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:17.440
I'm serious.
Stop following me.
And they didn't.

1198
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:21.580
And I was just like,
you know what?
Fuck it.
And I just unfollowed this dude.

1199
01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:22.660
I'm like,
what am I supposed to do?

1200
01:10:22.661 --> 01:10:26.560
Keep following a guy that's like waving his dick in my face.

1201
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:31.240
You know what I mean?
It depends.
And you know,
and then he,

1202
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:31.841
you know,

1203
01:10:31.841 --> 01:10:36.841
I wake up today at four 30 in the morning with anxiety from having a bad set of

1204
01:10:37.721 --> 01:10:42.430
the fucking charity Gig last night and I check my Twitter and there's like five

1205
01:10:42.431 --> 01:10:45.850
tweets at me from this guy.
You were never funny.
You're a piece of shit.

1206
01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:50.710
The shoe that has this guy,
uh,
I'll say his name is Fred from Brooklyn.

1207
01:10:50.711 --> 01:10:54.730
Is his Twitter handle at Fred from Brooklyn Comic?
I don't know what he does.

1208
01:10:54.731 --> 01:10:58.390
I think he has a podcast.
He's not like a guy anybody knows except like some,

1209
01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:00.670
he's part of that.
Don't put them up on the screen.
Yeah,

1210
01:11:00.671 --> 01:11:02.620
he's part of that ONA crew.
Um,

1211
01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:07.630
but like so just like was trying to hurt your feelings.
Yeah,
it was like,
it was,

1212
01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.690
it kind of made me sad to be honest because like he was doing it the way,

1213
01:11:10.691 --> 01:11:14.040
like a scorned lover does it.
Like,
like do two days ago you

1214
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.470
<v 8>were telling me you love me and now you're,
you're telling me I'm not funny.</v>

1215
01:11:16.471 --> 01:11:18.420
It's like you're just,
you're just hurt.
Your feelings are hurt.

1216
01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:23.340
So it didn't upset me in that sense.
And by the way,
Fred,

1217
01:11:23.341 --> 01:11:27.960
if you're hearing this,
I'm not giving you attention because this got to me,

1218
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:31.260
I'm just mature enough to talk about this and I don't give a fuck.

1219
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.320
I don't give a fuck.
I can't get into all the God damn head games of,

1220
01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:38.460
don't say his name.
That dude right now,
it's sweaty fingers.
You know?

1221
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:42.930
It's just like,
and it's like,
and if you are listening to this,
it's like,
dude,

1222
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:44.100
I'm not even mad at you.

1223
01:11:44.101 --> 01:11:47.760
It's like you were saying a bunch of Shit I didn't agree with.

1224
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:51.870
And I was like,
all right dude,
I can't fuck with you anymore,
man.

1225
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:56.010
And he's writing,
if you don't play Twitter by Derosa is rules,
he'll fucking,

1226
01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.630
he'll kill Blah on fall.
You,
he's a fucking cunt.
It's like,
dude,

1227
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.720
weren't you one of the same guys that stood up for Anthony?

1228
01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.320
And we're pissed off that he came under fire for his words.

1229
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.270
So you can attack other people when their words come under fire.
But I can't,

1230
01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.850
but nobody can criticize your work.
You know what I mean?

1231
01:12:14.851 --> 01:12:18.480
Like how the fuck does that coin?
Yeah,
that's it.

1232
01:12:18.481 --> 01:12:20.670
That's a real convenient fucking coin.
You're flipping their,

1233
01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.533
you know what I mean?

1234
01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.470
<v 0>Um,
well why,
why worry about what his fucking hang up is?</v>

1235
01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:28.930
Why spend so much energy on it?
That's the real issue.

1236
01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:34.220
<v 8>Well,
now we're back to the thing about the indifference.
Yeah.
Um,
I don't,</v>

1237
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.660
it's not a lot of energy that I'm spending on it.
It's just,
I guess I'm just,

1238
01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:44.150
I don't remember why we got into Twitter,
but,
uh,
but oh,

1239
01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:48.430
you were saying the,
the,
you know these people from the hundred 40.
Yeah.

1240
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:51.530
That's your only relationship to die.
You know,
you don't have to,

1241
01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:54.050
he was somebody that I actually genuinely liked,

1242
01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.340
like as a dude and troubled people.
Well,

1243
01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:02.720
that's why I say I wasn't mad.
It was more just like,
it was like,
I feel bad man.

1244
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:05.960
Like I just feel bad for you,
dude.
Like you,
you're reacting the way,

1245
01:13:05.961 --> 01:13:08.770
like a dumped girl reacts right now.
You know what I mean?

1246
01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.240
<v 0>You,
you know,
when someone says something like that to you,</v>

1247
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:14.750
it'll alleviates any responsibility you have for continuing to communicate with

1248
01:13:14.751 --> 01:13:18.100
them.
Like,
are you being a baby?
Okay.
Yeah.
And like if someone,

1249
01:13:18.101 --> 01:13:21.320
like some people will do that and they'll expect you to fire back at them and

1250
01:13:21.321 --> 01:13:24.020
they'll do it wanting you to fire back on it.
They want you to engage.

1251
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:26.930
And that's where indifference comes in.
Like he,
but he,

1252
01:13:26.931 --> 01:13:29.600
this is an indifference necessarily cause we're kind of discussing it,

1253
01:13:29.601 --> 01:13:31.220
but you know,
it's,

1254
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:34.640
it's important to recognize what you want to invest your energy yet.
Yes.

1255
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.020
My hours in a day.

1256
01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:39.290
<v 8>I agree.
I agree.
I just don't like,</v>

1257
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:43.070
like part,
I will say this,

1258
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:48.370
my only emotional investment in that back and forth and like sending out a tweet

1259
01:13:49.881 --> 01:13:53.930
that says,
please stop following me to anybody that feels this way.

1260
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:58.970
I want people like that out of my life.
I don't want them coming to my shows.

1261
01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.650
I don't want them around.
I don't,
and,

1262
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:06.710
and it's not because they'd said mean things about Andy Kindler I can deal with

1263
01:14:07.011 --> 01:14:10.760
somebody saying mean things about Andy Kindler it's the reasons they were saying

1264
01:14:10.761 --> 01:14:12.220
the mean about Andy Kindler

1265
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.400
<v 4>they're pissed off because Andy Kindler,
uh,</v>

1266
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.360
address the Anthony situation at Montreal and now it's,

1267
01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:24.130
we see blood and we and attack and kill and it's fucking stupid.

1268
01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.530
It's mob mentality.
I don't agree with it.

1269
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:29.950
I don't want people like that behind me in any way,
in any fucking way.

1270
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:34.540
<v 0>Well,
you know,
Andy Kindler is a very progressive guy,
very smart guy.</v>

1271
01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:37.900
And uh,
he,
you know,

1272
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:40.360
if he met Anthony and he had a conversation with them,

1273
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:43.540
maybe they would have a difference of opinion.
Maybe they would argue,

1274
01:14:43.541 --> 01:14:48.310
I don't know.
But I respect them both.
Yeah.
It's a tricky,

1275
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.640
tricky situation where Anthony Kumina situation for folks who don't know Anthony

1276
01:14:54.581 --> 01:14:58.120
from opie and Anthony was fired because,
um,
he was in a situation,

1277
01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:01.970
another situation,
line situation.
I can't stop saying situation.

1278
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:05.680
It's stuck in my head.
He was taking photographs late at night and Times Square.

1279
01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.890
Some woman,
he took her photograph and she got mad at him.

1280
01:15:08.891 --> 01:15:11.170
She hit him yelling at him,
screaming at him,

1281
01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:14.740
and then he went on this rant about the African American community,

1282
01:15:14.741 --> 01:15:15.610
about violence,

1283
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:19.480
about all sorts of different things and he got fired for the rent.
And uh,

1284
01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:23.590
you know,
if anybody pays any attention to him on the opiate Anthony Show,

1285
01:15:23.591 --> 01:15:25.000
they know that he does that all the time.

1286
01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:28.300
That that style of communication is his thing.

1287
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:33.750
But you can explain yourself way better on a radio show when you going back and

1288
01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:38.170
forth with people and you cite statistics and facts about the African American

1289
01:15:38.171 --> 01:15:42.220
community,
there's no doubt about it.
I mean,
there's no way to deny it.

1290
01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:46.330
There's a disparity in the amount of African American people that are in prison.

1291
01:15:46.331 --> 01:15:49.330
There's a disparity in the amount of African American people that commit crime,

1292
01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:54.070
but that could be attributed to a bunch of different things,
economic factors,

1293
01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.830
the,
the,
the,
there,

1294
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:58.840
the opportunities that they have as opposed to the opportunities that people

1295
01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:01.660
that live in better neighborhoods have it.
There's a lot of shit going on there.

1296
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:03.070
It's a complex,

1297
01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:07.780
nuanced discussion and you're not going to have a complex,
nuanced discussion.

1298
01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:08.860
I have to get punched in the face.

1299
01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.740
It's going to start screaming and yelling and he should have just stayed off the

1300
01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:13.300
air or stayed offline.

1301
01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:16.390
We should have done is talked about it on the radio show on Monday morning and

1302
01:16:16.391 --> 01:16:19.270
expressed the whole story.
It's a sensitive issue.

1303
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:24.550
<v 4>Very sensitive.
And I think that,
you know,
I,</v>

1304
01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.291
I'll be honest with you,

1305
01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:29.710
this is the first time I've ever talked about this publicly to anybody.
Uh,

1306
01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.500
and when this all happened,

1307
01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.810
I got a lot of shit online about not coming out and saying Stan with ant or

1308
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:38.990
defendant or whatever.
Um,

1309
01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:44.150
because I wanted to see the situation through before I said anything and I

1310
01:16:44.311 --> 01:16:49.110
don't,
I didn't agree with the initial outburst on Twitter,

1311
01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:53.730
but I thought to myself,
okay,
he was angry.
It was fucked up.

1312
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:56.460
Let his blood fucking calm.

1313
01:16:57.270 --> 01:17:01.590
Maybe he'll apologize or reword things or whatever.
Uh,

1314
01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:02.341
also too,

1315
01:17:02.341 --> 01:17:05.670
I think if you're going to be somebody that complains about the problems in a

1316
01:17:05.671 --> 01:17:07.110
community,
you need to come,

1317
01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:11.180
you need to address those problems and try to help offer solutions,

1318
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.480
not just yell from a hilltop about how fucked up it is and how you're pissed off

1319
01:17:16.641 --> 01:17:18.710
about it.
I don't think that helps anything.

1320
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:23.780
And that's that kind of addressing of a problem is what makes people start

1321
01:17:23.781 --> 01:17:27.010
saying,
what's,
what's going on with this guy?
You know what I mean?
It,

1322
01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:30.050
it starts to sound like a very one sided attack on something.

1323
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:35.210
Now you can agree or anybody could agree or disagree with that point and we can

1324
01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:37.460
even move beyond that point to this point,

1325
01:17:37.461 --> 01:17:41.390
which is after he went on that app had that Twitter outbursts.
So I was like,

1326
01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:44.900
okay,
that was unfortunate,
but let's see what he says now.

1327
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:49.370
Then he went on red eye and was like,
I'm not sorry.
I'm not sorry.

1328
01:17:49.371 --> 01:17:53.930
I'm not apologizing.
I am not sorry for what I did.
And I was like,
okay,

1329
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:57.230
this is starting to get a little bit more complicated now.

1330
01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.240
And then after that,

1331
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:03.920
I mean by the time he went on that like white nationalists radio show to like

1332
01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:07.820
defend himself.
I was just like,
I,
I don't know where this,
I didn't hear that.

1333
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:11.460
Well,
I saw it online,
uh,

1334
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:14.450
transcript or did you hear it?
There was a part,

1335
01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.420
there was part of a transcript of some stuff he said.
Uh,

1336
01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:23.540
but I found online cause I was just kind of following the situation that he had

1337
01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:27.560
gone on basically a white nationalist podcast or radio show or something.

1338
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:31.790
Uh,
and it's like the guy,
the host of the show is on Wikipedia.

1339
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:34.280
He's got a Wikipedia page and it was like the Wikipedia page.
It was like,

1340
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:37.760
this is a guy that has had like Holocaust deniers and shit on a show.

1341
01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:39.200
Like your friend from Ireland.

1342
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:42.830
He wasn't my friend who was my neighbor and I didn't know he thought that until

1343
01:18:42.831 --> 01:18:47.450
it came out that night.
And they choose exaggerated made lad.
Oh,

1344
01:18:47.451 --> 01:18:51.200
he's have to meet rocky times.
By the way,
if that guy had a radio show,

1345
01:18:51.201 --> 01:18:52.250
I wouldn't have gone on it.

1346
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:57.920
So when I saw that,
I mean you can,

1347
01:18:57.921 --> 01:19:00.360
you guys look it up so you like it doesn't know something I don't want,

1348
01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.030
I don't want to publicize and he fucking white nationalists.
Fair.

1349
01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.280
Know what I mean?
So,
so,
um,
anyway,

1350
01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.860
so when I saw that I was like,

1351
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.120
and saw some of Anthony's quotes from the show,
I was like,
this is,

1352
01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.560
this is getting fucked up.

1353
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:19.790
So do you think he just went off the deep end because he was angry and he was

1354
01:19:19.791 --> 01:19:23.630
trying to publicize the whole situation?
Or do you think he's really racist?

1355
01:19:23.631 --> 01:19:25.050
Like what's your take on it?

1356
01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:30.620
It will probably as good as I know him when it first happened and I'm going to,

1357
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:35.540
I'm putting this disclaimer out before I say anything.
Uh,

1358
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:41.620
I am fully aware of the hell fire that I might face for not just saying I'm with

1359
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:47.640
the guy on this stuff.
I'm fully aware of it.
Um,

1360
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:51.650
I've thought about this very long and very hard.
I am aware of it.
Um,

1361
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:57.800
I'm not,
you know that I'm just saying that anyway,
uh,
the,

1362
01:19:57.950 --> 01:20:01.250
Eh,
when it first happened I was like,

1363
01:20:01.251 --> 01:20:05.420
this is really fucking unfortunate and I want to believe that my friend fucked

1364
01:20:05.421 --> 01:20:08.040
up and I want to believe that my friend is,

1365
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:10.050
<v 8>is going to redeem himself from this.</v>

1366
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:14.370
And the further it went down the road and finally for,
for me,

1367
01:20:14.371 --> 01:20:18.420
the last final Straw was the shitty was tweeting about the Ferguson situation.

1368
01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.960
I was just like,
I can't,
I unfollowed him on Twitter.
I was like,

1369
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:26.730
I can't do this man.
And that's not me saying fuck you.

1370
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:30.690
Comea that's me saying,
look dude,
you have the,

1371
01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.050
he has the absolute right to say whatever he wants to say.

1372
01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.790
I would never ever,

1373
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:39.030
ever say somebody doesn't have the right to speak out loud about what they say,

1374
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:41.370
but I also have the right to react to it.

1375
01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:45.270
And I also have the right to say if that's how you feel about this shit.

1376
01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:50.220
I disagree so strongly and this is such a,
this is such a,

1377
01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:53.760
to me,
an ethical and moral issue when it comes,
when you start dealing with race.

1378
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:59.190
I don't know how we can pal around still,
you know what I mean?

1379
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:02.850
Because this is,
this is,
this is beyond like political differences to me.

1380
01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:03.871
You know,

1381
01:21:03.871 --> 01:21:07.560
it's like once it starts getting into racial stuff and I have to start thinking

1382
01:21:07.561 --> 01:21:11.460
about what does it say to my black friends if I still hang out,

1383
01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:16.740
you know,
uh,
with a certain person,
I,
I,
you know,

1384
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:21.810
it's,
it's a real fucking tight spot.
At that point they also didn't agree with.

1385
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:28.010
I also didn't agree with the whole thing where everybody was really on this like

1386
01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:33.620
cancel your subscriptions thing and what and Fuck opion Jim over.

1387
01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:38.670
Fuck them out of a job.
Let Sirius Xm lose all this business.
I mean,

1388
01:21:38.671 --> 01:21:39.391
those guys were,

1389
01:21:39.391 --> 01:21:44.370
were were left in a in a really tough situation and they're making the best out

1390
01:21:44.371 --> 01:21:49.200
of it.
And for everybody to,
that was behind Anthony to go,

1391
01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:52.410
yeah,
canceling your fucking subscription.
Why?

1392
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.280
Well now why are you fucking these people over?
Why?
What did they do?

1393
01:21:56.281 --> 01:22:01.281
They didn't do anything and it just was such a messy thing.

1394
01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:03.780
It was just such a messy thing.
And everybody was saying,

1395
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:08.190
this is a free speech issue.
It's not a free speech issue.
Speech is free.

1396
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:11.250
Freedom of speech is,
it's free,

1397
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:14.490
but it doesn't mean it comes without consequences.

1398
01:22:14.491 --> 01:22:17.520
It works like a giant candy dish at your doctor's office.

1399
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:21.630
It's there for the taking,
but if you don't handle it carefully or or,
or,

1400
01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:23.370
or use with any responsibility,

1401
01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:27.690
you're going to get sick and fuck yourself up a little bit.
You gotta be careful.

1402
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:31.080
There are repercussions for free speech,
free speech.

1403
01:22:31.081 --> 01:22:32.310
Just means you're allowed to say it.

1404
01:22:32.311 --> 01:22:35.850
It doesn't mean nothing bad can happen afterwards,
you know?

1405
01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:39.120
And so when people were,
were talking about like,

1406
01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:43.020
I can't believe that they fired him,
it's like,
well,

1407
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.940
whether you agree with him getting fired or not,

1408
01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:47.070
you can't believe that they fired him.

1409
01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:51.270
If you had a pizza shop and one of your top pizza makers was across the street

1410
01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:54.300
saying that stuff and your customers could hear him,
you'd be like,

1411
01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.820
we hate this fucking guy away from the pizza shop right now.

1412
01:22:57.230 --> 01:23:01.320
This is bad for pizza business.
So I don't see how Sirius Xm is any different.

1413
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:05.320
Now again,
whether you agree with him getting fired or not is a different story.

1414
01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.890
But to say we can't understand why he got fired.

1415
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:14.250
I just think it's such a closed minded one way sa one side and way of looking at

1416
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:14.470
it.

1417
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:19.470
I think this was approached with zero gray area and um,

1418
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.730
on

1419
01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:25.730
<v 0>one hand I kind of appreciate their loyalty now that they want to stick up for</v>

1420
01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:29.840
Anthony and they want to do that.
But there,

1421
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:33.180
there are real issues when you start discussing race that you have to take any

1422
01:23:33.181 --> 01:23:36.330
consideration.
And like this Ferguson thing,
you know,

1423
01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:41.360
the Ferguson thing is a very unique situation because it's an incredibly

1424
01:23:41.611 --> 01:23:45.750
impoverished community with a lot of fucking crime,
a lot of crime,

1425
01:23:45.751 --> 01:23:50.220
and a lot of police brutality,
right?
Like it does to just an awful place.

1426
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:54.750
It's awful.
And um,
it,
it's not as simple as black people or white people.

1427
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:58.230
I,
this is gonna sound stupid,

1428
01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:03.780
but I wished it was no race and wish there was no color.

1429
01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:08.100
I wish it was no differentiation other than your behavior.

1430
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:09.990
Because if that was the case,

1431
01:24:10.290 --> 01:24:13.730
we would be able to look at behavior and we did to be,

1432
01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:18.170
look at all of these people that are involved in tremendous amounts of crime.

1433
01:24:18.190 --> 01:24:20.000
Okay.
What are the variables there were,
where,

1434
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:24.750
what are the single parent households?
What are the absentee parents?

1435
01:24:24.751 --> 01:24:26.940
What are the kids that are growing up with drug addicts?

1436
01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:31.380
What are the kids that are growing up with crime in their environment
constantly.

1437
01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:36.420
That that's what's going on.
It's not just black people.

1438
01:24:36.421 --> 01:24:38.250
Why I don't fucking crazy white people.

1439
01:24:38.251 --> 01:24:40.500
I grew up with a lot of poor white people that were insane.

1440
01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:43.350
They're just as God damn dangerous is anybody.
Well,

1441
01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:47.280
there's nobody that's less dangerous when it comes to poverty and crime.

1442
01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:47.941
You know?

1443
01:24:47.941 --> 01:24:52.941
It's like you get poverty and crime and bad scenarios and then children

1444
01:24:52.951 --> 01:24:57.360
potential that's growing up in this really distorted and fucked up way.

1445
01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.540
You're going to get crazy.
People should go to the grow up with crime,

1446
01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:02.760
commit crime.
People imitate their atmosphere.

1447
01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:05.490
People who grow up in terrible environments,

1448
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:08.730
it's very difficult to rise above and you can't just,

1449
01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:13.140
you can't just say it's a black thing or a white thing and it just,

1450
01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:17.460
because it's in the black community more that's in the white community.
Look,
man,

1451
01:25:17.461 --> 01:25:20.550
you got to take into consideration that have hundred and fucking 50 years ago

1452
01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:22.410
there was slavery.
Okay.

1453
01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.970
And the great grandchildren of those slaves or the what,

1454
01:25:25.971 --> 01:25:28.530
what you're dealing with today.
And that's,
that's a real,

1455
01:25:28.531 --> 01:25:30.710
and I'm not a fan of reparations or any of that,

1456
01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:33.990
those ideas that a lot of people bantered back and forth,

1457
01:25:33.991 --> 01:25:37.710
but I am a fan of what I would call social or civil engineering.

1458
01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:42.120
Social engineering is probably not a bad idea to try to rejuvenate impoverished

1459
01:25:42.121 --> 01:25:45.960
communities that are predominantly one race.

1460
01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.920
I mean it seems to me that those places are a trap and if you're born in those

1461
01:25:49.921 --> 01:25:51.810
places,
whether it's poor white,

1462
01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:55.440
Irish people that are fucking criminals and meth heads or whether it's black

1463
01:25:55.441 --> 01:25:57.990
people that you grow up and your parents,
both your parents are in jail.

1464
01:25:57.991 --> 01:26:01.340
He'd been raised by grandmother who sells crack.
That's a terrible,
and there's,

1465
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:04.670
these are terrible environment to get people coming out of and they're very

1466
01:26:04.671 --> 01:26:07.040
commonplace.
Yeah,
that's the real issue.

1467
01:26:07.041 --> 01:26:11.810
The real issue is children that grow up in these environments and become really

1468
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:14.720
fucked up members of society.
It has nothing to do with race.

1469
01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:19.670
Just so happens that a lot of them are black.
I agree.
I agree.
And that's why,

1470
01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.830
that's why I think when statements start becoming things like that,

1471
01:26:24.831 --> 01:26:29.300
community is so quick to jump to violence and savages and statements like that.

1472
01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:33.710
It's in one hand he's right.
On one hand,
he's right statistically,

1473
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:37.730
but the real question is why are those communities more likely and is it because

1474
01:26:37.731 --> 01:26:41.870
they've been ignored?
You know,
are as a society,
we have a right,

1475
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:47.300
we have rather an obligation to,
to take care of our community,
right?

1476
01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.100
But how far does our community extent,

1477
01:26:49.130 --> 01:26:52.400
that's where it gets really problematic because our community,

1478
01:26:52.401 --> 01:26:54.530
when we think about America as a community,

1479
01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:57.470
it's 350 million people that stretches out thousands of miles.

1480
01:26:57.470 --> 01:27:00.370
It's impossible to get everybody on board,
right?
It's simple.

1481
01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:05.690
If we add a community and our community was 20 people and there was one guy who

1482
01:27:05.691 --> 01:27:08.690
had no fucking money and who was doing a terrible job raising his kids and he

1483
01:27:08.691 --> 01:27:11.570
was on drugs all the time and he,
his kids were left along,

1484
01:27:11.571 --> 01:27:14.680
we would take that kid in,
right?
We would all take that kid in,
right?

1485
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:17.930
We all would,
but we can't.
When there's a million kids like that.

1486
01:27:17.931 --> 01:27:20.510
And then those kids grew up and they become adults and they were,

1487
01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:23.210
they were ignored and there's no love and there's a just,

1488
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:27.710
just as disastrous circumstance that they're growing up.
And that's what's wrong.

1489
01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:32.660
I don't believe that it's a color issue.
I believe it's an environmental issue.

1490
01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:35.000
I think it's a genetic issue in that the,

1491
01:27:35.001 --> 01:27:38.540
the genetics of the people that were in these fucked up environments,

1492
01:27:38.541 --> 01:27:40.910
they're raising more people that are in these fucked up environments.

1493
01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:42.110
It's epigenetics,

1494
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:45.290
learning from your environment that passes on to the next generation.

1495
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:48.230
But it's not a race thing.
It's just an environmental thing.

1496
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:51.110
It could be white people that are in poor neighborhoods like those Gypsies in

1497
01:27:51.111 --> 01:27:53.600
England.
Those are people are God damn savages.

1498
01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.790
Those people that are driving around those caravans,

1499
01:27:55.791 --> 01:27:58.910
having bare knuckle fights with each other,
robbing everybody left and right.

1500
01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:02.810
I have a friend who,
they're,
um,
they're good friends in England.

1501
01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:06.170
They're from England and they have good friends in England that had to abandon

1502
01:28:06.171 --> 01:28:11.030
their home cause Gypsies moved into a park next to their house and when they

1503
01:28:11.031 --> 01:28:14.590
have like these weird laws over there,
when these gypsies shell up and under,

1504
01:28:14.650 --> 01:28:15.650
not all bad I'm sure,

1505
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:18.530
but these particular Gypsies that moved next to them were bad.

1506
01:28:18.531 --> 01:28:19.820
They started robbing the neighborhood.

1507
01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.620
We started leaving their garbage everywhere.

1508
01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:25.130
They would dig holes and shit and them,
they was just chaos.
They would have,

1509
01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:29.180
they would stay up late at night and drinking and screaming and fighting and it

1510
01:28:29.181 --> 01:28:30.740
was just,
and they couldn't get rid of him.

1511
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:33.770
There's nothing they could do about them.
Had nothing to do with race.

1512
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.460
It had everything to do with who are these fucking human beings.

1513
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:38.570
There were white people,

1514
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:41.290
there were white people that were completely fucking out of control.
Right.

1515
01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:44.510
But if you took those same white people,
raised them in a nice neighborhood,

1516
01:28:44.511 --> 01:28:46.820
you up,
raised him in studio city,

1517
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.390
put them in a nice suit and have them a walk into their BMW.

1518
01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:54.350
No one blinked an eye the same human being.
Right,
right.
No.
Yeah,
I hear you.

1519
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.740
I hear you.
I totally agree.
I can I go back to something you said earlier

1520
01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:02.010
when you said on the one hand you admire their

1521
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.860
<v 8>loyalty for [inaudible],
for going with him.
I think it's shortsighted,</v>

1522
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:08.730
but here's my thing.

1523
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:12.870
As far as I understood it was about that show,

1524
01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:14.910
you know,
I mean the fan base,

1525
01:29:14.911 --> 01:29:19.911
I mean was about that show and about what that shows stood for and to me,

1526
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:25.830
nothing about saying fuck you to two other guys and we're,

1527
01:29:25.831 --> 01:29:30.630
we're gonna f 100% gonna follow one guy was anything that that shows stood for,

1528
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:33.660
it showed zero unity to me.
It just didn't,

1529
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:38.690
it just didn't it to to to throw two other dudes under a bus and go and have no

1530
01:29:39.271 --> 01:29:43.110
consideration for the situation that they're left in.
You know?

1531
01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.370
I understand.
If you want to have consideration for the position,

1532
01:29:47.371 --> 01:29:51.420
Anthony's in not saying they shouldn't have had consideration,
I'm saying,

1533
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:55.080
but to have zero consideration for the other two and go fuck it.

1534
01:29:55.081 --> 01:29:57.510
We're out of here.
Cancel subscription.
Well,

1535
01:29:57.511 --> 01:30:00.270
that's the thing I didn't agree with that just felt like it felt like mob

1536
01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:01.200
mentality to me.

1537
01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:03.600
<v 0>I see what you're saying,
what you're saying,
but in their defense,</v>

1538
01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:07.140
I think what they were trying to do was there's only one way to force their hand

1539
01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.810
and the w the way wasn't sit back the way it was.

1540
01:30:09.811 --> 01:30:13.800
The cancel subscriptions deal serious brought Anthony back as they wanted to

1541
01:30:13.801 --> 01:30:16.860
show as a whole,
so their idea wasn't the fuck Jimmy and oop.

1542
01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:21.090
Their idea was to cancel serious because it would force their hand and make them

1543
01:30:21.091 --> 01:30:24.330
bring back.
Can't prove a point.
Yeah.
That was the only thing that they could do.

1544
01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:27.030
I mean if you wanted to bring back Anthony,
there was really no other way to act,

1545
01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:32.180
<v 8>but I never felt,
now look,
I might be wrong.
How else could they have acted?
Just,</v>

1546
01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.193
hey guys,
this is,

1547
01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:37.970
this is fucking unfortunate animal listens to that and we'll to economics.

1548
01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:42.170
We'll listen to,
we'll also subscribe to this thing over here now.

1549
01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:46.100
Do you know what I mean?
Because now I might be wrong about this,

1550
01:30:46.101 --> 01:30:49.550
but as far as I could see it was never painted in the light of,

1551
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:54.410
of we're leaving and we'll be back if you rehire him.

1552
01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:58.970
It was fuck him.
We're done.
That two days later Anthony was like,

1553
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.290
I'm starting my own show.
It was,
and then for a week,
two weeks,

1554
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:05.480
those subscription cancellations were coming in.

1555
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:10.430
So it never to me once came across as we're doing this now as a walkout,

1556
01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:14.180
as a strike.
And if you guys do what we think is the right thing,

1557
01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:18.710
we'll bring him back.
It struck me very immediately as like he's out the door,

1558
01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:20.510
he's starting his own thing.

1559
01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:25.520
These people are continually jumping ship and I just think that kind of sucks

1560
01:31:25.521 --> 01:31:29.420
for the other two guys.
And I'm,
I realize I'm not speaking for them right now.

1561
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:33.680
I don't know how they feel about it.
Um,
and I don't mean to talk out of turn.

1562
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.210
<v 0>No,
I know,
I know what you're saying,
but I see what you're saying.</v>

1563
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:40.200
But I think for them I can totally understand why they wanted a boycott.

1564
01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:43.710
Cause I think for them that was the only way to voice their opinion in a way

1565
01:31:43.711 --> 01:31:47.280
with a company be forced to listen if the company had 50,000 people cancer,

1566
01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:49.650
this subscriptions because Anthony [inaudible] got fired.

1567
01:31:49.890 --> 01:31:53.940
And then everybody said,
oh we shit,
we just lost x amount of revenue.
Um,

1568
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:57.570
can we get Anthony to apologize and bring them back?
Boom,
he's back on the show.

1569
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:03.250
Right.
And he wouldn't have apologized though.
Well,
um,
no,

1570
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:06.460
but I think there could have been a way to,

1571
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:11.680
I don't think an apology it was as necessary or as an explanation and an a

1572
01:32:11.681 --> 01:32:15.340
discussion.
You know,
I think if they had a discussion of the issue on Monday,

1573
01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.610
he could have said the exact same things that he said in those tweets,

1574
01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:22.060
but said them.
And it's very different to hear someone say something,

1575
01:32:22.090 --> 01:32:25.300
talk about being punched in the face by someone in the African American

1576
01:32:25.301 --> 01:32:28.660
community.
See,
but look,
I got to take another position too,

1577
01:32:28.661 --> 01:32:30.940
because I don't think you should have been taken a picture of that check without

1578
01:32:30.941 --> 01:32:35.440
her permission.
I don't think it's cool to be,
you're a woman.
And this guy.

1579
01:32:35.441 --> 01:32:36.700
I'm not a white knight here.
Okay,

1580
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:40.300
but hear me out if you're a woman and some fucking dude on the street is

1581
01:32:40.301 --> 01:32:43.450
pointing a camera at you and taking pictures.
That shit's creepy.

1582
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:46.870
And maybe dudes don't think that way because they think they're innocent.

1583
01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.390
They're just capturing.
They would prefer to be anonymous.

1584
01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:52.240
I'm just capturing the city.
I just love taking photographs.

1585
01:32:52.241 --> 01:32:54.280
I think it's a beautiful city.
It's interesting.
It's fascinating.

1586
01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:56.950
I like taking pictures of cabs.
I don't get their permission.

1587
01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:59.170
This is a person there just happened to be walking down the street.

1588
01:32:59.170 --> 01:33:01.180
I'm going to take a picture of him.
I disagree with that.

1589
01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.810
I think especially in the case of a man taking a photograph of a woman,

1590
01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:09.430
men are traditionally the pursuers.
I mean that's we,
we're,

1591
01:33:09.610 --> 01:33:13.000
we're liars.
If we pretended that there's anything other than that going on.
Yeah.

1592
01:33:13.001 --> 01:33:16.010
Women pursue sometimes,
but most creepers are dudes.
Right.

1593
01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:19.020
And when a dude is taking photographs,
if I was a chick out,

1594
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:23.030
immediately assumed that he,
that he was a creeper.
So,
in my opinion,
this woman,

1595
01:33:23.031 --> 01:33:27.040
it was,
it was probably,
I don't know what the fuck was said.
Si.

1596
01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.410
So I mean I'm even commenting at of school.

1597
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.560
Well that's the tough part is it becomes like the Watergate tapes,

1598
01:33:32.561 --> 01:33:36.250
there's like this missing 20 minutes.
She was missing all minutes.

1599
01:33:36.251 --> 01:33:40.960
We all have any time.
Zero words.
Exactly.
So I mean it's,
it's,

1600
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:42.910
it literally goes from,
I was taking a picture too,

1601
01:33:42.911 --> 01:33:46.090
I got hit in the face and called white motherfucker.

1602
01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:49.690
This is how I felt like this about the Zimmerman case too.
You know,

1603
01:33:49.691 --> 01:33:52.210
everybody was like,
Oh,
you know,
this is a clear cut case.

1604
01:33:52.211 --> 01:33:54.250
Like I was a piece of shit and you know,

1605
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:57.580
George Zimmerman's an awful person and that kid,
you know,
he should have been,

1606
01:33:57.850 --> 01:34:00.070
or then there's other people that said that kid was a punk.

1607
01:34:00.071 --> 01:34:03.940
He was beating him up.
He should have shot him.
Right.
My take was always like,

1608
01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:09.010
what would have happened if someone who was cooler and they talked to that kid,

1609
01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.650
what would have happened with someone who understands people better?

1610
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.903
What would it mean?

1611
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.980
What if the whole scenario it played out where it was a dude who's really good

1612
01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:21.490
at communicating with people and very respectful and said to the kid,

1613
01:34:21.491 --> 01:34:24.010
how you doing today?
My brother,
everything good?
And the kid said,

1614
01:34:24.011 --> 01:34:27.520
everything's good man.
You know what,
what are you up to?
You know?
I mean,

1615
01:34:27.521 --> 01:34:31.360
who knows?
Maybe the kids say just head back from the store man.
Alright,

1616
01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:36.040
stay dry.
And who knows?
You know what I'm saying?
Exactly.
Exactly.

1617
01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:40.360
A fucking Dork like George Zimmerman might've caused that altercation just by

1618
01:34:40.361 --> 01:34:44.150
being a social fuckhead.
Well I think if,
yeah,
I mean I thought I,

1619
01:34:44.290 --> 01:34:47.590
I certainly thought so.
I went,
I went,

1620
01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.480
I was open minded to the point of going,

1621
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:53.710
I understand if that the guy had his suspicions raised or whatever,

1622
01:34:54.010 --> 01:34:56.860
but then when you listen to those cell phone calls and he's like chasing the guy

1623
01:34:56.861 --> 01:34:58.310
around the neighbor,
it was so painfully

1624
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:02.180
<v 8>obvious to me that here's a guy that just wants to be a hero.</v>

1625
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:05.720
Here's a wanna be cop that wants to be a hero and shit got out of hand.

1626
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.370
He bit off more than he could chew.

1627
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:11.240
He got his fucking ass kicked by a kid and he ended up killing somebody over it,

1628
01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:16.410
you know,
and like somehow slid through that self defense loophole because uh,

1629
01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:18.680
you know,
seven,
how old was Trayvon's?

1630
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:22.730
16 got on top of him and it was beating his ass.
Yeah,
it was beating his ass.

1631
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:26.630
But you know,
look,
the,
the,
it's like the Ferguson thing.
Those two,

1632
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:30.320
all anybody was talking about was the first was,
was the,

1633
01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:34.700
was the video of the guy,
the defenders of the cop.

1634
01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:36.650
All they were talking about was the guy,
you know,

1635
01:35:36.651 --> 01:35:39.410
shoving the guy in the convenience store and stealing the cigar,
whatever it was.

1636
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:45.260
Two white witnesses came out yesterday finally and said,

1637
01:35:45.261 --> 01:35:49.970
we saw the shooting and his hands were up.
His hands were up when he was shot,

1638
01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:52.040
you know,
so now,

1639
01:35:52.041 --> 01:35:57.041
regardless of this weird phantom gunfire shot that happened when the cop was in

1640
01:35:57.381 --> 01:36:00.080
the car,
whatever weird fucking altercation thing happened there,

1641
01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:04.460
whether it was that dude's fault or the cup,
whatever,
regardless of any of that,

1642
01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:09.350
the guys getting chased,
the cop is chasing him.
If he's got his fucking hands up.

1643
01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:13.910
You're a cop dude at that point.
That's it.
You don't shoot,

1644
01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.340
you don't shoot a dude to death,
you just don't,

1645
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:19.780
<v 0>well the guy who was the cop that shot him was also a guy that was a part of</v>

1646
01:36:19.781 --> 01:36:22.150
another band of cops that was so fucked up.

1647
01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:25.990
It's so many complaints about them that they disbanded the whole department and

1648
01:36:25.991 --> 01:36:28.280
then he got hired by Ferguson.
Yeah,
it's,

1649
01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.110
he had a history of that kind of abuse.

1650
01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:35.920
<v 8>Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know,
it's so,
you know,</v>

1651
01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:39.820
to,
to,
unless you don't want to talk about this anymore,
but like,
you know,

1652
01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:43.990
again,
with the Kumi a thing,
you know,

1653
01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:47.530
look at at the end of the day with Anthony and this is what,

1654
01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.100
why when I saw the Ferguson tweets I was like,
oh that's it.
I can't,
you know,

1655
01:36:51.101 --> 01:36:54.790
cause when you see him he would,
I don't want to get into what he was tweeting,

1656
01:36:54.791 --> 01:36:57.830
but like the point is,
is that I didn't,
I harshly

1657
01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:01.160
<v 0>agree with it.
Well,
I think he's a bit like,
you know,
I mean,</v>

1658
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.500
I don't want to cast him in a bad light because he's my friend.

1659
01:37:03.501 --> 01:37:06.890
But I think he's a bit like your friend that's a spurned lover.
I mean,

1660
01:37:06.891 --> 01:37:10.820
I think there's a little bit of that,
of that he's fired by this company's like,

1661
01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:13.400
yeah,
fuck you.
I'm going to go even deeper with it now.

1662
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:17.020
I'm getting even more crazy with it now.
Don't give a fuck.
No.
Yeah,

1663
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:22.190
<v 8>no,
he is.
And it's,
it's,
I got to say,
man,
like at the end of the day,</v>

1664
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:26.030
um,
the whole thing just makes me sad.

1665
01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:30.320
And I know at probably deepened as Corp Anthony doesn't really give a fuck about

1666
01:37:30.321 --> 01:37:34.400
what I think we were friends.
Uh,
and you know,

1667
01:37:34.401 --> 01:37:37.400
like we used to hang out.
I was bummed out,
man.

1668
01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.450
I was bummed out that I felt like I got to a point with a friend where I was

1669
01:37:41.451 --> 01:37:43.490
like,
I don't think I can hang out with this guy anymore.

1670
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:47.000
And it really bummed me out.
But did you talk to him in person?

1671
01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:51.650
I texted him twice.
He,
he didn't respond to the first one.

1672
01:37:51.651 --> 01:37:56.010
The second one,
he responded to me.
Uh,
the second text I sent,

1673
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:59.370
I was a little pissed honestly that I didn't get a response from the first one.

1674
01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.040
And then I texted him a second time,
like two weeks later and I said,
hey man,

1675
01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:09.270
I don't know if you've got my other text.
But uh,
the first text was just like,

1676
01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:12.210
hey man,
you know,
I know you're going through some shit right now.

1677
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:16.560
I'm sorry that you're in a tough position and I just want you to know I had

1678
01:38:16.561 --> 01:38:19.950
great times in the,
in the studio with you and I wish you well man.

1679
01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:23.760
Like I felt like I could say that much to a guy,

1680
01:38:23.761 --> 01:38:25.860
even though I didn't agree with the shit that came out of his mouth,

1681
01:38:25.861 --> 01:38:27.060
I could say that much to him.

1682
01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.540
I owe a lot of my career to opie and Anthony and Jimmy.

1683
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:34.860
So that was the first text.
I didn't hear back from him and I was like,
okay,
fine.

1684
01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:37.590
And then two weeks later I texted him again and he said,
hey man,

1685
01:38:37.591 --> 01:38:38.700
I don't know if he got my other texts,

1686
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:43.760
but there's some guy online writing fake retweets of me saying really nasty shit

1687
01:38:46.111 --> 01:38:49.710
about you.
I go,
I'm not that,
those aren't my tweets.
That's not me.

1688
01:38:50.850 --> 01:38:54.000
And then he responded to that one.
He was like,
hey man,
I was new.
We were cool.

1689
01:38:54.001 --> 01:38:58.740
Don't worry about it,
Duh Duh,
Duh.
And I was like,
oh cool man.
Like you know,

1690
01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:02.250
let's have a beer at some point because in my head I was like,

1691
01:39:02.730 --> 01:39:06.390
this was still before the redeye icon or at least I saw the red I clip and
stuff.

1692
01:39:06.391 --> 01:39:11.370
And I was still thinking like this will turn around,
this will turn around.

1693
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:12.630
That's what I just kept thinking.

1694
01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:18.050
And after that I started seeing all the other stuff and that's when I started to

1695
01:39:19.531 --> 01:39:23.430
be like,
Whoa,
well we'll,
and I'll be honest,
man.

1696
01:39:23.431 --> 01:39:27.180
Like what really bummed me out one day was was he like Kinda,

1697
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:30.990
he knew I was getting a lot of shit online cause his name was in the tweets

1698
01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:34.360
<v 2>and he never wants told these people to leave me the fuck alone.</v>

1699
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:39.220
But don't you think that he was,
first of all,
this was a national story.
Okay,

1700
01:39:39.221 --> 01:39:40.210
this is a huge story.

1701
01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:43.990
Don't you think that he was probably completely overwhelmed and may very well

1702
01:39:43.991 --> 01:39:47.890
have been ignoring his app replies because there was overwhelming.

1703
01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:52.000
He said Nice things about burr.
He said Nice things about Bobby Kelly.

1704
01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:55.810
He said,
Nice.
There's other comics.
I don't remember the nice things about me.

1705
01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.880
So nice things about you ignored you.
Uh,
well it doesn't.
Yeah.

1706
01:39:59.890 --> 01:40:03.700
It wasn't like I'm not important enough.
I'm not important enough.
Seriously.

1707
01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.770
Don't you think that's it?
Or is it just like,

1708
01:40:06.130 --> 01:40:07.660
here's why I think that's what it is.

1709
01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:11.420
<v 8>Here's why I think that's what it is.
Because not only did he not</v>

1710
01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.120
help get some of the fucking heat off of me and there was a lot of it.

1711
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:18.590
Um,

1712
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:23.590
when he finally did address me on Twitter as people like Colin Quinn and,

1713
01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:29.000
um,
who's the guy from the vice guy?
What's his name?
Uh,

1714
01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:36.120
<v 2>which vice guy that a god damn.
Shane.
Shane Smith.
Not Shane.
The,</v>

1715
01:40:36.190 --> 01:40:39.220
the guy that left vice with the beard.
Oh,

1716
01:40:39.221 --> 01:40:43.600
the guy who got in trouble recently for a talking about transsexuals.

1717
01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:46.270
Probably Gavin's yeah.
Yeah.

1718
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:51.020
<v 8>Gavin.
Collin Quinn.
We're getting tweets like,
hey,</v>

1719
01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:54.220
would you please come do my new show?
I'll send a car

1720
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:58.450
<v 2>for you.
Hahaha.
Dm me.
Come to my show please.</v>

1721
01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:03.010
My tweet in the midst.
By the way,
by the way,
Anthony bleeding them.

1722
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:06.590
Yes.
Spurned lover.
Now you feel that?
No,
I'm just,

1723
01:41:06.591 --> 01:41:11.450
I'm just gonna say Burn Lover Talk Today.
By the way,
by the way.
Uh,
some of my,

1724
01:41:11.451 --> 01:41:12.070
uh,

1725
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:15.400
I guess anger about the situation is when you're sitting at your aunt's funeral

1726
01:41:15.401 --> 01:41:18.550
who was like a second mother to you and your phone keeps buzzing cause you're

1727
01:41:18.551 --> 01:41:22.110
getting tweets like you're a talentless shit.
Selfish shit bag cunt.

1728
01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:27.100
Stick up for cu mia.
Okay.
You need to take that fucking at replies,

1729
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:28.510
right?
Fucking notifications.

1730
01:41:28.511 --> 01:41:31.000
You don't have your phone buzzed when people tweet you write what are you an

1731
01:41:31.001 --> 01:41:33.190
amateur?
But maybe,

1732
01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:36.760
but my point is is like there was some,

1733
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:39.760
there was some personal stuff in there because I was like,
I was like,

1734
01:41:39.761 --> 01:41:43.390
I'm getting shit for not disguising.
Give a fuck about me.
Obviously.

1735
01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:46.930
Like he's the one ever he wants,
why am I being held overwhelmed man?

1736
01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.620
So you kind of talked to a guy before you form an opinion in my opinion.

1737
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.940
Well this was the tweet I got.
This was the tweet I got.
Okay.

1738
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.060
Hey fuck head from you,
from,
from Anthony.
Hey fuck head.

1739
01:41:58.450 --> 01:42:00.670
Are you going to do my show when you're in New York?

1740
01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:05.370
That's the tweet I got when he knew there was bullshit going on online.

1741
01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:08.890
Then he calls me out in front of everybody like,
you're on the spot,
Douche,

1742
01:42:08.891 --> 01:42:12.730
let's go dance.
Are you coming on or not?
And I responded,
you know,

1743
01:42:12.731 --> 01:42:14.260
I'm 10% black.
Right?

1744
01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:19.060
Cause I thought that was fucking funny and nothing.

1745
01:42:20.170 --> 01:42:23.380
Nothing.
Okay.
Not a favorite,
not a reply.
Nothing.

1746
01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:27.630
Very personal action of air it out in this manner.

1747
01:42:27.810 --> 01:42:29.860
Why you got all worked up?
I've not worked on it.

1748
01:42:29.861 --> 01:42:31.570
This is all just an interpersonal situation.

1749
01:42:31.571 --> 01:42:36.571
We were talking about like a more complex issue of racism and you know what he

1750
01:42:37.121 --> 01:42:41.650
said?
Nah.
And then it became all about him not being nice to you.
No.
No I don't.

1751
01:42:43.610 --> 01:42:48.200
No,
no,
no.
It seems like you're taking Twitter.
I've way too seriously.
Awesome.

1752
01:42:48.201 --> 01:42:50.380
I've,
I mean when,
whenever I have a problem with Twitter,

1753
01:42:50.381 --> 01:42:54.610
I either banned user ignore it or anything like that.

1754
01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:57.900
But it seems like you'd take your very,
uh,
are,

1755
01:42:57.990 --> 01:43:00.560
do you and your personal life before Twitter and everything,
do you,

1756
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:05.320
do you get in a lot of confrontations with people?
No.

1757
01:43:05.650 --> 01:43:10.480
No,
I don't.
I used to,
I don't a lot in my personal life.
I like.

1758
01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:13.450
I used to,
I used to be bad about confrontation.
I used to,

1759
01:43:13.630 --> 01:43:17.680
but the only reason I'm bringing in any personal stuff is because you were

1760
01:43:17.681 --> 01:43:20.860
asking me when I said he doesn't give a fuck about me.

1761
01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:25.120
You know like the guy man,
you got to talk to him sometimes.

1762
01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:29.410
You know sometimes the people are busy man and when when he said fuck face or

1763
01:43:29.411 --> 01:43:31.690
whatever,
he says like hey fuck face.
Are you going to do my show or whatever.

1764
01:43:31.691 --> 01:43:34.360
He said,
do you think maybe he was just like,
hey fuck face.

1765
01:43:34.361 --> 01:43:37.180
Wouldn't you give myself,
it sounds like a text I might get from Brian.
Yeah.

1766
01:43:37.181 --> 01:43:40.840
Cause it seems like you and your head,
we're reading it like hey fuck face.

1767
01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:44.590
You were all worked up.
I mean let's build it up.
You were all worked up,

1768
01:43:44.591 --> 01:43:48.430
your aunt died,
you're at the funeral,
you're phone's busy buzzing.
People calling.

1769
01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:51.920
It still doesn't change the fact that I wouldn't do the show.

1770
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:56.440
<v 0>I mean because you because of that.
No,
because of the stuffies.
Yeah,</v>

1771
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:57.283
but didn't you?

1772
01:43:57.290 --> 01:44:00.410
I would do it even though I don't agree with what he said because he's my friend

1773
01:44:00.411 --> 01:44:03.530
and if we disagreed I'd love to,
I'd like to disagree with them on air.

1774
01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:04.573
Like you know,

1775
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:09.320
people that I'm friends with have opinions I don't agree with and sometimes I've

1776
01:44:09.321 --> 01:44:13.580
had opinions that are off base and someone is sort of explained things to me in

1777
01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:16.100
a way that's made me think about things in a different way.
I don't,

1778
01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.710
I don't know if Anthony is capable of being reached like that,

1779
01:44:18.711 --> 01:44:22.940
but you know sometimes you can buy always someone in say something that opens

1780
01:44:22.941 --> 01:44:27.500
their eyes.
I always,
in the beginning of this whole situation,

1781
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:32.501
I absolutely thought that he was and I have lost the hope of that and I feel

1782
01:44:33.291 --> 01:44:37.800
like at this point for me to act like it,
it's like I'm like,

1783
01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:39.560
see,
I feel like if I say this,

1784
01:44:39.561 --> 01:44:42.110
it sounds like I'm judging you and I don't mean to be judging you right now.

1785
01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.160
Like,
but I feel like if I were to go on his show,
it would make,
it would,

1786
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:51.320
unless it was under the guise of Joe come on and we'll debate race.

1787
01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:55.160
And it's like,
okay,
then I could go on and hey,

1788
01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:57.770
it doesn't matter what this guy thinks I am allowed to do this.

1789
01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.030
But if I went on the show and let's say we didn't get around to debating race,

1790
01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:04.280
now I'm sitting and we're just laughing and Yucky.

1791
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:09.140
To me that looks like I'm giving a stamp of approval,
you know,
and I,

1792
01:45:09.141 --> 01:45:13.940
I can't,
it's like,
you know,
it's okay.
I could,
I could understand your opinion.

1793
01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:19.010
I mean,
um,
my a friendship with him is,
uh,
it's pretty deep.

1794
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.520
I really enjoyed doing that show and I have a lot of respect for him and I

1795
01:45:22.521 --> 01:45:25.400
probably don't agree with them.
A lot of issues when it comes to race,

1796
01:45:25.401 --> 01:45:28.270
especially because,
because I've,

1797
01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:31.310
I have these opinions about things being much,

1798
01:45:31.311 --> 01:45:35.060
much more complicated than simply black people do this.
White people do that.

1799
01:45:35.061 --> 01:45:37.940
I don't think it's that,
I think it's poverty.
It's an economic,

1800
01:45:37.941 --> 01:45:42.470
it's a cultural issue.
It's an issue with people get stuck.

1801
01:45:42.650 --> 01:45:46.310
They are stuck in bad neighborhoods,
they're stuck in economic situations.

1802
01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:49.680
And I think we probably both agree with that.
Yeah.
And Anthony,
um,

1803
01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:54.050
has some very good points about the reality of statistics in these communities.

1804
01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:59.020
I think it's a much more complex issue,
but sure.
His,
his,
um,

1805
01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:04.000
issue is that people want to deny those realistic statistics.
Sure.

1806
01:46:04.010 --> 01:46:06.500
Reality of those statistics is undeniable in my opinion.

1807
01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:10.850
I just think that there's more to it than simply the statistics.
Sure.

1808
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:14.720
And I think that society as a whole has done a really shitty job at taking care

1809
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:17.570
of the lowest social and economic rung of the ladder.

1810
01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:20.000
I think people have ignored it because it's convenient cause they don't have to

1811
01:46:20.001 --> 01:46:24.890
do anything about it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
but you know,

1812
01:46:24.891 --> 01:46:27.610
a lot of people accuse you of socialism if you say things like that.
I've had,

1813
01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:32.330
I had someone call me a socialist today because of that.
I'm like,
you know,
look,

1814
01:46:32.331 --> 01:46:36.020
if you think taking care of poor babies is socialism.
Yeah,
I'm a socialist.

1815
01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:39.120
But yeah.
Well,
you know what I mean?
I mean,

1816
01:46:39.130 --> 01:46:42.510
it's just like they didn't fucking ask to be born again.
Oh Man.
And if you,

1817
01:46:42.511 --> 01:46:44.720
you can't feel that,
you know,
you don't,

1818
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:48.530
you don't have any remorse or you know,

1819
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:52.980
any compassion for people that are born in terrible situations.
To me that's a,

1820
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:56.040
that's a mark against you as a human being.

1821
01:46:56.930 --> 01:47:01.040
<v 4>I agree with that.
I totally agree with that.
Which is why,</v>

1822
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:03.880
<v 0>so why wouldn't you just have a discussion with him about it?</v>

1823
01:47:03.881 --> 01:47:05.740
Like to try to figure out

1824
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:09.280
<v 4>how do you have a discussion with a guy that doesn't return your texts?
Okay.</v>

1825
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:10.800
Board doesn't get back to you,

1826
01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:15.140
<v 0>but if he did,
would you still,
you know what I'm saying?
Like if he did,</v>

1827
01:47:15.141 --> 01:47:17.170
would you have that conversation because you,

1828
01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.570
you just said that you thought it would give him a stamp of approval.

1829
01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:23.290
<v 4>No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's not,
no,
that's not what I said.
What I said was,</v>

1830
01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.090
I said I would go on,

1831
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:28.900
I would absolutely go on his show if debate this was to discuss race.

1832
01:47:29.230 --> 01:47:33.940
I wouldn't go on the show if that wasn't preset that we were going to do that

1833
01:47:33.941 --> 01:47:36.370
because if we didn't get around to discussing race,

1834
01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:39.350
then we're just having a good time.
You know what I mean?
And it's,

1835
01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:43.900
it's just not cool to me.
But you know,
I just PR look,

1836
01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:48.700
now here's the thing,
here's the thing.
And again,
I,
I want us to,

1837
01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:51.220
well let me just say this to defend myself a little bit.

1838
01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:56.530
I am not sore about the way he treated me.
I'm not upset.
Say butthurt.

1839
01:47:56.590 --> 01:48:00.590
Yeah,
I'm not butthurt thank you.
I'm not my,
my ass.
My little ass.

1840
01:48:00.591 --> 01:48:05.110
He Poo doesn't hurt.
Um,
and I'm not trying to,

1841
01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:08.380
and I'm in no way trying to air a grievance,

1842
01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:12.640
a personal grievance right now on your show about this in any fucking way.

1843
01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:15.430
I only went into that stuff cause you were saying when I started talking about

1844
01:48:15.431 --> 01:48:19.000
it,
I don't think he really cares what I think.
Um,

1845
01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:23.710
I had,
I had a friendship with a guy.
Um,

1846
01:48:24.570 --> 01:48:25.150
you know,

1847
01:48:25.150 --> 01:48:30.150
when I reached out and tried to get to a deeper place with him about this and

1848
01:48:31.931 --> 01:48:36.430
discuss,
maybe have a discussion or whatever about this,
let's grab a beer by,

1849
01:48:36.431 --> 01:48:40.810
let's grab a beer.
Never received a response.
You know,

1850
01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:41.793
I didn't get it.

1851
01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:44.350
<v 0>Let's stop right here.
But you know,
all that really is very personal.
This is,</v>

1852
01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:46.160
you know what I mean?
This is not about the issue itself.

1853
01:48:46.161 --> 01:48:49.430
This is what you and him and your relationship and I don't know what the fuck it

1854
01:48:49.431 --> 01:48:49.611
is,

1855
01:48:49.611 --> 01:48:54.611
but I think what they should have done from the beginning is say we're going to

1856
01:48:56.001 --> 01:48:58.850
ride our contract out when that pitch is over.
We're going to go on the Internet.

1857
01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:01.700
Do the opiod Anthony show when our contract is out.
I mean,

1858
01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:04.910
I don't even know if they can say that,
but their contracts out in like October,

1859
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:08.300
they might already be doing planning.
I hope they are.

1860
01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.480
Because I think that the reality of satellite radio is it's awesome because it's

1861
01:49:13.851 --> 01:49:17.510
in your car.
It's way better than terrestrial radio.
You've got Howard Stern,

1862
01:49:17.511 --> 01:49:21.050
you got opie and Anthony,
you got all these radio stations that have,
you know,

1863
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:24.860
have great music on them.
Find channels you can find.
You know,

1864
01:49:24.861 --> 01:49:28.430
I love classic vinyl.
It's great.
I love listening to satellite radio,

1865
01:49:28.431 --> 01:49:32.510
but you have to listen to what they want you to listen to.
I don't listen to it.

1866
01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:36.410
I have it in my car most of the time.
I listen to podcasts,
right?

1867
01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:40.690
Most of the time I'm listening to hardcore history or radio lab or you know,

1868
01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:44.210
any of our friends podcast.
That's what I do most of the time.
I don't,
I don't,

1869
01:49:45.170 --> 01:49:48.220
I just think it's an archaic way.
Do you get programming?

1870
01:49:48.450 --> 01:49:52.540
It's this idea that you have to listen to what's on when it's on it.

1871
01:49:52.570 --> 01:49:53.403
That's great.

1872
01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:56.740
If you happen to be flipping through the channels or you turn on your car and

1873
01:49:56.741 --> 01:49:58.990
Opie and Anthony comes on,
or the Anthony and Jimmy show,

1874
01:49:58.991 --> 01:49:59.890
whatever they call it now,

1875
01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:04.360
or opion Jimmy when it comes on and it's an interesting interview,
it's great,

1876
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:08.670
but sometimes you just want to listen to what you want to listen to.
Sure.

1877
01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:13.300
It'd be great if I could say,
oh look,
Joe Derosa is on Joey Diaz,
his podcast.

1878
01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:16.590
Let me just press play on that and I have like a whole like,

1879
01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.260
or I could go listen to Arnold Schwarzenegger on the Nerdist or this and that or

1880
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:21.320
you know,
whatever.
Sure.

1881
01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:25.660
That I think is the future and I think that's the present also and I think that

1882
01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:29.170
once that's readily available in all cars at all times,

1883
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.590
the idea of them working for satellite radio be sound kind of silly.

1884
01:50:32.591 --> 01:50:35.110
Like why would you choose to have a boss when?

1885
01:50:35.111 --> 01:50:38.590
What is the difference between the distribution method of satellite radio and

1886
01:50:38.591 --> 01:50:40.990
the Internet?
That's how you,
what the differences there is a difference.

1887
01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:44.620
Satellite radio is more restrictive,
warm,
strict,
just more advertising.

1888
01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:47.260
You don't get as much of a piece of it and you've got this massive overhead

1889
01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:50.590
because you're attached to this gigantic company that's totally unnecessary and

1890
01:50:50.591 --> 01:50:53.960
you can get fired.
Apparently you can get fired for talking you,

1891
01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:57.640
you have to rent this giant fucking building.
You mean there's a fucking floor.

1892
01:50:57.641 --> 01:50:59.710
You have to show id,
go through the whatever.

1893
01:50:59.711 --> 01:51:01.480
Florida is the way the fuck up there,

1894
01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:04.990
because there's all this money that's being spent where look at this fucking

1895
01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:08.230
place.
This reaches the same amount of people or more really,

1896
01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:12.790
this show reaches more most satellite radio shows and we do it from a fucking

1897
01:51:12.791 --> 01:51:16.390
office park.
It's a joke that the future is,

1898
01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:19.840
the distribution method is changing and the distribution method,

1899
01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:23.470
I think it's being tested by these sort of situations where you find out that

1900
01:51:23.471 --> 01:51:26.000
you could be fired for something totally unrelated to this show.
Right.

1901
01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:29.320
It's not like they went on the show and he said something that the company
can't,

1902
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:32.490
like he went on the show and said something totally racist and the company's

1903
01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:34.780
like,
you can't say that on our show.
You're fired.
No,

1904
01:51:34.781 --> 01:51:38.320
he said it on his own Twitter.
You know it the very least,

1905
01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.960
they should have had some form of a debate with the guy,

1906
01:51:41.110 --> 01:51:43.720
but I think there's more to it than that.

1907
01:51:43.721 --> 01:51:48.700
And I think when you talk about this a white nationalist radio station that he

1908
01:51:48.701 --> 01:51:51.020
went on,
I think there's a little bit of that there too.

1909
01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.470
Like they might've been more to behind the scenes.

1910
01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.480
<v 4>Well but,
and this is,</v>

1911
01:51:55.770 --> 01:51:59.440
and I'm no way retreading or trying to beat a dead horse here,

1912
01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:04.000
but this is why I'm saying I'm not trying to be personal.

1913
01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:09.150
I agree with everything you're saying but I'm saying how I feel like I almost

1914
01:52:10.061 --> 01:52:13.210
felt like he wasn't that open to having the discussion.
Maybe it wasn't.

1915
01:52:13.211 --> 01:52:16.600
So it's like how can you,
on the one hand everybody,
and this is,

1916
01:52:16.601 --> 01:52:19.120
which drives me nuts about like this sort of blind like,

1917
01:52:19.330 --> 01:52:21.550
like I know what's going to happen.
I'm going to leave here.

1918
01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.060
I'm going to get a flood of tweets tonight.
Why?

1919
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:25.930
You know why you're going to cause I'm saying care.

1920
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:28.900
Well no I don't freaking out cause they know they can make your phone buzz.

1921
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:32.500
I don't,
I go,
I'm going to shut that part off that off already.

1922
01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:35.820
How much has it gone off?
All the shows on like crazy.
I got to,

1923
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:39.640
I got a confession to make.
I lied.
I don't have my Twitter alerts on my phone.

1924
01:52:39.641 --> 01:52:42.610
I went outside during the funeral to get some air and I checked my Twitter and

1925
01:52:42.611 --> 01:52:46.040
then I saw the stuff
Jerry.
But I was

1926
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.130
<v 8>trying to just get through the God who was the last story I used to be on your</v>

1927
01:52:49.131 --> 01:52:53.540
phone.
Oh,
it was just I the years.
That's a big y.
Yeah,
it was a big line.

1928
01:52:55.130 --> 01:52:59.390
I glad you owned up to that.
Um,

1929
01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:04.010
but that's,
and it doesn't,
I mean I guess yeah,
to,
to certain extent.

1930
01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:05.840
It does bother me that I'll get some of these sweets whenever.

1931
01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:11.020
But that to me is what bothers me about the whole discussion is because I feel

1932
01:53:11.391 --> 01:53:13.670
like everybody's going,
it should have been more open minded.

1933
01:53:13.671 --> 01:53:15.680
It should have been more open minded.
It's like,
okay,

1934
01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:19.280
well I can speak from the place of somebody that was trying to approach it more

1935
01:53:19.281 --> 01:53:23.720
open minded.
And I felt like I didn't,
there wasn't an option to do that.

1936
01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:26.330
I felt like that wasn't there so well,

1937
01:53:26.331 --> 01:53:29.600
it's just because of your relationship with Anthony.
Well,
I mean,
well,
no,

1938
01:53:29.601 --> 01:53:34.280
I also mean like just in the public discussion forums,
like the second you don't,

1939
01:53:34.281 --> 01:53:36.620
you didn't,
not you,
but any general,

1940
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:42.310
the second you didn't Hashtag stand with ant or come out and say something.

1941
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:45.560
You were a trader and a piece of shit and it's like,

1942
01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:50.210
well that's not open minded discussion either.
Talking about the pests.
Wait,

1943
01:53:50.211 --> 01:53:54.560
why are you looking for open mind discussion?
People are savages.
Yeah,
they are.

1944
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:59.870
They are.
I don't know.
I guess I always think that because,
because like the,
the,

1945
01:53:59.871 --> 01:54:03.980
the shit heels or more prone to write stuff,

1946
01:54:04.570 --> 01:54:08.330
more voice.
The negative opinion than the positive people are new to voice.

1947
01:54:08.331 --> 01:54:12.890
The positive.
It seems like the majority voice is that sort of negative voice.

1948
01:54:12.891 --> 01:54:17.450
Sometimes they're more likely to fester and they're more likely to get crazy

1949
01:54:17.451 --> 01:54:19.550
about it and obsess about it.

1950
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:24.110
Like I retweeted this one dude the other day about something and I saw him going

1951
01:54:24.111 --> 01:54:28.750
back and forth with people for 13 hours.
Yeah.

1952
01:54:28.770 --> 01:54:32.750
That's not retweeted him.
And he just was battling people all day.

1953
01:54:32.751 --> 01:54:36.050
It became his life.
I mean,
it was every minute for 13 hours.

1954
01:54:36.051 --> 01:54:37.400
This guy was going back with people.

1955
01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:40.430
There's pro folks like that out there and you have to realize that you can get

1956
01:54:40.431 --> 01:54:45.050
caught into their web of psychosis.
Uh,
sorry.

1957
01:54:45.230 --> 01:54:48.950
That's good.
See something off topic.
No,
go ahead.
You want to talk about anxiety?

1958
01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:53.840
Sure.
Do you,
do,
you know this is,
we're getting into this.
This is beautiful man.

1959
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:57.740
I think it is.
I like how raw this discussion is.

1960
01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:02.480
Do you know the surge,
the full body surge of anxiety?

1961
01:55:02.481 --> 01:55:06.110
I felt when you were like,
let's stop there.
This is getting way too personal.

1962
01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:10.250
This is really dude.
Oh my God.
It felt like I stuck my finger in a light socket.

1963
01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:12.740
Oh,
I'm sorry.
No,
no,
no,
don't be sorry.

1964
01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:16.100
I just beating on the same path over and over again.

1965
01:55:16.101 --> 01:55:19.120
And it was getting to be like,
you know,
he fucking didn't call me.
You know,

1966
01:55:19.130 --> 01:55:21.680
I didn't mean it like that.
I was,
I was saying when you were saying,

1967
01:55:21.710 --> 01:55:22.880
why didn't you have a discussion?

1968
01:55:22.881 --> 01:55:25.250
I was saying I tried to and that was my attempt to,

1969
01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:28.590
and I didn't get a response or I don't know what else to do.
Um,

1970
01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:32.600
but then I knew you took it the other way cause what you said and then I went

1971
01:55:32.601 --> 01:55:35.930
right back to the beginning.
Don't fuck this up.
First Time and Rogan's podcast,

1972
01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.320
Brogan doesn't like you.
You went down this hall.

1973
01:55:38.690 --> 01:55:42.140
I like you felt like I put my finger in an electric socket.

1974
01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:43.680
Well get it out of there.

1975
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:48.780
<v 2>Go get a bandaid.
The I,
I just,
I've just be at a hundred percent honest.
No,</v>

1976
01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.520
I know what you're saying.
You know,
it's a complex subject.
It's tricky also too.

1977
01:55:53.521 --> 01:55:54.630
I want to,
you know,
I'm not,

1978
01:55:54.930 --> 01:55:59.460
I'll talk about myself as openly as I'll talk about anybody else.
Like,
you know,

1979
01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:04.080
beat my ass.
I'll beat on myself.
Yeah,

1980
01:56:04.110 --> 01:56:05.850
it's a luck,
man.

1981
01:56:06.110 --> 01:56:10.110
You people fuck up and they say things that are wrong.

1982
01:56:10.111 --> 01:56:13.650
They say things they don't mean.
The real question is,

1983
01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:16.220
did he say things that he doesn't mean?
Did he say thing?

1984
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:20.400
Was he upset or is that what he really feels?

1985
01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:25.380
And if that's the case,
then it becomes a real issue because if that's the case,

1986
01:56:25.381 --> 01:56:29.460
if he denies that there's some complexities to it.
But she,
my,

1987
01:56:29.490 --> 01:56:30.540
my interactions with him,

1988
01:56:30.541 --> 01:56:34.590
my communication with him has not been that my community communications with
him,

1989
01:56:34.591 --> 01:56:37.280
this has been,
there is a real problem in those communities,

1990
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:39.150
but it's not his fault.
And He's,

1991
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:43.680
what he deals with is the PC denial of these real problems.

1992
01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:46.410
I community,
I agree with that.
I agree with that.

1993
01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.930
And that was always how it seemed to be,

1994
01:56:48.931 --> 01:56:52.170
at least at the times when I was in the studio and stuff and would hear it.

1995
01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:56.190
And when we hung out,
I mean,
dude,
this is a dude,
I can't stress this enough.

1996
01:56:56.370 --> 01:57:00.120
I'm bummed about the whole thing first and foremost because this is a dude I

1997
01:57:00.121 --> 01:57:02.970
used to have a great fucking time with.

1998
01:57:03.150 --> 01:57:07.320
We would drink did I had so much fun with them and it never got heavy ever,
ever,

1999
01:57:07.321 --> 01:57:12.060
ever,
ever.
So like,
uh,
the,
uh,
when I,

2000
01:57:12.090 --> 01:57:14.370
when,
when the discussions of this stuff would come up on the show,

2001
01:57:14.371 --> 01:57:17.970
when it w when you're in the room,
it sounded a little more to me like,

2002
01:57:18.210 --> 01:57:22.650
like what you're saying,
I'm like,
he's addressing that there was this problem,

2003
01:57:22.890 --> 01:57:25.920
but then there was also the times where he would get real mad on the air.

2004
01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:28.110
And even in those times you were like,
okay,

2005
01:57:28.111 --> 01:57:30.660
he just got a little hot today and that's not that big of a deal.

2006
01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:35.130
But then when all these things happened after the show and we're after he was

2007
01:57:35.131 --> 01:57:39.000
fired from the shell,
that's when it started to feel kind of like weird to me,

2008
01:57:39.001 --> 01:57:43.140
where I was like,
okay,
well was all that anger coming from a different place,

2009
01:57:43.650 --> 01:57:46.800
you know,
or,
yeah.
I don't know,
man.

2010
01:57:47.010 --> 01:57:50.820
The radio show thing fucked me up.
The white nationalist thing.
Fuck me up.
Yeah.

2011
01:57:50.821 --> 01:57:53.670
Well that'll do it.
I mean,
I don't know what,
you know,

2012
01:57:53.671 --> 01:57:57.180
I don't know how to take that.
Yeah.
That I know.
Hiding someone's house on fire.

2013
01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:00.870
I mean,
that's like you break up with someone,
you fucking burn all their records.

2014
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:04.260
It's so crazy to me that I almost feel like it.
I'm like,

2015
01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:08.550
maybe somebody's going to write later tonight and be like,
that's not true.

2016
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:12.720
That was a made up thing.
I don't see he was drinking.
Maybe he was,

2017
01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:16.950
who knows?
Who knows?
I don't know.
I would have to communicate with him.

2018
01:58:16.951 --> 01:58:19.350
I would have to pay attention to what he actually said on that show.

2019
01:58:19.351 --> 01:58:20.670
I didn't see it.
I didn't listen to it.

2020
01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:25.320
But the fact that he went on a white national shows not good.
You know,

2021
01:58:25.321 --> 01:58:29.540
like he,
isn't it funny,
you know,
this is a funny thing man,
because,
uh,

2022
01:58:30.610 --> 01:58:33.330
um,
you know,
going back and forth with people,

2023
01:58:33.331 --> 01:58:37.050
because it's something I said the other day on a podcast about Jon Jones where,

2024
01:58:37.051 --> 01:58:40.530
uh,
I said that I think that a lot of the hate that Jon Jones gets,

2025
01:58:41.170 --> 01:58:42.370
it's possible

2026
01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:45.430
<v 0>that some of it might be because of racism.
I said,</v>

2027
01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:49.900
I wonder if some of it might be because of racism.
That was my exact words.

2028
01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.490
And people were,
you know,

2029
01:58:51.610 --> 01:58:55.600
said like there's headlines of things and said white guilt,
you know,

2030
01:58:55.601 --> 01:58:57.550
Rogan thinks that,
you know,
this is,

2031
01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:02.380
it's all because of racism and it's such as a hot button topic.
Right?
You know,

2032
01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:06.490
if you bring it up in any form at all,
you bring up racism in any form at all.

2033
01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:07.960
People just immediately.

2034
01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:13.970
<v 2>It's just so it's a weird topic.
It's a tough subject,</v>

2035
01:59:13.971 --> 01:59:17.210
which is why I think if you're going to address problems in a community,

2036
01:59:17.211 --> 01:59:21.080
you have to also address potential solutions.
Uh,

2037
01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:26.770
I don't,
and I don't think that happens often in the race discussion.

2038
01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:31.330
I think the race discussion is almost always two sides attacking one,

2039
01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.600
one side on a hard blind attack and another side on a hard blind defense.

2040
01:59:36.730 --> 01:59:39.140
But there's like double standards.
And here's one of them.

2041
01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:42.940
The heavyweight champion of the world is dude named Cain Velasquez.
Awesome fire,

2042
01:59:42.941 --> 01:59:46.750
great guy boxing the heavyweight UFC heavyweight champion.

2043
01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:49.210
<v 0>Um,
and uh,</v>

2044
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:54.270
he has brown pride tattooed across his chest because he's Mexican Brown pride.

2045
01:59:56.870 --> 02:00:01.570
Could you imagine if there was a white guy who was the heavy,

2046
02:00:01.571 --> 02:00:06.571
if Brock Lesnar won the heavyweight title and then got white pride tattooed

2047
02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:08.080
across his chest.

2048
02:00:08.250 --> 02:00:11.620
<v 2>Yeah,
but here's the difference.
Here's to me,
here's the difference.</v>

2049
02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:16.320
That argument Brown pride never meant the same thing as white pride.

2050
02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:20.370
White pride has always been synonymous with white power,

2051
02:00:20.670 --> 02:00:24.810
always that those two terms have never not been linked to one another.

2052
02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:28.770
So you put white pride out there,
it sounds like white power.

2053
02:00:28.890 --> 02:00:31.020
People start going down that road and they're like,

2054
02:00:31.021 --> 02:00:35.400
what the fuck is this guy all about brown pride when it's like,
hey man,

2055
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:39.420
I'm from a suppressed,
people are oppressed people.
Excuse me.
Uh,

2056
02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:42.780
and,
and hey man,
I'm,
I'm proud of who I am.

2057
02:00:43.470 --> 02:00:45.840
Nobody would have a problem with a white guy.
That's where it's at.

2058
02:00:45.850 --> 02:00:50.310
Italian pride or Irish pride,
Russ.
True.
Nobody would have a problem with that.

2059
02:00:50.311 --> 02:00:54.780
That's very true.
That's very true.
It's overall white would be an issue.

2060
02:00:55.230 --> 02:00:58.310
But that's true.
If someone had Irish pride written under chest,
like of Collin,

2061
02:00:58.370 --> 02:01:00.600
uh,
um,
Mcgregor.

2062
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:05.730
Conor McGregor rather had a Irish pride on his back as a famous Irish fighter

2063
02:01:05.970 --> 02:01:09.150
and we would give a fuck.
No,
nobody would,
nobody would care at all.

2064
02:01:09.151 --> 02:01:11.880
Proud Irishman has done wrong with that.
He says he's a proud Irishman.
Yeah,

2065
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:16.470
I mean it's English pride would be fine.
And I'll anyone Polish German navy,

2066
02:01:16.471 --> 02:01:19.800
not chairman German would be a real issue and be like,
what are you proud about?

2067
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:24.600
Exactly?
Engineering our cars.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay,
cool.
Yeah,

2068
02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:31.800
I mean a company accomplishments assigned.
Yeah.
No,
it's,

2069
02:01:31.801 --> 02:01:36.170
it's,
it's,
I mean,
this whole,
why do it?

2070
02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:39.980
It goes back to the thing you said about certain communities having to deal

2071
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:44.870
<v 4>with,
uh,
certain setbacks,
right.
I'm not putting words in your mouth here.</v>

2072
02:01:44.871 --> 02:01:48.800
That's essentially what you said.
Certain communities have had certain setbacks.

2073
02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.960
The white community as a whole has not faced too many setbacks.

2074
02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:59.540
It's just a fact.
Most of global tyranny,
uh,
violence,

2075
02:01:59.541 --> 02:02:04.490
genocide,
whatever has a big chunk of it has been perpetuated by white people.

2076
02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:09.220
And white people have pretty much prevailed in the majority in,

2077
02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:12.050
in most of the societies that they have ever existed.

2078
02:02:12.051 --> 02:02:14.420
In not saying there aren't poor white people.

2079
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:18.950
I don't agree with that whole white people problems.
Bullshit.
You know,

2080
02:02:18.951 --> 02:02:22.430
I'm not saying that white people can't have a hard time.
Ah,

2081
02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:26.780
and I'm not saying that there aren't people that aren't white that are as well

2082
02:02:26.781 --> 02:02:29.720
off or way better off than a lot of white people.
Right.

2083
02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:33.110
But if you want to speak in generalities,

2084
02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:37.790
a of race white has had the least amount of headaches.

2085
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:41.870
So it's tough when the people that have had the least amount of setbacks in the

2086
02:02:41.871 --> 02:02:45.440
least amount of headaches stand to the side and go,

2087
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:49.250
stop your complaining.
Stop your complaining.

2088
02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:54.590
Because then it starts to be like,
fuck you man.
Fuck you.

2089
02:02:54.710 --> 02:02:59.200
That's like somebody going,
you know Joe,
you know man,
you,
you,

2090
02:02:59.750 --> 02:03:00.260
oh

2091
02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:04.250
<v 0>did you take Jujitsu when you were a kid?
Cause your upbringing was so bad.
Oh,</v>

2092
02:03:04.251 --> 02:03:07.820
stop fucking war.
You know what I mean?
Then you want to be like,
hey fuck you.

2093
02:03:07.821 --> 02:03:09.470
You don't know anything about my fucking upbringing.

2094
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:11.930
I probably wouldn't handle it that way,
but go ahead.

2095
02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:16.590
But I'm saying it would feel disrespectful if I spoke to you.

2096
02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:22.480
I don't think the comparison is like a martial arts comparison because yeah,

2097
02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:27.470
I think the race issue is a bigger issue.
Of course it's bigger,
it's darker,

2098
02:03:27.471 --> 02:03:31.130
it's more fucked up.
And racism to me is one of the,

2099
02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:34.940
it's one of the most unfortunate aspects of humanity.

2100
02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.330
This idea of just seeing someone,

2101
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:42.530
basing it on all the data that you've accumulated in the x amount of years

2102
02:03:42.531 --> 02:03:45.500
you've been alive,
all the bad experiences you've had with,
uh,

2103
02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:49.070
white people or black people,
whatever it is that you have a racism towards,

2104
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:52.460
and then automatically assuming that this person who you have no interaction

2105
02:03:52.461 --> 02:03:54.440
with whatsoever is negative based on that.

2106
02:03:54.441 --> 02:03:57.080
It's just so limiting and it's so unfortunate.

2107
02:03:57.110 --> 02:03:59.420
It's one of the most unfortunate aspects of being a person.

2108
02:03:59.421 --> 02:04:02.260
So I can never support it.
But,
um,

2109
02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:06.530
I think it's a complex subject for debate.
It's a very complex subject.

2110
02:04:06.531 --> 02:04:08.960
There's a lot going on there and anybody that pretends it isn't,

2111
02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:13.100
whether it's Anthony or whether it's on the progressive side,
you know,
who,

2112
02:04:13.101 --> 02:04:17.910
whichever side has an a non nuanced opinion on it.
I think yes,

2113
02:04:17.970 --> 02:04:19.430
the service to a complex topic.

2114
02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:23.790
<v 4>I have a,
I have a real problem when the topic is addressed,</v>

2115
02:04:25.050 --> 02:04:27.540
uh,
with,
with the,
with the,
um,

2116
02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:33.400
the approach of stop your belly aching.
Yeah,
let's just,

2117
02:04:33.401 --> 02:04:37.590
the people fucking with you.
You know,
it's this simple.
Do you know what I mean?

2118
02:04:37.591 --> 02:04:38.280
It's this simple

2119
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.060
<v 8>guys,
get up slavery,
get over it.
I mean,
I've heard people say that,</v>

2120
02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:47.130
I've heard people say slavery,
get over it.
I've heard Jewish people say,
oh,

2121
02:04:47.190 --> 02:04:50.940
I'm sick of hearing this.
We were in the Holocaust and it's like,
you guys were,

2122
02:04:50.941 --> 02:04:54.210
and that's fucking terrible.
But at the same time,
guys,
Jesus,

2123
02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:55.500
I'm not saying all Jewish people say that,

2124
02:04:55.501 --> 02:04:58.860
but like I've heard Jewish people say that about black.

2125
02:04:58.930 --> 02:05:01.220
I've heard black people say,
we don't give a fuck up to the house.

2126
02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:04.060
It's not just white people.
It was my point.
Or,
you know,
or,

2127
02:05:04.090 --> 02:05:08.460
or the classic stereotypical white people doing this,
it comes from all sides.

2128
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:12.150
You know,
Italian people and Irish people will say,
oh,
big deal.

2129
02:05:12.151 --> 02:05:15.450
We were in the ghettos when we first came here.
It's like,
yeah,

2130
02:05:15.451 --> 02:05:18.180
but it's just everybody's got their different,

2131
02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:21.420
they're different run through this and there's a snowball effect that happens

2132
02:05:21.421 --> 02:05:21.970
and it's,
it's

2133
02:05:21.970 --> 02:05:25.900
<v 2>complicated.
Yeah,
no,
it's definitely complicated,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

2134
02:05:26.170 --> 02:05:29.010
So I mean,
um,
it,

2135
02:05:29.070 --> 02:05:32.500
it would be nice if we could just judge people and who sucks and then figure out

2136
02:05:32.501 --> 02:05:35.380
why they suck and then,
but you know what,
man,

2137
02:05:35.710 --> 02:05:39.520
I wonder if it's even fucking possible to ever work it out.

2138
02:05:39.610 --> 02:05:44.610
I kind of feel like to the day humans stop until the day we become something

2139
02:05:46.001 --> 02:05:46.834
else.

2140
02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:52.120
I just don't see how there's ever going to be a universal group of people that

2141
02:05:52.121 --> 02:05:56.170
gets it.
Right.
Like,
like where anybody,
any culture ever,

2142
02:05:56.171 --> 02:05:59.620
like completely gets it right with his no fuck heads.
There's no jealousy.

2143
02:05:59.621 --> 02:06:00.670
There's no bullshit.

2144
02:06:00.671 --> 02:06:05.671
There's no insecurity or nonsense or I think other countries on the planet have

2145
02:06:08.741 --> 02:06:09.880
a shot at it.
Really.

2146
02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:14.860
I don't think this one has got a shot at Iceland or something like that where

2147
02:06:14.861 --> 02:06:18.760
there's only a hundred people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean Canada might have a shot,

2148
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:21.220
you know,
like they do better than us.
I'll tell you that.

2149
02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:26.520
I think other countries might have a shot at complete harmony amongst people of

2150
02:06:27.731 --> 02:06:32.290
any color,
whatever.
It will never happen here.
It will never happen here.

2151
02:06:32.291 --> 02:06:37.120
This country is built on a disgusting foundation.

2152
02:06:37.121 --> 02:06:41.500
There are too many skeletons in the closet.
There's too much dirt,
too much pain.

2153
02:06:41.501 --> 02:06:45.460
It's built on.
It's just build on too much pain and turmoil and and deceit and,

2154
02:06:46.090 --> 02:06:48.610
and whatever.
And it's like when you start something like that,

2155
02:06:48.611 --> 02:06:51.490
when you start the practice like that,
steal the land,

2156
02:06:51.491 --> 02:06:55.600
steal the people so we can prosper it.

2157
02:06:55.630 --> 02:06:57.400
How could it ever bounce back?

2158
02:06:57.580 --> 02:07:01.000
Because that just will continue and continue and continue and snowball and

2159
02:07:01.001 --> 02:07:04.990
snowball and stumble until you have these seemingly unfixable problems,

2160
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:06.700
seemingly unfixable.

2161
02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:11.400
And I don't say that to a t to,

2162
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:14.800
to take hope away from anybody that's in a dire situation.

2163
02:07:15.310 --> 02:07:17.980
I think all these things are able to be Rah,

2164
02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:22.050
Rah risen above on an individual level,
but individual level,

2165
02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:25.600
an individual levels.
But I mean,
for God's sakes,
it's like we have,

2166
02:07:26.380 --> 02:07:31.380
you look at the situations in the inner cities because of all these different

2167
02:07:31.481 --> 02:07:35.890
factors that we're talking about,
uh,
and how it,
and

2168
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:38.050
<v 8>how it got to where it is now and everything.
It's like,</v>

2169
02:07:38.110 --> 02:07:41.980
how could you ever in a million years rectify that?

2170
02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:44.970
<v 0>All right,
let me tell you this.
What if you're,
you're the president,</v>

2171
02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:49.980
President Derosa all of a sudden they say,
we've decided to,
you know,

2172
02:07:50.070 --> 02:07:54.330
start electing standup comedians.
They,
they,
they have good philosophical points.

2173
02:07:54.630 --> 02:07:57.180
Like,
what would you do?
What would you do to try to fix shit?

2174
02:07:57.630 --> 02:08:00.780
Do you have any answers or are you just look at it and go,
it's all fucked up.

2175
02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:03.540
Do you ever let go pass?
It's all fucked up.
Do you ever like,

2176
02:08:03.541 --> 02:08:05.940
see if I was going to do something about it,
what would I do?

2177
02:08:06.070 --> 02:08:10.750
<v 8>I have a very hard time seeing past I,
yeah,</v>

2178
02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:14.830
this is,
this would be my one suggestion.
Uh,

2179
02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:19.060
it would be
strive for independence,

2180
02:08:19.061 --> 02:08:21.970
strive for individual success,

2181
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:27.640
strive for individual success.
Because when you try everybody,

2182
02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:31.990
everybody,
I think by just by default,
I don't know what it is.

2183
02:08:31.991 --> 02:08:34.060
I guess it's just survival tactics or whatever.

2184
02:08:34.210 --> 02:08:37.810
We all sort of have that run with the pack mentality.
You know?

2185
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:39.070
It's like when you're growing up,

2186
02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:40.540
no matter what kind of neighborhood you live in,

2187
02:08:40.541 --> 02:08:45.160
whether it's a suburb or the projects,
or in a fucking country,

2188
02:08:45.161 --> 02:08:47.980
dirt road on a country to where,
excuse me,

2189
02:08:48.730 --> 02:08:53.380
there's always the one kid that's maybe going places and that one kid always

2190
02:08:53.381 --> 02:08:55.750
gets the same advice you want to go anywhere.

2191
02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:58.150
I'm going to stop hanging around with these fucking knuckleheads that you're

2192
02:08:58.151 --> 02:09:00.970
running around with because these guys are going to hold you back.
Why?

2193
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:06.010
Because for some reason in anybody's community,
everybody,
the mentality,

2194
02:09:06.011 --> 02:09:08.410
the notion is stick together.
If you leave your,

2195
02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:11.590
that means you think you're better.
That means you think you're different.

2196
02:09:11.591 --> 02:09:14.470
We don't want it.
Dude,
it happened to me and I'm from the fucking suburbs.

2197
02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:15.770
So it's not just a,

2198
02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:20.740
it's not just a thing you hear about in rap songs when guys are talking about

2199
02:09:20.741 --> 02:09:23.950
people in the projects holding,
trying to hold them back.

2200
02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:27.340
It's a thing that happens all over.
So if I was the president,

2201
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:30.700
I were the president,
I would say to people,

2202
02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:33.460
strive for independent success.

2203
02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:36.480
Stop worrying about what's happening to the people.

2204
02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:39.250
I'm not saying like in a callous went fuck the people around you,

2205
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:41.530
be concerned about your community,

2206
02:09:42.130 --> 02:09:44.890
but strive for independence success because you're not going to be able to fix

2207
02:09:44.891 --> 02:09:48.790
the problem from within.
You have to get out and fix it from the outside.

2208
02:09:48.970 --> 02:09:51.790
And if enough people can get out and start to assist from the outside,

2209
02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:55.940
then there's a chance there's a chance of fixing this.
There's a chance he's

2210
02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:58.820
<v 2>break up the neighborhood.
That's what I heard say,</v>

2211
02:09:58.850 --> 02:10:01.560
just fucking the roast is trying to break up the neighborhood.

2212
02:10:01.590 --> 02:10:04.530
I was laughing what Ron on from Ron and Fez about it,
like,

2213
02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.630
like Philly and he's like,
you know,

2214
02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.460
like we were just laughing about like when trying to get out of Philly and like

2215
02:10:11.461 --> 02:10:14.410
the suburbs around Philly and stuff and like guys just being like,
where are you?

2216
02:10:14.450 --> 02:10:19.350
We go in,
we got,
we got these sandwiches,
you know what I mean?

2217
02:10:20.070 --> 02:10:24.180
And it's like we were laughing cause it's just like,
yeah,
yeah.
I like,

2218
02:10:24.210 --> 02:10:27.140
I would have people be so fucking passive aggressive with

2219
02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:29.980
<v 8>me and,
and you know,</v>

2220
02:10:30.070 --> 02:10:34.010
like it took years and then like when I started to find

2221
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:35.420
<v 4>a little bit of success in the business,</v>

2222
02:10:35.630 --> 02:10:40.220
people that I was friends with would say things to me like,
fuck you dude.

2223
02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:44.540
Oh mister fucking comedians back in town.
And it's like,

2224
02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:48.170
this is just shit.
People do wherever you live.

2225
02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:52.000
<v 0>They don't always do that though,
is there's a lot of people that don't do that.</v>

2226
02:10:52.001 --> 02:10:55.660
But I know this isn't,
you know,
there's a little bit of that crabs in a bucket.

2227
02:10:55.661 --> 02:11:00.070
Shit going on the east coast.
Yes.
East Coast.
More so I think,
and I,

2228
02:11:00.490 --> 02:11:01.420
we've talked about this before,

2229
02:11:01.421 --> 02:11:05.110
but I believe it's because they are the children of immigrants that like almost

2230
02:11:05.111 --> 02:11:07.110
everyone on the east coast is live.

2231
02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:10.690
The grandfathers or the great grandfathers came over from Europe or some other

2232
02:11:10.691 --> 02:11:12.760
country landed on the east coast and stayed there.

2233
02:11:13.150 --> 02:11:15.100
Whereas by the time people got to the west coast,

2234
02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:18.010
there are a bit more progressive people,
more wanderlust,

2235
02:11:18.011 --> 02:11:22.270
more people like looking for different options.
See,
I don't totally agree.

2236
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:26.420
<v 4>Well I think it happens here in a very different way.
How's it happen here?
Uh,</v>

2237
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:30.550
I think here there's a,
there there's a massive,
um,

2238
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:36.870
I'd say almost bleeding heart liberal mentality and

2239
02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:44.370
at least from what I've,
from what I've experienced here,
um,

2240
02:11:45.010 --> 02:11:50.010
as being somebody who needs to sort of assimilate into this system that's here,

2241
02:11:50.081 --> 02:11:50.771
you know what I mean?

2242
02:11:50.771 --> 02:11:54.820
Like I'm not to a point in my life where I can kind of just go off and do my own

2243
02:11:54.821 --> 02:11:56.710
thing and,
and be okay.

2244
02:11:56.711 --> 02:12:00.340
Like I still need to like meet the right people and,

2245
02:12:01.090 --> 02:12:04.000
and kind of work my way into the system and all that stuff.

2246
02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:08.890
And familiarize myself with them.
And I find that there is a very,
very,

2247
02:12:08.891 --> 02:12:13.300
very,
like I said,
almost bleeding heart mentality here and it feels,

2248
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:17.680
it feels like the same thing to me except in the other direction where it's
like,

2249
02:12:17.681 --> 02:12:19.660
don't go against the pack.
Don't say that.

2250
02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:22.030
Don't you dare say that because let me just clarify.

2251
02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:26.590
You're talking about show business?
Well,
in my la experience,

2252
02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:29.740
but I,
I think the city itself,
I think the cow,

2253
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:31.810
at least southern California,

2254
02:12:31.930 --> 02:12:36.220
I think there's a certain common mentality that exists here.
Like,
Hey,

2255
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:39.880
you can't act that way.
That's to Ed.
Edgy meaning on edge.

2256
02:12:39.881 --> 02:12:41.380
Not meaning you're saying as he thinks.

2257
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:42.081
<v 0>Well you,</v>

2258
02:12:42.081 --> 02:12:44.810
but you're the majority of the people that you're communicating with a show

2259
02:12:44.811 --> 02:12:46.160
business people though,
right?
Uh,

2260
02:12:46.161 --> 02:12:49.550
probably a problem with the show business that you're communicating with your

2261
02:12:49.551 --> 02:12:53.270
talking about like people and television and things along those lines is that

2262
02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:57.800
there's a lot of people trying to get people to hire them for things,

2263
02:12:57.890 --> 02:13:00.170
trying to get people to cast them in shows,

2264
02:13:00.171 --> 02:13:03.260
trying to get people to give them deals,
trying to get people to like them.

2265
02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:07.880
And the way to get people to like them as to subscribe to whatever popular

2266
02:13:07.881 --> 02:13:10.670
opinions these people subscribed to.
And in show business,

2267
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:12.260
it's almost universally liberal.

2268
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:17.240
And that's one of the things that people like Charlton Heston or John void or

2269
02:13:17.330 --> 02:13:20.810
Clint Eastwood have always complained about the price of the rare Hollywood

2270
02:13:20.811 --> 02:13:24.250
conservatives because everyone in Hollywood is liberal.
And I think that that's,

2271
02:13:24.370 --> 02:13:26.990
there's some valid discussion to that.

2272
02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:30.800
But I think it's also the nature of the beast itself where you want people to,

2273
02:13:30.801 --> 02:13:31.230
like,

2274
02:13:31.230 --> 02:13:35.070
you want people to accept you and there's a lot of fake fucks out here because

2275
02:13:35.071 --> 02:13:39.570
of that.
Because the business itself,
it,
it sort of rewards fakery,

2276
02:13:39.571 --> 02:13:42.420
it rewards conformity and the conformity,

2277
02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:46.710
a lot of it is this sort of left wing liberal thinking.

2278
02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:49.560
<v 4>So,
and when I'm,
when I'm saying is,
and I agree with you,</v>

2279
02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:54.510
that's how they get work.
And I agree with you.
Uh,
what I'm saying is though,

2280
02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:56.850
I think that mentality exists everywhere.

2281
02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:01.860
It can sure that I want people to like me.
You're,
it's,
it's survival.

2282
02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:04.640
It's survival.
It's,
yeah.
You know,

2283
02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:08.840
I think it was like there's a car in one line where he says species first in

2284
02:14:09.150 --> 02:14:13.770
first interest is always survival.
Uh,
so like,
you know,

2285
02:14:13.771 --> 02:14:15.760
I think,
I just think that's a thing every day.
It's,
it's,

2286
02:14:15.761 --> 02:14:20.520
it's why whenever any one of us has at a party and we're outnumbered in opinion,

2287
02:14:21.090 --> 02:14:25.620
whether it's a political discussion or we're fucking discussion about people

2288
02:14:25.621 --> 02:14:28.080
think Katy Perry's the best,
whatever,

2289
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:31.290
that's when you just have to just walk away.
Well,
not sure,

2290
02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:33.820
but the best what Scott?

2291
02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:37.170
Great till we're done basically donut,

2292
02:14:38.070 --> 02:14:42.510
but you won't walk away.
Sure.
But I'm saying like most of us feel that,

2293
02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:44.130
that you tense up and you go,

2294
02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:48.060
I don't want to say I don't really like Katy Perry's tits because now everybody

2295
02:14:48.061 --> 02:14:50.880
in the room's going to be like,
what the fuck are you talking about,
dude?

2296
02:14:51.210 --> 02:14:53.760
Do you see what I'm saying?
Like I just,
I,
I don't know.

2297
02:14:54.210 --> 02:14:57.850
I might be putting too fine a point on it.
Sorry.
Yeah,
I know you're saying

2298
02:14:57.850 --> 02:14:58.180
<v 0>though,</v>

2299
02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:01.660
I know he's saying this is definitely a strong urge to conform as part of being

2300
02:15:01.661 --> 02:15:03.040
a human being and yeah,
you're right.

2301
02:15:03.041 --> 02:15:07.480
It's part of like the only way you can ensure your survival is that you're a

2302
02:15:07.481 --> 02:15:08.830
part of a group.
I mean,
that's,

2303
02:15:08.831 --> 02:15:12.640
that's ingrained in our DNA because at one point in time,
that's how we survived.

2304
02:15:12.641 --> 02:15:15.070
When marauding tribes would come into our villages,

2305
02:15:15.071 --> 02:15:18.430
you had to stay United as a United front.
And I think there's,

2306
02:15:18.431 --> 02:15:22.360
it's a stronger urge in these places where,
you know,
like in Philly,

2307
02:15:22.361 --> 02:15:25.750
in places along those lines where,
you know,
these communities stay in tact.

2308
02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:29.140
Whereas in La there's more wandering la,
everyone's transient.

2309
02:15:29.141 --> 02:15:30.640
They came here from another place,

2310
02:15:30.641 --> 02:15:33.310
they move around and I don't think it's the same thing,

2311
02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:35.980
but there's definitely like Brian posted that thing up.

2312
02:15:35.981 --> 02:15:36.791
I don't know if you saw it,

2313
02:15:36.791 --> 02:15:41.791
but they did a Twitter map of hate speech east coast to west coast and racial

2314
02:15:42.250 --> 02:15:44.410
and homophobic.
I look at it and look at it.

2315
02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:49.440
It's overwhelmingly east coast welcomingly and I personally,

2316
02:15:50.010 --> 02:15:51.280
it was just my own theory.

2317
02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:54.160
It's probably like Michael Jackson doesn't have any balls theory.

2318
02:15:54.161 --> 02:15:55.060
It's probably socks.

2319
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:58.300
But I think that a lot of that has to do with the spread of immigration.

2320
02:15:58.301 --> 02:16:01.150
And that my own experience with immigrants,

2321
02:16:01.151 --> 02:16:05.180
my grandparents were immigrants on both sides.
And I grew up in,
you know,

2322
02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:09.280
New Jersey and then in Boston and I grew up around a lot of immigrants.

2323
02:16:09.670 --> 02:16:12.910
People that you know,
were children of immigrants or grandchildren of immigrants.

2324
02:16:13.150 --> 02:16:17.230
And I think that that's a lot of what happens.
I think there's just a,

2325
02:16:17.290 --> 02:16:19.830
there's a trap,
you know,
and it's not as bad as a trapped,

2326
02:16:19.831 --> 02:16:21.550
it's in the impoverished black communities,

2327
02:16:21.551 --> 02:16:25.990
but it's still a very similar trap as far as the behavioral trap.
Sure.

2328
02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:27.790
People are fucking strange man,

2329
02:16:27.791 --> 02:16:32.791
because it took a law of work to get to 2014 with all the rhinos and lions and

2330
02:16:34.061 --> 02:16:37.390
fucking poisonous bugs and all the shit that's out there that could fuck you up.

2331
02:16:37.460 --> 02:16:37.711
Sure.

2332
02:16:37.711 --> 02:16:42.340
It took a long time and a lot of work for us to get to where we are today with

2333
02:16:42.341 --> 02:16:44.800
lava lamps and laptops and shit.
You know,
we had,
uh,

2334
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:47.980
we had to get our way through a lot of things and we had to stay protected while

2335
02:16:47.981 --> 02:16:51.490
we innovate.
You know,
here's a crazy thing I just totally off subject,

2336
02:16:51.491 --> 02:16:53.850
but I think we've beaten this to death anyway.
Um,

2337
02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:59.640
they found a huge underground reservoir recently that holds three times as much

2338
02:17:00.401 --> 02:17:05.050
water as the earth's oceans.
Yeah.
It's,

2339
02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:10.180
well this is on,
it's on fucking Nova.
Okay.
This is a PBS website that has this,

2340
02:17:10.181 --> 02:17:12.610
this is,
it's unbelievable.

2341
02:17:13.090 --> 02:17:15.910
It's is an unbelievable discovery.

2342
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:20.980
It's a study that was published in science magazine that Earth's water may have

2343
02:17:20.981 --> 02:17:22.420
been there all along,

2344
02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:26.200
oozing out gradually from the rock deep in the crust.

2345
02:17:26.590 --> 02:17:30.700
It was pressed up by intense heat and pressure below the surface because a lot

2346
02:17:30.701 --> 02:17:35.620
of our theories about how earth became so covered in water was that,
uh,
was,

2347
02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:38.920
was comics was comments that comments,

2348
02:17:38.921 --> 02:17:40.840
when you see a comet streaking across the sky,

2349
02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:43.900
where you're seeing is melting ice,
you're seeing enormous,
you know,

2350
02:17:43.901 --> 02:17:48.280
miles wide chunks of ice that are flying through space.
And the trail,

2351
02:17:48.310 --> 02:17:52.930
the tail of the comet is,
is actually ice.
Um,
being,
you know,

2352
02:17:52.931 --> 02:17:56.980
evaporating with as these things fly through the air.
So this is,
um,

2353
02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:01.060
this new study,
um,
that they,
uh,

2354
02:18:01.210 --> 02:18:05.970
have found this water in these subterranean,
um,
uh,

2355
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:10.530
I got,
I don't know how it,
I don't understand it.
There's,
it's,

2356
02:18:10.570 --> 02:18:14.800
it's called subterranean would,
would dite,

2357

2358
02:18:20.350 --> 02:18:21.760
A deep blue mineral,

2359
02:18:21.761 --> 02:18:26.020
chemically similar to a paradox.

T,
a green middle,

2361
02:18:28.571 --> 02:18:31.990
often used in jewelry and that it's,

2362
02:18:32.290 --> 02:18:35.120
it's been found in media rights and there's Ringwood.

2363
02:18:35.170 --> 02:18:39.100
I'd came from the transition zone between the upper and lower mantle,

2364
02:18:39.101 --> 02:18:43.300
about 400 million mile 400 miles below the earth's surface.

2365
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:48.610
It's about 15% of the weight of this stuff turned out to be water.

2366
02:18:49.210 --> 02:18:54.190
And,
uh,
if a lot of this,
it says if a lot of this water heavy mineral existed,

2367
02:18:54.191 --> 02:18:57.280
underground scientist reasons there might be enough water to explain where

2368
02:18:57.310 --> 02:18:58.330
earth's oceans came from.

2369
02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:01.570
And so then they started doing these studies and try to figure this out and they

2370
02:19:01.571 --> 02:19:06.160
found this insane amount of water below the earth's surface.

2371
02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:09.760
Okay.
It's this,
it's this incredible.
What are they,

2372
02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:12.280
what are they going to do with the water?
I don't know.
I Dunno.

2373
02:19:12.281 --> 02:19:16.810
The layer holds three times as much water as all of the earth's oceans combined.

2374
02:19:17.890 --> 02:19:21.850
It's incredible.
So it reduced the,
um,
the,

2375
02:19:21.851 --> 02:19:25.210
this right now people think that the earth is 96% water.

2376
02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:28.010
All the or the 96% of the water is in the ocean.

2377
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:32.550
Now they're saying it's only 24% of the water on earth is in the ocean.
Really?

2378
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:36.710
Yeah.
I wonder if there's any life in that water.

2379
02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:39.830
I don't think so because I think what this saying by this,

2380
02:19:39.831 --> 02:19:42.050
they're saying this ring would EIT stuff.

2381
02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:47.200
It's that water is compressed in this minerals and these minerals,

2382
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:51.320
see it's,
this is the exact way they word it.
Obviously I'm an idiot,

2383
02:19:51.321 --> 02:19:52.610
but bear with me.

2384
02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:57.740
Northwestern University professor who led the study found water in subterranean

2385
02:19:57.741 --> 02:20:02.360
Ringwood,
EIT,
a deep blue mineral,
chemically similar to paradox,

2386
02:20:02.570 --> 02:20:03.351
a green mineral.

2387
02:20:03.351 --> 02:20:08.351
Often used in jewelry until a sample turned up in 2008 in a diamond,

2388
02:20:08.421 --> 02:20:12.650
coughed up from a volcano Ringwood.
I had only been found in media rights.

2389
02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:15.770
The ring would,
I came from the transition zone,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

2390
02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:18.830
If a lot of this water,
every mineral existed underground.

2391
02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:22.220
So this water heavy mineral is what contains all this water.

2392
02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:26.670
So I don't know if they can get it out of the water.
See,
it sounds like,
you know,

2393
02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:28.640
you would,
you would hear that and you would say,
oh,

2394
02:20:28.641 --> 02:20:32.270
there's like rivers under the ocean.
I don't think they're saying that.

2395
02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:37.540
I think what they're saying is this water heavy mineral is so dense in the earth

2396
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:42.710
under the earth's mantle that doubled the amount of water in it is much more

2397
02:20:42.711 --> 02:20:46.610
than the amount that's in the oceans.
Really?
Yeah.
That's amazing.
What I learned.

2398
02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:50.330
You know,
Dave,
they're learning shit about the earth.
Just the earth,

2399
02:20:50.331 --> 02:20:54.440
the thing we live on,
they're learning things every day.
It's,
there's all,

2400
02:20:54.441 --> 02:20:55.610
the data's not in yet.

2401
02:20:56.280 --> 02:21:00.870
<v 4>It's,
uh,
it's,
I find it incredibly overwhelming.</v>

2402
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:03.450
Like,
you know,

2403
02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:08.460
we just had that really long discussion about race and how complicated and how

2404
02:21:08.461 --> 02:21:09.540
deep that all is.

2405
02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:14.900
And that's just a discussion pertaining to people in just this country,

2406
02:21:16.020 --> 02:21:18.180
not even the people of the entire world.

2407
02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:23.240
And now we're into a discussion about how we're learning about the actual earth

2408
02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:26.310
and now there's three times more water here than we thought there.
Well,

2409
02:21:26.311 --> 02:21:27.144
whatever it is,

2410
02:21:27.180 --> 02:21:32.180
and it's so fucking over like that discussion into that news piece,

2411
02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:33.870
it's,

2412
02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:37.410
I literally have the same feeling I had when I was at the Grand Canyon and I was

2413
02:21:37.411 --> 02:21:40.230
like,
I don't even exist.
This is like,
you know what I mean?

2414
02:21:40.410 --> 02:21:42.960
Like I've never felt more like a speck of dust right now.

2415
02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:46.260
There I'm completely overwhelmed.
I really mean that.

2416
02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:48.660
<v 0>Well then they can keep finding these goldilocks planets,</v>

2417
02:21:48.661 --> 02:21:50.820
these planets in the goldilocks zone that are,

2418
02:21:50.850 --> 02:21:54.540
they're capable of supporting the same type of life that exists on earth.
I mean,

2419
02:21:54.541 --> 02:21:58.830
scientists say that life can exist in a bunch of different ways and it never,

2420
02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:02.220
they never thought before like they're finding life and these volcanic vents

2421
02:22:02.460 --> 02:22:02.911
deep,
deep,

2422
02:22:02.911 --> 02:22:06.510
deep in the ocean where they never thought that any being could survive the

2423
02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:09.040
extreme temperatures.
You know,
they're,
they're,
they're,

2424
02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:11.940
they're essentially living off lava and the,

2425
02:22:12.030 --> 02:22:17.030
and the ocean floor and these events are giving birth to these weird kind of a

2426
02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:20.700
life forms.
What are the life forms like down there?

2427
02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:25.770
Some fucking creepy things,
some creepy plant life and weird life.

2428
02:22:25.771 --> 02:22:30.720
But they found a new type of mushroom that was recent.
It's a recent study,

2429
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:33.480
new mushroom that defies classification.

2430
02:22:33.481 --> 02:22:37.710
It's a new type of life and they just found it.
But with the animal,

2431
02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:41.430
the lava animal thing.
When you say animal life,

2432
02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:46.520
do you mean literally animal life microscopic things that are alive?

2433
02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:50.580
Like this deep sea mushroom that they found.
This is a new one that they found.

2434
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:55.920
Um,
this is a off of the BBC science and environment page is a mushroom shaped,

2435
02:22:55.921 --> 02:23:00.870
see animal discovered off and Australian coast that has defied classification

2436
02:23:00.871 --> 02:23:01.830
and the tree of life.

2437
02:23:02.370 --> 02:23:06.060
So this is a new type of life form that they found.

2438
02:23:06.690 --> 02:23:09.420
This is fucking crazy shit,
man.
You know,

2439
02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:11.820
finding something like this is extremely rare.

2440
02:23:11.821 --> 02:23:16.560
It's maybe only happened four times in the last 100 years are saying they don't

2441
02:23:16.561 --> 02:23:20.160
know what it is.
They're like,
what the fuck is this stuff?
It's like,

2442
02:23:20.161 --> 02:23:23.940
it's not quite a plant that's fucking wild.

2443
02:23:24.810 --> 02:23:27.450
Jesus Christ.
That's literally star Trek Shit.

2444
02:23:27.451 --> 02:23:29.700
When when there would be plants with like mouths and eyes.

2445
02:23:29.970 --> 02:23:32.670
That might be the beginning of something like that.
Well,
you know,

2446
02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:36.810
if you think about plants like Venus fly traps and shit like that where they

2447
02:23:36.811 --> 02:23:40.530
have carnivorous plants,
at what point is a plant and animal?

2448
02:23:40.650 --> 02:23:44.820
I mean when plants start fucking closing in on flies and eating them.
Yeah,

2449
02:23:44.850 --> 02:23:47.760
I get it.
It's a plant,
but that's a predator.

2450
02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:51.450
It things lays traps and it actually has action.
It moves.

2451
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:54.570
I always wanted one of those.
Those are dope.
Do you have one?
No,

2452
02:23:54.571 --> 02:23:57.930
but I should get them now that I bring it up.
I had one.
I had one that died.

2453
02:23:57.990 --> 02:24:01.890
I remember what happened.
What'd he do?
What'd he flies?
Flies to feed it.
Hey,

2454
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:03.060
we have to have a shitty house.

2455
02:24:06.650 --> 02:24:07.680
Otherwise you'd be in rude.

2456
02:24:07.681 --> 02:24:10.070
It's like you wouldn't have a cat and not have cat food.
You know,

2457
02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:12.450
if you have a Venus flytrap,
you can't just fucking water it.

2458
02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:15.090
You gotta throw some flies in there.
I wonder what you do.

2459
02:24:15.091 --> 02:24:16.280
Do you get by dead flat?

2460
02:24:16.310 --> 02:24:20.160
You probably buy dead fives to feed it or some kind of like larva to feed it.

2461
02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:22.530
He'd have to hope that somebody left a window open otherwise.

2462
02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:26.310
But how cool would that be?
I am such a jacket.

2463
02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:29.430
I keep looking at the fucking screen and then it,
yeah,
that's why I tell people.

2464
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:32.690
That's why I've been asking you to shut these off.
Right?
Like there's,
sorry.

2465
02:24:32.890 --> 02:24:36.690
That's all right.
There's a plant that eats rats.
Get the fuck Outta here.

2466
02:24:36.691 --> 02:24:39.960
I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.
No,
there's a plant,
I believe it's in the Amazon.

2467
02:24:40.350 --> 02:24:45.330
It's a,
it captures rats.
It captures rats.
Yeah,

2468
02:24:45.331 --> 02:24:49.500
it eats mice.
Yeah.
Google that.
Brian's rat eating plant.

2469
02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:54.000
There's a video on wimp.com don't play the video cause otherwise we'd get

2470
02:24:54.001 --> 02:24:58.920
another fucking strike against us on Youtube.
What do you mean it's so bizarre?

2471
02:24:59.070 --> 02:25:03.510
Every time we uh,
play videos or things,
just like there's all these weird,

2472
02:25:04.350 --> 02:25:07.740
is this supposed to be fair use?
Like when you're discussing something online,

2473
02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:10.860
it fits the boundaries of fair use.
The definition of fair use,

2474
02:25:10.861 --> 02:25:14.130
but people could still,
Dubuque dispute it or not.
It's fair use.

2475
02:25:14.490 --> 02:25:18.150
And then they put a hold on your youtube video and if it goes against you,

2476
02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:20.310
you get a certain amount of them,
they can pull your videos.

2477
02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:24.340
It's just fucking stupid.
But is stupid.
There is a plant,

2478
02:25:25.090 --> 02:25:29.560
it's a carnivorous plant.
It eats frogs and it eats mice,
ate,
eats,

2479
02:25:29.561 --> 02:25:33.220
all kinds of different shit.
Really?
Yeah.
If you just Google it,
it's called,

2480
02:25:33.610 --> 02:25:38.320
here's a fucking name and a half.
Right?
It's a who is,
that's called?

2481
02:25:38.350 --> 02:25:40.840
Yeah,
it's called net pen.

2482
02:25:40.930 --> 02:25:44.740
This at 10 baroque.
He,

2483
02:25:44.890 --> 02:25:47.380
is it possible that you could put it up on the screen and not put it on the

2484
02:25:47.381 --> 02:25:51.490
screen where the people at home see it?
Can you do that?
Meaning we watch it,

2485
02:25:51.491 --> 02:25:56.380
but they can see it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
This just,
if you want to Google it folks,

2486
02:25:56.381 --> 02:26:00.850
just Google a plant that eats rash.
I did fucking incredible.

2487
02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:02.051
I swear to God.

2488
02:26:02.051 --> 02:26:04.930
I thought you were yelling at him for a second and I got super uncomfortable.

2489
02:26:04.931 --> 02:26:09.010
What do you mean versus now?
Would you ever do you went,
is it possible for you?

2490
02:26:09.011 --> 02:26:10.240
And I thought you were going to be like,

2491
02:26:10.300 --> 02:26:13.000
is it possible for you not to fucking keep turning,
switching the script.

2492
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:15.610
I thought that's what you were going to do.
And I was like,
oh Jesus,

2493
02:26:15.611 --> 02:26:19.870
I don't want to see this happen full with anxiety.
Do they?
Dude,
I am.
I am.

2494
02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:24.660
You know,
you get a lot of massages.
I get massages every day.

2495
02:26:24.661 --> 02:26:29.350
She'd smokes weed every day.
I smoke weed every day.
Uh,

2496
02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:33.130
I don't know,
Dude.
If I look at this ratty and plant man,
no,

2497
02:26:33.131 --> 02:26:36.970
the folks at home can see this.
What are they seeing?
Just us.
Your logo.
Okay,
good.

2498
02:26:37.210 --> 02:26:40.000
So this is the fucking plant.
I guess it's growing here.

2499
02:26:40.001 --> 02:26:42.520
Is that what's going on here?
Yeah,
this is it growing up.

2500
02:26:42.730 --> 02:26:46.780
So it gets to a certain size and when it gets to a certain size,
um,
it's,

2501
02:26:46.781 --> 02:26:51.130
it's completely kind of diverse.
It eats frogs,
mice.
It captures them.

2502
02:26:51.310 --> 02:26:54.730
It opens up like this,
this thing I believe it has like a,

2503
02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:56.320
a sweet fermented,

2504
02:26:56.390 --> 02:27:00.220
a smell to it and these things go in it because they think this is like some

2505
02:27:00.221 --> 02:27:03.310
food in there and go in a Jackson.

2506
02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:06.000
Is that a snake or is that no,
that's,

2507
02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:10.690
that's it's like 10 to Kohl's or whatever the fuck it is.
Jesus Christ.

2508
02:27:10.691 --> 02:27:13.900
This is literally like little shop of horrors.
Shit.
Yeah,
it is.

2509
02:27:13.930 --> 02:27:17.260
It's like invasion of the body snatchers type shit.

2510
02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:20.860
That thing is fucking nasty.
Look,
it's enormous too.

2511
02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:24.040
That's the weird thing about it.
It's,
it's an enormous,

2512
02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:29.290
enormous thing that literally looks like a star Trek plant.
[inaudible] yeah,

2513
02:27:29.291 --> 02:27:33.070
you would think that would be like from avatar or something like that.
Right.

2514
02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:34.780
But it is a real thing.

2515
02:27:35.530 --> 02:27:39.520
Thank you for having a more recent reference than star Trek.
Keep.
That's my,

2516
02:27:39.521 --> 02:27:43.030
that was the best Scifi.
I'm terrible sometimes with references.

2517
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:47.050
I want to do now.
Is it going to show a rat go into it?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2518
02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:49.850
Would eventually show,
uh,
something go into it.
I forget what I've,

2519
02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:54.760
I've seen this video,
but there's a bunch of videos of them online.
Um,
these are,

2520
02:27:54.761 --> 02:27:57.490
uh,
they're fairly recent discoveries to,
I don't think they discovered it.

2521
02:27:57.491 --> 02:28:01.030
Tilted the two thousands.
Yeah.
Here it is.
May,
2010,

2522
02:28:01.031 --> 02:28:04.330
the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University

2523
02:28:04.331 --> 02:28:09.220
selected this plant is one of the top 10 new species described in 2009.

2524
02:28:09.221 --> 02:28:12.790
So in 2009,
they started a finding that this thing,
a real plant.

2525
02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:17.080
I don't understand how we didn't know about a plant until 2009.
Oh,

2526
02:28:17.081 --> 02:28:19.630
there's a lot of plants we still don't know about in the Amazon.

2527
02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:24.590
That's incredible to me.
Well,
the Amazon is so fucking big.
You know,
when you,

2528
02:28:24.740 --> 02:28:29.660
if there was a weird distortion thing,
when you look at,
um,
any sort of a,

2529
02:28:29.661 --> 02:28:31.400
a map,
you know,
like,

2530
02:28:31.401 --> 02:28:35.810
have you ever seen like a realistic interpretation of the size of continents?

2531
02:28:36.770 --> 02:28:40.610
Uh,
no.
Yeah.
See if we could find that.

2532
02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:43.610
Brian realistic.
I'm learning a lot today.
Yeah.

2533
02:28:43.611 --> 02:28:45.740
Realistic size of continents.

2534
02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:50.700
<v 2>Do you just read the shit like constantly?
Yeah,
I got problems,
man.
No,
I don't,</v>

2535
02:28:50.701 --> 02:28:54.930
I'm not criticizing.
I do,
I have problems.
Um,
not a problem.

2536
02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:00.060
Uh,
I'm envious of your knowledge of all this stuff.
I really wished that I had a,

2537
02:29:01.050 --> 02:29:03.750
I don't know anything about sports.
I know nothing about sports.

2538
02:29:03.751 --> 02:29:07.320
I asked you before if that guy was the boxing champion that you mentioned.
Oh,

2539
02:29:07.410 --> 02:29:12.390
Cain.
Valasquez yeah.
I didn't even know that.
Uh,
the,
uh,
I wish I knew.

2540
02:29:12.391 --> 02:29:16.470
I find this stuff so interesting and yet I never remember to read any of it.

2541
02:29:16.471 --> 02:29:19.470
And then I start to try to look it up and I can't remember your look.

2542
02:29:19.530 --> 02:29:21.210
Look how fluffy and big Africa is.

2543
02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:25.530
You can fit a whole United States in there and a China and in India,

2544
02:29:25.531 --> 02:29:29.040
Andy Italy,
like everything in Africa.
But,

2545
02:29:29.070 --> 02:29:32.280
but how the maps were drawn for reasons,
it

2546
02:29:32.590 --> 02:29:37.290
<v 0>just appears smaller.
Yeah.
Holy Shit.
It's crazy.
And that's just,</v>

2547
02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:41.080
that's the,
the rain forest in the Congo and the African rain forest,

2548
02:29:41.081 --> 02:29:45.250
but there's also the South American rain forests.
They're massive.

2549
02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:48.520
The rain forest in Brazil and Peru and down there,

2550
02:29:48.521 --> 02:29:51.670
I mean there's so many plants and that's one of the reasons why these

2551
02:29:51.671 --> 02:29:56.200
pharmaceutical companies keep going down there to try to explore and find out

2552
02:29:56.201 --> 02:29:58.780
new plants that can provide,
you know,

2553
02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:03.550
new drugs and good reasons for cancer medications and cure diseases and things

2554
02:30:03.551 --> 02:30:07.030
along those lines.
And also there's some of them that they,
uh,
they're,

2555
02:30:07.090 --> 02:30:08.250
they're using for like,

2556
02:30:08.350 --> 02:30:12.190
they're trying to do research on this aunt as an aunt called the bullet ant,

2557
02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:16.090
one of the most painful stings in the world.
But it,
uh,

2558
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:20.620
it doesn't just sting you.
Um,
oh,
not the bullet ant.
Catch your ass.
That's,

2559
02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:22.900
it really fucks you up.
That one fucks you up.
They're using that.

2560
02:30:22.901 --> 02:30:25.000
They're trying to use that for something else.
I got to confused.

2561
02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:27.040
It's actually the Brazilian wandering spider.

2562
02:30:27.041 --> 02:30:30.520
I was going to bring up the Brazilian wandering spiders.
So it's so fucked up.

2563
02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:32.830
It stings you.
It's in the jungle,
Brazil.

2564
02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:37.950
It stings you and gives you an unbelievably painful erection to the point where

2565
02:30:38.501 --> 02:30:41.050
if you survive where a lot of people don't,
if you survive,

2566
02:30:41.051 --> 02:30:43.330
your Dick is broken forever.

2567
02:30:43.390 --> 02:30:46.960
It'll never work it again in red lines your Dick

2568
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:52.270
and it works in the same sort of way like Viagra works where it,
it,
it,

2569
02:30:52.271 --> 02:30:57.250
it gives you nitric oxide,
it produces some massive amount of nitric oxide,

2570
02:30:57.251 --> 02:31:02.190
your body.
So all of your muscles become incredibly painful.
Like just,

2571
02:31:02.191 --> 02:31:06.730
just massive agony.
Like think of like your whole body just,

2572
02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:11.740
just red lined all the time and your Dick,
your dicks,
hard as fuck.
And it breaks.

2573
02:31:11.741 --> 02:31:12.574
It breaks your Dick

2574
02:31:12.900 --> 02:31:16.910
<v 2>so you don't orgasm like no during this scan</v>

2575
02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:19.970
<v 0>me.
Maybe if you stuck your finger up your ass while I was going down,
he</v>

2576
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:22.530
<v 2>might be able to pull something off.
It's not make,
it wouldn't be happy.</v>

2577
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:27.660
Wouldn't be happy coming.
There'll be the last one.
Yeah,
the uh,
that's fucked up.

2578
02:31:27.661 --> 02:31:29.970
What's that thing called?
It's called the Brazilian wandering spider.

2579
02:31:29.971 --> 02:31:32.790
And so these pharmaceutical companies are trying to figure out how to make that

2580
02:31:32.791 --> 02:31:36.420
the new like supervised Agora had to take.
Not that they need it,

2581
02:31:36.421 --> 02:31:38.670
like doesn't Viagara work,
can't they just move on?

2582
02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:42.960
And the reason is just like they want to have something that's new,
you know,

2583
02:31:42.961 --> 02:31:46.650
it's like there's competing forces like there's Viagara than their Cialis came

2584
02:31:46.651 --> 02:31:48.560
along.
We last longer and then you know,

2585
02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:51.120
there's other ones that we don't give you as much of a headache and then there's

2586
02:31:51.121 --> 02:31:53.880
this one and that one and they're always trying to find some new one,

2587
02:31:53.881 --> 02:31:57.640
but they're trying to figure out a way to use this evil fucking murderer,

2588
02:31:57.641 --> 02:32:01.260
spiders,
venom and get your Dick hard with it.
It's like that old,

2589
02:32:01.350 --> 02:32:05.180
it's like that old leary joke about cocaine or crack and he's like,
oh wait,

2590
02:32:05.250 --> 02:32:08.430
this is the only country where cocaine wouldn't be fast enough.

2591
02:32:08.860 --> 02:32:11.400
Somebody needed something faster.
But that's how it is with those,

2592
02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:12.960
with those penis drugs,

2593
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:17.490
it's like how much fucking stronger and faster does this need to get?

2594
02:32:17.491 --> 02:32:21.900
How much harder does that your Dick need to be?
It's an unnatural.
Yeah.

2595
02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:25.350
Erection.
I don't mean just because it's caused a naturally,
I mean,

2596
02:32:25.860 --> 02:32:29.820
the type of erection you get from it is fucking a natural.
Great.

2597
02:32:29.821 --> 02:32:33.240
You know when it's also,
have you found that like you've saved,

2598
02:32:33.241 --> 02:32:36.780
they found that they've isolated components in plants that can give you that.

2599
02:32:36.990 --> 02:32:40.460
What else is out there?
Is there something out there that makes kids grow taller?

2600
02:32:40.470 --> 02:32:42.540
Is there something out there that cures autism?

2601
02:32:42.541 --> 02:32:44.970
Is there something out there that makes your hair grow back?

2602
02:32:44.970 --> 02:32:47.010
Because there's something out there that,
you know,
there's,

2603
02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:51.750
there's so many hundreds of thousands of plants that are undiscovered.
I mean,

2604
02:32:51.751 --> 02:32:55.170
there's just areas where they just don't go.
There's people don't get to,

2605
02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:59.220
the density of the rain forest is just so incredible.
I'm,
I'm,

2606
02:32:59.270 --> 02:33:01.830
I'm absolutely amazed that this spider,

2607
02:33:01.831 --> 02:33:06.270
the wandering spider can do this to you and scientists are forget like that.

2608
02:33:06.271 --> 02:33:09.600
It's even stronger than Viagra.
But like that,
scientists are like,

2609
02:33:09.601 --> 02:33:13.830
let's fuck with that.
Let's see what we can get out of it.
You know what I mean?

2610
02:33:13.831 --> 02:33:17.970
Like it's just,
no,
leave that thing alone.
It's the worst thing in the world.

2611
02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:19.650
Leave it alone.
Don't try to,

2612
02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:22.620
unless you're going to try to make some kind of bio weapon with it.

2613
02:33:22.621 --> 02:33:27.050
You know what I mean?
Like leave it the fuck alone.
That's one of the worst.
Um,

2614
02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:29.910
apparently one of the worst things you can ever get.

2615
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:33.360
One of the most toxic venoms that a,
they've ever discovered.

2616
02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:37.200
A lot of people die from it too.
It sounds horrible,
but a terrible world.

2617
02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:40.080
That's one of the things I don't like about the west coast is like there's a

2618
02:33:40.290 --> 02:33:43.680
much higher concentration of like poisonous spiders and shit out here.

2619
02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:45.600
That was never a thing on the east coast,

2620
02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:49.200
but I felt like I had a black widow in my house one day and it was just like,

2621
02:33:49.201 --> 02:33:50.280
what the fuck?

2622
02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:55.080
Twice now in my house I've killed spiders that have like clear spots on their

2623
02:33:55.081 --> 02:33:58.980
tail or not tail,
but you know what I mean?
The buck part,
whatever that's called.

2624
02:33:59.190 --> 02:34:02.370
What's that?
One of them was a fucking black widow.

2625
02:34:02.371 --> 02:34:06.660
It had a big fucking dot on its back red big red thing.
And it was red or white.

2626
02:34:06.661 --> 02:34:10.020
I can't remember which black widow,
which the black widow is.
But whatever it is,

2627
02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:13.020
it was that.
Yeah,
they fuck with,
I mean they don't fuck with you.

2628
02:34:13.021 --> 02:34:16.830
You have to like get near them and scare them for them to sting you,

2629
02:34:16.831 --> 02:34:18.250
but their goddamn everywhere out here.

2630
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:22.150
<v 3>Yeah.
Oh Dude.
Black widows are all over the place.
My back porch is literally,</v>

2631
02:34:22.330 --> 02:34:25.860
you can find 20 of them and just sitting down there everywhere there's,

2632
02:34:25.870 --> 02:34:29.080
I have so much trees and spiderwebs and what sucks is that night I'll go out and

2633
02:34:29.081 --> 02:34:34.030
have a cigarette and I've walked through so many spider webs that I'm surprised

2634
02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:37.040
that I,
do you ever get bit by one?
I probably I had on,

2635
02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:40.140
I have to have isn't a black widow like very poisonous.

2636
02:34:40.141 --> 02:34:42.970
I think the brown widow is,
I don't know.

2637
02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.700
I know one of them is more poisonous than the other.

2638
02:34:45.850 --> 02:34:50.560
I met my ex girlfriend's dog actually died from getting bitten by one of the

2639
02:34:50.561 --> 02:34:53.690
weaknesses question,
well we don't have to go to the bathroom on this show.

2640
02:34:55.420 --> 02:34:56.650
We'll talk about phones while you're gone.

2641
02:34:56.980 --> 02:34:59.440
As you're talking about the hardest Dick of all time.

2642
02:34:59.490 --> 02:35:02.260
I have like I'm special gender almost straight jack off for now.
Yeah.

2643
02:35:02.330 --> 02:35:04.030
I got to think he has look at them.
I'm just excited.

2644
02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:06.680
Going to Jack off to alleviate anxiety.
Did you uh,

2645
02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:10.030
check out the new iPhones and the new watch and all that stuff?
Yeah,

2646
02:35:10.031 --> 02:35:11.310
they look pretty cool.
Did you hear about them?

2647
02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:15.530
<v 0>The macworld staff got,
almost all of them got laid off today.
They,</v>

2648
02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:16.380
they work,

2649
02:35:16.380 --> 02:35:20.780
they had to work like crazy covering the launch of the new phones and then
today,

2650
02:35:20.781 --> 02:35:25.781
like everybody got laid off the biggest apple news day of the year and they laid

2651
02:35:26.031 --> 02:35:28.040
off like almost the entire staff.

2652
02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:31.590
<v 3>Well it's so,
I mean that's,
that's ridiculous.</v>

2653
02:35:31.591 --> 02:35:35.000
But it's amazing that they even lasted this long,
right?

2654
02:35:35.220 --> 02:35:39.570
I mean cause it's a magazine.
Yeah.
I mean magazines are so pointless.

2655
02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:43.410
Today's Francis.
Yeah.
By the time you buy a Mac world right now,

2656
02:35:43.411 --> 02:35:45.030
it's not talking about the new iPhone.

2657
02:35:45.031 --> 02:35:47.650
It's not talking about all the news in the last month.
Even probably it's

2658
02:35:47.970 --> 02:35:51.450
<v 0>okay,
it's going away.
What they're saying is macworld Dotcom will still continue,</v>

2659
02:35:51.451 --> 02:35:56.280
but macworld print has gone to wow economic reality of running a print

2660
02:35:56.281 --> 02:35:58.890
publication.
You know what they should do?
Bring back silent movies.

2661
02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:01.830
Heard they're not going to come back.
Do you guys know how to make smoke signals?

2662
02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:05.910
Sell smokes.
Yeah,
they're going away.
Why is everybody sad?

2663
02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:09.620
It sucks that those folks lost their jobs,
but they should just translate.

2664
02:36:09.810 --> 02:36:13.730
What they should have done is just transitioned those writers into the Mac

2665
02:36:13.731 --> 02:36:15.580
world.com thing.
They should have worked on it.

2666
02:36:15.581 --> 02:36:19.080
If there were valuable employees and you know,
everybody's pissed off.

2667
02:36:19.170 --> 02:36:22.440
A lot of people were pissed off because they made these people work really hard

2668
02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:27.060
and go crazy too.
Um,
you know,
to,
to,

2669
02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:31.590
to launch this new product and to cover the launch and that,
uh,
you know,

2670
02:36:31.591 --> 02:36:34.200
these people at this grueling day of Marathon,

2671
02:36:34.201 --> 02:36:36.420
iPhone coverage and then they fired him

2672
02:36:37.850 --> 02:36:41.360
<v 3>there also were geeky in the fuck out of there.
I do.
We're at the apple event.</v>

2673
02:36:41.361 --> 02:36:44.300
This is so cool.
Let's take pictures and call it a job.
Yeah,

2674
02:36:44.301 --> 02:36:47.170
there's always going to be a little of that,
right?
It's going to be a little,
uh,

2675
02:36:47.210 --> 02:36:50.970
what I find interesting is the new,
uh,
payment plans that,

2676
02:36:50.971 --> 02:36:54.380
that they're introducing with this new iPhone where you're pretty much not going

2677
02:36:54.381 --> 02:36:57.640
to have a credit card anymore.
You're not going to have your bank cards anymore.

2678
02:36:57.740 --> 02:36:59.630
You're just waving your phones and it's,

2679
02:36:59.631 --> 02:37:03.830
it's sending out a unique number to the cash register.

2680
02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:07.700
It's almost like how bitcoins are where it's,
it's,
it's interesting,

2681
02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:10.290
but it does it have to work where,
um,

2682
02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:13.580
the people at the cash register have to have a device to pick it up?

2683
02:37:13.581 --> 02:37:16.030
Is that what it is?
But when you have that already

2684
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.050
<v 2>for androids four.
Okay.</v>

2685
02:37:17.230 --> 02:37:21.150
<v 3>No,
I don't know.
But,
but before the launch,
they,
uh,
they,</v>

2686
02:37:21.151 --> 02:37:24.850
apple is working with all the biggest like credit card companies like,
you know,

2687
02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:29.700
chase and capital one and all that.
So a lot of big stores already have it.

2688
02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:34.950
Um,
I know like there is versions of it that's existed already.
Like,

2689
02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:37.650
and I pay at Starbucks,
I use my phone,
you know,
but it's,

2690
02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:39.960
this is inside the phone.

2691
02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:44.340
I think it's called near frequency NFS or something like that where it sends out

2692
02:37:44.341 --> 02:37:45.350
a signal.
It's actually,
yeah,

2693
02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:50.080
<v 2>like a little local radio based.
I wonder like if it has a limit,</v>

2694
02:37:50.140 --> 02:37:51.700
could you buy a car like that?

2695
02:37:51.701 --> 02:37:53.620
Did you go to a Ford dealership and pick up a month?

2696
02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:58.010
<v 3>Your credit card?
You're a Amex,
American express black or whatever you have,</v>

2697
02:37:58.040 --> 02:37:58.710
you know,
have,

2698
02:37:58.710 --> 02:38:00.690
<v 2>wow.
You would have it on your phone.</v>

2699
02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:03.850
That would be dope as fuck to buy a car with your phone.
Yeah.

2700
02:38:04.170 --> 02:38:06.150
I don't even know why I want to buy a car with my phone,

2701
02:38:06.930 --> 02:38:09.810
but I want to buy a car with my phone.
But it seems so ridiculous.

2702
02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:15.150
So there are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches is the new iPhones.
It's graduations.

2703
02:38:15.151 --> 02:38:17.450
You finally caught up fucking idiots here.

2704
02:38:17.470 --> 02:38:20.210
Should have done that a million years ago.
Jesus Christ there.

2705
02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:23.880
They're fucking iPads.
They've advanced the sync technology,

2706
02:38:23.881 --> 02:38:27.380
which is nice with that.
Like pass it off feature.
Put that back up to the front.

2707
02:38:27.390 --> 02:38:31.950
Yeah.
I'm going to try to find a better,
uh,
the,
this is the 4.7 inch.
This is what?

2708
02:38:31.951 --> 02:38:34.950
Four inches?
The five inches,
four inches.

2709
02:38:35.250 --> 02:38:39.540
And I have a Samsung Galaxy s five,
which is only a,

2710
02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:44.070
it's five inches.
That's 5.5.
I believe.
That's fucking giant.

2711
02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:48.810
That's as big as what I had.
I used to have the note,
which was like five,

2712
02:38:48.811 --> 02:38:53.460
seven I think.
Yeah,
somewhere on then I think the galaxies five,

2713
02:38:53.461 --> 02:38:57.750
five or five.
Three.
It's bigger than the new iPhone.
I did a comparison.

2714
02:38:57.780 --> 02:39:02.460
The galaxies bigger the note or the galaxy s five.
Well,

2715
02:39:02.490 --> 02:39:05.700
the galaxy is bigger than the regular iPhone six.

2716
02:39:05.701 --> 02:39:08.670
The iPhone six extra large or whatever the fuck it's called.

2717
02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:13.410
Deluxe I think is either the same size as the galaxy are a little bigger.

2718
02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:16.560
Put that up again so I get to it.
Yeah.
I'm trying to find a better ones,

2719
02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:21.620
but I did a side by side with the regular new iPhone six in the galaxy s five.

2720
02:39:22.170 --> 02:39:23.760
Well,
the good thing about the big one,

2721
02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.060
he said it's supposed to have two hours more battery life.
Yeah.

2722
02:39:27.061 --> 02:39:30.360
That battery's way better for some reason on other fuckers,

2723
02:39:30.361 --> 02:39:31.680
they always catch up with the big ones.

2724
02:39:31.930 --> 02:39:36.660
But you know they've been saying this for every fucking iPhone that comes out.

2725
02:39:36.661 --> 02:39:39.270
They go the batteries better now and it's no it's not.

2726
02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:41.730
It's never been better once it is better,

2727
02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:46.760
the issue is that you have more need for juice because you have four g LTE and

2728
02:39:48.270 --> 02:39:53.220
three g and Wifi and all that stuff.
Things are more intensive.

2729
02:39:53.221 --> 02:39:57.390
Like programs,
games,
they just use more juice.
So the batteries are better,

2730
02:39:57.540 --> 02:39:59.280
but it depends on what you're using them for.

2731
02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:02.850
But they never break it down like that.
They always go like this new one.

2732
02:40:02.851 --> 02:40:07.440
They go this new battery,
11 hours of video watching time.
It's like,
yeah,

2733
02:40:07.441 --> 02:40:11.480
no that's what you said the last two phones and it's never that.
Yeah.

2734
02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:12.960
And then when you complain they go,

2735
02:40:12.990 --> 02:40:17.990
well see cause you're your Bluetooth fuck you follow apple.

2736
02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:19.800
There's a lot of reasons.

2737
02:40:19.810 --> 02:40:23.040
One of the biggest reasons is if you don't have good service in your house and

2738
02:40:23.041 --> 02:40:25.400
it's always searching for signals and stuff like that.

2739
02:40:25.410 --> 02:40:29.580
Wifi and all that stuff is the thing that drains you out because you will have

2740
02:40:29.581 --> 02:40:31.980
your Wifi on your phone and then you'll go to Chili's.

2741
02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:34.350
And so the whole time it's like trying to search for Wifi.

2742
02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:37.380
You don't even realize it.
It says draining your battery.
It's,
it's,

2743
02:40:37.381 --> 02:40:38.280
it's amazing what,

2744
02:40:38.281 --> 02:40:42.600
just simple like turning on to airplane mode or does to your,

2745
02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:47.320
you know,
or turn off Wifi,
turning off Bluetooth,
turning off,
you know,

2746
02:40:48.030 --> 02:40:51.510
turn off four G,
right?
Yeah.
She's three g.
That's dumb.

2747
02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:58.810
It's terrible.
If you try to go online with three g now you're so spoiled.
Yeah.

2748
02:40:58.811 --> 02:41:02.280
I bring my friend Aubrey has a Tesla.
It's fucking dope.

2749
02:41:02.340 --> 02:41:05.640
It's the most ridiculous car.
Those,
those crazy electric cars.

2750
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:09.940
And is this the phone?
Yeah,
he has a crazy electric car and they're not,

2751
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.410
we're not sure on that.
Where we get pulled over,
we now know this is just for us.

2752
02:41:13.411 --> 02:41:15.600
Yeah.
Um,
his,
uh,
Tesla,

2753
02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:20.310
his car has us giant screen man.
This huge screen.

2754
02:41:20.311 --> 02:41:23.130
It's like a laptop,
like a bigger than a laptop.

2755
02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.010
It's like an Imac that's in the middle of the console.

2756
02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:28.230
And that's where everything is.
It doesn't have any buttons.

2757
02:41:28.410 --> 02:41:31.020
Everything is all touch screen on this thing and you talk to it.

2758
02:41:31.290 --> 02:41:32.310
Like he could say,

2759
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:37.230
play Joe Derosa comedy and it'll go to Spotify and it'll go,
why

2760
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:42.640
don't you to come over there and hug you?

2761
02:41:44.470 --> 02:41:48.300
Like we were in the car and he said,
uh,
came,
come up with a,
you know,

2762
02:41:48.301 --> 02:41:52.380
say anything.
I go arctic monkeys.
So he goes,
play Arctic monkeys.
It goes,

2763
02:41:52.410 --> 02:41:53.670
finds it on Spotify,

2764
02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:56.850
brings up a list of songs he presses play and starts playing in Arctic monkeys

2765
02:41:56.851 --> 02:42:01.200
song,
but it's three g and I was like,
where's the four g bitch?
You ain't got it.

2766
02:42:01.410 --> 02:42:03.060
No.
Four g up in his mother fuckers.

2767
02:42:03.061 --> 02:42:07.940
And that's no g three G is like slow three G's.
No.
Gee,
here's Lizza.

2768
02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:11.430
Here's the,
it's talking about the new camera that's in the,
in the iPhone.

2769
02:42:11.431 --> 02:42:14.580
But here's interesting a here they do payment thing.
Check us out.

2770
02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:20.270
We're introducing apple pay fast mobile payments.

2771
02:42:20.541 --> 02:42:23.340
I don't think this pay thing is a great idea.
I think it's awesome.

2772
02:42:23.341 --> 02:42:26.640
And you can pay with your Dick because if you use your thumb finger,

2773
02:42:26.641 --> 02:42:27.451
thumb recognition,

2774
02:42:27.451 --> 02:42:31.290
you could use your deck for their Dick Recognition and find that unique pattern

2775
02:42:31.291 --> 02:42:34.980
on your skin of your cock.
And then he'd get buy things with your cock.
Listen,

2776
02:42:35.050 --> 02:42:38.140
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's not hear me.
No,
I heard Ya.

2777
02:42:38.490 --> 02:42:40.560
I've been rubbing my dick on my phone for years

2778
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:48.600
now,
but I don't think it's bad about it.
I remember years ago Burgos uh,

2779
02:42:48.660 --> 02:42:51.360
he goes,
they're moving in all the foam though.

2780
02:42:51.390 --> 02:42:53.070
They're moving it all the fucking phone.

2781
02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:58.470
And then the second the government decides they want to shut you down.
Boom,

2782
02:42:58.471 --> 02:43:02.340
you're done.
Cause it's all on the trip and it's happening now.
I used to be like,

2783
02:43:02.341 --> 02:43:05.790
you're nuts.
What are you talking about?
And now it's finally happening.

2784
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:09.720
It's like your life is on that fucking phone,
your life.

2785
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:11.710
But you choose to put your life that phone.
I mean,

2786
02:43:11.711 --> 02:43:14.680
there's a lot of things on that phone,
but you know,
if you want,

2787
02:43:14.710 --> 02:43:17.350
you can do whatever you want,
man.
You don't have to jump along.

2788
02:43:17.470 --> 02:43:20.830
You could be that guy that lives up in fucking big bear.

2789
02:43:20.831 --> 02:43:24.280
You've got a cabin somewhere and you your chop your own wood and you've got a

2790
02:43:24.281 --> 02:43:26.160
water.
Well that you get all your wall.

2791
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:28.150
You could be that guy if you really want it to.

2792
02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:31.630
You just have to move towards that.
You gotta jump along dude,
jump along.

2793
02:43:31.690 --> 02:43:34.750
You gotta you said you don't have to jump along.
You gotta jump along.

2794
02:43:35.170 --> 02:43:39.850
Do you want to watch,
look at the watch?
No,
fucking retake it.
I think it's stupid.

2795
02:43:39.851 --> 02:43:43.150
I think it's,
if it catches on like the iPhone did it,
everyone has it.

2796
02:43:43.151 --> 02:43:47.490
It's going to make so much more sense because being able to just go like to your

2797
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:50.860
wrist and be like,
get me directions,
you know,
talk to your wrist or,

2798
02:43:51.130 --> 02:43:55.090
or there's also does interesting technology and it would,
that's a,

2799
02:43:55.330 --> 02:43:59.500
if you have a phone on Joe or if you have a wrist on and you're in my contacts,

2800
02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:03.010
I can send you private messages just to your,
you're like,
hey,

2801
02:44:03.070 --> 02:44:04.780
check out the chick going through the door right now.

2802
02:44:04.830 --> 02:44:08.020
You or send you a like a quick drawing of something.

2803
02:44:08.530 --> 02:44:10.660
Only you would have to use it for creeping on people.

2804
02:44:10.690 --> 02:44:12.130
It won't be suspicious at all.

2805
02:44:12.250 --> 02:44:15.580
As you're staring at your watch and your lips are moving.

2806
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:19.570
I like that other girl works with a winder thing.

2807
02:44:19.571 --> 02:44:23.140
Like it doesn't have a touch screen.
The winder thing is how they use it.

2808
02:44:23.170 --> 02:44:27.740
That little thing is a handle.
The knob on the side is uh,

2809
02:44:28.090 --> 02:44:30.910
it's going to be interesting though because it seems like that's,
you know,

2810
02:44:30.970 --> 02:44:35.970
could cause also problems if you hit it and he sings a phone call fucking

2811
02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:41.860
working for directions to the moon.
Directions on your wrist that are tiny.

2812
02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:45.310
It does.
It just doesn't seem convenient to me.
That seems goofy.

2813
02:44:45.370 --> 02:44:49.410
But it's like the,
um,
the heart rate monitor thing is,

2814
02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:51.820
it's got different bands.
It's got three different models.

2815
02:44:51.821 --> 02:44:54.970
There's actually a gold one,
which is grammar to me,

2816
02:44:55.180 --> 02:44:57.610
maybe even over thousands of dollars.

2817
02:44:58.650 --> 02:45:03.490
And they have a sport edition,
which is like a rubber,

2818
02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:07.090
like more show me the diamond crusted one for rappers.

2819
02:45:07.780 --> 02:45:10.780
Is there a diamond crusted one for rappers?
Not yet.

2820
02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:13.780
I'm going to get into that business tomorrow.
We call my accountant.

2821
02:45:14.140 --> 02:45:17.170
Put all the money and the diamonds and watches.
Yeah.
I don't know man.

2822
02:45:17.171 --> 02:45:21.190
I just think it's just kind of pointless.

2823
02:45:21.220 --> 02:45:24.010
Like I love how they use it.
English got to sell it.
You know why?

2824
02:45:24.011 --> 02:45:26.980
Because you can't use a guy from New York check out this goal.
In addition,

2825
02:45:27.350 --> 02:45:31.600
tastes have developed to be up to twice as hard.
The standard gold,

2826
02:45:32.340 --> 02:45:36.030
the developed to be up to twice as hard as a standard gold.
You can't have it.

2827
02:45:36.220 --> 02:45:39.130
Nobody would trust him.
She had a guy from another land,

2828
02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:41.410
well maybe they're different in this other land called England.

2829
02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:46.000
I want here one of them sell this product.
It sounds much more respectable.

2830
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:51.430
I see that knob breaking a lot.
That's the next broken iPhone is broken.

2831
02:45:51.431 --> 02:45:55.980
Nonstop working.
Yeah,
could be.
I mean the one thing about Apolis,

2832
02:45:55.990 --> 02:46:00.610
they're pretty good about testing shit pretty rigorously before they release it.

2833
02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:04.900
I guess the biggest problem is seven.
But the biggest problem is,

2834
02:46:04.901 --> 02:46:08.260
is that the battery they're not happy with because right now it's supposedly,

2835
02:46:08.261 --> 02:46:10.640
it's rumored the lasts about a day

2836
02:46:10.910 --> 02:46:14.900
<v 4>and they want it,
you know,
days.
Right?
And when they say a day,</v>

2837
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:17.390
does that mean a day with you using it?
Right.

2838
02:46:17.450 --> 02:46:20.760
Or a day with a regular normal person.
It was a job using it.
Yeah.
Now,

2839
02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:24.770
and they say a day on the iPhones too,
and it's nowhere fucking near it.

2840
02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:28.250
I'm going to make the best point than anybody.

2841
02:46:28.490 --> 02:46:33.440
It's impossible has made about this.
Okay.
Right now on this show,
okay,

2842
02:46:34.310 --> 02:46:35.690
here's why that's a dumb idea.

2843
02:46:36.050 --> 02:46:41.050
The new iPhone has a significantly bigger screen for a fucking reason.

2844
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:44.870
This is a completely tiny,

2845
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:48.590
completely inconvenient screen.
Who the fuck wants that?

2846
02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:53.540
Everybody wants a device that's easier to use.
And I don't see how this is this,

2847
02:46:53.541 --> 02:46:56.690
just like when they did the Ipod Nano and they tried to put it all on the screen

2848
02:46:56.691 --> 02:47:01.280
and it was too fucking small.
Tell you why.
Because this is as easy as it is.

2849
02:47:01.530 --> 02:47:04.400
Uh,
you have your phone in your pocket.
You're talking to somebody,

2850
02:47:04.970 --> 02:47:08.810
you have a little vibrate on your hand.
You look down just calling me.
Oh No.

2851
02:47:08.820 --> 02:47:10.520
You're always a vibrate in your pocket.
No,
no.

2852
02:47:10.521 --> 02:47:11.740
Just the vibrant in your hands Kinda.

2853
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:14.270
It's got it has you got to turn out on both.
If you want

2854
02:47:14.430 --> 02:47:16.890
<v 2>what the girl's giving you a hand job and you feel your Dick Vibrate and then</v>

2855
02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:20.340
she starts looking at arrest and she wants to stop.
That'll be annoying.

2856
02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:23.350
Somebody else's texting are cock block and you mean this is what I'm talking

2857
02:47:23.351 --> 02:47:27.650
about.
Nobody thinks ahead.
I'm thinking ahead.
We had a time.

2858
02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:33.400
Yeah,
we got five minutes.
Oh,
okay.
Joe Derosa.
This was fun.
It was this about six,

2859
02:47:33.401 --> 02:47:36.120
