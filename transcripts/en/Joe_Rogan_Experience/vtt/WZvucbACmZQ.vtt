<v Speaker 2>martial artists,</v>

15
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:28.100
<v Speaker 2>a former UFC fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

16
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.093
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 2>kept me many times.</v>

18
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

19
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

20
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 2>you work at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

21
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 2>University of Portland State,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland state.</v>

22
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work Portland state,</v>

23
00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:45.220
<v Speaker 2>teach philosophy there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're also a guy who is your,</v>

24
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 2>you described as an atheism advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not just an atheist,</v>

25
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 2>but someone who actively promotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

26
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 2>you should probably try this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

27
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I promote critical thinking and reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>and rationality and I,</v>

28
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 2>and the two go together.</v>

29
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that naturally leads to to </v>

30
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 2>atheism if people are honest with </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

31
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

32
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned rory.</v>

33
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.223
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been a longtime martial arts my </v>

34
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 2>whole life actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

35
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 2>What did you start off with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fantasy based martial arts?</v>

36
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 2>The bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like which ones?</v>

37
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did everything.</v>

38
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried Kempo I tried,</v>

39
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.683
<v Speaker 2>I literally tried if you were to put all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the emotional arts together that </v>

40
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 2>don't work and put them into one suite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried them,</v>

41
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.323
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Campos got some good striking </v>

42
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 2>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't have a,</v>

43
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 2>an overall comprehensive system to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with grappling.</v>

44
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried [inaudible] I tried taekwondo.</v>

45
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

46
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 2>I tried tai cheese so I tried them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I actually,</v>

47
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 2>one of my turning points was when Ron </v>
<v Speaker 2>van Cleef,</v>

48
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.730
<v Speaker 2>who was in the original UFC as early </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC,</v>

49
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 2>he was in like ufc three or four or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that early on.</v>

50
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 2>And he was like in his fifties he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>older.</v>

51
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 2>He's in still in very good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

52
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.753
<v Speaker 2>he liked competed in a tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a karate tournament I think deep into </v>

53
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 2>his sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

54
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I trained with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Ron and I trained with this guy,</v>

55
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:12.254
<v Speaker 2>she on Hector Santiago who was quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and I trained with them for </v>

56
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:15.834
<v Speaker 2>years in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when Ron van cleef got taken down </v>

57
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 2>and just dominated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a huge moment for me.</v>

58
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 2>That was then I then that started me on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole other path.</v>

59
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 2>And then I trained with Greg Jackson for</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico.</v>

60
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Will you in New Mexico?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 2>W having there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've trained,</v>

62
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I started in New York City before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC came,</v>

63
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.803
<v Speaker 2>came along and I trained there and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained in New Mexico and now I train </v>

64
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 2>with Matt Thornton from straight blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

65
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.253
<v Speaker 2>his John Calvin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ours coach who's obviously conor </v>

66
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Nelson's that's,</v>

67
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:49.694
<v Speaker 2>that's a great lineage man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you saw Ron van cleave get dominated </v>

68
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 2>by hoists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gracie?</v>

69
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fairly easily.</v>

70
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of interesting watch like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy</v>

71
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 3>who is this ledge really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really well respected in the karate.</v>

72
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.600
<v Speaker 3>We're whole legend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legend.</v>

73
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 3>Smoked like a beginner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 3>And I saw those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I saw Hector Santiago fight in real</v>

75
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:12.514
<v Speaker 3>life and he is a very dangerous person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saw him fight like in a street </v>

76
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 3>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I used to live in the lower east side</v>

77
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:21.690
<v Speaker 3>between a and B and a d.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

78
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 3>so all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was just part of my,</v>

79
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.283
<v Speaker 3>my experience and I thought a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff was real and it just turned </v>

80
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:31.110
<v Speaker 3>out to be fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just turned out to be make-believe.</v>

81
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's an interesting parallel.</v>

82
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.983
<v Speaker 3>When we were talking before the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about critical thinking </v>

83
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 3>and Brazilian Jujitsu and martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>

84
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 3>and there are a lot of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>very distorted ideas of many things,</v>

85
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 3>not just of their ability to handle </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves physically,</v>

86
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 3>but just of the world in general.</v>

87
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 3>And I think martial arts sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>highlights a lot of that curriculum,</v>

88
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 3>those critical thinking issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

89
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:57.844
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the reasons that I was so </v>

90
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 3>excited to come on this podcast today is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think you are ideally situated</v>

91
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 3>to have it have that conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me because Jujitsu,</v>

92
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically alive in his training,</v>

93
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 3>training against resisting opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't talk about,</v>

94
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 3>this is a huge area that nobody is </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

95
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 3>We can understand all of reason and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationality through Jujitsu,</v>

96
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.383
<v Speaker 3>through corrective mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through aligning your beliefs with </v>

97
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean little things from,</v>

98
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>testing ideas yourself,</v>

99
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:33.541
<v Speaker 3>not having to take it on faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just talking to 'em as talking to uh,</v>

100
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

101
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 3>cause the name eludes me now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

102
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's something Chris </v>
<v Speaker 3>harder I think is super good guy.</v>

103
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Great Guy.</v>

104
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

105
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 3>There's something in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

106
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 3>so you've been tapped thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

107
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

108
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.273
<v Speaker 3>probably if I counted them all up yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been tapped to do something about </v>

109
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.833
<v Speaker 3>the type of person who would either if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you frame it in terms of subjecting </v>

110
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.024
<v Speaker 3>yourself to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about that that's </v>

111
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally differentiates us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

112
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 3>from people in fantasy based martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>arts.</v>

113
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.643
<v Speaker 3>It develops a kind of character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>develops a kind of attitude when you </v>

114
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 3>placed yourself in situations and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>tapped.</v>

115
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a type of a corrective mechanism.</v>

116
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.313
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is a corrective mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can help you align your beliefs with </v>

117
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

118
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:27.244
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to explore that with you today </v>

119
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 3>and talk about what that means just in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the case that some people might not know</v>

120
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:34.380
<v Speaker 3>what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We mean by tap is submit.</v>

121
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do Jujitsu,</v>

122
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 3>I believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to,</v>

123
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I assume that people know what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

124
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.800
<v Speaker 3>but I've talked to people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

125
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 3>what is Jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you doing?</v>

126
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Submission?</v>

127
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has a Jujitsu is one style of it,</v>

128
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's all about using leverage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique,</v>

129
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.123
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>against joints or chokes against </v>

130
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.120
<v Speaker 3>arteries like choke holds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

131
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 2>to cut off the blood to your brain or </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck cranks.</v>

132
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.640
<v Speaker 2>And when you train Jujitsu as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>other martial arts other than wrestling,</v>

133
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 2>which I consider martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go full speed on that.</v>

134
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go 100%.</v>

135
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.013
<v Speaker 2>And that's the difference between those </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts and striking based martial </v>

136
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:15.794
<v Speaker 2>arts where you really shouldn't go 100% </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you only have so many punches </v>

137
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>your head can take before your body just</v>
<v Speaker 2>stops working.</v>

138
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 2>That's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could train sparring hard for,</v>

139
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of years,</v>

140
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:31.650
<v Speaker 2>but you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>

141
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 2>you're mind is going to turn into mush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just no doubt about it.</v>

142
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.000
<v Speaker 2>We know that for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people do Jujitsu into their sixties</v>

143
00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 2>and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

144
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Well Anthony Bordain didn't even start </v>
<v Speaker 2>until he was 58 and he's obsessed.</v>

145
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.603
<v Speaker 2>He trains every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes sometimes twice a day I'll take </v>

146
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>a private in the morning and then he'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>train in a group class after that.</v>

147
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 2>He's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

148
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.143
<v Speaker 2>but the difference being like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely know what works and doesn't </v>

149
00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:58.130
<v Speaker 2>work and you absolutely know how good </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are.</v>

150
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 2>So if we rolled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't fake it.</v>

151
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we rolled 20 times and you tapped me </v>

152
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:03.870
<v Speaker 2>18 of those 20 times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

153
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 2>and if someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good is Peter?</v>

154
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he taps me most of the time.</v>

155
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.090
<v Speaker 2>And then we know we have no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>

156
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 2>you sit in that case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

157
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.193
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

158
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 2>We know it's clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

159
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't fake it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no pretending.</v>

160
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.433
<v Speaker 2>There's no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know like bowing rituals and </v>

161
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:21.704
<v Speaker 2>masters and all this nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those structures I think are put </v>

162
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:25.754
<v Speaker 2>in place to conceal the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>paucity of the effectiveness of the </v>

163
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 2>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people come up with this.</v>

164
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.943
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing about that that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is so important is that all of </v>

165
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:38.294
<v Speaker 2>these combat based martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been waiting for this conversation </v>

166
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 2>for all of those combat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these combat based martial arts.</v>

167
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned wrestling.</v>

168
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.803
<v Speaker 2>We know it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know there are some things we just </v>

169
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 2>know that they work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know the kickboxing works.</v>

170
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 2>We also know that it's head trauma for </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>

171
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.603
<v Speaker 2>We know that Moitai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in my opinion and insane </v>

172
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 2>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know that it works.</v>

173
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 2>We know that Western boxing works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that Jujitsu works,</v>

174
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 2>so the reason that we know we can test </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

175
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:09.914
<v Speaker 2>we can take people and hopefully later </v>
<v Speaker 2>on we'll talk about the difference </v>

176
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 2>between Brazilian Jujitsu and Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

177
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same techniques,</v>

178
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 2>different pedagogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different training method.</v>

179
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a $2 word for training method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can take that.</v>

180
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:23.743
<v Speaker 2>We can adjudicate these things because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we take two people of equal weight and </v>

181
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:27.434
<v Speaker 2>we stick them in a cage and we have some</v>
<v Speaker 2>very basic rules and also for your </v>

182
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 2>listeners who aren't from there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mma gloves are very thin.</v>

183
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people who don't understand mma,</v>

184
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:38.900
<v Speaker 2>they think that they're kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing gloves.</v>

185
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.853
<v Speaker 2>They are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very thin gloves that they don't afford </v>

186
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:42.944
<v Speaker 2>much protection at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really led the person punch you harder </v>

187
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 2>so they don't have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking their hand.</v>

188
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 2>But as far as like cushion to your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your head,</v>

189
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not a cushioning.</v>

190
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

191
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>so we can look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can judge what works.</v>

192
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 3>And the one of the ways that we do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is to people same size,</v>

193
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 3>put them in a cage and we see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>

194
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is that when you train </v>
<v Speaker 3>against a resisting opponent,</v>

195
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:10.851
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is the key,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can figure out what's real.</v>

196
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a corrective mechanism.</v>

197
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 3>It's a way for you to discern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make,</v>

198
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 3>believe land and reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit,</v>

199
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.513
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

200
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 3>w what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what works and what doesn't work.</v>

201
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 3>And once we start introducing that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems like,</v>

202
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that I said to you,</v>

203
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

204
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I've come up with this technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

205
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 3>I know this is going to sound crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's incredibly effective.</v>

206
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 3>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

207
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:38.670
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pinky blitz creek.</v>

208
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.470
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot like they're gonna use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I said this,</v>

209
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

210
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 3>attacking with pink.</v>

211
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:43.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

212
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a certain,</v>

213
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:46.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stance and I do this right.</v>

214
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come Bantus stance where,</v>

215
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 3>and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

216
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 3>And so you call up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unbeknownst to me,</v>

217
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 3>you call up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

218
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:54.294
<v Speaker 3>like I heard her show you're buddies </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Eddie Bravo right now he's called </v>

219
00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:57.784
<v Speaker 3>me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

220
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 3>we got this guy in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says that he has this technique,</v>

221
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 3>p picky blitzkrieg I'm going to send </v>
<v Speaker 3>them over there,</v>

222
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 3>put them up against your good purple </v>
<v Speaker 3>belt,</v>

223
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 3>getting on video and we'll see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

224
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a way to test it now.</v>

225
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Speaker 3>Now if that works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

226
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't,</v>

227
00:10:14.431 --> 00:10:15.590
<v Speaker 3>this is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we,</v>

228
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 3>nobody ever thought of the pinky </v>
<v Speaker 3>blitzkrieg it's incredible.</v>

229
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.573
<v Speaker 3>But what you've done there is you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a core component of critical </v>

230
00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:25.164
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a willingness to revise your </v>

231
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:27.624
<v Speaker 3>beliefs.</v>

232
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.703
<v Speaker 3>It may sound like bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're completely open to the </v>

233
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:32.544
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this works against a resisting </v>

234
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:34.591
<v Speaker 3>opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

235
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 3>So let's say that I tap out his tap out </v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

236
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>purple belts,</v>

237
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:40.201
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

238
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:41.034
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown belt.</v>

239
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.003
<v Speaker 3>At some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be so absurd that you'd think </v>

240
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 3>that Eddie and I were in on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

241
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never rolled them,</v>

242
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 3>never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He'd call someone else,</v>

243
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.053
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you can test it so you can </v>

244
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:52.374
<v Speaker 3>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually you can test it with your </v>

245
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:54.204
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this idea of testability and people </v>

246
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:57.144
<v Speaker 3>can figure out things for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to go on the history of </v>

247
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 3>the tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

248
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:01.224
<v Speaker 3>some guy punched a bull in the head or </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a blind nun walking through </v>

249
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:04.554
<v Speaker 3>this and she killed all these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's when we always had to deal </v>

250
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:07.104
<v Speaker 3>with that was that was the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts was always muscle yama and </v>

251
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.090
<v Speaker 3>killed a bull with a banshee.</v>

252
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 3>We always hear about Maslow Yama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was this?</v>

253
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Was He kilkee Shin or I think it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>coke cushion.</v>

254
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So his lineage,</v>

255
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember,</v>

256
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:19.853
<v Speaker 3>but he was a famous Japanese guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently had killed a bull right </v>

257
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 3>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>

258
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that,</v>

259
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.130
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

260
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 3>that comes down as legends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when people said,</v>

261
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:28.801
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

262
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 3>how do you know this works?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why should do it?</v>

263
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy killed a bull.</v>

264
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you see the bull did,</v>

265
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:35.590
<v Speaker 3>did you see it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

266
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.523
<v Speaker 3>so it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fable and the fable takes on a </v>

267
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:41.030
<v Speaker 3>life of its own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

268
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.123
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genius about the ultimate fighting </v>

269
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 3>challenge was then you had a way to test</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>

270
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.833
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can literally watch these things </v>

271
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 3>unfold against people of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in</v>

272
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.813
<v Speaker 2>the early ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your people have different weight </v>

273
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:56.764
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had the sumo wrestler and the </v>

274
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

275
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.463
<v Speaker 2>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an opportunity for you to figure </v>

276
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 2>out what was real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

277
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 2>And there's something that's incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>appealing to that.</v>

278
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Like think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about Kata,</v>

279
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking waste of time.</v>

280
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Like not only is it a waste of time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of let's say what Kata is,</v>

281
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to go.</v>

282
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:24.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

283
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:25.354
<v Speaker 2>we'll their forms and what a form as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a pattern of movement that </v>

284
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everyone does.</v>

285
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 2>You'd get one when you get your white </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt,</v>

286
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.160
<v Speaker 2>you practice that and you get really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at it.</v>

287
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 2>You do it for a task to get your yellow </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt.</v>

288
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 2>And in a lot of traditional martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>

289
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:39.800
<v Speaker 2>that is part of how you test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

290
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:40.634
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my black belt in taekwondo and I </v>

291
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:47.611
<v Speaker 2>had to remember all those goofy moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they never came into play ever.</v>

292
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 2>When I competed they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were no sort of nonsense.</v>

293
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 2>It was a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I did get my black,</v>

294
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.320
<v Speaker 2>I forgot all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely remember it.</v>

295
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.203
<v Speaker 2>It's a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'd argue it's even worse than a </v>

296
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 2>waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it were just a waste of time,</v>

297
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have been staring at a wall,</v>

298
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.160
<v Speaker 2>but you thought that you were doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to help you achieve a goal and</v>

299
00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:12.994
<v Speaker 2>the goal was to win a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you thought you were engaged in </v>

300
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Speaker 2>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the whole,</v>

301
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 2>there's no resisting opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when there's no resisting opponent,</v>

302
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not a tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not testable.</v>

303
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 2>You can't bring the tools of science </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

304
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

305
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 2>so you thought you were engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity that brought you closer to your</v>

306
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 2>desired objectives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't.</v>

307
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Here's the argument against that though.</v>

308
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.773
<v Speaker 2>The what it does do is it helps your </v>
<v Speaker 2>precision movement and you could argue </v>

309
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.223
<v Speaker 2>that learning how to execute these </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns in a very beautiful way shows </v>

310
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:52.330
<v Speaker 2>control and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it shows precision movement.</v>

311
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 2>They aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with it is that there's some</v>

312
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:57.790
<v Speaker 2>of those movements that are completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>ineffective like double knife,</v>

313
00:13:57.791 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 2>hand block or thrusts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knife hand thrusts is,</v>

314
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.470
<v Speaker 2>there's movements that are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the not applicable to mma.</v>

315
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.573
<v Speaker 2>But the concept behind it is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that a lot of really good </v>

316
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts like Carlos condit or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even conor mcgregor are doing.</v>

317
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 2>They're doing a lot of like movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

318
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.833
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I don't think Kata is the best </v>

319
00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:20.970
<v Speaker 2>way to achieve those kinds of goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

320
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:21.933
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's something to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>said for not just martial arts </v>

321
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 2>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other things as well.</v>

322
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:32.521
<v Speaker 2>Like Yoga I think is extremely effective</v>
<v Speaker 2>in enhancing your ability to,</v>

323
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.503
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to control and manage your body in the </v>

324
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.223
<v Speaker 2>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

325
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.460
<v Speaker 2>She's a weird strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're on the same page.</v>

326
00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:43.120
<v Speaker 2>So think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd offer a constructive way to think of</v>

327
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:45.730
<v Speaker 2>it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you just said,</v>

328
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.773
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to just use basketballs </v>

329
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.983
<v Speaker 2>stamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a ball and a net and black eyes </v>

330
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.530
<v Speaker 2>and then that's</v>

331
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.410
<v Speaker 3>the court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

332
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm like guys,</v>

333
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.383
<v Speaker 3>when when you think about basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you just described was a guy on a </v>

334
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 3>court practicing a lay up over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

335
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I think a layup is like when you bounce </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and you shoot,</v>

336
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 3>you don't know the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about basketball.</v>

337
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like your run up to the fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you run,</v>

338
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 3>throw the ball and then whole and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody gets crazy.</v>

339
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But think about,</v>

340
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.110
<v Speaker 3>don't think about caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

341
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.193
<v Speaker 3>so I think thinking about caught to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a layup in terms of precision is the </v>

342
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:22.700
<v Speaker 3>wrong way to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it.</v>

343
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Think about Catia as a layup without a </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball.</v>

344
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Think about the practice of basketball </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice,</v>

345
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote a basketball without a </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball.</v>

346
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.361
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

347
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about shadow boxing?</v>

348
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.453
<v Speaker 3>Shadow boxing is extremely effective and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shadow boxing in a sense is a form of </v>

349
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Kata shadow boxing and w including not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just boxing but kicking and punching and</v>

350
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 3>needing is a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long excepted.</v>

351
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Excellent form of training and </v>
<v Speaker 3>visualization.</v>

352
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

353
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.880
<v Speaker 3>so one of the things that shadow boxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do,</v>

354
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.010
<v Speaker 3>you can warm up was shadow boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>

355
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.760
<v Speaker 3>when I woke up in Git and just to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>upfront,</v>

356
00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:05.594
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suck.</v>

357
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing it for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not very good.</v>

358
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I just felt or I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blue Belt.</v>

359
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not how long you've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

360
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm tell you it'd be ambassador.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me since 1999 how dare you,</v>

361
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.850
<v Speaker 3>you're still a blue belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

362
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 3>how often do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well only once a week if I'm lucky.</v>

363
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.793
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

364
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.290
<v Speaker 3>You gotta go Anthony Bourdain's tag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to get obsessed.</v>

365
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't have a lot of </v>

366
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:26.954
<v Speaker 3>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a family that I pushed </v>

367
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:29.414
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a work career and I have either </v>

368
00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 3>you have a life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a life.</v>

369
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking people with their lives.</v>

370
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know I'm not,</v>

371
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not speaking about it from any kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like,</v>

372
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an expert in this.</v>

373
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.743
<v Speaker 3>I understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what's interesting about </v>

374
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:46.390
<v Speaker 3>this is the philosophical implications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like,</v>

375
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.383
<v Speaker 3>like when I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to warm up with another body to </v>

376
00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:50.480
<v Speaker 3>slow roll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

377
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 3>I like to just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because then I have an opponent.</v>

378
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.940
<v Speaker 3>If you're practicing something over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again,</v>

379
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.030
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that is there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrective mechanism.</v>

380
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.983
<v Speaker 3>You could be doing the technique </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorrectly and then when you actually </v>

381
00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:03.554
<v Speaker 3>go to execute it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've had a body memory for that </v>

382
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:07.880
<v Speaker 3>technique that hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been,</v>

383
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.773
<v Speaker 3>that's taking you away from your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean with striking you mean mean </v>

384
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 3>shadowbox and when you use these samples</v>
<v Speaker 3>shadowboxing,</v>

385
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 3>just so you're saying with shadow boxing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>

386
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 3>you need another body in order for it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be effective.</v>

387
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that like,</v>

388
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.270
<v Speaker 3>so let's say that you shadow box a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hammer punch.</v>

389
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so stuff that doesn't work like Catia,</v>

390
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:28.450
<v Speaker 3>things like double knife hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

391
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.353
<v Speaker 3>even if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you a shadowbox jabs and crosses and </v>

392
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.180
<v Speaker 3>upper cuts and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you do that,</v>

393
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.003
<v Speaker 3>if you could not be doing it correctly </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you'd be practicing the wrong </v>

394
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:46.460
<v Speaker 3>thing over and over again and that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>take you away from your goal.</v>

395
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.353
<v Speaker 3>That's why you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have some kind of a </v>

396
00:17:48.771 --> 00:17:50.370
<v Speaker 3>resisting opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Resisting</v>

397
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.540
<v Speaker 2>opponents are the corrective mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>for everything and just as the,</v>

398
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 2>they're the correct of mechanisms in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical domain.</v>

399
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.943
<v Speaker 2>Did the corrective mechanisms in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive and intellectual domains as </v>

400
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why prayer is so insidious.</v>

401
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.793
<v Speaker 2>It's because people think that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing something that's in their </v>

402
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:10.080
<v Speaker 2>own wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing something that's good,</v>

403
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.153
<v Speaker 2>but they're just talking to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is some aspects and I would </v>

404
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:17.560
<v Speaker 2>agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I would,</v>

405
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't like labels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a real hard time with labels,</v>

406
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:21.264
<v Speaker 2>even labels for things that I think are </v>
<v Speaker 2>good things like I think that some </v>

407
00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:33.480
<v Speaker 2>people get a lot out of prayer and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily because they're praying to a</v>

408
00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:34.314
<v Speaker 2>nonexistent deity or they really truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that if they wish for a new car </v>

409
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:39.354
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the mind when focused </v>

410
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:48.760
<v Speaker 2>on positive thinking and and and focused</v>
<v Speaker 2>on love and focused on that,</v>

411
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.673
<v Speaker 2>the tenants of Christianity let go of </v>
<v Speaker 2>God godly behavior and compassion and </v>

412
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:55.854
<v Speaker 2>all these different things and you truly</v>
<v Speaker 2>are looking out for your fellow man and </v>

413
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:00.270
<v Speaker 2>wanting to be a good person.</v>

414
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 2>All those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is merit in that.</v>

415
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

416
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:08.250
<v Speaker 2>you can certainly find benefit in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a tool for mental management.</v>

417
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.113
<v Speaker 2>I mean does that mean there's a guy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the clouds with a harp and all that </v>

418
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:12.120
<v Speaker 2>jazz?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course not,</v>

419
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.560
<v Speaker 2>but I think that it's in a sense like </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Tai Chi.</v>

420
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.733
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a guy thinks that he's going to take </v>

421
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Tai Chee only and get into the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

422
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get fucked up.</v>

423
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 2>But if a guy in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like conor mcgregor for instance,</v>

424
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 2>who's so concentrated on movement really</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets involved in Tai Chi,</v>

425
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.513
<v Speaker 2>I think he would probably get at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>some benefit out of it because in that </v>

426
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:41.150
<v Speaker 2>slow moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this like rhythmic pattern,</v>

427
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:42.323
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is you're exercising </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body in an unusual way and </v>

428
00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 2>expanding the possibilities of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your,</v>

429
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your interactions with opponents,</v>

430
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:53.850
<v Speaker 2>expanding what your body can and can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

431
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.683
<v Speaker 2>And I think yoga does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of different </v>

432
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:57.850
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need that.</v>

433
00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.260
<v Speaker 2>There are about 20 really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you just said.</v>

434
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.930
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to kind of unpack those </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>

435
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.853
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you talk about you to take a look </v>

436
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 2>at prayer and what people think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing,</v>

437
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 2>and then let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why you're the perfect person is</v>

438
00:20:13.771 --> 00:20:15.370
<v Speaker 2>talking to this about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

439
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.500
<v Speaker 2>then compare that to a martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit,</v>

440
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Tai Chi is a good example.</v>

441
00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:22.404
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people think that they're going </v>

442
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 2>towards a certain end winning fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly,</v>

443
00:20:27.751 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about now anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly some people that teach Tai</v>

444
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Chi and even practice Tai Chi that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing it for their health.</v>

445
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad is one of those people,</v>

446
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.180
<v Speaker 2>so he has zero ambitions to win a fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>with anybody.</v>

447
00:20:39.181 --> 00:20:43.080
<v Speaker 2>He's in his late seventies so if </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody says that,</v>

448
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem with that at all and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's true in Mo motion</v>

449
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.263
<v Speaker 3>would be better than non motion and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prom is exactly the same problem with </v>

450
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:55.030
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people are making objective claims,</v>

451
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:55.893
<v Speaker 3>they're making claims about the nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>of reality and I want to know what's </v>

452
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 3>true and we don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is that people,</v>

453
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:05.014
<v Speaker 3>every time you talk about faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the religion or have you people shut </v>

454
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 3>down or they have barriers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't need to talk about that.</v>

455
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.293
<v Speaker 3>All we need to do is talk about Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why this is so perfect because </v>

456
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 3>with Jujitsu you can figure things out </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself with,</v>

457
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 3>you can figure out what works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

458
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.970
<v Speaker 3>The pinky blitzkrieg you can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>what doesn't work.</v>

459
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:23.710
<v Speaker 3>You can figure out what you're capable </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

460
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.150
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I tap you,</v>

461
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.880
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you tap me out 20 times,</v>

462
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm under no illusions that the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

463
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:32.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could get lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

464
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 3>like I could get lucky against rory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could get lucky against Matt Thornton.</v>

465
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:38.950
<v Speaker 3>It's always possible I could get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's highly unlikely,</v>

466
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.173
<v Speaker 3>but I could get lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that if you look at the </v>

467
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:47.740
<v Speaker 3>way that people engage these rituals in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives,</v>

468
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:48.963
<v Speaker 3>what these people are doing is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think it's taking them towards an </v>

469
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:52.714
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly identical to fantasy based </v>

470
00:21:55.691 --> 00:21:56.524
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think it's taking them towards an </v>

471
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:00.550
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not right.</v>

472
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 3>I think also a parallel like in fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 3>based martial arts,</v>

473
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.060
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

474
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

475
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:10.324
<v Speaker 4>I did taekwondo for a long time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got really good at it and then </v>

476
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.030
<v Speaker 4>competed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

477
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.490
<v Speaker 4>I was essentially in a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

478
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although it's a beneficial called and it</v>

479
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:22.114
<v Speaker 4>helped me a lot and it made a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways and made me the person that I am </v>

480
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:25.114
<v Speaker 4>today because in training and doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>really difficult things and competing </v>

481
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:31.540
<v Speaker 4>and overcoming nerves and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

482
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:33.610
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of benefit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then,</v>

483
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.533
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a distorted perception of reality </v>

484
00:22:36.641 --> 00:22:39.160
<v Speaker 4>because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that distorted perception of reality</v>

485
00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:42.040
<v Speaker 4>was shattered once I started boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

486
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 4>And I realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

487
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:45.700
<v Speaker 4>I was getting punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>

488
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:48.460
<v Speaker 4>I thought I knew how to fight when </v>
<v Speaker 4>really I just knew how to do taekwondo.</v>

489
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.323
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I had to learn all the other </v>

490
00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:51.880
<v Speaker 4>aspects of martial arts.</v>

491
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the most sobering moments of</v>
<v Speaker 4>my life was when I,</v>

492
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 4>I trained at Carlson Gracie's in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

493
00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on Hawthorne,</v>

494
00:23:00.251 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 4>in Hollywood in 1996.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is before Vito Belfort made his</v>

495
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:07.150
<v Speaker 4>debut in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

496
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

497
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this long,</v>

498
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:10.744
<v Speaker 4>extensive history of competing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo tournament and I had kicked </v>

499
00:23:13.911 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 4>boxed and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

500
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 4>I'd done quite a bit of a boxing </v>
<v Speaker 4>training and a,</v>

501
00:23:18.851 --> 00:23:19.684
<v Speaker 4>I wrestled in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was pretty good martial </v>

502
00:23:21.311 --> 00:23:26.311
<v Speaker 4>artist and I just got fucking mall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like I had never exercised.</v>

503
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:28.684
<v Speaker 4>Like I had no idea what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just remember the feeling of </v>

504
00:23:31.721 --> 00:23:33.520
<v Speaker 4>helplessness and the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the,</v>

505
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of people mauled me,</v>

506
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.670
<v Speaker 4>but one of the guys at mauled me I'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>never forget,</v>

507
00:23:36.671 --> 00:23:40.360
<v Speaker 4>is this Brazilian kid who was a purple </v>
<v Speaker 4>belt who was basically my size.</v>

508
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:41.403
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't any bigger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he wasn't like some Super Mario </v>

509
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Sperry blackbelt guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

510
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

511
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.290
<v Speaker 2>was just some guy just beat the fuck out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of me.</v>

512
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.393
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's almost disdainfully and he was a </v>

513
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:51.860
<v Speaker 2>nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

514
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:52.694
<v Speaker 2>when he was training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was training really hard and he </v>

515
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 2>didn't give me any slack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just getting wrecked.</v>

516
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.460
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

517
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:00.830
<v Speaker 2>what a stupid illusion I was under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

518
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:01.400
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

519
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.310
<v Speaker 2>and so in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

520
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's a question we could talk </v>

521
00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:07.964
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know is it incumbent upon us to </v>

522
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.110
<v Speaker 2>help people out of these traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts?</v>

523
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Like I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a very similar experience.</v>

524
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 2>I trained in stick a knife fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

525
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:19.100
<v Speaker 2>That's why my hands cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

526
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Grima that's why my my hands have all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these cuts and are all married with real</v>

527
00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:24.320
<v Speaker 2>knives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real knives and sticks.</v>

528
00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:25.154
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the stuff with the dog brothers </v>

529
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:26.714
<v Speaker 2>and Dan Medina was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a black belt and stick a knife </v>

530
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:30.700
<v Speaker 2>fighting and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

531
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about black belts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sticking a knife.</v>

532
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

533
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:34.431
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

534
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:35.264
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a place where the bullets </v>

535
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:38.150
<v Speaker 2>are all gone and no one knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a gun,</v>

536
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bows and arrows haven't been invented.</v>

537
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Speaker 2>That's where I was going to go with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

538
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Where I was going to go with this is I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

539
00:24:43.971 --> 00:24:45.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I thought it was a pr like you,</v>

540
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was pretty good martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>artist.</v>

541
00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

542
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought a guy fight,</v>

543
00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 2>actually great Jackson with sticks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just beat the shit on them.</v>

544
00:24:57.171 --> 00:24:58.004
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I had a stick and I had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>training with the stick for like years </v>

545
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 2>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was just a huge wake up call from</v>

546
00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:07.710
<v Speaker 2>you guys fought like in the competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>we fought in like a fight fight and,</v>

547
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had only on fight fight.</v>

548
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 2>You were mad at each other?</v>

549
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like uh,</v>

550
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a party's arm to the submission.</v>

551
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not,</v>

552
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.160
<v Speaker 2>so it was a competition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>

553
00:25:19.161 --> 00:25:23.440
<v Speaker 2>it was at his old place and this is when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started training with him and we,</v>

554
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.493
<v Speaker 2>I think we put on like very light hockey</v>
<v Speaker 2>gear and I was just going to beat the </v>

555
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:29.200
<v Speaker 2>shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just going to,</v>

556
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.203
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was my goal cause he said he </v>

557
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:33.104
<v Speaker 2>based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was before I learned about a </v>

558
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 2>liveliness training and and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resisting.</v>

559
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the lifeness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

560
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:40.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's like Matt Thornton to me and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

561
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.510
<v Speaker 2>and it's a combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other discussion.</v>

562
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:45.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

563
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Speaker 2>timing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and motion,</v>

564
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:48.134
<v Speaker 2>resisting opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to figure out what's true and what </v>

565
00:25:50.451 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

566
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:53.054
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gets back to our discussion about </v>

567
00:25:55.281 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 2>shadow boxing and about training other </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

568
00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:58.693
<v Speaker 2>I had trained with a stick and I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>known all of these kind of basically </v>

569
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:01.543
<v Speaker 2>this caught to things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also trained against a willing </v>

570
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:07.090
<v Speaker 2>opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you watch these stick demos,</v>

571
00:26:07.091 --> 00:26:10.280
<v Speaker 2>the key to to look for is what the UK </v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

572
00:26:10.281 --> 00:26:11.390
<v Speaker 2>The feeder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

573
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.190
<v Speaker 2>it's not what the guy does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>UK,</v>

574
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a Japanese word for like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who's feeding in,</v>

575
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:17.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

576
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:18.521
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

577
00:26:18.521 --> 00:26:21.760
<v Speaker 2>so the guy who is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do this and that people,</v>

578
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.390
<v Speaker 2>most of the people are listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

579
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like probably 90%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though a lot of watching it.</v>

580
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.273
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're demonstrating for those who </v>

581
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:31.460
<v Speaker 2>are listening is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

582
00:26:31.461 --> 00:26:32.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these live,</v>

583
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.793
<v Speaker 2>these drills that you do where someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>will pretend to throw a punch gifts so </v>

584
00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:39.560
<v Speaker 2>the person will step aside and do their </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter attack and it looks awesome.</v>

585
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:41.800
<v Speaker 2>So the UK guy has it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got We in taekwondo,</v>

586
00:26:41.801 --> 00:26:43.350
<v Speaker 2>he used to call it the one steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

587
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>The one steps.</v>

588
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

589
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.003
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great example of a fantasy based </v>

590
00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:51.690
<v Speaker 3>martial art because it makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it brings you further from reality.</v>

591
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.810
<v Speaker 3>It makes you think you can do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you simply cannot do.</v>

592
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.183
<v Speaker 3>So what you need to do in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances is you need to watch the </v>

593
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:01.890
<v Speaker 3>feed or the person who's giving the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reverse punch.</v>

594
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:03.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like punched that comes off of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

595
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:04.344
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to be caught a punch that </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes off of your ribs and goes out and </v>

596
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.580
<v Speaker 3>they almost never hit somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

597
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 3>if you watched the Steven Seagal when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>got his black belt as a famous black and</v>

598
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:18.900
<v Speaker 3>white video that's out there and Jamie </v>
<v Speaker 3>can link to it,</v>

599
00:27:18.901 --> 00:27:19.840
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

600
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 3>it looks awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's bullshit.</v>

601
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 3>It's all choreographed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kido.</v>

602
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

603
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.693
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the key deliverable I think in this </v>

604
00:27:29.401 --> 00:27:30.234
<v Speaker 3>call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those in this conversation is </v>

605
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 3>that whether it's shadow boxing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Kata or whether it's taking</v>

606
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 3>a knife and doing a drill.</v>

607
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.210
<v Speaker 3>When I used to do those train with </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticks,</v>

608
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.370
<v Speaker 3>I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>

609
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.400
<v Speaker 3>But I always knew the angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was fantasy based.</v>

610
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.850
<v Speaker 3>If you took the angle out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just get beaten to death.</v>

611
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean peeps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

612
00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:49.243
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by angle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like in disrobed or scream or there </v>

613
00:27:51.901 --> 00:27:56.480
<v Speaker 3>are 12 angles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes 99 it goes like 75 degrees,</v>

614
00:27:56.481 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 3>35 degrees the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baseball swing,</v>

615
00:27:58.411 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 3>reverse baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swing,</v>

616
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.770
<v Speaker 3>stab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overhand stab,</v>

617
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 3>tack to the knees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack to the other needs.</v>

618
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.140
<v Speaker 3>So when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do those,</v>

619
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 3>when you train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys just do the numbers one,</v>

620
00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three and you know,</v>

621
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 3>you get so good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's pretty crazy.</v>

622
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:16.620
<v Speaker 3>I can show your stuff here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

623
00:28:16.621 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like if I know the angle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks awesome.</v>

624
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.640
<v Speaker 3>I've seen guys do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks pretty bad ass,</v>

625
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.793
<v Speaker 3>but it's bullshit.</v>

626
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.533
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fantasy based martial arts because </v>

627
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:29.400
<v Speaker 3>the opponent isn't resisting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a resisting opponent.</v>

628
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.413
<v Speaker 3>But here's the deliverable for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation I think is that if you </v>

629
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.950
<v Speaker 3>train in a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absent to corrective mechanism,</v>

630
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 3>but you think that corrective mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 3>is an actual corrective mechanism.</v>

631
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.013
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you're training in a way that </v>

632
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:45.084
<v Speaker 3>will bring you closer to reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're becoming further from </v>

633
00:28:47.701 --> 00:28:52.140
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What that does is that takes that,</v>

634
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.800
<v Speaker 3>that's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's devastating because you need that</v>

635
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:56.634
<v Speaker 3>corrective mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to bring your thoughts in </v>

636
00:28:58.561 --> 00:28:59.394
<v Speaker 3>alignment with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the great thing about the </v>

637
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:06.510
<v Speaker 3>UFC is because now we have all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and we can see what works.</v>

638
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.130
<v Speaker 3>So think about the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know I,</v>

639
00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.780
<v Speaker 3>I listened to your show that he bravo </v>
<v Speaker 3>are I think,</v>

640
00:29:12.781 --> 00:29:13.321
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

641
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:17.900
<v Speaker 3>he was just practicing the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rear naked on his leg from,</v>

642
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:18.773
<v Speaker 3>well that's not gonna work because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no corrective mechanism because </v>

643
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:21.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you understand what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

644
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.033
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was exercising his squeeze on his </v>

645
00:29:24.811 --> 00:29:25.770
<v Speaker 3>leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still does it.</v>

646
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.200
<v Speaker 3>And it's because one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

647
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:29.034
<v Speaker 3>about finishing a technique is how hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>can you squeeze and how long can you </v>

648
00:29:33.391 --> 00:29:34.224
<v Speaker 3>squeeze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what Eddie does is he'll do this </v>

649
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if we're watching TV together,</v>

650
00:29:37.051 --> 00:29:38.580
<v Speaker 3>he'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He puts his knee up.</v>

651
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:39.414
<v Speaker 3>If we're watching the fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who put his knee up like this and he'll </v>

652
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>rear naked,</v>

653
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.873
<v Speaker 2>choke his own knee and just squeeze it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he's doing is he's working on </v>

654
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:47.104
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>squeeze and it's not thinking that </v>

655
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:53.770
<v Speaker 2>that's going to make him get to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>position where he can squeeze someone.</v>

656
00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.673
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the or against a live resisting </v>

657
00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:57.160
<v Speaker 2>opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

658
00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 2>it's an exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

659
00:29:58.391 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 2>So that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

660
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.560
<v Speaker 2>if the idea then is that we'll work on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your squeeze,</v>

661
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 2>then that's different from thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

662
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 2>that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

663
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.530
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I train,</v>

664
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.463
<v Speaker 2>if you practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about like practicing shadow </v>

665
00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:13.960
<v Speaker 2>boxing and you're to use your example </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your hook is always,</v>

666
00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:14.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wide,</v>

667
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.890
<v Speaker 2>you stand here and then when you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a fight,</v>

668
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 2>if you deal with a resisting opponent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do that,</v>

669
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:21.664
<v Speaker 2>so you would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have gone down a path to make </v>

670
00:30:23.711 --> 00:30:26.020
<v Speaker 2>you worse than are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's assuming that you're doing it</v>

671
00:30:26.021 --> 00:30:26.800
<v Speaker 2>incorrectly.</v>

672
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.633
<v Speaker 2>If you train correctly and you learn the</v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques correctly and then you apply </v>

673
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:34.150
<v Speaker 2>them in your shadow box and correctly </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to benefit.</v>

674
00:30:34.151 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

675
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.240
<v Speaker 2>So that's the question that the question</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

676
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:38.723
<v Speaker 2>and I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great thing about this conversation </v>

677
00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:42.490
<v Speaker 2>is that we can test this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

678
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the ultimate we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have people we have,</v>

679
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.433
<v Speaker 2>so for that we need to look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only big word I think we need here </v>

680
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:53.740
<v Speaker 2>today is pedagogy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at the training method,</v>

681
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:55.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a big word for training method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even need pedagogy.</v>

682
00:30:55.791 --> 00:30:56.624
<v Speaker 2>Just say training method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we look at the training method and </v>

683
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.850
<v Speaker 2>what I think you would need for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually I guess here's my question</v>

684
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:08.851
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be better in your mind to train</v>

685
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:09.783
<v Speaker 2>shadowboxing or to do some light boxing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with guys with focus middle over there </v>

686
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:19.190
<v Speaker 2>at guys holding up focus Mitts at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same speed that you were shadowboxing?</v>

687
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 2>This is where I think the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going on,</v>

688
00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that it's better.</v>

689
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 2>All those things have their merits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shadowboxing has its merit.</v>

690
00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Yoga has its merit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga is not going to teach you how to be</v>

691
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:32.314
<v Speaker 2>a a better fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you learn all the techniques of </v>

692
00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and you incorporate yoga into </v>
<v Speaker 2>your training,</v>

693
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.680
<v Speaker 2>it will likely elevate your Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

694
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.533
<v Speaker 2>I have absolutely no question that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true and I think that that goes </v>

695
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:46.170
<v Speaker 2>along with shadow boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

696
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.013
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a striker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a striker and you don't </v>

697
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.123
<v Speaker 2>shadowbox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're doing yourself a </v>

698
00:31:51.221 --> 00:31:52.054
<v Speaker 2>disservice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is a benefit to a </v>

699
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Speaker 2>visualization and to movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And two,</v>

700
00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.563
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's things that happen when you </v>

701
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:02.750
<v Speaker 2>throw combinations in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

702
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:07.830
<v Speaker 2>as far as you are dexterity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with kicking and your ability</v>

703
00:32:07.991 --> 00:32:12.991
<v Speaker 2>to even do combinations without any </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance or without anybody,</v>

704
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

705
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.120
<v Speaker 2>trying to counter you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

706
00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:19.930
<v Speaker 2>there's benefit in stringing together </v>
<v Speaker 2>those reps,</v>

707
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.260
<v Speaker 2>those repetitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

708
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

709
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:26.140
<v Speaker 2>So I think there is a benefit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think so sometimes if I,</v>

710
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 2>if I go in to straight blast and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody on the mat,</v>

711
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:30.933
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to roll with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes what I'll do is I'll just go </v>

712
00:32:32.801 --> 00:32:35.470
<v Speaker 2>through the motions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll do roles or I'll do go over my</v>

713
00:32:35.471 --> 00:32:37.210
<v Speaker 2>back shoulder or I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

714
00:32:37.211 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 2>fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's</v>

715
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.590
<v Speaker 3>merit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's merit to that in that,</v>

716
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I already know how to do it.</v>

717
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.323
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure sure that I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve on it without any question at </v>

718
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:52.004
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is so like your example of yoga is a </v>

719
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 3>really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's certainly true that you can</v>

720
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 3>use muscles and yoga that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and another activity.</v>

721
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 3>And I think that those have benefits to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mma.</v>

722
00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:06.884
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they have benefits to a lot of </v>

723
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:08.871
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

724
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:12.800
<v Speaker 3>so the not just the flexibility aspect </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the body maintenance,</v>

725
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:15.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of good things to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

726
00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:18.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably should,</v>

727
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:19.244
<v Speaker 3>but if I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd just spend that hour and doing </v>

728
00:33:19.941 --> 00:33:20.774
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu to be blunt with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that you can get things out </v>

729
00:33:24.261 --> 00:33:27.050
<v Speaker 3>of yoga and get things out of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>other activities,</v>

730
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:31.430
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be conscious about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why you're doing these things and</v>

731
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.520
<v Speaker 3>the way to get better ultimately like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

732
00:33:34.521 --> 00:33:37.400
<v Speaker 3>so you could shadow box at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

733
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

734
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.950
<v Speaker 3>I guess I think we can think about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

735
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the layup example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

736
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:47.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily the lay the ball is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the corrective mechanism with the layup.</v>

737
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.270
<v Speaker 3>The person is the corrective mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the fight.</v>

738
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.403
<v Speaker 3>And as long as somebody knows what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing and their training in a </v>

739
00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:56.570
<v Speaker 3>certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily that shadowboxing,</v>

740
00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 3>we'll take one away from one school if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's being practiced correctly.</v>

741
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I think Carta would take one away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>one school,</v>

742
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 3>but I think that the whole project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you think about,</v>

743
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.490
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I think the shadow boxing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is such a good example of this.</v>

744
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:17.800
<v Speaker 3>What is it that that w okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when someone's shadow boxes,</v>

745
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:18.643
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point is to warm up that </v>

746
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.920
<v Speaker 3>accomplishes that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do that with squats to right.</v>

747
00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Speaker 3>And someone or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do that in any one of a number</v>

748
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:26.840
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at me like you're lost.</v>

749
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.733
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

750
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.370
<v Speaker 4>that was all in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

751
00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.270
<v Speaker 4>I just ain't got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>

752
00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.820
<v Speaker 4>I got that look like we're just talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

753
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.251
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

754
00:34:41.251 --> 00:34:42.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm just listening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

755
00:34:42.661 --> 00:34:44.640
<v Speaker 4>Well if you think I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think I'm off track,</v>

756
00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:45.900
<v Speaker 4>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

757
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.790
<v Speaker 4>you might be a little off track.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

758
00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:50.723
<v Speaker 4>in that I think you think there's very </v>
<v Speaker 4>little benefit and a lot of these </v>

759
00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:56.820
<v Speaker 4>activities that I think a aren't primary</v>
<v Speaker 4>activities.</v>

760
00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:57.601
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

761
00:34:57.601 --> 00:34:59.400
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted to break it down to what </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the only,</v>

762
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.600
<v Speaker 4>see there's just this broad range of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things you can do,</v>

763
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.590
<v Speaker 4>you could do to improve all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletic endeavors.</v>

764
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:08.663
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe you should do any strength and </v>

765
00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:11.184
<v Speaker 4>conditioning training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should just do technique and you </v>

766
00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:14.844
<v Speaker 4>should just do sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that go that </v>

767
00:35:17.101 --> 00:35:19.080
<v Speaker 4>route.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's other people that think</v>

768
00:35:19.081 --> 00:35:21.420
<v Speaker 4>that's absolutely foolish you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>primary like,</v>

769
00:35:21.421 --> 00:35:24.060
<v Speaker 4>especially once you learn the skills you</v>
<v Speaker 4>should,</v>

770
00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:24.923
<v Speaker 4>if you're competing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should focus primarily on strength </v>

771
00:35:27.361 --> 00:35:28.194
<v Speaker 4>and conditioning because really it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just about burning your body out and </v>

772
00:35:30.781 --> 00:35:34.650
<v Speaker 4>reaching an incredibly high level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cardio so that when you compete,</v>

773
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.573
<v Speaker 4>you know all these techniques already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will now a gas tank that's superior </v>

774
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:40.770
<v Speaker 4>to your opponents and that will lead to </v>
<v Speaker 4>victory.</v>

775
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.220
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of modalities and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of schools of thought.</v>

776
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.190
<v Speaker 4>Can we talk for a sec?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we talk about that for a sec?</v>

777
00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:48.900
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's interesting to me.</v>

778
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:52.590
<v Speaker 4>I see guys who come in who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

779
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.483
<v Speaker 4>who are just super strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think to a certain extent we need </v>

780
00:35:57.541 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 4>to be careful because strength,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

781
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm not speaking from experience so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much,</v>

782
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:02.664
<v Speaker 4>I'm speaking of just conceptually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a tendency for strong </v>

783
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 4>guys or big guys to overlay upon their </v>
<v Speaker 4>strengths or size small man Jiu Jitsu is</v>

784
00:36:11.311 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 4>the best to just tell people if they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about learning.</v>

785
00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:17.340
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu learned from a little person </v>
<v Speaker 4>because little guys,</v>

786
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boiler Gracie or even Eddie Bravo before</v>

787
00:36:20.281 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 4>he started lifting weights that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite a bit bigger now,</v>

788
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.260
<v Speaker 4>but Eddie was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

789
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.370
<v Speaker 4>150 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>140 pounds.</v>

790
00:36:26.371 --> 00:36:28.980
<v Speaker 4>So what he was rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would always be rolling with big guys</v>

791
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:30.870
<v Speaker 4>and he had to rely on perfect technique.</v>

792
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.620
<v Speaker 4>Whereas a guy like Frank Mir,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a very large man,</v>

793
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.100
<v Speaker 4>has a lot of physical strength and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>rely on that.</v>

794
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

795
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.160
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tell him what you think.</v>

796
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:46.200
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that if somebody goes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>strong and they focus on that often that</v>

797
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:49.050
<v Speaker 4>that can come at the expense of learning</v>
<v Speaker 4>techniques?</v>

798
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:49.591
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can.</v>

799
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:50.424
<v Speaker 4>But here's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the concept of strength and </v>

800
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:52.440
<v Speaker 4>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people think,</v>

801
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.330
<v Speaker 4>oh well you're doing squats and dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifts.</v>

802
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.600
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good example is a guy I've had on this</v>

803
00:36:57.601 --> 00:36:59.600
<v Speaker 4>podcast before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His name is Nick Khorsandi,</v>

804
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:00.463
<v Speaker 4>Trans Hofeld Osan Joe see trains a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russell and providing the cough was a </v>

805
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.030
<v Speaker 4>frame famous boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of world class athletes.</v>

806
00:37:06.031 --> 00:37:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Joe Schilling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a glory to shirt,</v>

807
00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:10.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm wearing a one of their uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>best fighters,</v>

808
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.603
<v Speaker 4>excellent kickboxer world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he's doing is his strength and </v>

809
00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:15.870
<v Speaker 4>conditioning program.</v>

810
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:20.870
<v Speaker 4>He trained under Marvin Marinovich and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nick does a lot of plyometric exercises,</v>

811
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:22.074
<v Speaker 4>a lot of sprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of box jumps and all these really </v>

812
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:25.764
<v Speaker 4>unorthodox techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is to improve your ability </v>

813
00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:29.874
<v Speaker 4>to execute things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>improve your ability to close the </v>

814
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:32.874
<v Speaker 4>distance and includes your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>improve your ability to get out of the </v>

815
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 4>way and prove your ability to maintain a</v>
<v Speaker 4>high workload through the rounds.</v>

816
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you can only throw,</v>

817
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say 50 kicks in,</v>

818
00:37:44.101 --> 00:37:44.934
<v Speaker 4>around before you get exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you can improve that through </v>

819
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 4>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strength and conditioning,</v>

820
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.733
<v Speaker 4>make it 75 or 80,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a significant </v>

821
00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:54.480
<v Speaker 4>advantage over the pace that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>push on your opponent.</v>

822
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.190
<v Speaker 4>And that is in his opinion and many </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people's opinion.</v>

823
00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:00.024
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a really open debate right now </v>

824
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:06.300
<v Speaker 4>in the world of martial arts because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>has not been solved because it relies on</v>

825
00:38:06.301 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 4>so many variables.</v>

826
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.680
<v Speaker 4>It relies on the athlete themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their mental fortitude,</v>

827
00:38:10.681 --> 00:38:13.150
<v Speaker 4>their dedication to their craft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

828
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.153
<v Speaker 4>how good is their technique in the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>place before they embark on a trunk </v>

829
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.293
<v Speaker 4>strength and conditioning program?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many variables I think to </v>

830
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:22.650
<v Speaker 4>unbox all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

831
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.690
<v Speaker 4>and to make it a little bit easier for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are going,</v>

832
00:38:24.691 --> 00:38:25.524
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we're saying is there's a lot of </v>

833
00:38:28.141 --> 00:38:33.141
<v Speaker 4>people that have distorted ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality itself and a method for exposing</v>

834
00:38:36.311 --> 00:38:37.144
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like this sort of dogmatic </v>

835
00:38:43.931 --> 00:38:44.764
<v Speaker 4>religious thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is ultimately accepted by all the </v>

836
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:50.320
<v Speaker 4>people around you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but never,</v>

837
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.710
<v Speaker 4>never critically judged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

838
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 4>A really good method is Jujitsu and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the meaning,</v>

839
00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.613
<v Speaker 4>the reason why Jujitsu is such a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>method is because Jujitsu is one of the </v>

840
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:07.110
<v Speaker 4>few martial arts that you could practice</v>
<v Speaker 4>at any age and you could apply to.</v>

841
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.983
<v Speaker 4>And you could also watch those </v>
<v Speaker 4>techniques being applied by other </v>

842
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:11.471
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>

843
00:39:11.471 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gigit like yesterday I went to the Eddie</v>

844
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:14.883
<v Speaker 4>Bravo invitational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was at the orpheum theater in </v>

845
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:20.320
<v Speaker 4>downtown La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the best Jujitsu fighters in the</v>

846
00:39:20.321 --> 00:39:21.580
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going at it.</v>

847
00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was really amazing to watch.</v>

848
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:25.550
<v Speaker 4>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was a,</v>

849
00:39:25.551 --> 00:39:26.384
<v Speaker 4>a crowd filled with thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are fans of Jujitsu and </v>

850
00:39:29.021 --> 00:39:31.570
<v Speaker 4>practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was really educated crowd.</v>

851
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:32.643
<v Speaker 4>And what was cool about that is we all </v>
<v Speaker 4>understood like when the guy got to a </v>

852
00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:37.240
<v Speaker 4>position like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

853
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:37.481
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

854
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:37.721
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

855
00:39:37.721 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

856
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:39.424
<v Speaker 4>the crowd would cheer when someone would</v>
<v Speaker 4>get out of a heel hook or they would </v>

857
00:39:42.071 --> 00:39:45.880
<v Speaker 4>cheer when a guy would be able to tap a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy with a rear naked choke.</v>

858
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.340
<v Speaker 4>And we were watching all these things </v>
<v Speaker 4>play out.</v>

859
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.173
<v Speaker 4>So there was lessons for me as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as someone who's not competing as </v>

860
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:53.764
<v Speaker 4>sitting in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've spent so much time doing </v>

861
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:58.900
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching this sort of,</v>

862
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.033
<v Speaker 4>these interactions take place in a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>logical truth seeking truth seeking </v>

863
00:40:04.841 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

864
00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.213
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

865
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.130
<v Speaker 4>when the techniques work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the techniques work.</v>

866
00:40:09.131 --> 00:40:09.964
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting is Brazilian Jujitsu </v>

867
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:17.830
<v Speaker 4>as it was first created,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a first sort of established came from</v>

868
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:20.950
<v Speaker 4>Japanese Jujitsu and Elio Gracie and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Carlos Gracie,</v>

869
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:22.023
<v Speaker 4>who were probably two of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>important people ever in the history of </v>

870
00:40:24.251 --> 00:40:26.020
<v Speaker 4>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

871
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.423
<v Speaker 4>they sort of manipulated those </v>
<v Speaker 4>techniques and improved upon them and </v>

872
00:40:30.881 --> 00:40:31.714
<v Speaker 4>made the art more about the submissions </v>
<v Speaker 4>than it was about the stand up and the </v>

873
00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.070
<v Speaker 4>bringing the fight to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in doing so,</v>

874
00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:41.920
<v Speaker 4>they established a series of techniques </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

875
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:42.773
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we refer to those techniques as the </v>

876
00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:44.734
<v Speaker 4>basics.</v>

877
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.133
<v Speaker 4>There are some people in that world that</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that the basics are all you need </v>

878
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.720
<v Speaker 4>and they don't accept the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>techniques.</v>

879
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:53.973
<v Speaker 4>And it's really fascinating because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's essentially how Jujitsu became </v>

880
00:40:57.161 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 4>effective in the first place is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the new techniques that were established</v>

881
00:41:00.971 --> 00:41:04.090
<v Speaker 4>by Carlos and Elio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gracie and all these different movements</v>

882
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:04.924
<v Speaker 4>like the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like learning how to do triangles off </v>

883
00:41:06.521 --> 00:41:07.690
<v Speaker 4>your back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different things,</v>

884
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:08.703
<v Speaker 4>which people had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the early UFC like Royce gracie </v>

885
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.280
<v Speaker 4>tapped out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dan severn,</v>

886
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is he doing?</v>

887
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.000
<v Speaker 4>He's got his legs wrapped around his </v>
<v Speaker 4>neck and his arm.</v>

888
00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:16.834
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Dan's about to go out and he </v>

889
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:20.230
<v Speaker 4>taps and everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

890
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:23.770
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well those were in our world,</v>

891
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:24.604
<v Speaker 4>completely new techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's a lot of new techniques </v>

892
00:41:26.861 --> 00:41:27.694
<v Speaker 4>that are constantly being established </v>
<v Speaker 4>now by these young innovative </v>

893
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:35.060
<v Speaker 4>practitioners and that some of the old </v>
<v Speaker 4>guard are ignoring.</v>

894
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:38.510
<v Speaker 4>And the real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that smart?</v>

895
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Do you just need the basics?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a hot debate right now.</v>

896
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:45.560
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this hot debate can be proven.</v>

897
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.020
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what I was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

898
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:51.320
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if as a result of this being proven,</v>

899
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.183
<v Speaker 4>somebody doesn't change their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the core piece that what's really </v>

900
00:41:58.101 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 4>important is belief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>revision,</v>

901
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.850
<v Speaker 4>critical thinking is all about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made a mistake.</v>

902
00:42:01.851 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 4>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought this,</v>

903
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:03.794
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

904
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.330
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made a mistake.</v>

905
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.193
<v Speaker 4>And so if they don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're somehow deficient in that </v>

906
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.860
<v Speaker 4>attitude and disposition of critical </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationality,</v>

907
00:42:12.861 --> 00:42:13.694
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

908
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 4>but it would seem to me if it could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrated,</v>

909
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.330
<v Speaker 4>people who want to seek the truth in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this case,</v>

910
00:42:20.331 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 4>they want to win against a resisting </v>
<v Speaker 4>opponent.</v>

911
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some would,</v>

912
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.810
<v Speaker 4>some would accept the data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but many haven't.</v>

913
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.780
<v Speaker 4>And my good friend Eddie Bravo is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect example of that.</v>

914
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.793
<v Speaker 4>I went with Eddie to Brazil in 2003 and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he competed in the world championships </v>

915
00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.030
<v Speaker 4>and he beat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

916
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.360
<v Speaker 4>Gustavo Dante,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a world champion at the time.</v>

917
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:39.194
<v Speaker 4>He tapped him in his first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then after that he fought boiler </v>

918
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:42.944
<v Speaker 4>Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was one of the greatest Brazilian </v>

919
00:42:44.961 --> 00:42:48.890
<v Speaker 4>jujitsu competitors of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hoya gracie's a national hero.</v>

920
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.873
<v Speaker 4>They closed the other mats off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put a spotlight on the main event </v>

921
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:56.060
<v Speaker 4>and they thought they thought that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Heuler was going to wreck this young kid</v>

922
00:42:56.061 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 4>who wasn't even a black belt at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

923
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Eddie was a brown belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

924
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.983
<v Speaker 4>And Eddie with his unorthodox techniques</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people had laughed at tap toilet </v>

925
00:43:03.771 --> 00:43:06.200
<v Speaker 4>gracie in front of everybody and he got </v>
<v Speaker 4>him with the triangle,</v>

926
00:43:06.201 --> 00:43:08.420
<v Speaker 4>but he got up the setup was his rubber </v>
<v Speaker 4>guard set up.</v>

927
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.760
<v Speaker 4>He has all these crazy guards set ups </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

928
00:43:10.761 --> 00:43:12.620
<v Speaker 4>his game has advanced light years since </v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

929
00:43:12.621 --> 00:43:15.770
<v Speaker 4>But the point being that people mocked </v>
<v Speaker 4>him for that,</v>

930
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.450
<v Speaker 4>it didn't help that he went to his next </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

931
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:21.380
<v Speaker 4>He fought Leo Vieira and he popped his </v>
<v Speaker 4>rib early in the fight and got dominated</v>

932
00:43:21.381 --> 00:43:22.214
<v Speaker 4>in that fight and almost got tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he know there was also a giant </v>

933
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.370
<v Speaker 4>emotional let down because he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe he just tapped toilet gracie.</v>

934
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 4>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he's moving on and he's fighting Leo</v>

935
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.830
<v Speaker 4>Vieira,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's another monster,</v>

936
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:34.940
<v Speaker 4>Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ours.</v>

937
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 4>But there's a point for the longest time</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

938
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.493
<v Speaker 4>there was two schools of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was the old guard that just did </v>

939
00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:44.270
<v Speaker 4>not accept him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They openly mocked him.</v>

940
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:45.251
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

941
00:43:45.251 --> 00:43:47.870
<v Speaker 4>the really criticized his whole movement</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his,</v>

942
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.580
<v Speaker 4>his techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what champions is,</v>

943
00:43:49.581 --> 00:43:50.414
<v Speaker 4>he produced all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't really work on real </v>

944
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:56.230
<v Speaker 4>fighters until he had a rematch with </v>
<v Speaker 4>boiler many years later and just wrecked</v>

945
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

946
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:57.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

947
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 4>it was worse than the first time because</v>
<v Speaker 4>heuler didn't tap,</v>

948
00:44:00.711 --> 00:44:02.600
<v Speaker 4>but he got his knee destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

949
00:44:02.601 --> 00:44:03.434
<v Speaker 4>if you watch that video who are just </v>
<v Speaker 4>deals with the fact that his knees </v>

950
00:44:06.171 --> 00:44:08.750
<v Speaker 4>getting ripped apart while Eddie's </v>
<v Speaker 4>mangling it,</v>

951
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.020
<v Speaker 4>but it was never a moment where Eddie </v>
<v Speaker 4>was in trouble.</v>

952
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:17.140
<v Speaker 4>He dictated the entire match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we played the fight on,</v>

953
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the TV,</v>

954
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 4>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a podcast.</v>

955
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:20.563
<v Speaker 4>And had Eddie explained what he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing and even when it looked like </v>

956
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:23.714
<v Speaker 4>horror,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lou was improving the position and he </v>

957
00:44:25.311 --> 00:44:25.701
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

958
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:27.960
<v Speaker 4>I let him do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I could do this and then I'll,</v>

959
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.950
<v Speaker 4>then I would adjust and he was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>explaining,</v>

960
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 4>I pulled him back on top of me because</v>

961
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I knew if I did that I would be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move his arm higher up on my shoulder.</v>

962
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.983
<v Speaker 2>Then I rolled him back over onto his </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and then I can get deeper in on </v>

963
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 2>when he was explaining that it was even </v>
<v Speaker 2>more humiliating.</v>

964
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Because you've got this guy who earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gracie,</v>

965
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:46.044
<v Speaker 2>who has a multiple time world champion </v>
<v Speaker 2>who just did not learn these new </v>

966
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:50.364
<v Speaker 2>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like she's got these old </v>

967
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:55.140
<v Speaker 2>techniques and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the application.</v>

968
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:55.974
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't learn it and if you're </v>

969
00:44:57.421 --> 00:44:59.790
<v Speaker 2>not willing to revise your beliefs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not looking,</v>

970
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 2>if you're not willing to test this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept the conclusion,</v>

971
00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:04.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think something's common </v>

972
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:08.220
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Common sense is irrelevant.</v>

973
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.500
<v Speaker 2>What's relevant is what works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

974
00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Well these new techniques that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly being innovative,</v>

975
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:14.423
<v Speaker 2>they're constantly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's almost impossible to stay up </v>

976
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:17.604
<v Speaker 2>on all of it unless it's a monster part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your life and you're absorbing him </v>

977
00:45:20.721 --> 00:45:21.554
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

978
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Like the leg lock game is this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>element that over the last few years has</v>

979
00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 2>really come into play in a major way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks to a bunch of guys,</v>

980
00:45:30.481 --> 00:45:31.151
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donna,</v>

981
00:45:31.151 --> 00:45:32.100
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Cummins,</v>

982
00:45:32.101 --> 00:45:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Gary Tone and who won the Eddie Bravo </v>
<v Speaker 2>and invitation only yesterday.</v>

983
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:36.263
<v Speaker 2>These like really high level </v>
<v Speaker 2>practitioners and instructors are </v>

984
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:44.040
<v Speaker 2>constantly adding new improvements to </v>
<v Speaker 2>approaches and techniques.</v>

985
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:48.090
<v Speaker 2>So it's all a applicable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all you can watch it happen in real</v>

986
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:48.924
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even as someone who's not competing </v>

987
00:45:50.341 --> 00:45:51.174
<v Speaker 2>like me sitting in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand the positions and the </v>

988
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:53.964
<v Speaker 2>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I see all this new stuff and I </v>

989
00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 2>see all these new approaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

990
00:45:57.031 --> 00:45:57.864
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this game just continues to grow and </v>

991
00:45:59.401 --> 00:46:00.230
<v Speaker 2>evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

992
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 2>and w what amazes me is when I watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids classes,</v>

993
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:04.463
<v Speaker 2>kids are doing the craziest stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they really have stood on the </v>

994
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:10.560
<v Speaker 2>shoulders of giants and they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's just so advanced.</v>

995
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 2>And I look at that now and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

996
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:14.740
<v Speaker 2>it's like speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even great thing.</v>

997
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:19.880
<v Speaker 2>How quickly these techniques and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>game has been advanced in a very,</v>

998
00:46:21.271 --> 00:46:22.920
<v Speaker 2>very short period time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has literally been,</v>

999
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:24.960
<v Speaker 2>in my lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a revolution in the martial arts.</v>

1000
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 2>It really has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying this for a while,</v>

1001
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:29.454
<v Speaker 2>but I'll say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The UFC has changed martial arts so </v>

1002
00:46:32.851 --> 00:46:37.851
<v Speaker 2>radically that there's been more </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvement since 1993 there's been more</v>

1003
00:46:37.891 --> 00:46:38.724
<v Speaker 2>evolution than there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There have been in the last 10,000 </v>

1004
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:42.450
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

1005
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.313
<v Speaker 2>That's 100% true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go back and watch martial arts from </v>

1006
00:46:46.291 --> 00:46:50.490
<v Speaker 2>1993 and watch the UFC today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a completely different realm.</v>

1007
00:46:50.491 --> 00:46:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

1008
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.470
<v Speaker 2>The differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1009
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.333
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about Jujitsu being </v>

1010
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.040
<v Speaker 2>applicable and all its applicable inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

1011
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.160
<v Speaker 2>the problem is when you get someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a really good wrestler,</v>

1012
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:05.130
<v Speaker 2>who's an awesome kickboxer and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>use your Jujitsu,</v>

1013
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Speaker 2>you're still going to get fucked up.</v>

1014
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Like a guy like chuck Liddell who you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to take down and he's going to</v>

1015
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:12.030
<v Speaker 2>knock you dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great wrestler.</v>

1016
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:14.760
<v Speaker 2>You mean he's a perfect anti Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>

1017
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even even that,</v>

1018
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.840
<v Speaker 2>look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave five things that work,</v>

1019
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.610
<v Speaker 2>boxing and wrestling with two of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>

1020
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.580
<v Speaker 2>They train against resisting opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1021
00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's no surprise then,</v>

1022
00:47:25.081 --> 00:47:27.300
<v Speaker 2>and maybe sometimes he comes from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kempo background,</v>

1023
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:28.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1024
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.073
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've listed that it's one of the </v>

1025
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:30.964
<v Speaker 2>martial arts that don't really work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the martial art that </v>

1026
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 2>chocolate Dell learned for striking </v>
<v Speaker 2>under John Hackleman.</v>

1027
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:35.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1028
00:47:35.981 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another example.</v>

1029
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:38.910
<v Speaker 2>People can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

1030
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.761
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1031
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:42.850
<v Speaker 2>so you're much more versed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifics than I am,</v>

1032
00:47:42.851 --> 00:47:43.684
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1033
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.210
<v Speaker 2>to burst a gunner Nelson fight and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>she did,</v>

1034
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:47.044
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

1035
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:47.883
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1036
00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.890
<v Speaker 2>background hoss to someone's head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just ground Dick.</v>

1037
00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1038
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.111
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

1039
00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:53.944
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he looked around house to </v>

1040
00:47:55.481 --> 00:47:56.314
<v Speaker 2>someone's in the back of someone's head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He trained in traditional karate for </v>

1041
00:48:00.281 --> 00:48:01.310
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1042
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:01.991
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:03.400
<v Speaker 2>He's a brown belt in karate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:04.293
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not that these techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be integrated or that they don't </v>

1045
00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:09.690
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the problem is that they're sold</v>

1046
00:48:09.691 --> 00:48:10.960
<v Speaker 2>as systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1047
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of picking and choosing,</v>

1048
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.940
<v Speaker 2>so if everybody trained against </v>
<v Speaker 2>resisting opponents,</v>

1049
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear to me that there would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>any styles,</v>

1050
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.490
<v Speaker 2>styles would fade away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1051
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:21.343
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that highlights the problem </v>

1052
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:25.450
<v Speaker 2>that we brought up earlier that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really can't resist.</v>

1053
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 2>You can't train 100% resisting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>

1054
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.690
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be a healthy member of </v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

1055
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.153
<v Speaker 2>that's brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I have brain damage and </v>

1056
00:48:36.671 --> 00:48:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I stopped really getting hit in the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 22.</v>

1057
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:40.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really haven't been hitting the head </v>

1058
00:48:41.261 --> 00:48:42.094
<v Speaker 2>of that much since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm for sure something's fucked up </v>

1059
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:44.710
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I was watching a guy hit the pads about </v>
<v Speaker 2>a brown belt a couple of weeks ago and I</v>

1061
00:48:48.941 --> 00:48:50.260
<v Speaker 2>just thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

1062
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.840
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing was moving it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought to myself like,</v>

1063
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.910
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if that guy ever hit me,</v>

1064
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that would be it.</v>

1065
00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would just be over and,</v>

1066
00:48:59.081 --> 00:48:59.914
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I watched people kick the heavy bag </v>

1067
00:49:00.801 --> 00:49:02.910
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen Melvin manhoef kicked</v>

1068
00:49:02.911 --> 00:49:03.744
<v Speaker 2>the pads?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ pull up Melvin manhoef </v>

1069
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:07.810
<v Speaker 2>trains with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1070
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot his trainer's name.</v>

1071
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Mike Mike's gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1072
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I forgot how to say his last passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>passenger.</v>

1073
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I forget how to say it cause he's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're from Holland.</v>

1075
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:21.550
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1076
00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:25.480
<v Speaker 2>a video is a bunch of videos of Malvin </v>
<v Speaker 2>but Melvin kicking the pads with him.</v>

1077
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.313
<v Speaker 2>It's just Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the I'm terrifying cause he's a super </v>

1078
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:34.560
<v Speaker 2>fucking athlete and he's training with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this really aggressive Moitai trainer or</v>

1079
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:35.403
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike's gym is famous for like guys like </v>

1080
00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Badr Hari and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1081
00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.310
<v Speaker 2>man who have that are just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>ferocious aggressive competitors.</v>

1082
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:50.170
<v Speaker 2>And manhood is particularly famous for </v>
<v Speaker 2>having just unbelievable knockout power.</v>

1083
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:52.720
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out Mark Hunt and he weighed </v>
<v Speaker 2>185 pounds.</v>

1084
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out Mark Hunt when mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] was probably 300 pounds.</v>

1085
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.033
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so imagine some of those guys or </v>

1086
00:49:59.471 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 2>people in their lineage fighting it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what fighting these guys who do Katas.</v>

1087
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.670
<v Speaker 2>There's not pads though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta focus pads.</v>

1088
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:08.560
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if you can find one with him.</v>

1089
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That says,</v>

1090
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 2>that's just my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if you could find,</v>

1091
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:14.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melvin manhood.</v>

1092
00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 2>That's him though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Melvin.</v>

1093
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:19.600
<v Speaker 2>But they're just sparring there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which most of the time they,</v>

1094
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.400
<v Speaker 2>they go hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1095
00:50:21.401 --> 00:50:22.234
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they usually don't go too hard to the </v>

1096
00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:24.280
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.373
<v Speaker 2>That's the Holon style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine those guys fighting these </v>

1098
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:29.720
<v Speaker 2>guys who are in make believe land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1099
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 2>You want your fantasy fantasy land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1100
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.413
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've played videos many times and </v>

1101
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:38.550
<v Speaker 2>recently one or here's hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malvin see,</v>

1102
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.570
<v Speaker 2>get some volume on that shit.</v>

1103
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:52.240
<v Speaker 5>Sounds not saying for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you get the picture of him.</v>

1104
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.230
<v Speaker 5>He's a fucking destroyed that switch </v>
<v Speaker 5>kick to the body.</v>

1105
00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.600
<v Speaker 5>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you watch this guy in real life,</v>

1106
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.670
<v Speaker 5>it's even more stunning because you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really can feel the impact when he's</v>

1107
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 5>kicking the pads.</v>

1108
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:13.290
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing about that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy knows we can do and he can't do,</v>

1109
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.700
<v Speaker 2>they don't spend a lot of these young </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

1110
00:51:15.701 --> 00:51:16.534
<v Speaker 2>they see a movie with a guy who's beaten</v>
<v Speaker 2>up five guys with knives and bats and </v>

1111
00:51:19.901 --> 00:51:20.734
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's total make believe land and it </v>

1112
00:51:22.961 --> 00:51:25.000
<v Speaker 2>immerses people in a culture of make </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>

1113
00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1114
00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:27.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree more.</v>

1115
00:51:27.911 --> 00:51:31.270
<v Speaker 2>And I was in that culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to teach it.</v>

1116
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I taught at Boston University.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1117
00:51:32.651 --> 00:51:33.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

1118
00:51:33.521 --> 00:51:35.500
<v Speaker 2>huge part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1119
00:51:35.501 --> 00:51:38.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wake up call that I got was,</v>

1120
00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:42.190
<v Speaker 2>it was a really stunning thing to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to end.</v>

1121
00:51:42.191 --> 00:51:43.024
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1122
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:47.770
<v Speaker 2>it was a long progression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just one wake up call.</v>

1123
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.530
<v Speaker 2>It was like one wake up call and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>another one,</v>

1124
00:51:50.531 --> 00:51:52.960
<v Speaker 2>and then deeper and deeper and deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the UFC comes along,</v>

1125
00:51:52.961 --> 00:51:54.160
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

1126
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:55.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1127
00:51:55.421 --> 00:51:56.300
<v Speaker 2>this is this.</v>

1128
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.180
<v Speaker 2>And then you get this understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1129
00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I live my life under this illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:05.500
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me about that is those are culturally</v>

1131
00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:06.940
<v Speaker 2>reinforced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1132
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.890
<v Speaker 2>There are these rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the bowing,</v>

1133
00:52:08.891 --> 00:52:09.724
<v Speaker 2>the master,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other people that your friends that </v>

1134
00:52:11.651 --> 00:52:15.790
<v Speaker 2>you come to do these things with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that reinforces the delusion.</v>

1135
00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.770
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar to,</v>

1136
00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:18.723
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1137
00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.293
<v Speaker 2>to religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that religions focus with the </v>

1138
00:52:21.941 --> 00:52:25.030
<v Speaker 2>difference being that people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions,</v>

1139
00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:26.043
<v Speaker 2>people who have faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they're a bit better people </v>

1140
00:52:27.821 --> 00:52:28.654
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of them having faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas very few people in the </v>

1141
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:32.463
<v Speaker 2>delusional martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that they think they're good </v>

1142
00:52:34.271 --> 00:52:35.410
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1143
00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the techniques are too dangerous to task</v>

1144
00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:38.051
<v Speaker 2>or we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1145
00:52:38.051 --> 00:52:40.570
<v Speaker 2>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't do this and see if we did this,</v>

1146
00:52:40.571 --> 00:52:42.570
<v Speaker 2>we would kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1147
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:43.533
<v Speaker 2>but those cultures of delusion keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>people trapped in thinking about things </v>

1148
00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:50.020
<v Speaker 2>that remove them from reality.</v>

1149
00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely some of that,</v>

1150
00:52:52.391 --> 00:52:53.224
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's some good to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of respecting a Dojo as a place </v>

1151
00:52:59.591 --> 00:53:01.260
<v Speaker 2>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you walk into it.</v>

1152
00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:04.060
<v Speaker 2>One of the things stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

1153
00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:06.550
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have keys to uh,</v>

1154
00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.613
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1155
00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a doe Jang,</v>

1156
00:53:09.311 --> 00:53:11.320
<v Speaker 2>cause it was taekwondo is the Korean </v>
<v Speaker 2>word doubled.</v>

1157
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when no one was there,</v>

1158
00:53:12.581 --> 00:53:13.414
<v Speaker 2>I would bow when I would walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I would go to work out in the </v>

1159
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.161
<v Speaker 2>middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I would go there,</v>

1160
00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I had keys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1161
00:53:19.431 --> 00:53:20.264
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would train sometimes I'd show up at </v>

1162
00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.353
<v Speaker 2>midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go there and lock the door and go in </v>

1163
00:53:24.021 --> 00:53:24.720
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1164
00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 2>but when stepped into the training area,</v>

1165
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 4>I would always bow and I was like almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an ocd thing.</v>

1166
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't not do it because I,</v>

1167
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:31.914
<v Speaker 4>in my mind when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I had been trained and taught that </v>

1168
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:35.694
<v Speaker 4>when I entered that room I had to bow </v>
<v Speaker 4>and even with there's fucking no one </v>

1169
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 4>there man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm by myself and I always bout like one</v>

1170
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:42.414
<v Speaker 4>time my girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my girlfriend was a freak in high </v>

1171
00:53:43.411 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wanted to fuck in the,</v>

1172
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.890
<v Speaker 4>in the gym and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't,</v>

1173
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.930
<v Speaker 4>can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1174
00:53:48.931 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 4>I won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't do it here.</v>

1175
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:51.510
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

1176
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.373
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

1177
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.740
<v Speaker 4>not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a lost opportunity for you?</v>

1178
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.210
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucked the shit out of her.</v>

1179
00:53:57.211 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 4>I fucked her all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were like little fucking rabbits,</v>

1180
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.410
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

1181
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:04.740
<v Speaker 4>there was the one place where I wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

1182
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:05.700
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't,</v>

1183
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.260
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is,</v>

1184
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:10.920
<v Speaker 4>this is a sacred ground for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I guess here's my problem with that,</v>

1185
00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:14.280
<v Speaker 4>besides the lost opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't a lost opportunity for me.</v>

1186
00:54:14.281 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 4>It was an execution of discipline of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

1187
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:18.084
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was very hard for a 17 year old boy </v>

1188
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:21.563
<v Speaker 4>to not have sex with this hot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she was 1616 year old girl who </v>

1189
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:29.610
<v Speaker 4>wanted a bang in this karate or </v>
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo gym.</v>

1190
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:32.630
<v Speaker 4>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me it was like that.</v>

1191
00:54:32.631 --> 00:54:34.160
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this what,</v>

1192
00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:35.043
<v Speaker 4>what martial arts meant to me at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time was there was this the first thing </v>

1193
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:41.430
<v Speaker 4>that I had ever done that made me feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I wasn't a loser.</v>

1194
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:42.833
<v Speaker 4>So my whole life I'd been insecure and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we had moved around a lot when I was a </v>

1195
00:54:46.351 --> 00:54:47.184
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really have a whole lot of </v>

1196
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:50.160
<v Speaker 4>friends and I never felt like I fit in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I always felt,</v>

1197
00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know my dad and you know,</v>

1198
00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.940
<v Speaker 4>my stepdad was a little distant.</v>

1199
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.680
<v Speaker 4>There was all this stuff going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1200
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 4>There was all these things that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't feel right,</v>

1201
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.990
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't make me feel good.</v>

1202
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:04.110
<v Speaker 4>And then this one thing came along that </v>
<v Speaker 4>made me feel good.</v>

1203
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.970
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing came along that I had </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten really proficient,</v>

1204
00:55:06.971 --> 00:55:07.804
<v Speaker 4>not really quickly and was absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>obsessed with and I was doing it all </v>

1205
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.191
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all day.</v>

1206
00:55:11.191 --> 00:55:14.070
<v Speaker 4>And there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was my whole focus of my life.</v>

1207
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Other than the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1208
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:16.711
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't not sure.</v>

1209
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:19.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it wasn't good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it was probably terrible,</v>

1210
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.340
<v Speaker 4>but point being like I wasn't willing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice that.</v>

1211
00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Like the ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting isn't it?</v>

1212
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.890
<v Speaker 4>So we use the same today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think,</v>

1214
00:55:28.891 --> 00:55:31.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean do you have that notion of sacred</v>
<v Speaker 4>with regard to these things?</v>

1215
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't have that notion of sacred when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes to like a space,</v>

1216
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:38.640
<v Speaker 4>but I do in terms of like my approach to</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1217
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.700
<v Speaker 4>Like what if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm focused on something,</v>

1218
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.220
<v Speaker 4>like I don't allow myself to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>distracted.</v>

1219
00:55:44.221 --> 00:55:45.680
<v Speaker 4>If something is is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1220
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.553
<v Speaker 4>is critical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's like really important to </v>

1221
00:55:48.181 --> 00:55:49.014
<v Speaker 4>focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I decided this is what I'm doing </v>

1222
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:51.870
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'm doing this,</v>

1223
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.900
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I may wanna be overly personal,</v>

1224
00:55:54.901 --> 00:55:58.620
<v Speaker 4>but like your marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you decided to do it,</v>

1225
00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:01.110
<v Speaker 4>you're focusing on it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's taken me,</v>

1226
00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 4>marriage is a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1227
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Relationships?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1228
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.940
<v Speaker 4>Like the way you engage with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you care about someone,</v>

1229
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:09.803
<v Speaker 4>here's a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not just relationships as far as like </v>

1230
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:13.680
<v Speaker 4>sexual relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but friendships.</v>

1231
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:14.843
<v Speaker 4>If you care about someone and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really enjoy being with them and </v>

1232
00:56:17.911 --> 00:56:20.160
<v Speaker 4>they're one of the most important people</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your life.</v>

1233
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.413
<v Speaker 4>Like when you interact with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should interact with them </v>

1234
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:28.690
<v Speaker 4>under that provision or with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought in mind with that.</v>

1235
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.553
<v Speaker 4>Would that intention with what I missed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You intention that you care about them </v>

1236
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:33.244
<v Speaker 4>very deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are important people in your life </v>

1237
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:37.180
<v Speaker 4>authentically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't,</v>

1238
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:38.770
<v Speaker 4>you don't ever want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't,</v>

1239
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.770
<v Speaker 4>I would never like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really good friends.</v>

1240
00:56:41.771 --> 00:56:45.370
<v Speaker 4>I would never yell at them and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1241
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 4>call them a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never want you in my life.</v>

1242
00:56:48.161 --> 00:56:48.994
<v Speaker 4>Or it's like say crazy things to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sometimes people say hurtful </v>

1243
00:56:52.021 --> 00:56:52.854
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean don't be critical.</v>

1245
00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:57.610
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean don't correct someone if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see them doing something that you've</v>

1246
00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.410
<v Speaker 4>seen your friends doing something </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid,</v>

1247
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:03.310
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's a good example.</v>

1248
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:04.300
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1249
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.400
<v Speaker 4>because marriage is not something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1250
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:10.120
<v Speaker 4>it's like something you're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1251
00:57:10.121 --> 00:57:12.460
<v Speaker 4>marriage is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or even relationships,</v>

1252
00:57:12.461 --> 00:57:16.660
<v Speaker 4>friendships are just their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are their interactions.</v>

1253
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.673
<v Speaker 4>So they should ships or it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it should be fun and enjoyable and </v>

1254
00:57:21.161 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 4>all that good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm talking about as a discipline.</v>

1255
00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:23.671
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1256
00:57:23.671 --> 00:57:26.740
<v Speaker 4>what I was trying to tease out from you </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that when you were 17,</v>

1257
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.470
<v Speaker 4>you had this idea of the Dojo being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacred place.</v>

1258
00:57:29.471 --> 00:57:30.304
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you talked about what that meant to </v>

1259
00:57:32.951 --> 00:57:36.370
<v Speaker 4>you and I'm curious if there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you hold sacred now.</v>

1260
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question.</v>

1261
00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.000
<v Speaker 4>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

1262
00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:45.843
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've definitely changed my ideas about </v>

1263
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:53.190
<v Speaker 4>what that even was at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what that was that need for that</v>

1264
00:57:54.011 --> 00:57:54.844
<v Speaker 4>sacred space in this like intense </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentration and purity of that </v>

1265
00:57:59.921 --> 00:58:04.270
<v Speaker 4>environment was really like my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my ticket out,</v>

1266
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 4>my ticket out of this life that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>really unfulfilling to manhood.</v>

1267
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That definitely to sovereignty,</v>

1268
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:12.580
<v Speaker 4>personal sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1269
00:58:12.581 --> 00:58:14.470
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to realize that,</v>

1270
00:58:14.471 --> 00:58:17.020
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that I,</v>

1271
00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.120
<v Speaker 4>it's not that I was a loser.</v>

1272
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:23.020
<v Speaker 4>He says that I wasn't a winner and I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out how to be one.</v>

1273
00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:26.020
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't all my failures,</v>

1274
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:27.153
<v Speaker 4>what I was is now and all those failures</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all those mistakes and bad feelings </v>

1275
00:58:31.811 --> 00:58:32.644
<v Speaker 4>that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those were really just lessons and that </v>

1276
00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:36.483
<v Speaker 4>now that I have this new focus and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>new thing and it's shown massive </v>

1277
00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:43.240
<v Speaker 4>positive results,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will honor that.</v>

1278
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.373
<v Speaker 4>And that's what it was to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the new focus being one martial </v>

1279
00:58:47.081 --> 00:58:48.070
<v Speaker 4>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

1280
00:58:48.071 --> 00:58:52.360
<v Speaker 4>competing taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that space to Dojo,</v>

1281
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:53.223
<v Speaker 4>that Doe Jang represented a sacred place</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me because it represented this new </v>

1282
00:58:57.821 --> 00:59:01.180
<v Speaker 4>ticket and I wasn't about to cash that </v>
<v Speaker 4>in for some Pussy Holla.</v>

1283
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:04.360
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like was my thoughts Matt.</v>

1284
00:59:04.361 --> 00:59:06.400
<v Speaker 4>Now my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1285
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:07.293
<v Speaker 4>I mean if there's anything I would think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the world like life itself is that </v>

1286
00:59:13.361 --> 00:59:15.610
<v Speaker 4>environment life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

1287
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:20.670
<v Speaker 4>that Doh Jang life itself is that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you don't ever want,</v>

1288
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.693
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to steal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to commit crimes against </v>

1289
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:27.980
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to do things to hurt.</v>

1290
00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 4>All those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

1291
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:32.270
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those terrible things that we see out in</v>

1292
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:35.870
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the world was your Dough Jang,</v>

1293
00:59:35.871 --> 00:59:38.360
<v Speaker 4>if the world was your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your church,</v>

1294
00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:39.473
<v Speaker 4>if the world was your sacred place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would never want to commit bad acts </v>

1295
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:44.210
<v Speaker 4>in your sacred place.</v>

1296
00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:49.800
<v Speaker 3>That's a lovely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish we could figure out a way to,</v>

1297
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:53.720
<v Speaker 3>to help people adopt those values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1298
00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:56.960
<v Speaker 3>I wish we could come up with some way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1299
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.033
<v Speaker 3>especially when we see what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Middle East and we see what's </v>

1300
00:59:59.511 --> 01:00:00.344
<v Speaker 3>going on in the world and we see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we're treating our environment </v>

1301
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:02.684
<v Speaker 3>or climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish there was some way to make that </v>

1302
01:00:05.661 --> 01:00:06.494
<v Speaker 3>real and palatable to people so that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>would start being more authentic and </v>

1303
01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:12.320
<v Speaker 3>more sincere with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1304
01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:17.060
<v Speaker 3>and I think what you said about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about criticism,</v>

1305
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.580
<v Speaker 3>the way I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's about forthright speech.</v>

1306
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:24.020
<v Speaker 3>You can be forthright in your speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>with somebody and not be,</v>

1307
01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:27.140
<v Speaker 3>be be an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not be a jerk.</v>

1308
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I think those kinds of relationships </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1309
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:32.030
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aristotle talks about that too.</v>

1310
01:00:32.031 --> 01:00:32.864
<v Speaker 3>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the most meaningful </v>

1311
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:40.511
<v Speaker 3>relationships are those people with whom</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be authentic.</v>

1312
01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 3>And be myself and be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those are kind of,</v>

1313
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the word sacred though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1314
01:00:45.231 --> 01:00:47.720
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's the one kind of nitpick I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

1315
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:49.523
<v Speaker 4>Cause you attach that to religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well because I attach it to the </v>

1316
01:00:52.381 --> 01:00:56.820
<v Speaker 4>inability to revise something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I attach it to the utmost respect.</v>

1317
01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:00.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if we replaced a sacred for respect,</v>

1318
01:01:00.271 --> 01:01:01.104
<v Speaker 4>I think we'd be noises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things I don't like </v>

1319
01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:09.120
<v Speaker 4>about labels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I like intent and intent.</v>

1320
01:01:09.121 --> 01:01:11.550
<v Speaker 4>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my idea of sacred is not like God.</v>

1321
01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:14.400
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not like a sum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a deity,</v>

1322
01:01:14.401 --> 01:01:18.630
<v Speaker 4>this unnamed unknown word that's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>passed down from person to person.</v>

1323
01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:21.090
<v Speaker 4>It's based on personal experience based </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a real thing.</v>

1324
01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.270
<v Speaker 4>So when I say sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my law,</v>

1325
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.830
<v Speaker 4>my love for my children is sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1326
01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:27.630
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I say it in that window.</v>

1327
01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1328
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:32.070
<v Speaker 4>say it like in terms of like harps and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the clouds and all that kind of jazz.</v>

1329
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:34.140
<v Speaker 4>And when we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1330
01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:36.450
<v Speaker 4>like don't be an asshole to people you </v>
<v Speaker 4>care about.</v>

1331
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:37.283
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't mean it certainly </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean I'm some sort of a perfect </v>

1332
01:01:40.771 --> 01:01:42.630
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certain doesn't mean that I have been an</v>

1333
01:01:42.631 --> 01:01:43.464
<v Speaker 4>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then sometimes when you're </v>

1334
01:01:44.281 --> 01:01:47.520
<v Speaker 4>responding to someone else being </v>
<v Speaker 4>retarded or someone being ridiculous,</v>

1335
01:01:47.521 --> 01:01:51.540
<v Speaker 4>you can be an asshole because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the patience for it anymore because</v>

1336
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:56.541
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the a at the moment you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have the temperament to charity.</v>

1337
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:57.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1338
01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be maturity.</v>

1339
01:01:58.891 --> 01:02:02.520
<v Speaker 4>It could be you're overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of variables.</v>

1340
01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:06.060
<v Speaker 4>So like if someone hears this and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know all,</v>

1341
01:02:06.061 --> 01:02:08.670
<v Speaker 4>well man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been an asshole lately.</v>

1342
01:02:08.671 --> 01:02:10.450
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'm a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like No.</v>

1343
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:11.303
<v Speaker 4>It's just recognizing those moments </v>
<v Speaker 4>where he probably could have handled </v>

1344
01:02:14.641 --> 01:02:18.900
<v Speaker 4>something better and continuing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>approve and then also this idea,</v>

1345
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 4>here's this is a really important</v>

1346
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 2>one because people have this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow I'm 30 years old,</v>

1347
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't be doing this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 50 years old.</v>

1348
01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I should have learned by now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all bullshit.</v>

1349
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Throw that away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tossed that shit aside.</v>

1350
01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.213
<v Speaker 2>You like these ideas of numbers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have in their head that by a </v>

1351
01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:36.234
<v Speaker 2>certain age you should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are alive and if you are alive and </v>

1352
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:44.070
<v Speaker 2>if you are thinking all those numbers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you keep attaching,</v>

1353
01:02:44.071 --> 01:02:44.904
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when Einstein was 30 heat or </v>

1354
01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.890
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop doing that.</v>

1355
01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 2>That that is a waste of your time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop saying to yourself,</v>

1356
01:02:51.691 --> 01:02:52.524
<v Speaker 2>I should be better by now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm such a total non helping thought </v>

1357
01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:01.920
<v Speaker 2>what you need to think of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're living,</v>

1358
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:02.813
<v Speaker 2>you're alive right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you've made a mistake and you're </v>

1359
01:03:04.861 --> 01:03:07.680
<v Speaker 2>still continuing to learn and grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all just data.</v>

1360
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.470
<v Speaker 2>And I think bundled with that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>gratitude.</v>

1361
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 2>Gratitude is giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't say a prayer in my household,</v>

1362
01:03:13.921 --> 01:03:14.754
<v Speaker 2>but we go around every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have seven people living with us and </v>

1363
01:03:17.611 --> 01:03:21.210
<v Speaker 2>we say what we're grateful for and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you went into commune when you doing?</v>

1364
01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

1365
01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a,</v>

1366
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a long story of a woman from China </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1367
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what does she do?</v>

1368
01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:29.603
<v Speaker 2>Wink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wink.</v>

1369
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.033
<v Speaker 2>No sex slaves and bocce though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have another woman who lives in the </v>

1370
01:03:35.881 --> 01:03:36.714
<v Speaker 2>cargo container.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody who lives in the garage over </v>

1371
01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.750
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no attention to the banging.</v>

1372
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1373
01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:42.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go around,</v>

1374
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:42.863
<v Speaker 2>we talk about what they're grateful for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is grateful and I think that </v>

1375
01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.460
<v Speaker 2>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1376
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.810
<v Speaker 2>it's an opportunity to be authentic at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>

1377
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.793
<v Speaker 2>But it's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think verbalizing those things are </v>

1378
01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:53.400
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just the negative,</v>

1379
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't be doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just the positive look.</v>

1380
01:03:55.951 --> 01:03:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Is it general as a general rule of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thumb,</v>

1381
01:03:57.841 --> 01:04:00.540
<v Speaker 2>if you ever have any doubts about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just be kind to people.</v>

1382
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.530
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1383
01:04:01.531 --> 01:04:04.050
<v Speaker 2>it's great when you reinforce it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your friends,</v>

1384
01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:06.340
<v Speaker 2>like verbalizing it like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1385
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:07.493
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell my friends I love them all the </v>

1386
01:04:09.811 --> 01:04:11.420
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like me and my friend,</v>

1387
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 2>like my wife jokes around about it.</v>

1388
01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:14.763
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any men that tell their </v>

1389
01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:17.010
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love him all the time.</v>

1390
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.083
<v Speaker 2>But all my friends do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all tell each other we love each </v>

1391
01:04:19.171 --> 01:04:20.100
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1392
01:04:20.101 --> 01:04:21.940
<v Speaker 2>I love you brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we hang up the phone.</v>

1393
01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm dealing with all my friends and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1394
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:27.060
<v Speaker 2>there were always hugging and always </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1395
01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1396
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:29.243
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a very tight knit group of </v>

1397
01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:34.980
<v Speaker 2>friends that I care about very much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're all very,</v>

1398
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:37.610
<v Speaker 2>they're very motivated and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy and the,</v>

1399
01:04:37.611 --> 01:04:39.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not without flaws,</v>

1400
01:04:39.331 --> 01:04:40.164
<v Speaker 2>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got shit going on and it empowers </v>

1401
01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:44.910
<v Speaker 2>me yet new up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's why.</v>

1402
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Here's why that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you got the tattoos,</v>

1403
01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:52.800
<v Speaker 2>you got to build,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been in the ring,</v>

1404
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.680
<v Speaker 2>you're friends with whomever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever you're friends with.</v>

1405
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.740
<v Speaker 2>And I think that whether you like it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1406
01:04:58.770 --> 01:04:59.603
<v Speaker 2>you're in a position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly with young people to look </v>

1407
01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:04.680
<v Speaker 2>up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is exactly the kind of behavior</v>

1408
01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:05.514
<v Speaker 2>that we want to see modeled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not emotionally immature for a guy </v>

1409
01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:10.320
<v Speaker 2>to cry at a tragic event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1410
01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:12.350
<v Speaker 2>I tell my friends I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you know,</v>

1411
01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:13.770
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell my buddy over there,</v>

1412
01:05:13.771 --> 01:05:16.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm incredibly grateful for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to stay his house,</v>

1413
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that</v>

1414
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 3>that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live in a culture that's suppressed,</v>

1415
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.653
<v Speaker 3>these particularly males,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this the ability for men to communicate </v>

1416
01:05:26.141 --> 01:05:29.140
<v Speaker 3>in an authentic way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also to experience emotion.</v>

1417
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Like this idea of somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 3>being stoic has virtue to it,</v>

1418
01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.310
<v Speaker 3>especially in the form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in face of tragedy or even joy.</v>

1419
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:40.343
<v Speaker 3>Like I sometimes cry more or for happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments sometimes and I do for a sad </v>

1420
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:45.760
<v Speaker 3>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1421
01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:48.460
<v Speaker 3>I'll cry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll cry fucking cartoons man.</v>

1422
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I almost cried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not a ton of times,</v>

1423
01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not crying to cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

1424
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:57.303
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that journey from you as a </v>

1425
01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:00.334
<v Speaker 3>17 year old to now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was some really core </v>

1426
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:08.611
<v Speaker 3>lessons for people out there struggling </v>
<v Speaker 3>with maybe issues of sexuality or issues</v>

1427
01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:12.410
<v Speaker 3>of feeling they hate the world and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>on good enough or their,</v>

1428
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.260
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their self esteem issues are they,</v>

1429
01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:16.020
<v Speaker 3>and I think that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1430
01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:18.640
<v Speaker 3>it acceptance and that's what we all </v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1431
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.450
<v Speaker 3>We all want to be loved and look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

1432
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm 49 and it's like I'd much rather be </v>
<v Speaker 3>people say about me,</v>

1433
01:06:26.171 --> 01:06:26.860
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1434
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.110
<v Speaker 3>pizza really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then pizza,</v>

1435
01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:30.880
<v Speaker 3>really smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

1436
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:32.200
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1437
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to embody those virtues.</v>

1438
01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:36.310
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more than that,</v>

1439
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:40.240
<v Speaker 3>I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story that you told there,</v>

1440
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.273
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that's accessible to </v>

1441
01:06:44.411 --> 01:06:46.990
<v Speaker 3>people and it's a type of thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to do.</v>

1442
01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:47.824
<v Speaker 3>We need to figure out how to move our </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture towards these more humane ways </v>

1443
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:55.900
<v Speaker 3>of dealing with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my own opinion is that we don't need</v>

1444
01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:59.770
<v Speaker 3>superstitions to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a perfect example of that,</v>

1445
01:06:59.771 --> 01:07:00.604
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need people making objective </v>

1446
01:07:02.831 --> 01:07:03.664
<v Speaker 3>claims about reincarnating and times </v>
<v Speaker 3>through bodies like the dilemma or wait </v>

1447
01:07:06.281 --> 01:07:07.114
<v Speaker 3>a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't think the Dalai Lama is a </v>

1448
01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:10.780
<v Speaker 3>reincarnated saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you serious?</v>

1449
01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:15.170
<v Speaker 3>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got nervous there for a moment.</v>

1450
01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:16.590
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1451
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:17.463
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be a long conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see my Buddha said another buddha </v>

1452
01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:23.200
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that's the funny thing.</v>

1453
01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:24.034
<v Speaker 3>If like I'll call it just call bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>on that in class and everybody will </v>

1454
01:07:27.011 --> 01:07:28.090
<v Speaker 3>freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if I say,</v>

1455
01:07:28.091 --> 01:07:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Jesus walking on water and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can join.</v>

1456
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 3>But if you start taking a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddhists and people were like,</v>

1457
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

1458
01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:35.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you say that?</v>

1459
01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:38.290
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Dalai Lama is so cool.</v>

1460
01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:40.510
<v Speaker 3>He's friends with Steven Seagal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1461
01:07:40.511 --> 01:07:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Well you actually saw them years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>together doing their little thing.</v>

1462
01:07:43.811 --> 01:07:45.630
<v Speaker 3>That all gets connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1463
01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:48.260
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I um,</v>

1464
01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:51.360
<v Speaker 3>I had a psychedelic trip that or saw a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of Golden Buddhas.</v>

1465
01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:54.510
<v Speaker 3>So that's what lsd about no DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1466
01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Cause that cause that like literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy like in that position,</v>

1467
01:07:58.631 --> 01:08:01.420
<v Speaker 3>but there was fractals with millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1468
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.910
<v Speaker 3>infinite numbers of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very strange.</v>

1469
01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what that,</v>

1470
01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.390
<v Speaker 3>that little puts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy made it for me.</v>

1471
01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:11.710
<v Speaker 3>I wish I remembered this homeboy's name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll find it somewhere and I'll throw it</v>

1472
01:08:11.711 --> 01:08:14.260
<v Speaker 3>up on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's on my instagram picture.</v>

1473
01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:15.094
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1474
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:16.183
<v Speaker 3>I'll find it.</v>

1475
01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.720
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1476
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.870
<v Speaker 4>all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things are not necessary.</v>

1477
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:24.980
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we are necessary like all these,</v>

1478
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:25.381
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1479
01:08:25.381 --> 01:08:29.180
<v Speaker 4>the false beliefs and all the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they are is like scaffolding.</v>

1480
01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:30.493
<v Speaker 4>I feel like they're scaffolding for like</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolution and I think that that's </v>

1481
01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:38.370
<v Speaker 4>ultimately the benefit that religion </v>
<v Speaker 4>does provide is in,</v>

1482
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:39.223
<v Speaker 4>in these insane beliefs in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gods and all these different things and </v>

1483
01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:45.290
<v Speaker 4>we show reverence to these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1484
01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:47.870
<v Speaker 4>these deities and they have these rules </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we must follow.</v>

1485
01:08:47.871 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise we would be punished in those </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules.</v>

1486
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:53.150
<v Speaker 4>There becomes order and then the order </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes society.</v>

1487
01:08:53.151 --> 01:08:55.160
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something that people always like</v>

1488
01:08:55.161 --> 01:08:55.994
<v Speaker 4>to fall back on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we are a Judeo Christian sound </v>

1489
01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:00.860
<v Speaker 4>founded society and our Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethics.</v>

1490
01:09:00.861 --> 01:09:01.694
<v Speaker 4>Like I saw some woman who was arguing </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Muslim terrorists and that was </v>

1491
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:06.530
<v Speaker 4>like one of the big things that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1492
01:09:06.531 --> 01:09:09.350
<v Speaker 4>this country was founded on Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian ethics.</v>

1493
01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:14.090
<v Speaker 4>Sowhat monkeys were founded on eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>bananas and we're not monkeys anymore.</v>

1494
01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:15.143
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's such a stupid fucking </v>

1495
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.300
<v Speaker 4>like just because something's founded on</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's illogical,</v>

1496
01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.213
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean you should have </v>
<v Speaker 4>reverence for that illogical things </v>

1497
01:09:23.991 --> 01:09:24.824
<v Speaker 4>perfectly stated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's part of the problem I think with </v>

1498
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:29.270
<v Speaker 4>once we make ideas sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1499
01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:30.143
<v Speaker 4>And they become much more difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not impossible to revise like George </v>

1500
01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:35.023
<v Speaker 4>Bush saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is actually I invite your viewers </v>

1501
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:39.150
<v Speaker 4>or listeners to listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1502
01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.200
<v Speaker 4>he's prayed about the war in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows who God wants them to do.</v>

1503
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:44.780
<v Speaker 4>So the moment you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it becomes irreversible.</v>

1504
01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 4>I used to have a bit about that where </v>
<v Speaker 4>George Bush was like,</v>

1505
01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:48.674
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1506
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.470
<v Speaker 4>that he's prayed about the world in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rack and you know,</v>

1507
01:09:51.471 --> 01:09:52.304
<v Speaker 4>God blessed the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if he said instead of that we </v>

1508
01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:55.994
<v Speaker 4>have found Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is in Afghanistan and we're moving </v>

1509
01:09:58.371 --> 01:09:59.390
<v Speaker 4>tanks into that area.</v>

1510
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1511
01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:01.970
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say?</v>

1512
01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:02.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

1513
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:06.440
<v Speaker 4>that's the draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the line that we draw.</v>

1514
01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:07.413
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not hitting out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he prayed to vishnu or </v>

1515
01:10:09.711 --> 01:10:10.411
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

1516
01:10:10.411 --> 01:10:12.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not allowed to say that.</v>

1517
01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:13.064
<v Speaker 4>You know the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to say the devil is </v>

1518
01:10:15.231 --> 01:10:15.621
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1519
01:10:15.621 --> 01:10:18.440
<v Speaker 4>and you never hear the president bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>up the devil.</v>

1520
01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:20.870
<v Speaker 4>They'll bring up God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God blessed the troops.</v>

1521
01:10:20.871 --> 01:10:21.704
<v Speaker 4>Got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll never say Satan is at work and </v>

1522
01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:26.940
<v Speaker 4>Satan is in the hearts and minds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1523
01:10:26.941 --> 01:10:27.321
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1524
01:10:27.321 --> 01:10:28.154
<v Speaker 4>these enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They never say that because it's so </v>

1525
01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:30.884
<v Speaker 4>preposterous that we're slowly as </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolution as thinking evolves and </v>

1526
01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:37.664
<v Speaker 4>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know evolutions where I'm worried for </v>

1527
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:41.720
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as it improves and expands,</v>

1528
01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:45.260
<v Speaker 4>we are no longer accepting the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Satan.</v>

1529
01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.960
<v Speaker 4>Like culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>culturally,</v>

1530
01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:51.530
<v Speaker 4>Satan was an accepted thing hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1531
01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.393
<v Speaker 4>It was parallel like he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you looked at the mentions of </v>

1532
01:10:54.921 --> 01:10:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Satan and dimensions of God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were right up there together.</v>

1533
01:10:57.861 --> 01:10:58.694
<v Speaker 4>You're blaming Satan on the bad things </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you praising God for the good </v>

1534
01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:02.600
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's no longer the case.</v>

1535
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:03.583
<v Speaker 4>Now we just cling to these absurd </v>
<v Speaker 4>notions of this one that's watching us </v>

1536
01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:08.864
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you've got to sort of peripherally </v>

1537
01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:15.630
<v Speaker 4>mention it and casually reference it </v>
<v Speaker 4>without going into detail.</v>

1538
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:18.030
<v Speaker 4>And you're allowed to do that because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes people think,</v>

1539
01:11:18.031 --> 01:11:19.410
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on the same page as me.</v>

1540
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.230
<v Speaker 4>You're a god feeling Kurt and Christian </v>
<v Speaker 4>man like myself,</v>

1541
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:24.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm a god fearing Christian man myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>

1542
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:26.490
<v Speaker 4>God bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God bless you as well.</v>

1543
01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:27.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you go out,</v>

1544
01:11:27.981 --> 01:11:30.750
<v Speaker 4>Satan is looking out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peyton's watching you right now,</v>

1545
01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:32.820
<v Speaker 4>Satan is just letting the air out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your tires.</v>

1546
01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:34.170
<v Speaker 4>Like you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1547
01:11:34.171 --> 01:11:35.910
<v Speaker 4>that guy's a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1548
01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:38.180
<v Speaker 4>like we've moved past Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1549
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.860
<v Speaker 4>But we haven't moved past Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly right.</v>

1550
01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Or the idea of God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though,</v>

1551
01:11:42.921 --> 01:11:43.754
<v Speaker 4>I mean if there is some all knowing </v>
<v Speaker 4>entity that is controlling everything </v>

1552
01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:51.750
<v Speaker 4>and is filled with love and has a grand </v>
<v Speaker 4>plan for the universe,</v>

1553
01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.793
<v Speaker 4>they have yet to show themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is all just a concept and an </v>

1554
01:11:55.621 --> 01:11:57.900
<v Speaker 4>idea with no basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact.</v>

1555
01:11:57.901 --> 01:11:58.734
<v Speaker 4>And as we have found more facts about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the nature of reality in the world </v>

1556
01:12:03.421 --> 01:12:06.330
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems more and more preposterous with</v>

1557
01:12:06.331 --> 01:12:07.164
<v Speaker 4>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every day the scientists come up with </v>

1558
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.193
<v Speaker 4>these new equations that show the the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way the universe could have possibly be </v>

1559
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.823
<v Speaker 4>been formed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the every day that these fucking </v>

1560
01:12:19.681 --> 01:12:21.960
<v Speaker 4>guys at the cern laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1561
01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:22.794
<v Speaker 4>they're the large Hadron collider,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are discovering these what were at one </v>

1562
01:12:26.941 --> 01:12:27.774
<v Speaker 4>time theoretical particles showing them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be true in their calculations to be </v>

1563
01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:32.860
<v Speaker 4>correct.</v>

1564
01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:33.693
<v Speaker 4>We're having.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a deeper and deeper </v>

1565
01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:37.620
<v Speaker 4>understanding of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we think now,</v>

1566
01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:41.280
<v Speaker 4>we love to think that right now that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were filled with knowledge and we'd love</v>

1567
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:44.520
<v Speaker 4>to look at ourselves now and look at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>past as well.</v>

1568
01:12:44.521 --> 01:12:46.800
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we know now,</v>

1569
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.770
<v Speaker 4>but if we looked in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would have the same ideas.</v>

1570
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.753
<v Speaker 4>They would look back at those poor </v>
<v Speaker 4>monkey people with the bananas and then </v>

1571
01:12:53.021 --> 01:12:55.200
<v Speaker 4>they'll go those fucking dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even know houses yet.</v>

1572
01:12:55.530 --> 01:13:00.530
<v Speaker 4>We will one day look back at 2015 like </v>
<v Speaker 4>what a bunch of fools,</v>

1573
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.690
<v Speaker 4>what a bunch of ridiculous people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were still,</v>

1574
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:04.763
<v Speaker 4>they have this incredibly complicated </v>
<v Speaker 4>society in this wonderful access to </v>

1575
01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:13.260
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet they were still shackled down by</v>

1576
01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:14.094
<v Speaker 4>ideology and killing each other over </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion and ancient superstitions that </v>

1577
01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:23.040
<v Speaker 4>the dictated their behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what a weird time to be in.</v>

1578
01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.013
<v Speaker 4>They'll look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll look at us now in 2015 they'll </v>

1579
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:27.383
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a strange time this is adolescent </v>

1580
01:13:30.331 --> 01:13:31.270
<v Speaker 4>period of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1581
01:13:31.271 --> 01:13:34.510
<v Speaker 4>of enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're just still there,</v>

1582
01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:35.344
<v Speaker 4>still concentrating on stupid shit in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking president of the United </v>

1583
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:42.690
<v Speaker 4>States can openly talk about God and </v>
<v Speaker 4>every and no and no one goes,</v>

1584
01:13:42.691 --> 01:13:44.250
<v Speaker 4>what is God?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you saying?</v>

1585
01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:45.203
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think Jesus came back from the </v>

1586
01:13:46.651 --> 01:13:47.700
<v Speaker 4>dead weight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>

1587
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.713
<v Speaker 4>Do you think someone walked on water?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe in the literal </v>

1588
01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:50.904
<v Speaker 4>translation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you an old testament guy or a new </v>

1589
01:13:52.501 --> 01:13:54.510
<v Speaker 4>testament guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well off a new instruments?</v>

<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1591
01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:55.793
<v Speaker 4>Well the New Testament was made by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Constantine who was a fucking Roman </v>

1592
01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:02.190
<v Speaker 4>emperor who wasn't even Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't even believe it.</v>

1593
01:14:02.191 --> 01:14:03.000
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he became a Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was fucking death bed.</v>

1596
01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:09.260
<v Speaker 4>Like that's when he became a Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1597
01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.950
<v Speaker 4>these people that are really into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>new testament and like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'll</v>

1599
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.100
<v Speaker 2>talk about old testament shit and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>get mad at me on twitter.</v>

1600
01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:17.740

1602

<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new testament,</v>

1603
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.610
<v Speaker 2>because the new testament is utter horse</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1604
01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.660
<v Speaker 2>It was created by a bishop and a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>emperor.</v>

1605
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.673
<v Speaker 2>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like established religious fact </v>

1606
01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:32.800
<v Speaker 2>like everyone knows where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

1607
01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:35.320
<v Speaker 2>it was written hundreds of years after </v>
<v Speaker 2>the death of Jesus.</v>

1608
01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:36.363
<v Speaker 2>So what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're talking about the old </v>

1609
01:14:38.051 --> 01:14:39.490
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go deep.</v>

<v Speaker 2>ridiculous aspects of that and tell me </v>
<v Speaker 2>you basing your life on that because </v>

1613
01:14:49.331 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 2>that's even more preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found them in clay pots in Qumran,</v>

1614
01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:54.003
<v Speaker 2>written on animal skins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people thought the world was flat </v>

1615
01:14:56.081 --> 01:14:58.390
<v Speaker 2>and a son was 17 miles away and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

1617
01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.600
<v Speaker 2>They really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to,</v>

1618
01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.493
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're going to live our </v>

1619
01:15:03.311 --> 01:15:04.360
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

1620
01:15:04.361 --> 01:15:07.780
<v Speaker 2>This is all the facts we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucked the whole large Hadron collider.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck those dudes with their telescopes.</v>

1624
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Now that we're going to base it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>leather skins and and and,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1626
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Like really that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

1627
01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:23.973
<v Speaker 2>that's the conversation we're having </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about ideological </v>

1628
01:15:26.561 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 2>religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a thing of beauty by the way.</v>

1629
01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a thing of beauty,</v>

1630
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:35.290
<v Speaker 2>what it is and people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you renew fuse your nurse school,</v>

1631
01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:36.550
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you believe in?</v>

1632
01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:37.384
<v Speaker 2>I had a guy yell at me at a comedy club </v>
<v Speaker 2>once cause I did this bit about </v>

1633
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.730
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do this bit about scientology,</v>

1634
01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:43.803
<v Speaker 2>about watching a scientology documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my mom who made me go to Catholic </v>

1635
01:15:46.961 --> 01:15:49.340
<v Speaker 2>school and how my mom thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology's religion.</v>

1636
01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:50.350
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1637
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:53.530
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

1638
01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:55.930
<v Speaker 2>what do you believe in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you believe in?</v>

1639
01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Like what if I have to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

1640
01:15:57.571 --> 01:15:58.404
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I have to believe I believe in </v>

1641
01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:00.184
<v Speaker 2>everything that has been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that this is made out of wood </v>

1642
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:04.080
<v Speaker 2>and I see it when I'm proven wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1643
01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:06.730
<v Speaker 2>When change your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's back to the Jujitsu thing again.</v>

1644
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:07.833
<v Speaker 2>But when you also think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what an unbelievable arrogance to think </v>

1645
01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:13.120
<v Speaker 2>that you know the will of the creator of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>

1646
01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:14.163
<v Speaker 2>You know what he wants you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where he wants you to put your </v>

1647
01:16:15.731 --> 01:16:16.900
<v Speaker 2>genitals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1648
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.943
<v Speaker 2>like you said it philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the problem of induction or </v>

1649
01:16:20.171 --> 01:16:21.820
<v Speaker 2>looking at the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the past,</v>

1650
01:16:21.821 --> 01:16:23.140
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resembling the past.</v>

1651
01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:24.573
<v Speaker 2>And we will look back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's absolutely no question in my </v>

1652
01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:29.020
<v Speaker 2>mind that you're correct and we will </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1653
01:16:29.021 --> 01:16:30.250
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you believe this?</v>

1654
01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:31.083
<v Speaker 2>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could we possibly have believed </v>

1655
01:16:32.111 --> 01:16:32.944
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting to me is we know </v>

1656
01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:35.494
<v Speaker 2>that that will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we know that that will happen and </v>

1657
01:16:37.871 --> 01:16:40.120
<v Speaker 2>it's an opportunity for us to reflect </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

1658
01:16:40.121 --> 01:16:42.100
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we being arrogant right now?</v>

1659
01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.313
<v Speaker 2>W are we thinking we know things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we pretending to know things when we </v>

1660
01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:47.440
<v Speaker 2>don't know them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1661
01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that a lot of that God talk is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of arrogance.</v>

1662
01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a type of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1663
01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:59.410
<v Speaker 2>wanting to assert how moral they are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they reap advantages.</v>

1664
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.060
<v Speaker 2>The president or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1665
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very complicated social </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even political problem,</v>

1666
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a type of arrogance.</v>

1667
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.293
<v Speaker 4>It is definitely a type of arrogance and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also a way that people stab the </v>

1668
01:17:13.821 --> 01:17:14.654
<v Speaker 4>moral high ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They establish a dominant social </v>

1669
01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:19.880
<v Speaker 4>position over you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the people love to do that.</v>

1670
01:17:19.881 --> 01:17:21.830
<v Speaker 4>They'd love to do that with their pious </v>
<v Speaker 4>attitude.</v>

1671
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:22.664
<v Speaker 4>What they're doing is by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by them accepting these religious </v>

1672
01:17:25.131 --> 01:17:28.010
<v Speaker 4>tenants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are somehow are superior to you.</v>

1673
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:29.930
<v Speaker 4>And some people don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1674
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:33.610
<v Speaker 4>I shared a hunting camp with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to names names.</v>

1675
01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:34.653
<v Speaker 4>A wonderful guy who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an elk hunter and this guy would get up </v>

1676
01:17:37.911 --> 01:17:39.950
<v Speaker 4>in the morning every day before </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

1677
01:17:39.951 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 4>And we've got up fucking early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1678
01:17:41.601 --> 01:17:44.630
<v Speaker 4>we would leave the camp by 6:00 AM so </v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy was up,</v>

1679
01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:48.530
<v Speaker 4>I would get up to take a shower like </v>
<v Speaker 4>5:00 AM and this dude was up reading the</v>

1680
01:17:48.531 --> 01:17:49.364
<v Speaker 4>Bible and he never talked about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he never talked about like God or Jesus </v>

1681
01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:55.550
<v Speaker 4>or any of the rules.</v>

1682
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:56.383
<v Speaker 4>But to him it was a way that he explored</v>
<v Speaker 4>these ideas and how he related to the </v>

1683
01:18:02.121 --> 01:18:05.840
<v Speaker 4>world and in application.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy was a fantastic,</v>

1684
01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:08.000
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a wonderful guy.</v>

1685
01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:11.720
<v Speaker 4>Like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was kind and it was like when you had</v>

1686
01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:15.860
<v Speaker 4>conversations with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was generous and it was very friendly</v>

1687
01:18:15.861 --> 01:18:20.861
<v Speaker 4>and he was curious and he would ask like</v>
<v Speaker 4>these really introspective questions,</v>

1688
01:18:21.051 --> 01:18:23.840
<v Speaker 4>like he was a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what matters.</v>

1689
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:28.870
<v Speaker 4>I think it matters less whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone is an atheist or not or a Hindu.</v>

1690
01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:31.850
<v Speaker 4>And I think what matters is how we treat</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>

1691
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:34.010
<v Speaker 4>I think what manages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're kind to people,</v>

1692
01:18:34.011 --> 01:18:34.844
<v Speaker 4>if we listen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we do our best to engage them </v>

1693
01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:41.270
<v Speaker 4>honestly and authentically and often we </v>
<v Speaker 4>get too caught up in,</v>

1694
01:18:41.271 --> 01:18:42.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is someone's real,</v>

1695
01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.050
<v Speaker 4>especially now with the Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 4>going bizarre,</v>

1696
01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.940
<v Speaker 4>bizarre fuck with this whole Islam </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1697
01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:49.910
<v Speaker 4>It's just crazy and disgraceful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1698
01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:50.744
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you see that video is a fantastic </v>

1699
01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:56.750
<v Speaker 4>video that's just been put out recently </v>
<v Speaker 4>I think by some guys in Holland.</v>

1700
01:18:56.890 --> 01:18:57.723
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they were because it's in another </v>

1701
01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:00.530
<v Speaker 4>language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1702
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:01.401
<v Speaker 4>the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:19:01.401 --> 01:19:04.400
<v Speaker 4>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put a cover of the,</v>

1704
01:19:04.401 --> 01:19:05.234
<v Speaker 4>put the Koran cover on the Bible and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then read passages to people on the </v>

1705
01:19:09.051 --> 01:19:11.120
<v Speaker 4>street and they asked him what do they </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about this?</v>

1706
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.560
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

1707
01:19:12.561 --> 01:19:13.394
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is ridiculous and this is </v>

1708
01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 4>outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was all from the Bible,</v>

1709
01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.273
<v Speaker 4>like Hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hilarious shit that a lot of people </v>

1710
01:19:20.481 --> 01:19:25.370
<v Speaker 4>don't know is in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you even bring this up,</v>

1711
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:27.320
<v Speaker 4>people already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're questioning their beliefs.</v>

1712
01:19:27.321 --> 01:19:30.290
<v Speaker 4>So they start foaming at the mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuming and that,</v>

1713
01:19:30.291 --> 01:19:31.124
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can feel my phone get heavy from hate </v>

1714
01:19:33.081 --> 01:19:33.980
<v Speaker 4>tweets right now.</v>

1715
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.053
<v Speaker 4>It's just coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking question in my view of </v>

1716
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:41.300
<v Speaker 4>reality and it makes me uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 4>when not going to work.</v>

1717
01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.840
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But isn't that the exact same issue with</v>

1718
01:19:44.841 --> 01:19:46.730
<v Speaker 4>someone doing a fantasy based martial </v>
<v Speaker 4>arts?</v>

1719
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:50.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh a hundred percent I've had </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations with people where they are</v>

1720
01:19:50.121 --> 01:19:53.510
<v Speaker 4>fucking furious at me because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe in their death touch.</v>

1721
01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.700
<v Speaker 4>I've had conversations with people they </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1722
01:19:55.701 --> 01:19:56.534
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are arrogant and your belief and </v>

1723
01:19:58.281 --> 01:20:00.690
<v Speaker 4>martial arts and you're in a position of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1724
01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:05.700
<v Speaker 4>of influence because of your work for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the UFC and what you're doing is you're,</v>

1725
01:20:05.831 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause you're not telling the truth</v>

1726
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.020
<v Speaker 2>about certain stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1727
01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.360
<v Speaker 2>Like did you stop abandoned it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1728
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:13.660
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1729
01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:14.790
<v Speaker 2>if you're like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1730
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:18.150
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was martial arts and that the doe Jang</v>

1731
01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:18.984
<v Speaker 2>was so sacred to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't need to have sex with my </v>

1732
01:20:20.041 --> 01:20:20.874
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That represents like such an important </v>

1733
01:20:24.541 --> 01:20:25.374
<v Speaker 2>part of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so lucky for me that it </v>

1734
01:20:27.901 --> 01:20:28.734
<v Speaker 2>happened during my formative period </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was exposed to reality at a </v>

1735
01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:33.940
<v Speaker 2>young age where I had to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1736
01:20:33.941 --> 01:20:34.950
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

1737
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to accept that these techniques </v>

1738
01:20:37.951 --> 01:20:40.470
<v Speaker 2>don't really work all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them work,</v>

1739
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:43.500
<v Speaker 2>but you have to learn all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff for them to work at all.</v>

1740
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wonder about,</v>

1741
01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:48.390
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so few people have written about this.</v>

1742
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:51.930
<v Speaker 2>I wonder about the experience that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had of that.</v>

1743
01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:53.573
<v Speaker 2>And I had of that we were in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>boat realizing over time that these </v>

1744
01:20:57.001 --> 01:20:59.430
<v Speaker 2>things just didn't work and we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasted our time.</v>

1745
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:03.780
<v Speaker 2>And I wonder how similar that is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's escaped from a faith,</v>

1746
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 100% people that have escaped from </v>

1747
01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.910
<v Speaker 2>cults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had folks on that have a,</v>

1748
01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:12.630
<v Speaker 2>used to be in cults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kurt Metzger is a perfect example,</v>

1749
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:15.420
<v Speaker 2>is a hilarious standup comedian friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mine and you know,</v>

1750
01:21:15.421 --> 01:21:18.840
<v Speaker 2>he was in Jehovah's Witness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it yeah,</v>

1751
01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1752
01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1753
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:25.680
<v Speaker 2>he won't accept any stupid shit now </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he's like,</v>

1754
01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:26.311
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1755
01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:27.144
<v Speaker 2>like when it comes to the regressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>left and some of these ideologies where </v>

1756
01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:31.644
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at something in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way and you can't look at it in </v>

1757
01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.570
<v Speaker 2>another way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a dogma and he's like,</v>

1758
01:21:36.571 --> 01:21:36.751
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1759
01:21:36.751 --> 01:21:37.800
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this before.</v>

1760
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:39.820
<v Speaker 2>I know what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing is you're,</v>

1761
01:21:39.821 --> 01:21:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you're saying you have to think a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>

1762
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:43.260
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>

1763
01:21:43.261 --> 01:21:44.094
<v Speaker 2>Like it can be discussed like you q can </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss certain aspects of people's </v>

1764
01:21:48.001 --> 01:21:52.650
<v Speaker 2>behavior or gender identity or gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronouns are in fact,</v>

1765
01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.590
<v Speaker 2>not only can it be discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be discussion.</v>

1766
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:56.693
<v Speaker 2>We have to have arenas and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have been writing about this </v>

1767
01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:01.374
<v Speaker 2>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about in my book and I tweeted </v>

1768
01:22:02.761 --> 01:22:04.800
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we have,</v>

1769
01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:09.420
<v Speaker 2>if we're not allowed an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a conversation than extremists will</v>

1770
01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:11.660
<v Speaker 2>step in with the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like trump is a great example.</v>

1771
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.600
<v Speaker 2>So we have to create spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about spaces.</v>

1772
01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.210
<v Speaker 2>This is probably another offshoot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation space.</v>

1773
01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:19.230
<v Speaker 2>The regressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1774
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:22.950
<v Speaker 2>We need to create opportunities for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to,</v>

1775
01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:27.150
<v Speaker 2>for sincere inquirers to engage things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now we don't have that.</v>

1776
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:28.710
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1777
01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:29.843
<v Speaker 2>I can bring it back to Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could just think about what </v>

1778
01:22:31.531 --> 01:22:33.720
<v Speaker 2>would happen if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a technique,</v>

1779
01:22:33.721 --> 01:22:34.411
<v Speaker 2>you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1780
01:22:34.411 --> 01:22:34.651
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1781
01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:35.790
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sacred.</v>

1782
01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:38.730
<v Speaker 2>We don't question it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you'd never get to the truth.</v>

1783
01:22:38.731 --> 01:22:39.564
<v Speaker 2>You deny people the opportunities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to figure out things for </v>

1784
01:22:43.021 --> 01:22:45.030
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100%,</v>

1785
01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:48.300
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think martial arts is an excellent</v>

1786
01:22:48.301 --> 01:22:52.080
<v Speaker 2>vehicle for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one of the things that was explained</v>

1787
01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:54.510
<v Speaker 2>to me when I was really young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really did sink in.</v>

1788
01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:55.530
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1789
01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:57.060
<v Speaker 2>instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1790
01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:59.290
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1791
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:03.150
<v Speaker 2>a disciple of general chase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young [inaudible] who was the founder of</v>

1792
01:23:03.151 --> 01:23:04.050
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1793
01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:06.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he taught it to troops and he was like,</v>

1794
01:23:06.150 --> 01:23:06.983
<v Speaker 4>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy's like really honed the </v>

1795
01:23:09.371 --> 01:23:14.371
<v Speaker 4>techniques for maximum power and </v>
<v Speaker 4>efficiency and leverage.</v>

1796
01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:16.210
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1797
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:17.343
<v Speaker 4>they had this idea that martial arts was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a vehicle for developing human </v>

1798
01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:21.760
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1799
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:24.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read that when I was like 15,</v>

1800
01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.720
<v Speaker 4>and I've always used that phrase because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a,</v>

1801
01:23:27.721 --> 01:23:29.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such a massive,</v>

1802
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.410
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean by such a massive what,</v>

1803
01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:33.101
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1804
01:23:33.101 --> 01:23:34.300
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1805
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:40.080
<v Speaker 4>it's so clear when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you understand that we will,</v>

1806
01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:44.890
<v Speaker 4>you go through life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life is filled with questions,</v>

1807
01:23:44.891 --> 01:23:47.080
<v Speaker 4>a diversity puzzles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>

1808
01:23:47.081 --> 01:23:49.570
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out the questions you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to ask of yourself.</v>

1809
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Examining your own behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>objective reasoning.</v>

1810
01:23:53.471 --> 01:23:54.304
<v Speaker 4>There's all these different variables </v>
<v Speaker 4>that come into play when it comes to </v>

1811
01:23:56.021 --> 01:23:59.050
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think those are highlighted in the</v>

1812
01:23:59.051 --> 01:23:59.884
<v Speaker 4>realm of martial arts because mark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can land a kick and you knock </v>

1813
01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:05.134
<v Speaker 4>someone out and then that that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that worked and you were in the </v>

1814
01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:09.243
<v Speaker 4>ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like especially the ultimate fighting </v>

1815
01:24:10.721 --> 01:24:12.160
<v Speaker 4>championship is a perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1816
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:13.143
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no higher level of problem </v>

1817
01:24:16.901 --> 01:24:17.734
<v Speaker 4>solving than problem solving with dire </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical consequences because your </v>

1818
01:24:22.331 --> 01:24:25.120
<v Speaker 4>emotions are on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your fears,</v>

1819
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.790
<v Speaker 4>your anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so,</v>

1820
01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:31.510
<v Speaker 4>there's so many fight or flight </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms in place,</v>

1821
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.640
<v Speaker 4>there's self doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1822
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:34.533
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much discipline did you truly </v>

1823
01:24:36.221 --> 01:24:39.520
<v Speaker 4>execute in training?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you give everything you had?</v>

1824
01:24:39.521 --> 01:24:43.540
<v Speaker 4>Did you reach your full potential?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people go through life without even</v>

1825
01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:47.050
<v Speaker 4>coming close to their full potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they live life in this,</v>

1826
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:52.350
<v Speaker 4>this weird fog of uncertainty and of </v>
<v Speaker 4>regret and of,</v>

1827
01:24:53.891 --> 01:24:54.724
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of just this feeling that they're not </v>

1828
01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.633
<v Speaker 4>accomplishing what they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're not achieving their full </v>

1829
01:25:00.581 --> 01:25:01.414
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that martial arts is a vehicle for </v>

1830
01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:04.144
<v Speaker 4>developing potential because through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>very difficult training and through </v>

1831
01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:11.740
<v Speaker 4>pushing yourself when you don't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

1832
01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:16.210
<v Speaker 4>and through this overwhelming desire for</v>
<v Speaker 4>comfort,</v>

1833
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:17.710
<v Speaker 4>we don't want to get out of bed.</v>

1834
01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:18.643
<v Speaker 4>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to do the training where </v>

1835
01:25:19.691 --> 01:25:22.210
<v Speaker 4>you would rather just blow it off and </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't go to class.</v>

1836
01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.480
<v Speaker 4>By forcing yourself to do that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it engages the muscles of discipline.</v>

1837
01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:29.440
<v Speaker 4>The inner muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:25:29.441 --> 01:25:30.274
<v Speaker 4>And it also you understand about </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplishing goals and about about </v>

1839
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:37.840
<v Speaker 4>reality facing things that it's just so </v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

1840
01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:38.880
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Jujitsu.</v>

1841
01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:42.390
<v Speaker 4>When you defeat somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you,</v>

1842
01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:44.290
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you work really hard and you tap someone</v>

1843
01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:47.350
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a sense of,</v>

1844
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:49.810
<v Speaker 4>you get a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll speak for myself.</v>

1845
01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:51.280
<v Speaker 4>I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like wow,</v>

1846
01:25:51.281 --> 01:25:53.200
<v Speaker 4>like I worked for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried hard,</v>

1847
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:57.430
<v Speaker 4>I work on my baseball back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>choke now and I feel pretty good.</v>

1848
01:25:57.970 --> 01:26:02.970
<v Speaker 4>So that activity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hard work brought you to a point in</v>

1849
01:26:03.471 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 4>which</v>

1850
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:09.110
<v Speaker 2>you would tap somebody out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a consequence of that,</v>

1851
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:10.183
<v Speaker 2>you feel self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we have done is we have inverted </v>

1852
01:26:13.881 --> 01:26:17.630
<v Speaker 2>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tried to teach self esteem absent any</v>

1853
01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:20.810
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the way it works.</v>

1854
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.823
<v Speaker 2>Self esteem is a byproduct of hard work </v>
<v Speaker 2>of something that you have done as a </v>

1855
01:26:25.191 --> 01:26:27.950
<v Speaker 2>direct result of an accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every,</v>

1856
01:26:27.951 --> 01:26:28.784
<v Speaker 2>every few years they give Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give kids all around the world to </v>

1857
01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:32.360
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this in um,</v>

1858
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Martin is the conspiracy of ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 2>many years ago,</v>

1859
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.000
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the to the test is like,</v>

1860
01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people in the world,</v>

1861
01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:41.660
<v Speaker 2>you know the Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the industrialized world,</v>

1862
01:26:41.710 --> 01:26:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>German center,</v>

1863
01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.813
<v Speaker 2>they took this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you think you did in relation to </v>

1864
01:26:45.771 --> 01:26:46.604
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans consistently score on the </v>

1865
01:26:47.931 --> 01:26:51.650
<v Speaker 2>bottom core tile in terms of their math </v>
<v Speaker 2>and science,</v>

1866
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.150
<v Speaker 2>how well they did and in comparatively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they score extraordinarily high.</v>

1867
01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost always in terms of self esteem.</v>

1868
01:26:58.910 --> 01:27:02.090
<v Speaker 2>We have taught the wrong things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We focused on the wrong things.</v>

1869
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Our school systems have been oriented </v>
<v Speaker 2>toward the wrong things.</v>

1870
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:07.123
<v Speaker 2>And I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just bring that back to Jujitsu </v>

1871
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.610
<v Speaker 2>and look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

1872
01:27:10.690 --> 01:27:12.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't possibly,</v>

1873
01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.840
<v Speaker 2>you could teach someone all of a self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you walk in,</v>

1874
01:27:14.841 --> 01:27:15.674
<v Speaker 2>they get a white belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you teach him to feel good about </v>

1875
01:27:16.611 --> 01:27:17.720
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this to this,</v>

1876
01:27:17.721 --> 01:27:19.100
<v Speaker 2>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does it work?</v>

1877
01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:20.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1878
01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:21.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1879
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.353
<v Speaker 2>you could get a lot of the lessons from </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts out of a lot of difficult </v>

1880
01:27:27.231 --> 01:27:28.640
<v Speaker 2>endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1881
01:27:28.641 --> 01:27:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think you get the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>solving aspect at the,</v>

1882
01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:32.413
<v Speaker 2>it's such a high level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some people find that in rock </v>

1883
01:27:35.631 --> 01:27:38.110
<v Speaker 2>climbing because it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in,</v>

1884
01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:38.953
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in accomplishing that and then getting </v>

1885
01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 2>through that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1886
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:46.330
<v Speaker 2>you learn about yourself and learn about</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ability to Chicago adversity and to</v>

1887
01:27:46.821 --> 01:27:47.750
<v Speaker 2>face your fears.</v>

1888
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.153
<v Speaker 2>But I just think that martial arts is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>more intense version of it because </v>

1889
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:56.900
<v Speaker 2>there's all this connected to combat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this,</v>

1890
01:27:56.901 --> 01:27:59.300
<v Speaker 2>the physical challenge of overcoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>another human being.</v>

1891
01:27:59.301 --> 01:28:00.134
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of our biggest fears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of our biggest fears other than </v>

1892
01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:06.080
<v Speaker 2>falling off of a mountain is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated by another human being,</v>

1893
01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:10.790
<v Speaker 2>getting your ass kicked and conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we have this long history of war.</v>

1894
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to,</v>

1895
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I heard that podcast the Jocko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1896
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:16.330
<v Speaker 2>The seal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:18.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a great podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an awesome guy.</v>

1898
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:19.303
<v Speaker 2>But we were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation that I had with my friend </v>

1899
01:28:21.831 --> 01:28:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Duncan trussell where I said that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1900
01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:24.913
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of a revelation for the both</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us and like human history is a </v>

1901
01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:31.010
<v Speaker 2>history of the wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when we talk about human history.</v>

1902
01:28:31.011 --> 01:28:33.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like the stuff that happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the wars and you know,</v>

1903
01:28:33.951 --> 01:28:36.470
<v Speaker 2>some inventions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's mostly the wars.</v>

1904
01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.840
<v Speaker 2>That's most of the history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1905
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:43.510
<v Speaker 2>where whether it's world war one or </v>
<v Speaker 2>world war two or Vietnam or you know,</v>

1906
01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.353
<v Speaker 2>there's all these different conflicts </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that happened and those are the </v>

1907
01:28:47.481 --> 01:28:49.280
<v Speaker 2>bulk of our history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we,</v>

1908
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:53.240
<v Speaker 2>when we consider the errors in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we consider the,</v>

1909
01:28:53.241 --> 01:28:54.074
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ages of the different things that </v>

1910
01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:55.814
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we consider like kingus Khan and </v>

1911
01:28:57.801 --> 01:29:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Napoleon Alexander the Great and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different things that happen.</v>

1912
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 2>We're considering war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1913
01:29:02.491 --> 01:29:03.324
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go off on a little tangent if you </v>

1914
01:29:04.471 --> 01:29:06.480
<v Speaker 2>don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me think,</v>

1915
01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.033
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about talking to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy over there about life and the </v>

1916
01:29:10.951 --> 01:29:13.050
<v Speaker 2>universe in this thing called the Fermi </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradox.</v>

1917
01:29:13.051 --> 01:29:13.884
<v Speaker 2>Where is everybody and I wonder if that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Fermi paradox being the amount of </v>

1918
01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.080
<v Speaker 2>life that must be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1919
01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:21.053
<v Speaker 2>like why haven't we been contacted yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I consider that to be just an </v>

1920
01:29:23.851 --> 01:29:24.684
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily interesting question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder if what you just said that </v>

1921
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:30.150
<v Speaker 2>our history has been a history of war.</v>

1922
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:31.583
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1923
01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if inherent in every species </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has evolved,</v>

1924
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.730
<v Speaker 2>they've had a similar history of war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1925
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:40.583
<v Speaker 2>because they've been subject to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different evolutionary mechanisms and </v>

1926
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:44.040
<v Speaker 2>pressures and such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1927
01:29:44.041 --> 01:29:46.080
<v Speaker 2>like different atmospheres would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1928
01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.290
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder if it's conflict over </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

1929
01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:50.520
<v Speaker 2>conflict over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1930
01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:51.773
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they have another gender or </v>

1931
01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:55.860
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's just intrinsic in the</v>

1932
01:29:55.861 --> 01:29:59.460
<v Speaker 2>nature of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

1933
01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:00.383
<v Speaker 2>I think what's intrinsic in the nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>of life is that sort of problem solving </v>

1934
01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:08.780
<v Speaker 2>and that nature wants to find the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>method of achieving a goal.</v>

1935
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:13.200
<v Speaker 2>And so the methods that are ineffective </v>
<v Speaker 2>die off.</v>

1936
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.273
<v Speaker 2>And that's why 90% of the living species</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been on this planet are </v>

1937
01:30:17.761 --> 01:30:18.594
<v Speaker 2>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They no longer exist because they </v>

1938
01:30:20.461 --> 01:30:23.250
<v Speaker 2>weren't effective enough to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep reproducing.</v>

1939
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.570
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1940
01:30:24.571 --> 01:30:26.760
<v Speaker 2>we'll a lot of them because people wipe </v>
<v Speaker 2>them out.</v>

1941
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:30.900
<v Speaker 2>People are evil and people are horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are the dominant species.</v>

1942
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:32.423
<v Speaker 2>What species do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean many animals have wiped out </v>

1943
01:30:34.471 --> 01:30:35.221
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1944
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:37.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real issue right now with wild</v>

1945
01:30:37.741 --> 01:30:42.741
<v Speaker 2>pigs and ground nesting birds because </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild pigs being an invasive species,</v>

1946
01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:43.584
<v Speaker 2>they're dealing with these birds that </v>
<v Speaker 2>nest on the ground that didn't have </v>

1947
01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:49.020
<v Speaker 2>these animals hunting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1948
01:30:49.021 --> 01:30:51.690
<v Speaker 2>or they shouldn't even say hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're eating their eggs.</v>

1949
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:52.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's just an ineffective way to </v>

1950
01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:56.801
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:30:56.801 --> 01:30:57.634
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an ineffective way to take care of </v>

1952
01:30:58.831 --> 01:30:59.664
<v Speaker 2>your eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't leave them on the ground and a </v>

1953
01:31:00.571 --> 01:31:01.404
<v Speaker 2>place where these fucking pigs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>rooting up everything and eating </v>

1954
01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:07.140
<v Speaker 2>everything in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they go ahead.</v>

1955
01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:07.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

1956
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:09.000
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't adapt,</v>

1957
01:31:09.001 --> 01:31:09.930
<v Speaker 2>then there'll be no more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1958
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.860
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are Gone.</v>

1959
01:31:10.861 --> 01:31:11.760
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

1960
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so evil.</v>

1961
01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.613
<v Speaker 2>It's so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you want a world filled with only </v>

1962
01:31:16.890 --> 01:31:18.990
<v Speaker 2>the spotted owl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1963
01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1964
01:31:19.450 --> 01:31:21.600
<v Speaker 2>the spotted owl dies off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cause it sucked.</v>

1965
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:23.130
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1966
01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we should kill the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spotted owl,</v>

1967
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:27.090
<v Speaker 2>but the motherfucker didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1968
01:31:27.091 --> 01:31:30.180
<v Speaker 2>And the other animals are still here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eagles are still here and got,</v>

1969
01:31:30.181 --> 01:31:31.014
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't want a world filled with </v>

1970
01:31:31.711 --> 01:31:34.410
<v Speaker 2>all eagles either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a competition between eagles</v>

1971
01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:36.210
<v Speaker 2>in salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the eagles eat all the salmon,</v>

1972
01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:38.090
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be pissed at the eagles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1973
01:31:38.110 --> 01:31:39.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the eagles make the stamp,</v>

1974
01:31:39.570 --> 01:31:40.920
<v Speaker 2>the salmon extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be like,</v>

1975
01:31:40.921 --> 01:31:43.530
<v Speaker 2>what the Fuck Eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1976
01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:46.350
<v Speaker 2>it's funny when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're talking about this and uh,</v>

1977
01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:48.420
<v Speaker 2>in the back of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1978
01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:50.910
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the back of my head I'm thinking,</v>

1979
01:31:50.911 --> 01:31:51.790
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1980
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:54.000
<v Speaker 2>so we're having a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1981
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:56.430
<v Speaker 2>You and I are talking like if I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>as talk about that,</v>

1982
01:31:56.431 --> 01:31:57.264
<v Speaker 2>some of that stuff in class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you get the whole trigger </v>

1983
01:31:59.261 --> 01:32:00.700
<v Speaker 2>warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe spaces and stuff.</v>

1984
01:32:00.701 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people would freak out.</v>

1985
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.120
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really important.</v>

1986
01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about species,</v>

1987
01:32:05.771 --> 01:32:06.604
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about taking care of the </v>

1988
01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:10.444
<v Speaker 2>planet and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we weigh the concerns of the </v>

1989
01:32:12.671 --> 01:32:14.320
<v Speaker 2>spotted owl against the loggers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1990
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important things and the recourse to I'm</v>

1991
01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:20.260
<v Speaker 2>offended or I can't think of what makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>me upset.</v>

1992
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:25.240
<v Speaker 2>It makes me think that maybe soon </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities won't be the,</v>

1993
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'll have to have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions out of the universities,</v>

1994
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:30.460
<v Speaker 2>which really be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great for you in your show.</v>

1995
01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:32.170
<v Speaker 2>It's at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's terrible for the society.</v>

1996
01:32:32.171 --> 01:32:34.060
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible for the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

1997
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:38.770
<v Speaker 2>The universities in a sense of cease to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these sorts of conversations.</v>

1998
01:32:38.771 --> 01:32:43.771
<v Speaker 2>When you watch those children scream at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that professor at Yale and then you find</v>

1999
01:32:44.051 --> 01:32:46.180
<v Speaker 2>out that that guy was disciplined and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2000
01:32:46.181 --> 01:32:48.880
<v Speaker 2>why were they fired?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or they stepped down.</v>

2001
01:32:48.881 --> 01:32:49.661
<v Speaker 2>They resign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2002
01:32:49.661 --> 01:32:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I think they resigned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2003
01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.800
<v Speaker 2>we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

2004
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:57.470
<v Speaker 2>I think liberals are eating themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the left is literally arrested,</v>

2005
01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:58.840
<v Speaker 2>left breast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a difference.</v>

2006
01:32:58.860 --> 01:32:59.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2007
01:32:59.770 --> 01:33:01.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

2008
01:33:01.211 --> 01:33:06.211
<v Speaker 2>Because liberals in terms of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>change and progress and you know,</v>

2009
01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.610
<v Speaker 2>acceptance of a various different </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2010
01:33:09.611 --> 01:33:11.080
<v Speaker 2>I think that's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

2011
01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:12.213
<v Speaker 2>But I think that this regressive left </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this very rigid ideology of what </v>

2012
01:33:15.911 --> 01:33:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you can and can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2013
01:33:17.351 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 2>the behaviors which they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they engage in enforcing these things.</v>

2014
01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I think it's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that ultimately what's going</v>

2015
01:33:26.231 --> 01:33:29.860
<v Speaker 2>to happen is you're not going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these kind of structures,</v>

2016
01:33:29.861 --> 01:33:30.640
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2017
01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:34.060
<v Speaker 2>these places where people go and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be learning things online.</v>

2018
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:37.300
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a lot worse before it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets better.</v>

2019
01:33:37.301 --> 01:33:41.170
<v Speaker 2>And the hard thing is that many of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>listeners are not in academia.</v>

2020
01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:44.440
<v Speaker 2>And when we tell these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2021
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:46.270
<v Speaker 2>they think that this kind of just making</v>
<v Speaker 2>this too,</v>

2022
01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.233
<v Speaker 2>you are an academia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So explain it from a first person </v>

2023
01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.580
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2024
01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:53.920
<v Speaker 2>so I give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you an example.</v>

2025
01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had uh,</v>

2026
01:33:56.410 --> 01:34:00.710
<v Speaker 2>an individual and class and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual is not even part of the class</v>

2027
01:34:00.711 --> 01:34:01.544
<v Speaker 2>and they'll write in the syllabus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put in this entire class as a trigger </v>

2028
01:34:04.061 --> 01:34:05.920
<v Speaker 2>warning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole thing a to z.</v>

2029
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:07.600
<v Speaker 2>You had to write that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it in.</v>

2030
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:08.663
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're going to trigger warning </v>

2031
01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:11.830
<v Speaker 2>right in the syllabus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing,</v>

2032
01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:12.843
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that you even use </v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger warning trigger warning you so </v>

2033
01:34:14.711 --> 01:34:16.210
<v Speaker 2>fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the whole thing.</v>

2034
01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:16.570
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

2035
01:34:16.570 --> 01:34:17.403
<v Speaker 2>Here's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I was actually just brought up in </v>

2036
01:34:18.521 --> 01:34:23.521
<v Speaker 2>charges again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't do that then you know,</v>

2037
01:34:24.041 --> 01:34:25.480
<v Speaker 2>people can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you didn't warn me.</v>

2038
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Well actually I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wondered the first day,</v>

2039
01:34:27.971 --> 01:34:29.470
<v Speaker 2>it's an Ita.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of these in the syllabus.</v>

2040
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:32.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this [inaudible] it's bold in </v>
<v Speaker 2>caps in the syllabus,</v>

2041
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:33.663
<v Speaker 2>in increased font.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody knows your class is a </v>

2042
01:34:36.611 --> 01:34:37.444
<v Speaker 2>trigger warning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2045
01:34:40.661 --> 01:34:41.494
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the dean or whatever and he's </v>

2046
01:34:43.571 --> 01:34:45.160
<v Speaker 2>questioning about things and I'm like,</v>

2053
01:34:53.111 --> 01:34:55.690
<v Speaker 2>woman who's offended because darth vader</v>
<v Speaker 2>was black,</v>

2054
01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>right on MSNBC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Dave Rubin</v>

2055

<v Speaker 3>tweeted today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2056
01:34:58.941 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Which is one of the dumbest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>things I've ever seen in my life.</v>

2057
01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 3>She's saying that star wars is racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>because darth vader's black.</v>

2058
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>darth vader is not black.</v>

2059
01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:06.824
<v Speaker 3>They took the mask off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd dump con it's a white dial into </v>

2060
01:35:09.261 --> 01:35:10.820
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm an idiot.</v>

2061
01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:14.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say I can trump that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let me give you a couple examples.</v>

2062
01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skywalker's his son too.</v>

2063
01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:17.270
<v Speaker 3>And that's another white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking idiot.</v>

2064
01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.950
<v Speaker 3>So here's one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this woman is in the class and I give</v>

2065
01:35:21.951 --> 01:35:23.840
<v Speaker 3>a class at the end of the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>

2066
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:27.470
<v Speaker 3>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen so many microaggressions</v>

2067
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:29.990
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was nice to class,</v>

2068
01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:30.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge,</v>

2069
01:35:30.921 --> 01:35:34.070
<v Speaker 3>values and rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We use Sam Harris's book,</v>

2070
01:35:34.071 --> 01:35:36.770
<v Speaker 3>the moral landscape in that class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we talk about,</v>

2071
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:38.690
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talk about heavy things.</v>

2072
01:35:38.691 --> 01:35:40.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about Isis,</v>

2073
01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:42.110
<v Speaker 3>we talked about cultural relativism.</v>

2074
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:44.240
<v Speaker 3>We talked about is there a way to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cross cultural,</v>

2075
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about things that frankly,</v>

2076
01:35:46.581 --> 01:35:48.110
<v Speaker 3>people in college should be talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2077
01:35:48.111 --> 01:35:48.944
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they vote their citizens in a </v>

2078
01:35:50.331 --> 01:35:53.120
<v Speaker 3>democracy and they need to engage these </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

2079
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:56.840
<v Speaker 3>And College professors are petrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just in,</v>

2080
01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:57.773
<v Speaker 3>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that because it's a theft </v>

2081
01:35:59.601 --> 01:36:01.220
<v Speaker 3>of one's time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My case,</v>

2082
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't care because I have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>

2083
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:06.740
<v Speaker 3>I was told point blank that you'll never</v>
<v Speaker 3>get promoted.</v>

2084
01:36:06.741 --> 01:36:08.930
<v Speaker 3>You could publish 10 books from Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we won't promote you.</v>

2085
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:10.400
<v Speaker 3>So once I found that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2086
01:36:10.401 --> 01:36:11.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can talk about whatever I want,</v>

2087
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:13.160
<v Speaker 3>so why did they tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2088
01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:14.070
<v Speaker 3>let me fit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll finish.</v>

2089
01:36:14.970 --> 01:36:15.950
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2090
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:19.600
<v Speaker 3>so it was really interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she,</v>

2091
01:36:19.601 --> 01:36:20.434
<v Speaker 3>she gets up and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been so microaggressed the </v>

2092
01:36:22.641 --> 01:36:23.180
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2093
01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:24.013
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

2094
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:27.350
<v Speaker 3>This is someone that again was not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>the class,</v>

2095
01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:28.480
<v Speaker 3>there was not even in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2096
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:31.550
<v Speaker 3>in the class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2097
01:36:31.551 --> 01:36:32.241
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

2098
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:33.920
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what my first,</v>

2099
01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:34.754
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this person totally insane or did I </v>

2100
01:36:36.411 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 3>say something that was really horrible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were the micro aggressions that she</v>

2101
01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:40.520
<v Speaker 3>was citing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2102
01:36:40.521 --> 01:36:43.460
<v Speaker 3>well I focus in the racist part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

2103
01:36:43.461 --> 01:36:44.111
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did,</v>

2104
01:36:44.111 --> 01:36:46.400
<v Speaker 3>what did I say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did I say?</v>

2105
01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Because if I said something that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

2106
01:36:47.991 --> 01:36:50.720
<v Speaker 3>I really do want to know cause I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be that kind of person.</v>

2107
01:36:50.721 --> 01:36:52.310
<v Speaker 3>So that's their belief revision thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2108
01:36:52.311 --> 01:36:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2109
01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:57.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she said you used the example of star</v>

2110
01:36:57.111 --> 01:37:01.490
<v Speaker 3>trek in a class and you were shocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the woman,</v>

2111
01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 3>when she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she pointed the woman,</v>

2112
01:37:02.991 --> 01:37:04.370
<v Speaker 3>she didn't know she was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was shocked.</v>

2113
01:37:04.371 --> 01:37:05.204
<v Speaker 3>I was genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was almost flabbergasted that she </v>

2114
01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:09.860
<v Speaker 3>never heard of star Trek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I understand not watching it,</v>

2115
01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:12.850
<v Speaker 3>but she never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I used the example,</v>

2116
01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:15.860
<v Speaker 3>the example of Marilyn Manson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2117
01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:20.660
<v Speaker 3>She said that you assumed that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>participated in white culture.</v>

2118
01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.680
<v Speaker 3>So that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2119
01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Now I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

2120
01:37:26.690 --> 01:37:29.030
<v Speaker 3>so for Marilyn Manson is white culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a white guy.</v>

2122
01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:33.370
<v Speaker 3>So now we can really drill down in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and think about this.</v>

2123
01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Can to find a forum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black fans of Marilyn Manson,</v>

2124
01:37:35.721 --> 01:37:38.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to read it out for forum.</v>

2125
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:42.200
<v Speaker 3>So now we can really unpack this </v>
<v Speaker 3>insanity.</v>

2126
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:43.143
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2127
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:44.383
<v Speaker 3>so she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she tells people that everybody should </v>

2128
01:37:46.071 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 3>file a complaint against me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2129
01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:48.440
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>

2130
01:37:48.441 --> 01:37:50.420
<v Speaker 3>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2131
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:51.263
<v Speaker 3>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody is free to free to file </v>

2132
01:37:52.590 --> 01:37:53.810
<v Speaker 3>complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have the number?</v>

2133
01:37:53.811 --> 01:37:54.644
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you like,</v>

2134
01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:57.030
<v Speaker 3>we'll put it around on the board and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to have a conversation with me?</v>

2135
01:37:57.031 --> 01:37:57.451
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2136
01:37:57.451 --> 01:37:58.284
<v Speaker 3>you're too far gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're too far gone because you like </v>

2137
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:02.690
<v Speaker 3>start or you mentioned star trek far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2138
01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:03.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2139
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.970
<v Speaker 3>See that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the horse analysis and run one</v>

2140
01:38:05.971 --> 01:38:07.670
<v Speaker 3>lane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It runs off furiously in all directions.</v>

2141
01:38:07.671 --> 01:38:09.780
<v Speaker 3>And the whole thing is main thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do though,</v>

2142
01:38:09.781 --> 01:38:11.640
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't discuss it with you.</v>

2143
01:38:11.641 --> 01:38:13.740
<v Speaker 3>You're too far gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a symptom.</v>

2144
01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:16.140
<v Speaker 3>That's a symptom of space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Safe spaces,</v>

2145
01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:20.130
<v Speaker 3>trigger warnings and microaggressions in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind that goes in,</v>

2146
01:38:20.610 --> 01:38:21.443
<v Speaker 3>I cannot speak to you will not get </v>
<v Speaker 3>infected by your horrible ideas which </v>

2147
01:38:26.791 --> 01:38:30.420
<v Speaker 3>come from Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are too far gone or repent.</v>

2148
01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Repent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter.</v>

2149
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:33.180
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's,</v>

2150
01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:34.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what she's saying.</v>

2151
01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:36.840
<v Speaker 3>It is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very similar.</v>

2152
01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.720
<v Speaker 3>It's very similar on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying.</v>

2153
01:38:40.050 --> 01:38:42.900
<v Speaker 3>So here's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she black by the way,</v>

2154
01:38:42.901 --> 01:38:44.490
<v Speaker 3>cause it'd be awesome if she was white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2155
01:38:44.491 --> 01:38:47.670
<v Speaker 3>she was his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was Hispanic.</v>

2156
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that that she was,</v>

2157
01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:52.050
<v Speaker 3>or maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know,</v>

2158
01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:53.470
<v Speaker 3>she said her name was [inaudible].</v>

2159
01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.840
<v Speaker 3>She rolled her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what,</v>

2160
01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:00.450
<v Speaker 3>how dare you racist the in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>name is Inigo Montoya.</v>

2161
01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:01.313
<v Speaker 3>The first thing I said to her is my </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally when she told me her name and </v>

2162
01:39:03.421 --> 01:39:05.700
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry if I can't pronounce it,</v>

2163
01:39:05.701 --> 01:39:08.640
<v Speaker 3>but he caught a mundo bond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2164
01:39:08.641 --> 01:39:10.860
<v Speaker 3>So here's what's interesting about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2165
01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:16.370
<v Speaker 3>So obviously she's been inculcated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she is incapable and I never want to pay</v>

2166
01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:20.130
<v Speaker 3>pick on her because in a sense she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a victim,</v>

2167
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:20.993
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a victim of this malicious </v>

2168
01:39:22.201 --> 01:39:24.330
<v Speaker 3>ideology that's running across campuses </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2169
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.333
<v Speaker 3>But people like that are not capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>engaging and entertaining ideas because </v>

2170
01:39:31.441 --> 01:39:34.980
<v Speaker 3>they have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the university protects them.</v>

2171
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.270
<v Speaker 3>They can say they've been aggressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can,</v>

2172
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.250
<v Speaker 3>they can say they've been kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>violated,</v>

2173
01:39:41.251 --> 01:39:42.084
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cognitively intellectually </v>

2174
01:39:43.501 --> 01:39:44.334
<v Speaker 3>violated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's really interesting about </v>

2175
01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:47.730
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two things.</v>

2176
01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:48.564
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she thinks that she can arbitrate </v>

2177
01:39:50.071 --> 01:39:51.330
<v Speaker 3>everybody else's reality.</v>

2178
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:52.423
<v Speaker 3>So she thinks I can understand if I say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and he's offended by it or I </v>

2179
01:39:55.231 --> 01:39:55.711
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2180
01:39:55.711 --> 01:39:56.544
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo and so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she thinks that the regressive </v>

2181
01:39:59.471 --> 01:40:00.304
<v Speaker 3>thinks that they arbitrate people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality and they know what other people </v>

2182
01:40:02.941 --> 01:40:05.160
<v Speaker 3>should be offended by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is amazing.</v>

2183
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 3>But here's the really interesting part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Love Star Trek.</v>

2184
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:10.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughter in a sec.</v>

2185
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:12.930
<v Speaker 3>Offscreen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Star Trek.</v>

2186
01:40:12.931 --> 01:40:14.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm the j clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2187
01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:19.850
<v Speaker 3>but she's Asian and know star Trek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has everything to do with paws.</v>

2188
01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:22.230
<v Speaker 3>It has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has everything.</v>

2189
01:40:22.231 --> 01:40:23.940
<v Speaker 3>That pause was the emphasis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has emphasis.</v>

2190
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:26.130
<v Speaker 3>It has everything good because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

2191
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:29.940
<v Speaker 3>the woman I was shocked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't heard of star Trek was Asian.</v>

2192
01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:31.890
<v Speaker 3>You said she was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2193
01:40:31.891 --> 01:40:32.724
<v Speaker 3>Who had heard of Star Trek?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different woman now that there </v>

2194
01:40:35.041 --> 01:40:35.874
<v Speaker 3>were two women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One was the woman who said she's never </v>

2195
01:40:37.201 --> 01:40:40.170
<v Speaker 3>been so offended in her whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other one,</v>

2196
01:40:40.171 --> 01:40:41.190
<v Speaker 3>when she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I missed,</v>

2197
01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:42.233
<v Speaker 3>she said she didn't hurt her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't heard of it because it was white </v>

2198
01:40:44.041 --> 01:40:45.540
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2199
01:40:45.541 --> 01:40:46.291
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two different people.</v>

2200
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:47.071
<v Speaker 3>So I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2201
01:40:47.071 --> 01:40:49.920
<v Speaker 3>I haven't articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a woman in the class.</v>

2202
01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.440
<v Speaker 3>I use a structure for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She hasn't heard of it.</v>

2203
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2204
01:40:53.621 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe</v>

2205
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:55.900
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I use a Marilyn Manson example.</v>

2206
01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.820
<v Speaker 2>She hasn't heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm shocked.</v>

2207
01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Then the other woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regressive,</v>

2208
01:40:59.870 --> 01:41:01.190
<v Speaker 2>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one who's watching.</v>

2209
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.033
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one who's watching the regressive </v>

2210
01:41:02.801 --> 01:41:03.634
<v Speaker 2>leftist says you're a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know something that better if I </v>

2211
01:41:06.881 --> 01:41:08.030
<v Speaker 2>don't remember exact words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2212
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Now I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so confused.</v>

2213
01:41:09.881 --> 01:41:11.120
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2214
01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:12.063
<v Speaker 2>all of these interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought the woman who is the </v>

2215
01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.550
<v Speaker 2>regressive also hadn't heard about star </v>
<v Speaker 2>trek.</v>

2216
01:41:15.630 --> 01:41:17.530
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem with mark circulation.</v>

2217
01:41:17.531 --> 01:41:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Not your understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just apologize.</v>

2218
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:21.460
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2219
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:24.880
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So w w what was really interesting to me</v>

2220
01:41:24.881 --> 01:41:28.930
<v Speaker 2>about that is that she identified that </v>
<v Speaker 2>person on the basis of her race,</v>

2221
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.333
<v Speaker 2>not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was assuming she made w when you're </v>

2222
01:41:34.811 --> 01:41:36.760
<v Speaker 2>a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything looks like a nail.</v>

2223
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:40.600
<v Speaker 2>When you're a regressive leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single thing you think of as race,</v>

2224
01:41:40.601 --> 01:41:41.770
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression,</v>

2225
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:44.200
<v Speaker 2>intersectionality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is parenthetically,</v>

2226
01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:46.270
<v Speaker 2>I have never heard their sectionality.</v>

2227
01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:47.163
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2228
01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:49.390
<v Speaker 2>you see sectionality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>

2229
01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:50.283
<v Speaker 2>anytime you hear someone use that word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can automatically assume they were </v>

2230
01:41:53.041 --> 01:41:53.874
<v Speaker 2>aggressive leftist and the next thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your mouth they're most will be </v>

2231
01:41:55.841 --> 01:41:56.674
<v Speaker 2>some kind of smear campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a hilarious video of Steven </v>

2232
01:41:59.111 --> 01:42:03.120
<v Speaker 2>crowder going up to people and asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>them what their preferred pronouns are.</v>

2233
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I almost retweeted that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought,</v>

2234
01:42:05.651 --> 01:42:07.540
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get in trouble for right now.</v>

2235
01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.720
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it is.</v>

2236
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:16.030
<v Speaker 2>They have really infested the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of academia and it's funny,</v>

2237
01:42:16.151 --> 01:42:16.984
<v Speaker 2>these diversity offices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they report directly to the president </v>

2238
01:42:19.571 --> 01:42:22.000
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are offices in search of tasks,</v>

2239
01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:23.403
<v Speaker 2>but back to this example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she was the one who identified the </v>

2240
01:42:26.411 --> 01:42:27.244
<v Speaker 2>person on the basis of their race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She identified me on the basis of their </v>

2241
01:42:29.771 --> 01:42:34.480
<v Speaker 2>race of your race because somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow there's,</v>

2242
01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:36.430
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing called white culture.</v>

2243
01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:40.420
<v Speaker 2>She knows what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's offended on someone else's behalf.</v>

2244
01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:45.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm a white CIS gendered heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cisgendered use that term.</v>

2245
01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2246
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Are you being forced to use that term?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>

2247
01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a question of being,</v>

2248
01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:54.380
<v Speaker 2>how's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2249
01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.680
<v Speaker 2>is that a question of being forced to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use it?</v>

2250
01:42:56.681 --> 01:42:58.330
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2251
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:59.383
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a real term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not in any dictionary or </v>

2252
01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:05.680
<v Speaker 2>bullshit nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But CIS gender is hilarious.</v>

2253
01:43:05.710 --> 01:43:06.543
<v Speaker 2>And the idea being that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to say transgender because </v>

2254
01:43:08.711 --> 01:43:13.570
<v Speaker 2>transgender should be normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's normal to want to be transgender.</v>

2255
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:14.583
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so normal that by saying </v>

2256
01:43:16.691 --> 01:43:18.430
<v Speaker 2>transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making it abnormal.</v>

2257
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:22.540
<v Speaker 2>So I should say sis gender for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who aren't transgender.</v>

2258
01:43:22.541 --> 01:43:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Meaning if you are a male and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>identify as being a male,</v>

2259
01:43:26.681 --> 01:43:30.220
<v Speaker 2>you are a cis gendered metric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking mail.</v>

2260
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're adding all,</v>

2261
01:43:31.630 --> 01:43:32.463
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adding all this extra shit to define </v>

2262
01:43:36.701 --> 01:43:39.340
<v Speaker 2>things that are already defined by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original word.</v>

2263
01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:42.940
<v Speaker 2>We don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it to prop up transgender.</v>

2264
01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the idea to make it so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

2265
01:43:45.641 --> 01:43:49.370
<v Speaker 2>we'll put sis regular gender trans with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2266
01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:50.680
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2267
01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that was another</v>

2268
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:54.950
<v Speaker 3>great explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now why do these people do this?</v>

2269
01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:55.813
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a long story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one value that's responsible for </v>

2270
01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:02.120
<v Speaker 3>that is radical egalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything has to be radical.</v>

2271
01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:04.000
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has to be equal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2272
01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

2273
01:44:06.170 --> 01:44:07.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they have these diversity </v>

2274
01:44:07.491 --> 01:44:10.700
<v Speaker 3>initiatives and diversity requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need more faculty of Color.</v>

2275
01:44:10.701 --> 01:44:11.534
<v Speaker 3>And I actually think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be a good thing in some </v>

2276
01:44:13.701 --> 01:44:15.160
<v Speaker 3>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2277
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:16.153
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they mean is they mean </v>

2278
01:44:17.961 --> 01:44:18.794
<v Speaker 3>diversity and the most narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigoted kind of a way they mean it in </v>

2279
01:44:21.531 --> 01:44:22.364
<v Speaker 3>terms of skin color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't mean it in terms of </v>

2280
01:44:23.421 --> 01:44:24.890
<v Speaker 3>ideological differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not enough.</v>

2281
01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:26.410
<v Speaker 3>They're hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2282
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:27.643
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans and Libertarians or </v>

2283
01:44:29.631 --> 01:44:30.464
<v Speaker 3>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other thing that's interesting </v>

2284
01:44:32.841 --> 01:44:34.490
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2285
01:44:34.491 --> 01:44:35.324
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a on Sam's podcast with Douglas </v>

2286
01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:37.431
<v Speaker 3>Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2287
01:44:37.431 --> 01:44:39.380
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be talking about pronouns</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the big thing.</v>

2288
01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Now we're going to be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronouns.</v>

2289
01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:43.370
<v Speaker 3>While these people are still sneaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>nukes in our cities.</v>

2290
01:44:43.690 --> 01:44:47.300
<v Speaker 3>It is a failure to Morley triage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a,</v>

2291
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.570
<v Speaker 3>it is a system wide failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2292
01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:51.853
<v Speaker 3>that's trickled down to individuals </v>
<v Speaker 3>within the system to make it almost </v>

2293
01:44:55.341 --> 01:44:58.760
<v Speaker 3>impossible for them to make discerning </v>
<v Speaker 3>judgments about things.</v>

2294
01:44:59.060 --> 01:44:59.893
<v Speaker 3>And so we have this consequence now have</v>
<v Speaker 3>an entire generation of students who's </v>

2295
01:45:03.651 --> 01:45:07.730
<v Speaker 3>being trained not only to suspend moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>judgments,</v>

2296
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:10.670
<v Speaker 3>but to think they're better people of as</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a result.</v>

2297
01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:14.570
<v Speaker 3>And it's also beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all coming from academia because</v>

2298
01:45:14.571 --> 01:45:17.360
<v Speaker 3>if you think about what a university as </v>
<v Speaker 3>an academia,</v>

2299
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>academia,</v>

2300
01:45:19.941 --> 01:45:22.490
<v Speaker 3>I went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went on to Grad school,</v>

2301
01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.740
<v Speaker 3>got their masters or their phd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started teaching,</v>

2302
01:45:24.741 --> 01:45:25.574
<v Speaker 3>never entered the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stayed in a sheltered environment and </v>

2303
01:45:27.741 --> 01:45:31.790
<v Speaker 3>now they're dictating this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior and thinking it's like,</v>

2304
01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:35.870
<v Speaker 3>it's like a Dojo in which they never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's everybody's training with everybody</v>

2305
01:45:35.871 --> 01:45:37.160
<v Speaker 3>else in the Dojo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2306
01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.280
<v Speaker 3>I told you it's all mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole thing can be seen through</v>

2307
01:45:40.281 --> 01:45:41.114
<v Speaker 3>that Lens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that this radical ideology </v>

2308
01:45:43.581 --> 01:45:47.540
<v Speaker 3>coming in this area and wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>redefine reality.</v>

2309
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In this area,</v>

2310
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:50.383
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going out into the real </v>

2311
01:45:52.431 --> 01:45:53.264
<v Speaker 3>world and experiencing the Congo and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this crazy fucked up parts of the world </v>

2312
01:45:56.931 --> 01:45:57.764
<v Speaker 3>and understanding like you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like an inherent problem with the </v>

2313
01:46:01.041 --> 01:46:01.874
<v Speaker 3>human race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't redefine it by changing </v>

2314
01:46:05.001 --> 01:46:05.834
<v Speaker 3>pronouns and CIS gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is the most insidious form of </v>

2315
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:11.323
<v Speaker 3>Cultural Myopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they think they have latched onto </v>

2316
01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:15.134
<v Speaker 3>some times they just making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think they've latched onto some </v>

2317
01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:19.124
<v Speaker 3>universal truth about reality and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this moral and I think that </v>

2318
01:46:24.171 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moral underlying moral impulses that</v>

2319
01:46:26.541 --> 01:46:27.740
<v Speaker 3>they have a pretty good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2320
01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:31.050
<v Speaker 3>you don't treat people differently on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the basis of their licensing or you'd be</v>

2321
01:46:31.090 --> 01:46:32.740
<v Speaker 3>basically a cool person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will be asked.</v>

2322
01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:33.633
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that those are there being a </v>

2323
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.823
<v Speaker 3>laudable and forcing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not enforcing it with kindness </v>

2324
01:46:38.331 --> 01:46:39.164
<v Speaker 3>and compassion and understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to promote this like positive </v>

2325
01:46:43.011 --> 01:46:45.170
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're shaming and docs.</v>

2326
01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:49.070
<v Speaker 3>So that's the other piece that we need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand here.</v>

2327
01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 3>The other piece is</v>

2328
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.113
<v Speaker 2>the tactics and the techniques and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have really done a number on me </v>

2329
01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.193
<v Speaker 2>or they have attempted to they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they mistake me for someone who gives a </v>

2330
01:46:57.361 --> 01:46:58.320
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't care.</v>

2331
01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:03.590
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing is these people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the most mean spirited,</v>

2332
01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.800
<v Speaker 2>nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vituperative operative.</v>

2333
01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Tam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever heard that one?</v>

2334
01:47:09.810 --> 01:47:10.643
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes to the google that Google that </v>

2335
01:47:11.911 --> 01:47:16.240
<v Speaker 2>vet to v VI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>T.</v>

2336
01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:16.240
<v Speaker 2>P.</v>
<v Speaker 2>R.</v>

2337
01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>T.</v>

2338
01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiv Vituperative.</v>

2339
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:17.083
<v Speaker 2>It means like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know a nasty name calling son of a </v>

2340
01:47:18.961 --> 01:47:21.300
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call someone that one day.</v>

2341
01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two operative like it.</v>

2342
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:26.460
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitter of your day.</v>

2343
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

2344
01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:32.900
<v Speaker 2>That's a good abusive or Tuper to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

2345
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.433
<v Speaker 2>These people are also characterized by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the strategies they use with when they </v>

2346
01:47:39.241 --> 01:47:42.720
<v Speaker 2>are engaging people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The smear tactics,</v>

2347
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.673
<v Speaker 2>if you say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you question or you challenge your </v>

2348
01:47:45.421 --> 01:47:46.710
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a bigot,</v>

2349
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:47.700
<v Speaker 2>you're a homophobe.</v>

2350
01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:51.150
<v Speaker 2>But what that does is that shuts down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation.</v>

2351
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:55.740
<v Speaker 2>That's the end of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have marginally,</v>

2352
01:47:55.770 --> 01:47:56.603
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is that not only are they </v>

2353
01:47:57.631 --> 01:48:00.420
<v Speaker 2>marginalize you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this rise of the victim culture,</v>

2354
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:01.343
<v Speaker 2>like every like victims or esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think I can find parallels when I </v>

2355
01:48:05.281 --> 01:48:10.281
<v Speaker 2>was talking about again with mixed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts is that like the Dojo to me</v>

2356
01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 2>was sacred because this was something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was transforming me and changing me</v>

2357
01:48:15.871 --> 01:48:16.704
<v Speaker 2>from a loser to someone who had like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible outcome that was positive that </v>

2358
01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I had potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a path out.</v>

2359
01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.793
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come from environments where maybe </v>

2360
01:48:28.801 --> 01:48:29.634
<v Speaker 2>their parents were fucked up or racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>or dumb or they didn't like their life </v>

2361
01:48:34.291 --> 01:48:36.720
<v Speaker 2>or they've been raped or some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical trauma.</v>

2362
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

2363
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had horrible experiences with bad people</v>

2364
01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:42.380
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2365
01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.610
<v Speaker 2>maybe abused in highschool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullied,</v>

2366
01:48:44.611 --> 01:48:45.444
<v Speaker 2>fucked with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now they found some culture where </v>

2367
01:48:47.161 --> 01:48:49.580
<v Speaker 2>they're being not just accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2368
01:48:49.581 --> 01:48:50.400
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2369
01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.233
<v Speaker 2>it's invigorating to them like other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we're going to change this </v>

2370
01:48:54.181 --> 01:48:57.130
<v Speaker 2>world and we're going to make things </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome for people and we're gonna,</v>

2371
01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make you ask people what </v>

2372
01:48:59.551 --> 01:49:01.320
<v Speaker 2>their preferred gender pronouns are.</v>

2373
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:03.540
<v Speaker 2>This is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really need to get on right.</v>

2374
01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:06.810
<v Speaker 2>And they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're living in this environment.</v>

2375
01:49:06.811 --> 01:49:07.644
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a really young </v>

2376
01:49:08.251 --> 01:49:09.084
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was when I was young and I was </v>

2377
01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:12.054
<v Speaker 2>looking at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stage of my life is this </v>

2378
01:49:13.861 --> 01:49:17.880
<v Speaker 2>transformative journey that I was on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wholeheartedly dedicated to it.</v>

2379
01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2380
01:49:20.351 --> 01:49:22.530
<v Speaker 2>this is their transformative journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2381
01:49:22.590 --> 01:49:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't going on others.</v>

2382
01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're imposing it there.</v>

2383
01:49:29.210 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 2>They're using the mechanisms of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university to impose those things.</v>

2384
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:34.373
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the very things that we need reason </v>

2385
01:49:37.141 --> 01:49:39.690
<v Speaker 2>and rationality or liberatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can liberate us.</v>

2386
01:49:39.691 --> 01:49:41.280
<v Speaker 2>They can emancipate us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2387
01:49:41.650 --> 01:49:42.990
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is like that.</v>

2388
01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:44.760
<v Speaker 2>You can test ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

2389
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:45.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2390
01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a son of a bitch to have a guy had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy on</v>

2391
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.813
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like 300 pounds and he's like knee </v>

2392
01:49:49.571 --> 01:49:51.490
<v Speaker 3>ride me and then skull riding me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2393
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:53.710
<v Speaker 3>it's just not a very pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2394
01:49:53.711 --> 01:49:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Those both sound very gay and be riding </v>
<v Speaker 3>a skull riding.</v>

2395
01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:59.640
<v Speaker 3>That's a microaggression is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>micrograph.</v>

2396
01:50:00.190 --> 01:50:03.580
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to get back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that protest,</v>

2397
01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:06.250
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think we completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>finished it.</v>

2398
01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:09.010
<v Speaker 3>I was going to finish the thought that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2399
01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:09.933
<v Speaker 3>give me the protest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>W This woman that was saying all this </v>

2400
01:50:11.891 --> 01:50:15.340
<v Speaker 3>stuff about you that you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist and that you're like,</v>

2401
01:50:15.341 --> 01:50:15.761
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2402
01:50:15.761 --> 01:50:18.400
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used the word hurtful before.</v>

2403
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:19.413
<v Speaker 3>So one of the reasons that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurtful to me is because my daughter's </v>

2404
01:50:22.210 --> 01:50:23.043
<v Speaker 3>Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2405
01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:26.320
<v Speaker 3>And now as the age of twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's like saying I'm not racist.</v>

2406
01:50:26.321 --> 01:50:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I have black friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2407
01:50:28.490 --> 01:50:29.171
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2408
01:50:29.171 --> 01:50:30.970
<v Speaker 3>It's different getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're kidding,</v>

2409
01:50:30.971 --> 01:50:31.630
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2410
01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:33.970
<v Speaker 3>but just think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just think about it for a second.</v>

2411
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:35.223
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my daughter grows up and this </v>

2412
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:37.570
<v Speaker 3>person in my class at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2413
01:50:37.571 --> 01:50:39.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like hates Asians or whatever,</v>

2414
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like to guy like star Trek,</v>

2415
01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:43.594
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2416
01:50:43.810 --> 01:50:44.643
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things tend to have a life of </v>

2417
01:50:47.081 --> 01:50:49.060
<v Speaker 3>their own and then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2418
01:50:49.061 --> 01:50:51.400
<v Speaker 3>but Goshen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy who hates Asians,</v>

2419
01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:52.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy.</v>

2420
01:50:52.810 --> 01:50:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2421
01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:56.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm just the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the earlier point,</v>

2422
01:50:56.651 --> 01:51:01.210
<v Speaker 3>I was going to make the very thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these regressives one of the things that</v>

2423
01:51:01.211 --> 01:51:02.200
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2424
01:51:02.230 --> 01:51:07.230
<v Speaker 3>perhaps the most important is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason is liberatory w we can emancipate</v>

2425
01:51:07.481 --> 01:51:09.670
<v Speaker 3>ourselves through reason and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationality,</v>

2426
01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.610
<v Speaker 3>but the only way to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weight,</v>

2427
01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:15.670
<v Speaker 3>that reason acts as a lubricant is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>social discourse.</v>

2428
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Like we need to be able to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>

2429
01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:23.090
<v Speaker 3>It's non negotiable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Free speech is not a negotiation 100%.</v>

2430
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:25.720
<v Speaker 3>It is pure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these people,</v>

2431
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:26.583
<v Speaker 3>they want to disinvite people if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't agree with them as opposed to </v>

2432
01:51:29.021 --> 01:51:30.250
<v Speaker 3>having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2433
01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:31.453
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an alternative speaker for their point </v>

2434
01:51:32.411 --> 01:51:34.720
<v Speaker 3>of view or debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fan of debates but you know,</v>

2435
01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:37.450
<v Speaker 3>or debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what they want to do is they want to</v>

2436
01:51:37.451 --> 01:51:38.284
<v Speaker 3>shut down the discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's take that at a deeper level </v>

2437
01:51:40.451 --> 01:51:43.510
<v Speaker 3>and take a look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of the problem with that is,</v>

2438
01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:48.580
<v Speaker 3>is that I firmly believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think I have evidence for this,</v>

2439
01:51:48.581 --> 01:51:49.414
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming evidence actually is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pedigree and long pedigree in western </v>

2440
01:51:52.961 --> 01:51:55.780
<v Speaker 3>intellectual thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can derive our values,</v>

2441
01:51:56.020 --> 01:52:00.880
<v Speaker 3>we can sit down and I can talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we can figure out and looking at the</v>

2442
01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:03.220
<v Speaker 3>black statue there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hendrix there,</v>

2443
01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:07.960
<v Speaker 3>we can figure out why we shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminate against people in the basis</v>

2444
01:52:07.961 --> 01:52:08.794
<v Speaker 3>of their skin color.</v>

2445
01:52:08.890 --> 01:52:11.380
<v Speaker 3>But the only way that we can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not matte,</v>

2446
01:52:11.410 --> 01:52:13.570
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't come from a want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2447
01:52:13.630 --> 01:52:16.540
<v Speaker 3>is that you need to be able to ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>

2448
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:17.463
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can figure things out in </v>

2449
01:52:18.821 --> 01:52:20.110
<v Speaker 3>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in dialog.</v>

2450
01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:21.063
<v Speaker 3>That's how we figure things out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these people want to shut down </v>

2451
01:52:23.741 --> 01:52:25.900
<v Speaker 3>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they do that,</v>

2452
01:52:26.170 --> 01:52:27.003
<v Speaker 3>then they become their own enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the worst type of idealog </v>

2453
01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:34.300
<v Speaker 3>because they have beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they haven't derived those beliefs.</v>

2454
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:37.120
<v Speaker 3>So then those beliefs are then sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2455
01:52:37.121 --> 01:52:38.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2456
01:52:38.261 --> 01:52:40.330
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only way they're,</v>

2457
01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:45.420
<v Speaker 3>they're taking away the one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to figure to figure stuff out.</v>

2458
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:47.233
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're taking away the resisting </v>

2459
01:52:49.971 --> 01:52:51.080
<v Speaker 3>opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In this case,</v>

2460
01:52:51.081 --> 01:52:53.000
<v Speaker 3>they're taking away the dialectic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dialogue,</v>

2461
01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:54.590
<v Speaker 3>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open inquiry,</v>

2462
01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:55.813
<v Speaker 3>the ability to say things on campuses </v>
<v Speaker 3>without being smeared as a racist or a </v>

2463
01:52:58.731 --> 01:52:59.930
<v Speaker 3>homophobe or a bigot.</v>

2464
01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.420
<v Speaker 3>You're 100% right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're 100% right.</v>

2465
01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:03.553
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't be more right about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of this whole dilemma that they </v>

2466
01:53:08.211 --> 01:53:09.044
<v Speaker 3>are trying to stop the debate because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think part of them knows what they're </v>

2467
01:53:12.231 --> 01:53:13.064
<v Speaker 3>doing is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like the the Ci Gong master that </v>

2468
01:53:15.681 --> 01:53:17.720
<v Speaker 3>wants to shoot you across the room when </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a question,</v>

2469
01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:21.720
<v Speaker 3>they kind of know they've got to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>the question.</v>

2470
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:22.603
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that is what I've really been </v>

2471
01:53:24.081 --> 01:53:24.914
<v Speaker 3>thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they know that their ideologies are </v>

2472
01:53:28.461 --> 01:53:30.230
<v Speaker 3>bankrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they know?</v>

2473
01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:31.153
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2474
01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:33.800
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about guys at the top,</v>

2475
01:53:33.801 --> 01:53:34.760
<v Speaker 3>like Reza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aslan,</v>

2476
01:53:34.761 --> 01:53:35.390
<v Speaker 3>green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glenn,</v>

2477
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:38.330
<v Speaker 3>Glenn Greenwald,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jank from the young Turks.</v>

2478
01:53:38.331 --> 01:53:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Like when you have to make shit up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lie,</v>

2479
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:46.490
<v Speaker 3>it makes me think that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>genuine about your beliefs,</v>

2480
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:50.810
<v Speaker 3>that you're not authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would just mention to someone the</v>

2481
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:54.050
<v Speaker 3>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem talking to someone who</v>

2482
01:53:54.051 --> 01:53:56.480
<v Speaker 3>tells me with total sincerity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2483
01:53:56.481 --> 01:53:57.314
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2484
01:53:57.410 --> 01:53:59.030
<v Speaker 3>I believe that there was a talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>snake.</v>

2485
01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:01.730
<v Speaker 3>Like I can have a conversation with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2486
01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:02.850
<v Speaker 3>He's sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Whoa,</v>

2487
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:04.330
<v Speaker 3>that person's sincere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

2488
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say this is what I believe,</v>

2489
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:08.263
<v Speaker 3>but the regressives you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost impart the one thing you </v>

2490
01:54:12.441 --> 01:54:14.000
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a conversation.</v>

2491
01:54:14.001 --> 01:54:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Cause if you ask a question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2492
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:18.710
<v Speaker 3>you're smeared you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you become a whole smear campaign.</v>

2493
01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:23.980
<v Speaker 3>So it's incredibly frustrating on an </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual level.</v>

2494
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:27.770
<v Speaker 3>But then when they have institutional </v>
<v Speaker 3>support of this stuff,</v>

2495
01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:33.010
<v Speaker 3>then when they have woven their </v>
<v Speaker 3>tentacles into academia in,</v>

2496
01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:34.500
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2497
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:38.270
<v Speaker 3>very high positions and it's across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>

2498
01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:39.530
<v Speaker 3>western Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2499
01:54:39.531 --> 01:54:42.650
<v Speaker 3>remember there is a hierarchy of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't talk about.</v>

2500
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:43.783
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>th there is and if you want to figure </v>

2501
01:54:45.951 --> 01:54:48.380
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can figure out the relationship,</v>

2502
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:52.580
<v Speaker 3>you mean this would be epic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You figure out why.</v>

2503
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:54.223
<v Speaker 3>I love my freedom of language with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>here on the show and you figure out why </v>

2504
01:54:57.801 --> 01:54:58.634
<v Speaker 3>of feminists are in bed with Islamists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we got something because this </v>

2505
01:55:03.291 --> 01:55:07.700
<v Speaker 3>to me is one of the most bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating,</v>

2506
01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:10.550
<v Speaker 3>disturbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grotesque.</v>

2507
01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:14.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there were ever a group who actively,</v>

2508
01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:14.601
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2509
01:55:14.601 --> 01:55:17.750
<v Speaker 3>it's even worse than the form Baltic </v>
<v Speaker 3>states and the Soviet Union who,</v>

2510
01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:18.613
<v Speaker 3>the only military alliance in history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their primary objective was to attack </v>

2511
01:55:21.051 --> 01:55:22.730
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is even worse than that.</v>

2512
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:23.743
<v Speaker 3>I mean these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could not possibly find a group of </v>

2513
01:55:26.841 --> 01:55:27.674
<v Speaker 3>people who are more antithetical to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most rudimentary feminist values than </v>

2514
01:55:33.081 --> 01:55:35.510
<v Speaker 3>the Islamists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not possible.</v>

2515
01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:36.373
<v Speaker 3>Never has it existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet these people are in bed with </v>

2516
01:55:39.351 --> 01:55:42.020
<v Speaker 3>each other and it happens over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2517
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this situation where you're laughing,</v>

2518
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:45.270
<v Speaker 4>it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2519
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:46.740
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2520
01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:50.130
<v Speaker 4>it's the poetry of the bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2521
01:55:50.131 --> 01:55:50.964
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2522
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:52.183
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2523
01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:56.640
<v Speaker 4>it's some bizarre folly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange.</v>

2524
01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:57.773
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's they're brown and you that you </v>

2525
01:55:59.941 --> 01:56:00.774
<v Speaker 4>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of the bad about Brown </v>

2526
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:04.110
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can openly mock Christians.</v>

2527
01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:05.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's right you,</v>

2528
01:56:05.691 --> 01:56:07.080
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can mock Christians.</v>

2529
01:56:07.290 --> 01:56:08.123
<v Speaker 4>There's something about a skin color </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that trumps other things to think </v>

2530
01:56:13.231 --> 01:56:15.810
<v Speaker 4>about that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people,</v>

2531
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:18.270
<v Speaker 4>the only people who care,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't my line,</v>

2532
01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:19.104
<v Speaker 4>I read this somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the only people who care about race </v>

2533
01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:24.990
<v Speaker 4>are racists and regressive leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people are,</v>

2534
01:56:24.991 --> 01:56:25.824
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the regressive left really are the new </v>

2535
01:56:27.871 --> 01:56:28.704
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were really looking at everything </v>

2536
01:56:30.181 --> 01:56:33.410
<v Speaker 4>in terms of race and sex and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of sense of sex.</v>

2537
01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.253
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of sexism in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>regressive left because they don't </v>

2538
01:56:36.031 --> 01:56:36.864
<v Speaker 4>really like men and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>anti unmasculine ideology that gets </v>

2539
01:56:40.051 --> 01:56:41.400
<v Speaker 4>perpetrated on people.</v>

2540
01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:46.350
<v Speaker 4>The point where you thinking like you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be more soft gendered,</v>

2541
01:56:46.650 --> 01:56:47.483
<v Speaker 4>gender supposed to be a fluid thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're not supposed to be overtly </v>

2542
01:56:49.921 --> 01:56:51.630
<v Speaker 4>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nonsense.</v>

2543
01:56:51.810 --> 01:56:55.410
<v Speaker 4>How come you can be overtly feminine </v>
<v Speaker 4>once you become transgender?</v>

2544
01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:57.310
<v Speaker 4>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come you,</v>

2545
01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:00.330
<v Speaker 4>if a woman wants to wear like a pushup </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bra,</v>

2546
01:57:00.331 --> 01:57:03.930
<v Speaker 4>have our tits poking out in a short </v>
<v Speaker 4>skirt and high heels and a lot of makeup</v>

2547
01:57:03.931 --> 01:57:07.170
<v Speaker 4>and do her hair up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That girl's giving into the patriarchy,</v>

2548
01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:10.050
<v Speaker 4>but if a transgender does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

2549
01:57:10.051 --> 01:57:10.884
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If a transgender man all of a sudden </v>

2550
01:57:12.841 --> 01:57:15.630
<v Speaker 4>adopts those traditionally feminine </v>
<v Speaker 4>views,</v>

2551
01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:16.493
<v Speaker 4>it hypocrisy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's even worse than hypocrisy </v>

2552
01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 4>because if it just stopped there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be something.</v>

2553
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:22.583
<v Speaker 4>But it's this idea that these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think that they can dictate to </v>

2554
01:57:26.041 --> 01:57:28.110
<v Speaker 4>other people how they should live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2555
01:57:28.111 --> 01:57:31.050
<v Speaker 4>When you see a guy who's a power lifter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2556
01:57:31.050 --> 01:57:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Some big fucking giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you know that game of thrones,</v>

2557
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:36.460
<v Speaker 4>the mountain guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mountain guys.</v>

2558
01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:38.280
<v Speaker 4>I met that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I didn't say hi to him.</v>

2559
01:57:38.281 --> 01:57:40.800
<v Speaker 4>I saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was at the UFC this past weekend.</v>

2560
01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:43.170
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking gigantic man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's huge.</v>

2561
01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.190
<v Speaker 4>He a whole thing with conor mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:46.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>

2563
01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:47.033
<v Speaker 4>He obviously likes being fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He enjoys picking shit up and moving it </v>

2564
01:57:51.211 --> 01:57:53.310
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He enjoys breaking records.</v>

2565
01:57:53.490 --> 01:57:55.950
<v Speaker 4>What do I give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would I care?</v>

2566
01:57:55.951 --> 01:57:58.470
<v Speaker 4>He seems like a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the idea that this it,</v>

2567
01:57:58.480 --> 01:57:59.840
<v Speaker 4>even if he's an Asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2568
01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing is,</v>

2569
01:58:01.170 --> 01:58:02.970
<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't seem to be,</v>

2570
01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:05.880
<v Speaker 4>and that my point is like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2571
01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:07.013
<v Speaker 4>he's not doing anything terrible like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you would look at that and decide </v>

2572
01:58:12.241 --> 01:58:15.750
<v Speaker 4>that this person living their life in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this way is negative.</v>

2573
01:58:15.751 --> 01:58:16.584
<v Speaker 4>That he's masculine and he's a part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem and rape culture and all </v>

2574
01:58:20.071 --> 01:58:20.610
<v Speaker 4>this Jay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2575
01:58:20.610 --> 01:58:25.610
<v Speaker 4>he's just picking big shit up and moving</v>
<v Speaker 4>it around and flexing the most innocuous</v>

2576
01:58:26.251 --> 01:58:26.731
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2577
01:58:26.731 --> 01:58:27.600
<v Speaker 4>That blood could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2578
01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:28.434
<v Speaker 4>why is it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it because he's overtly </v>

2579
01:58:30.541 --> 01:58:31.860
<v Speaker 4>masculine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is that bad?</v>

2580
01:58:31.861 --> 01:58:32.694
<v Speaker 4>Like what if he just put the same amount</v>
<v Speaker 4>of energy into swimming and this guy </v>

2581
01:58:35.671 --> 01:58:37.410
<v Speaker 4>just like to swim across the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean?</v>

2582
01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:39.150
<v Speaker 4>Would you freak out about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2583
01:58:39.151 --> 01:58:39.850
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2584
01:58:39.850 --> 01:58:44.530
<v Speaker 4>it's this feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy is becoming this thing that you</v>

2585
01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:46.840
<v Speaker 4>find impressive even if he's not doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>any of that yet.</v>

2586
01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:48.480
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's ticked.</v>

2587
01:58:48.650 --> 01:58:49.483
<v Speaker 3>So they're already a logs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got that and they subscribe to ideas </v>

2588
01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:56.430
<v Speaker 3>that are just not in accordance with </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

2589
01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:57.473
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not using the term regressive </v>

2590
01:58:59.311 --> 01:59:01.440
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think general liberals in general tend</v>

2591
01:59:01.441 --> 01:59:05.360
<v Speaker 3>to believe that if we can change social </v>
<v Speaker 3>system somehow and,</v>

2592
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:06.270
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2593
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a lot of truth in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2594
01:59:08.590 --> 01:59:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steven Steven pinker kind of,</v>

2595
01:59:10.570 --> 01:59:11.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the blank slate,</v>

2596
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:12.863
<v Speaker 3>deconstruct some of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but liberals kind of think if you could </v>

2597
01:59:15.241 --> 01:59:16.074
<v Speaker 3>only change the institutions in society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then things would by definition be more </v>

2598
01:59:19.501 --> 01:59:20.334
<v Speaker 3>fair and more equal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all born blank slates and you </v>

2599
01:59:22.351 --> 01:59:23.184
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all of these disparities and </v>

2600
01:59:24.871 --> 01:59:26.910
<v Speaker 3>inequality has come about as a result </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2601
01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:28.173
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems within the system despite </v>

2602
01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:32.370
<v Speaker 3>inequalities when the system and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2603
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:36.000
<v Speaker 3>unless you are really an ideolog on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2604
01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:39.840
<v Speaker 3>you would be hard pressed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2605
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:41.783
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why shouldn't we try to do our best to </v>

2606
01:59:43.891 --> 01:59:45.840
<v Speaker 3>create systems of justice that are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair?</v>

2607
01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:50.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big Fan of John Ralston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any reasonable person would say that,</v>

2608
01:59:51.090 --> 01:59:56.090
<v Speaker 3>but these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe in differences be,</v>

2609
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:59.060
<v Speaker 3>they think that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're non bile.</v>

2610
01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:02.490
<v Speaker 3>The differences between men and women </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not biological.</v>

2611
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:04.410
<v Speaker 3>They think that their cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>artifacts,</v>

2612
02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.030
<v Speaker 3>they think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2613
02:00:06.170 --> 02:00:07.800
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if you want to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole race thing,</v>

2614
02:00:07.801 --> 02:00:08.634
<v Speaker 3>but the race thing is another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they think that race is only skin </v>

2615
02:00:10.771 --> 02:00:12.780
<v Speaker 3>deep there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a social construct.</v>

2616
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:14.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than saying,</v>

2617
02:00:14.221 --> 02:00:15.054
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do Jewish women get [inaudible] </v>

2618
02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:16.890
<v Speaker 3>syndrome?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wider Black Guy,</v>

2619
02:00:16.891 --> 02:00:19.080
<v Speaker 3>black people get more sickle cell </v>
<v Speaker 3>anemia.</v>

2620
02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

2621
02:00:20.670 --> 02:00:21.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2622
02:00:21.210 --> 02:00:25.880
<v Speaker 3>I notice my hesitancy in discussing </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things because I know that anytime</v>

2623
02:00:25.890 --> 02:00:26.723
<v Speaker 3>you bring this up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an opportunity for people to </v>

2624
02:00:29.071 --> 02:00:30.900
<v Speaker 3>smear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell you you're a bigot,</v>

2625
02:00:30.970 --> 02:00:33.710
<v Speaker 3>a racist or a homophobe and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2626
02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:34.613
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also the pinnacle of identity </v>

2627
02:00:36.001 --> 02:00:36.834
<v Speaker 3>politics where the things that I say are</v>
<v Speaker 3>discredited or they look at me because </v>

2628
02:00:42.331 --> 02:00:43.164
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm situated in the body than I am for </v>

2629
02:00:45.061 --> 02:00:45.750
<v Speaker 3>the sexuality.</v>

2630
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:46.583
<v Speaker 3>I had no choice over whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they used that as an opportunity to </v>

2631
02:00:49.831 --> 02:00:53.160
<v Speaker 3>discredit my speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole thing is just,</v>

2632
02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:55.890
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is literally if you could say,</v>

2633
02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:58.590
<v Speaker 3>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make a list of all the things that</v>

2634
02:00:58.591 --> 02:01:01.620
<v Speaker 3>we can write down to make it impossible </v>
<v Speaker 3>to solve our problems.</v>

2635
02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:03.480
<v Speaker 3>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the list.</v>

2636
02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:06.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have the gold standard for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the list.</v>

2637
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very good point.</v>

2638
02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:09.533
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of this is what you said about </v>

2639
02:01:14.041 --> 02:01:17.580
<v Speaker 3>silencing debate and that debate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion</v>

2640
02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:20.340
<v Speaker 4>is the only way we figure things out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know,</v>

2641
02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:23.130
<v Speaker 4>I've met you today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you because of your work.</v>

2642
02:01:23.131 --> 02:01:25.500
<v Speaker 4>I know you because of your associations </v>
<v Speaker 4>with friends of mine,</v>

2643
02:01:25.501 --> 02:01:26.334
<v Speaker 4>like Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know your thinking until I </v>

2644
02:01:30.181 --> 02:01:32.280
<v Speaker 4>talked to you and when I talked to you I</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

2645
02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:33.121
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2646
02:01:33.121 --> 02:01:36.150
<v Speaker 4>I see how he sees that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or he sees things in a different way and</v>

2647
02:01:36.151 --> 02:01:36.984
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for people to do that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have this rigid set ideas that we </v>

2648
02:01:39.951 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 4>have</v>

2649
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.963
<v Speaker 2>in our head and we would like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforce those on everybody because it </v>

2650
02:01:42.531 --> 02:01:43.700
<v Speaker 2>makes life simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2651
02:01:43.701 --> 02:01:44.534
<v Speaker 2>if you think the way I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the way you think it's </v>

2652
02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:46.753
<v Speaker 2>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2653
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:48.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's when we bring Jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2654
02:01:48.591 --> 02:01:49.424
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why the problem is when we </v>

2655
02:01:51.771 --> 02:01:54.590
<v Speaker 2>hang out with people who only believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>like we do,</v>

2656
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:57.070
<v Speaker 2>it's called the filter bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2657
02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:59.220
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a book about it called the beat</v>

2658
02:01:59.330 --> 02:02:00.163
<v Speaker 2>big sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tend to be more confident in the </v>

2659
02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:03.790
<v Speaker 2>beliefs that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2660
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:07.400
<v Speaker 2>But what we should be doing is we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be going to different gyms,</v>

2661
02:02:07.670 --> 02:02:08.503
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be going as your buddy to </v>

2662
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.823
<v Speaker 2>10th planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be going and checking out </v>

2663
02:02:12.321 --> 02:02:13.154
<v Speaker 2>different things because you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>test these ideas to see if they work in </v>

2664
02:02:17.541 --> 02:02:20.180
<v Speaker 2>the same way we should be listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

2665
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:21.103
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem if you're a liberal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you only listen to liberal stuff or an </v>

2666
02:02:24.711 --> 02:02:25.544
<v Speaker 2>atheist and you only listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really need to listen to challenge </v>

2667
02:02:28.281 --> 02:02:29.114
<v Speaker 2>and engage yourself by opening yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to these experiences and starting </v>

2668
02:02:32.541 --> 02:02:34.850
<v Speaker 2>with the possibility that you could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

2669
02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:35.773
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a black belt in Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and you walk into someone's </v>

2670
02:02:39.191 --> 02:02:41.930
<v Speaker 2>school and the blue belts are routinely </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping you do,</v>

2671
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:43.470
<v Speaker 2>you got to do some thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2672
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:44.343
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be honest with yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't matter how much time </v>

2673
02:02:46.911 --> 02:02:47.744
<v Speaker 2>you've put into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what your commitment </v>

2674
02:02:49.251 --> 02:02:51.320
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what matters is what works.</v>

2675
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:52.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2676
02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.750
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is a beautiful thing about high</v>

2677
02:02:56.751 --> 02:03:00.050
<v Speaker 2>level problem solving in martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if it works,</v>

2678
02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2679
02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:03.153
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to do that when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas like compassion and justice and </v>

2680
02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:08.773
<v Speaker 2>getting along and how you should treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and how people should be </v>

2681
02:03:11.421 --> 02:03:12.230
<v Speaker 2>accepted.</v>

2682
02:03:12.230 --> 02:03:13.430
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2683
02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:14.413
<v Speaker 2>there's things about diversity and about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a quality that I think we all agree </v>

2684
02:03:20.631 --> 02:03:21.464
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think you shouldn't be judged </v>

2685
02:03:23.031 --> 02:03:28.031
<v Speaker 2>by your sexuality or what you look like </v>
<v Speaker 2>or where you were born or you know,</v>

2686
02:03:28.731 --> 02:03:29.564
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nationalism seems to be kind of fucking </v>

2687
02:03:31.671 --> 02:03:32.504
<v Speaker 2>silly to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should judge people on how </v>

2688
02:03:35.031 --> 02:03:38.180
<v Speaker 2>you behave and how you interact with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and be like,</v>

2689
02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:40.580
<v Speaker 2>do I enjoy talking to this person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>

2690
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:41.683
<v Speaker 2>You might enjoy talking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somebody else might fucking think </v>

2691
02:03:43.731 --> 02:03:45.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might not like talk to me.</v>

2692
02:03:45.591 --> 02:03:47.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's their prerogative to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>

2693
02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to just because you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Boghossian.</v>

2694
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Just because you enjoy people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean I have to enjoy them.</v>

2695
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:55.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that have friends.</v>

2696
02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking stand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2697
02:03:57.501 --> 02:03:59.480
<v Speaker 2>and I'll be around like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Christ,</v>

2698
02:03:59.481 --> 02:04:00.600
<v Speaker 2>why are you hanging around with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>

2699
02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.270
<v Speaker 2>He gives me headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get Outta here.</v>

2700
02:04:02.271 --> 02:04:04.070
<v Speaker 2>And the the older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2701
02:04:04.071 --> 02:04:06.290
<v Speaker 2>the older I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I,</v>

2702
02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I just want to spend my time with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2703
02:04:07.881 --> 02:04:10.240
<v Speaker 2>I really want to spend money and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligations.</v>

2704
02:04:10.241 --> 02:04:11.074
<v Speaker 2>You can't fix people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried so fucking hard to get along </v>

2705
02:04:14.481 --> 02:04:15.314
<v Speaker 2>with people that are unmotivated or lazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they have constant problems in their </v>

2706
02:04:19.221 --> 02:04:20.054
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't look at themselves objective </v>

2707
02:04:21.441 --> 02:04:22.274
<v Speaker 2>Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you talk to them about things that </v>

2708
02:04:23.721 --> 02:04:26.480
<v Speaker 2>happen in their life and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking myriad of excuses.</v>

2709
02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:29.840
<v Speaker 2>It's overwhelming and that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have those people in your life,</v>

2710
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:30.703
<v Speaker 2>they will overwhelm you with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues and you will never get anything </v>

2711
02:04:34.041 --> 02:04:34.874
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my take is try until you can't </v>

2712
02:04:38.611 --> 02:04:40.760
<v Speaker 2>try and then get the fuck out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2713
02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're already doing what you're doing.</v>

2714
02:04:42.481 --> 02:04:44.280
<v Speaker 2>And is that you're modeling those </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors.</v>

2715
02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:45.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when my,</v>

2716
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking to my buddy the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

2717
02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:47.813
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's upset that all their aggressives </v>

2718
02:04:49.411 --> 02:04:51.300
<v Speaker 2>are attacking him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just said,</v>

2719
02:04:51.330 --> 02:04:52.470
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll publish everybody.</v>

2720
02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the currency in academia.</v>

2721
02:04:55.050 --> 02:04:55.883
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just publish and explain your </v>

2722
02:04:58.591 --> 02:05:02.730
<v Speaker 2>thoughts in a way that will inspire </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate and aspire thought.</v>

2723
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Explain your thoughts in a blog in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people can read it and like it and</v>

2724
02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:09.293
<v Speaker 2>share it with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the beautiful things </v>

2725
02:05:10.441 --> 02:05:11.274
<v Speaker 2>about today is that you have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability that's never literally </v>

2726
02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:19.260
<v Speaker 2>unparalleled access to other human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

2727
02:05:19.261 --> 02:05:21.900
<v Speaker 2>It's never been like this where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could just write something.</v>

2728
02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:22.763
<v Speaker 2>You put it on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be a carpenter in Kansas and </v>

2729
02:05:27.331 --> 02:05:28.164
<v Speaker 2>you write something beautiful on </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook and it'll be shared across the </v>

2730
02:05:31.741 --> 02:05:34.020
<v Speaker 2>world within minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2731
02:05:34.021 --> 02:05:34.854
<v Speaker 2>I'll add one more thing to that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't treat people if you've been </v>

2732
02:05:38.071 --> 02:05:40.410
<v Speaker 2>treated negatively by people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't stoop to that.</v>

2733
02:05:40.530 --> 02:05:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2734
02:05:41.550 --> 02:05:43.190
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2735
02:05:43.290 --> 02:05:44.850
<v Speaker 2>My Mentor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mentor,</v>

2736
02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:45.903
<v Speaker 2>this is somewhat of a of a non sequitur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my metro told me this really fast </v>

2737
02:05:49.450 --> 02:05:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Dalai Lama story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2738
02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:52.640
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Pope No.</v>

2739
02:05:54.050 --> 02:05:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Did the one that just got rid of right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what?</v>

2740
02:05:56.041 --> 02:05:58.530
<v Speaker 2>The child molester pope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me he was a,</v>

2741
02:05:58.540 --> 02:06:01.820
<v Speaker 2>he's 97 and he's a survivor of a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

2742
02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:03.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really amazing guys that Phil </v>

2743
02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:07.170
<v Speaker 2>about his life and he went back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberated the same,</v>

2744
02:06:07.171 --> 02:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same</v>

2745
02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:11.060
<v Speaker 3>concentration camp told me the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>about chickens.</v>

2746
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:14.780
<v Speaker 3>That was a very profound in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>

2747
02:06:14.930 --> 02:06:17.120
<v Speaker 3>I think he was on the study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If not then,</v>

2748
02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:19.280
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically they,</v>

2749
02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:22.580
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to see if they could reverse</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pecking order among chickens.</v>

2750
02:06:23.150 --> 02:06:26.330
<v Speaker 3>And there's something that's a literal </v>
<v Speaker 3>pecking order.</v>

2751
02:06:26.331 --> 02:06:28.820
<v Speaker 3>And then if you put chickens in a coop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven chickens,</v>

2752
02:06:29.150 --> 02:06:32.240
<v Speaker 3>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one will peck chicken to chicken,</v>

2753
02:06:32.241 --> 02:06:36.380
<v Speaker 3>one would pet chickens two through seven</v>
<v Speaker 3>but never be picked chicken too will not</v>

2754
02:06:36.381 --> 02:06:38.240
<v Speaker 3>pet chicken one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we'll pick,</v>

2755
02:06:38.241 --> 02:06:40.320
<v Speaker 3>check it patrick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the same thing all the way down.</v>

2756
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Chick chicken seven gets packed by all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the chickens and pex nobody.</v>

2757
02:06:45.170 --> 02:06:47.600
<v Speaker 3>So they wanted to see if they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>reverse the pecking order.</v>

2758
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:51.380
<v Speaker 3>And I think that this story has profound</v>
<v Speaker 3>implications for all of life.</v>

2759
02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:53.870
<v Speaker 3>And so what they did was they put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little color,</v>

2760
02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:57.680
<v Speaker 3>they put little collars on all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chickens and when the chicken raised his</v>

2761
02:06:57.681 --> 02:07:00.260
<v Speaker 3>head as if it was going to pack into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken,</v>

2762
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:01.243
<v Speaker 3>they zapped it.</v>

2763
02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Now here's the question to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got it wrong.</v>

2764
02:07:04.791 --> 02:07:05.624
<v Speaker 3>When he asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think it was easier to make </v>

2765
02:07:08.031 --> 02:07:08.864
<v Speaker 3>chicken one chicken seven or chicken </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven chicken one chicken seven chicken </v>

2766
02:07:12.651 --> 02:07:13.221
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2767
02:07:13.221 --> 02:07:14.420
<v Speaker 3>that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong.</v>

2768
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:18.170
<v Speaker 3>And here's the reasoning for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken seven has been,</v>

2769
02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:23.880
<v Speaker 3>has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not plugged duct correct peck,</v>

2770
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:26.240
<v Speaker 3>peck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks has been pecked at whole life.</v>

2771
02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:27.313
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2772
02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:31.340
<v Speaker 3>it's all only going to get packed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>only takes one shock.</v>

2773
02:07:31.370 --> 02:07:32.570
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you another very quick </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

2774
02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:37.630
<v Speaker 3>It only takes one shock of chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one to make a chicken seven instantly.</v>

2775
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2776
02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:41.200
<v Speaker 3>because it's never experienced that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why,</v>

2777
02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:43.300
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the criminal justice system,</v>

2778
02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:46.090
<v Speaker 3>harsh punishments don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just don't.</v>

2779
02:07:46.091 --> 02:07:48.160
<v Speaker 3>And that's borne out by overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 3>empirical evidence.</v>

2780
02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:51.910
<v Speaker 3>But I think a theoretical background for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the chicken story.</v>

2781
02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:55.600
<v Speaker 3>That's why like my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was telling me that when his son,</v>

2782
02:07:55.630 --> 02:07:56.463
<v Speaker 3>he never yelled at his son is a funny </v>
<v Speaker 3>story looking at you with all the </v>

2783
02:07:58.451 --> 02:07:59.284
<v Speaker 3>tattoos and his son wanted to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tattoo and he slammed his hand down and </v>

2784
02:08:02.621 --> 02:08:03.490
<v Speaker 3>he said No.</v>

2785
02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:06.070
<v Speaker 3>And he screamed and his son was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>shocked.</v>

2786
02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:10.240
<v Speaker 3>It was like such a shocking thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he had never raised his voice.</v>

2787
02:08:10.241 --> 02:08:12.880
<v Speaker 3>He always been chicken one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know he had always been,</v>

2788
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:17.800
<v Speaker 3>but when you really start to think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the implications of that,</v>

2789
02:08:18.070 --> 02:08:21.370
<v Speaker 3>of what kindness will do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what,</v>

2790
02:08:21.850 --> 02:08:22.683
<v Speaker 3>of why being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's your word again for two </v>

2791
02:08:24.971 --> 02:08:25.960
<v Speaker 3>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty,</v>

2792
02:08:25.961 --> 02:08:26.794
<v Speaker 3>harsh to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best way to change moral attitudes </v>

2793
02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:31.600
<v Speaker 3>is through rapport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best way to help people,</v>

2794
02:08:31.601 --> 02:08:32.434
<v Speaker 3>and if you read the the Christian books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they talk about this interesting book </v>

2795
02:08:35.801 --> 02:08:40.090
<v Speaker 3>called tactics and the main thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2796
02:08:40.091 --> 02:08:42.460
<v Speaker 3>develop relationships with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're friendly,</v>

2797
02:08:42.461 --> 02:08:43.294
<v Speaker 3>they're kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trustworthy of communities with </v>

2798
02:08:45.041 --> 02:08:45.874
<v Speaker 3>people and that gets them involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their community and thus their faith </v>

2799
02:08:49.930 --> 02:08:51.400
<v Speaker 3>based blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with Jujitsu.</v>

2800
02:08:51.401 --> 02:08:52.234
<v Speaker 3>I have like some great guys I was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out with the other day who do </v>

2801
02:08:53.961 --> 02:08:54.794
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>

2802
02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:55.773
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is also interesting just </v>
<v Speaker 3>parenthetically because you have such a </v>

2803
02:08:59.471 --> 02:09:03.400
<v Speaker 3>trust of the people you work out with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have a bond.</v>

2804
02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:08.110
<v Speaker 3>A buddy of mine is a prosecutor for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state and you know how you have to say,</v>

2805
02:09:08.111 --> 02:09:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this guy.</v>

2806
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:10.143
<v Speaker 3>When he knew another guy who's also a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine and they did Jujitsu </v>

2807
02:09:12.431 --> 02:09:16.120
<v Speaker 3>together and he told the judge and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyer and they said they have,</v>

2808
02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:19.720
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neither one of those people do Jujitsu.</v>

2809
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:21.183
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's no freaking way that I </v>

2810
02:09:22.871 --> 02:09:23.704
<v Speaker 3>would let someone do Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit on a jury with somebody else who's </v>

2811
02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:29.630
<v Speaker 3>either the prosecutor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the defender,</v>

2812
02:09:29.631 --> 02:09:30.464
<v Speaker 3>because those people trust each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to trust each other </v>

2813
02:09:33.010 --> 02:09:35.730
<v Speaker 3>when you do Jujitsu or people will break</v>
<v Speaker 3>your arm still choke deck.</v>

2814
02:09:35.731 --> 02:09:39.070
<v Speaker 3>You're also part of a very tight knit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and unusual community.</v>

2815
02:09:39.070 --> 02:09:39.903
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have this bond with each other that </v>

2816
02:09:41.711 --> 02:09:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people understand your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your practice and killing each other.</v>

2817
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

2818
02:09:45.730 --> 02:09:46.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're practicing breaking each other's </v>

2819
02:09:47.531 --> 02:09:48.190
<v Speaker 3>arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2820
02:09:48.190 --> 02:09:50.740
<v Speaker 3>So I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that chicken story,</v>

2821
02:09:50.741 --> 02:09:55.741
<v Speaker 3>and I told that because often we think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the best response to be when,</v>

2822
02:09:56.670 --> 02:10:00.040
<v Speaker 3>when we're being mistreated or we </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceive an injustice or unfairness just</v>

2823
02:10:00.041 --> 02:10:04.570
<v Speaker 3>to lash out and a type of emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>maturity is just to not lash out.</v>

2824
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:05.823
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a really good strategy which I've </v>

2825
02:10:08.351 --> 02:10:10.900
<v Speaker 3>adopted instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly much easier than,</v>

2826
02:10:10.930 --> 02:10:14.890
<v Speaker 3>than attempting to do the emotional work</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being kind and compassionate is just,</v>

2827
02:10:14.891 --> 02:10:15.724
<v Speaker 3>just ignore people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to meet their nastiness </v>

2828
02:10:18.161 --> 02:10:20.080
<v Speaker 3>with nastiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just walk away.</v>

2829
02:10:20.730 --> 02:10:22.630
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he could pull it off,</v>

2830
02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:25.690
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people get pissed off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told you like fuck this guy.</v>

2831
02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that also is what I call the</v>

2832
02:10:28.931 --> 02:10:32.080
<v Speaker 3>battery effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also a good aspect of Jujitsu.</v>

2833
02:10:32.590 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I think beings have</v>

2834
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:34.873
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of energy that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>store up in their body because I think </v>

2835
02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:39.140
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our bodies are,</v>

2836
02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:40.393
<v Speaker 2>we have this ancient structure that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been passed on from generation to </v>

2837
02:10:44.181 --> 02:10:45.014
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands of years of </v>

2838
02:10:46.791 --> 02:10:47.624
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for the most part up until really </v>

2839
02:10:50.331 --> 02:10:51.164
<v Speaker 2>recently you were constantly engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical activity and conflict and your </v>

2840
02:10:55.101 --> 02:10:55.934
<v Speaker 2>body is designed for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe your body has a certain </v>

2841
02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:01.040
<v Speaker 2>amount of requirements for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expenditure of energy.</v>

2842
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And when you don't meet those </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirements,</v>

2843
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:06.680
<v Speaker 2>your battery overflows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what road rage is.</v>

2844
02:11:06.681 --> 02:11:07.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2845
02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:08.733
<v Speaker 2>irrational responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know personally from my own </v>

2846
02:11:10.971 --> 02:11:15.590
<v Speaker 2>experience in my own shortcomings when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had irrational responses is because</v>

2847
02:11:15.770 --> 02:11:16.603
<v Speaker 2>I have not maintained my body correctly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have not taken care of that </v>

2848
02:11:18.921 --> 02:11:21.560
<v Speaker 2>battery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when it comes up,</v>

2849
02:11:21.561 --> 02:11:22.394
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're someone like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even more consequential because </v>

2850
02:11:25.131 --> 02:11:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I've done it my whole life.</v>

2851
02:11:26.650 --> 02:11:29.360
<v Speaker 2>So my whole life has been about </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploding,</v>

2852
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:30.260
<v Speaker 2>punching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking.</v>

2853
02:11:30.370 --> 02:11:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm just all look kettlebells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

2854
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:35.320
<v Speaker 2>there's all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rah,</v>

2855
02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Rah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rah,</v>

2856
02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Rah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in doing that,</v>

2857
02:11:36.651 --> 02:11:38.990
<v Speaker 2>if I get it out of my system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tranquil.</v>

2858
02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:40.213
<v Speaker 2>Everything's calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I don't get out of my system </v>

2859
02:11:41.401 --> 02:11:42.350
<v Speaker 2>was about my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2860
02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I think this is an opportunity to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck a class.</v>

2861
02:11:45.860 --> 02:11:47.750
<v Speaker 2>You got all this extra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2862
02:11:47.751 --> 02:11:48.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you bought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2863
02:11:48.831 --> 02:11:50.380
<v Speaker 2>come on bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

2864
02:11:50.381 --> 02:11:51.680
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stored up.</v>

2865
02:11:51.710 --> 02:11:53.600
<v Speaker 2>You've got too much juice in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>battery.</v>

2866
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:57.620
<v Speaker 2>And Jujitsu people for the most part are</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the most mellow,</v>

2867
02:11:57.621 --> 02:11:58.454
<v Speaker 2>calm and relaxed people outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also have the benefit of knowing </v>

2868
02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:06.470
<v Speaker 2>that the average person literally has no</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea how to defend themselves.</v>

2869
02:12:06.630 --> 02:12:07.463
<v Speaker 2>We know this because we have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally humiliated as an average </v>

2870
02:12:10.881 --> 02:12:11.714
<v Speaker 2>person going into Jujitsu and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a practitioner and you become </v>

2871
02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:17.720
<v Speaker 2>fairly proficient and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand your limitations,</v>

2872
02:12:17.721 --> 02:12:21.380
<v Speaker 2>but you also understand much more deeply</v>
<v Speaker 2>the limitations of the average person.</v>

2873
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2874
02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:22.891
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't.</v>

2875
02:12:22.891 --> 02:12:23.724
<v Speaker 2>Having an at from my perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 2>encyclopedic knowledge of martial arts </v>

2876
02:12:26.631 --> 02:12:29.900
<v Speaker 2>and lineages and people in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

2877
02:12:30.170 --> 02:12:32.150
<v Speaker 2>the people I've met like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The people you meet who are just the </v>

2887
02:12:49.671 --> 02:12:51.710
<v Speaker 2>most dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deadly people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they got nothing to prove.</v>

2889
02:12:53.210 --> 02:12:54.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem to be the nicest people you </v>

2890
02:12:55.221 --> 02:12:57.380
<v Speaker 2>ever met Marcella Garcia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2891
02:12:57.410 --> 02:13:01.010
<v Speaker 2>He's the sweetest of sweeties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just like a smiling,</v>

2892
02:13:01.011 --> 02:13:02.950
<v Speaker 2>happy assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2893
02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:04.610
<v Speaker 2>When you're around him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so nice.</v>

2894
02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.350
<v Speaker 2>He's just such a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>

2895
02:13:06.351 --> 02:13:07.184
<v Speaker 2>when you're around them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Eddie Bravo is fucking nicest </v>

2896
02:13:08.931 --> 02:13:10.520
<v Speaker 2>guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always nice.</v>

2897
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2898
02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:13.730
<v Speaker 2>and then as I went out to a bar a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>while ago,</v>

2899
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:14.623
<v Speaker 2>and a guy had a black belt around his </v>
<v Speaker 2>waist as a belt and he was playing pool </v>

2900
02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:23.690
<v Speaker 2>and I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy has some issues.</v>

2901
02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:27.290
<v Speaker 2>It was a dangling a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how you tie a belt around a g?</v>

2902
02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:28.970
<v Speaker 2>He was tied it around his pants like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2903
02:13:28.971 --> 02:13:29.890
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

2904
02:13:29.970 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two were dangling like</v>

2905
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.813
<v Speaker 4>a black belt with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he wanted to let everybody know that </v>

2906
02:13:34.291 --> 02:13:35.480
<v Speaker 4>he's a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2907
02:13:35.490 --> 02:13:37.740
<v Speaker 4>you just buy a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing I tell people,</v>

2908
02:13:37.741 --> 02:13:38.574
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can get a black belt from like </v>

2909
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:42.750
<v Speaker 4>online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you buy them and then they come and then</v>

2910
02:13:42.751 --> 02:13:44.380
<v Speaker 4>you put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't have to earn it.</v>

2911
02:13:44.381 --> 02:13:47.280
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a sacred forging ground,</v>

2912
02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:50.850
<v Speaker 4>black belts where there's only one way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to just pay a lot of money.</v>

2913
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:53.640
<v Speaker 4>You don't even have to fucking do a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fantasy martial art.</v>

2914
02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:56.130
<v Speaker 4>You could just be a regular guy or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>black belt.</v>

2915
02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:57.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you literally can,</v>

2916
02:13:57.931 --> 02:13:59.730
<v Speaker 4>there was a video really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2917
02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:00.564
<v Speaker 4>it still does happen to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If some guy showing up at a Brazilian </v>

2918
02:14:03.331 --> 02:14:05.580
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he puts on a game,</v>

2919
02:14:05.850 --> 02:14:09.240
<v Speaker 4>I think he had a wrestling shoes on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a black belt and a,</v>

2920
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:12.450
<v Speaker 4>he showed up at this gym and he started </v>
<v Speaker 4>a working out with people.</v>

2921
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:13.283
<v Speaker 4>And then the instructor realized </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately that this guy was not a </v>

2922
02:14:16.291 --> 02:14:17.124
<v Speaker 4>black belt and humiliated him and punish</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and tell him to take the belt off </v>

2923
02:14:20.731 --> 02:14:23.280
<v Speaker 4>and get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was screaming at him.</v>

2924
02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:25.290
<v Speaker 4>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the beauty of Jujitsu too,</v>

2925
02:14:25.291 --> 02:14:27.330
<v Speaker 4>is you can't pretend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot pretend.</v>

2926
02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:29.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can pretend in some martial arts,</v>

2927
02:14:30.090 --> 02:14:33.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's guys that invent moves </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they think,</v>

2928
02:14:33.871 --> 02:14:34.704
<v Speaker 4>like with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my favorite videos as these guys </v>

2929
02:14:36.151 --> 02:14:38.730
<v Speaker 4>in Harlem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not videos.</v>

2930
02:14:38.731 --> 02:14:41.200
<v Speaker 4>There's a series of them who practice </v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

2931
02:14:41.250 --> 02:14:45.030
<v Speaker 4>some sort of fake Kung Fu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like one guy will,</v>

2932
02:14:45.031 --> 02:14:46.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be like,</v>

2933
02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:48.810
<v Speaker 4>he'll throw a punch and then the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy will go,</v>

2934
02:14:48.811 --> 02:14:50.690
<v Speaker 4>well if someone does that to me when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do is,</v>

2935
02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:51.340
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2936
02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:54.240
<v Speaker 4>they don't say it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say it in a very urban way.</v>

2937
02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Like not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

2938
02:14:55.801 --> 02:14:56.634
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit ain't gonna work cause I'm </v>

2939
02:14:57.121 --> 02:15:00.090
<v Speaker 4>gonna step over here and I'm attack with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chicken wing and then I got a,</v>

2940
02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:00.924
<v Speaker 4>I got a monkey Paul and they invent all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff on my attack your ribs for </v>

2941
02:15:03.901 --> 02:15:04.734
<v Speaker 4>this position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then their guys also in on it </v>

2942
02:15:06.211 --> 02:15:07.980
<v Speaker 4>because they're also practicing </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

2943
02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:09.001
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

2944
02:15:09.001 --> 02:15:09.451
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2945
02:15:09.451 --> 02:15:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I see how that would work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2946
02:15:11.090 --> 02:15:11.923
<v Speaker 4>what's hilarious is sometimes these guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually have fights and when they have </v>

2947
02:15:16.231 --> 02:15:20.040
<v Speaker 4>fights it becomes like two kids in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking school yard.</v>

2948
02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:22.590
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a brawl on the ground.</v>

2949
02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:26.130
<v Speaker 4>These wind up clawing at each other and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't do anything.</v>

2950
02:15:26.131 --> 02:15:28.450
<v Speaker 4>There's no Kung Fu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no monkey paw.</v>

2951
02:15:28.451 --> 02:15:29.284
<v Speaker 4>There's no attack the ribs with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>knife point fingers and all this stupid </v>

2952
02:15:32.851 --> 02:15:34.830
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you watch these guys do it.</v>

2953
02:15:34.831 --> 02:15:37.920
<v Speaker 4>And me as a person who studied martial </v>
<v Speaker 4>arts my whole life.</v>

2954
02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:38.993
<v Speaker 4>I know I don't practice Kung Fu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know what is actually Kung Fu and </v>

2955
02:15:43.621 --> 02:15:45.420
<v Speaker 4>what is some shit that someone's making </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

2956
02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.670
<v Speaker 4>They're just practicing and making </v>
<v Speaker 4>things up.</v>

2957
02:15:47.790 --> 02:15:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could go to even a common food dojo</v>

2958
02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:55.020
<v Speaker 4>and try and pretend that that stuff's </v>
<v Speaker 4>real and the Kung Fu guy would go like,</v>

2959
02:15:55.021 --> 02:15:56.270
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this?</v>

2960
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:57.383
<v Speaker 4>You're inventing things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you feel bad for those guys at </v>

2961
02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:00.511
<v Speaker 4>some level?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2962
02:16:00.511 --> 02:16:01.800
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2963
02:16:02.010 --> 02:16:05.970
<v Speaker 4>I think that a lot of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they had just found the correct path,</v>

2964
02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:10.590
<v Speaker 4>would benefit greatly if they just found</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real martial arts school.</v>

2965
02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:13.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's what I think part of it is,</v>

2966
02:16:13.710 --> 02:16:14.543
<v Speaker 4>I think that they engage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm really interested to hear what </v>

2967
02:16:17.491 --> 02:16:18.324
<v Speaker 4>you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that they engage in a </v>

2968
02:16:19.951 --> 02:16:22.260
<v Speaker 4>willingness to self deceive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2969
02:16:22.261 --> 02:16:24.210
<v Speaker 4>a hundred percent yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100% yeah.</v>

2970
02:16:24.450 --> 02:16:25.800
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's mutual.</v>

2971
02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:27.960
<v Speaker 4>It's with both people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they,</v>

2972
02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:29.093
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2973
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:31.480
<v Speaker 4>reinforce each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see it in religion too though.</v>

2974
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:34.210
<v Speaker 4>You see that in religion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>God finds a way.</v>

2975
02:16:34.211 --> 02:16:36.300
<v Speaker 4>Yes he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God does find a way.</v>

2976
02:16:36.370 --> 02:16:40.150
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile they leave and smoke crack and</v>
<v Speaker 4>suck some dude's Dick people are crazy.</v>

2977
02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:41.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they do.</v>

2978
02:16:41.021 --> 02:16:44.020
<v Speaker 4>They pretend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pretend and they loved.</v>

2979
02:16:44.050 --> 02:16:44.883
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that people love about</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christians and Christians love about </v>

2980
02:16:48.041 --> 02:16:49.180
<v Speaker 4>Christians and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2981
02:16:49.181 --> 02:16:50.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Christian too,</v>

2982
02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.660
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They you're saying no.</v>

2983
02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:53.620
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tribalism.</v>

2984
02:16:53.621 --> 02:16:56.410
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that at least in the moment,</v>

2985
02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:59.890
<v Speaker 4>you are going to engage in some very </v>
<v Speaker 4>predictable behavior.</v>

2986
02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:01.340
<v Speaker 4>You're going to engage in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2987
02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:02.213
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2994
02:17:17.261 --> 02:17:18.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You like country music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you Luke Bryan Fan Bait to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>course and I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've got a belt buckle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a big belt buckle.</v>

2999
02:17:25.061 --> 02:17:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what about your boots?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at my boots or cowboy boots.</v>

3000
02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:28.530
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like we,</v>

3001
02:17:28.530 --> 02:17:29.363
<v Speaker 4>we engage in these really predictable </v>
<v Speaker 4>patterns and people find comfort in </v>

3002
02:17:32.801 --> 02:17:34.000
<v Speaker 4>those patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3003
02:17:34.001 --> 02:17:36.370
<v Speaker 4>And we tend to like people who are like </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves.</v>

3004
02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:37.360
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

3005
02:17:37.361 --> 02:17:39.350
<v Speaker 4>It's very much a tribalism thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3006
02:17:39.370 --> 02:17:40.870
<v Speaker 4>it's also very much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3007
02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:41.773
<v Speaker 4>it reinforces your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you have a lack of willingness </v>

3008
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:47.703
<v Speaker 4>or ability or whatever it is to question</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reality that you have been shown </v>

3009
02:17:52.121 --> 02:17:53.560
<v Speaker 4>that you have subscribed to.</v>

3010
02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:55.870
<v Speaker 4>If you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not willing to question it and</v>

3011
02:17:55.871 --> 02:17:58.180
<v Speaker 4>you find someone else who was also not </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to question it,</v>

3012
02:17:58.181 --> 02:18:00.700
<v Speaker 4>there's some comfort in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you reassure each other,</v>

3013
02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:02.290
<v Speaker 4>there's some comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's absolutely right.</v>

3014
02:18:02.291 --> 02:18:06.070
<v Speaker 4>And that's why it's so important for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to be honest with themselves.</v>

3015
02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.620
<v Speaker 4>And how do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we promote those values of people</v>

3016
02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:12.513
<v Speaker 4>of self honesty this way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that is exactly what </v>

3017
02:18:15.581 --> 02:18:17.410
<v Speaker 4>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is the way you do it.</v>

3018
02:18:17.590 --> 02:18:18.423
<v Speaker 4>And especially the conversation like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this that will be heard by more than a </v>

3019
02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:21.813
<v Speaker 4>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3020
02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:23.380
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the way you do it.</v>

3021
02:18:23.410 --> 02:18:25.240
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying those Willem doing broom</v>

3022
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:26.103
<v Speaker 4>to fix in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying humans talking to each </v>

3023
02:18:28.301 --> 02:18:29.920
<v Speaker 4>other through social media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

3024
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:32.350
<v Speaker 4>I want various math,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just throw this out now.</v>

3025
02:18:32.351 --> 02:18:33.130
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3026
02:18:33.130 --> 02:18:33.761
<v Speaker 4>everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3027
02:18:33.761 --> 02:18:35.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would come after postmodernism,</v>

3028
02:18:35.861 --> 02:18:36.040
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3029
02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:37.810
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if this comes after </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism.</v>

3030
02:18:37.811 --> 02:18:38.644
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if these truth telling </v>

3031
02:18:39.731 --> 02:18:40.564
<v Speaker 4>conversations come after postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why say I certainly think there's a </v>

3032
02:18:44.861 --> 02:18:45.694
<v Speaker 4>great benefit to talking to people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>having people be honest and even in an </v>

3033
02:18:49.690 --> 02:18:52.060
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable way where when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>listened to it,</v>

3034
02:18:52.061 --> 02:18:53.170
<v Speaker 4>it makes you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3035
02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:56.920
<v Speaker 4>there's lights that go on in my head </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I hear someone say something,</v>

3036
02:18:56.950 --> 02:19:00.790
<v Speaker 4>maybe maybe they'll be vulnerable or </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe there'll be like introspective and</v>

3037
02:19:00.791 --> 02:19:01.624
<v Speaker 4>almost a painful way when I hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's lights that go on in my head </v>

3038
02:19:04.691 --> 02:19:05.291
<v Speaker 4>while I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

3039
02:19:05.291 --> 02:19:06.124
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting some real shit from this </v>

3040
02:19:06.941 --> 02:19:07.774
<v Speaker 4>person and I'll find in myself these </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments that relate to what this guy is </v>

3041
02:19:12.491 --> 02:19:13.240
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

3042
02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:14.073
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to see themselves from this point </v>

3043
02:19:15.491 --> 02:19:18.820
<v Speaker 4>of view as opposed to a newscaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When someone is,</v>

3044
02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:21.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>today in Los Angeles,</v>

3045
02:19:21.161 --> 02:19:21.994
<v Speaker 4>we found out the hard way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens when you don't obey the </v>

3046
02:19:25.631 --> 02:19:27.860
<v Speaker 4>law?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no re</v>

3047
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:29.900
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

3048
02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:32.330
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no human in there.</v>

3049
02:19:32.570 --> 02:19:37.130
<v Speaker 2>This is a strip club dj coming up on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>main stage.</v>

3050
02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:42.110

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3051
02:19:42.111 --> 02:19:44.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like these are patterns that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not real,</v>

3052
02:19:44.991 --> 02:19:49.991
<v Speaker 2>that people subscribe to and adopt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then perpetrate and,</v>

3053
02:19:50.121 --> 02:19:52.700
<v Speaker 2>and they do it over and over again in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the business world.</v>

3054
02:19:52.701 --> 02:19:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Hello Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's the family?</v>

3055
02:19:54.921 --> 02:19:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Is Everything good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These patterns are like,</v>

3056
02:19:57.830 --> 02:20:01.310
<v Speaker 2>they protect you from having to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable and real.</v>

3057
02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:02.293
<v Speaker 2>They buy by adopting these predetermined</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns of behavior that we all are </v>

3058
02:20:06.981 --> 02:20:10.160
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with and we all know as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>god fearing Christian man,</v>

3059
02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:11.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a god fearing Christian man,</v>

3060
02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:12.380
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swap.</v>

3061
02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand where you're coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>from there sir.</v>

3062
02:20:14.210 --> 02:20:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Give me a handshake right now on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're on the same page that what they're</v>

3063
02:20:17.421 --> 02:20:18.430
<v Speaker 2>doing is they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3064
02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:19.273
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're removing the possibility of </v>

3065
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:25.670
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability and of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of reality and authenticity.</v>

3066
02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:26.533
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Authenticity is the perfect word and </v>

3067
02:20:27.441 --> 02:20:29.090
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes me sad for them.</v>

3068
02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:30.871
<v Speaker 2>It really does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3069
02:20:30.871 --> 02:20:34.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a type of tragedy when you get sad </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the shit that I don't get sad.</v>

3070
02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:36.890
<v Speaker 2>I get sad at cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3071
02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't get set of cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do feel the impetus to help people</v>

3072
02:20:40.641 --> 02:20:41.474
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I do feel that it's important that </v>

3073
02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:47.000
<v Speaker 2>that people are laboring under beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>about reality.</v>

3074
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.863
<v Speaker 2>Like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy based martial arts that just </v>

3075
02:20:49.101 --> 02:20:51.710
<v Speaker 2>simply aren't true and they're wasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>their time.</v>

3076
02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:52.633
<v Speaker 2>But unlike fantasy martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people vote and these people </v>

3077
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:59.240
<v Speaker 2>affect decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They directly affect my life.</v>

3078
02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3079
02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:01.843
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially social issues comes a real </v>

3080
02:21:03.561 --> 02:21:04.520
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3081
02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:05.413
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a real problem when you start</v>
<v Speaker 2>blocking people's access to certain </v>

3082
02:21:08.811 --> 02:21:12.860
<v Speaker 2>medical procedures and deciding what can</v>
<v Speaker 2>and can be done based on,</v>

3083
02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:13.843
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what was happening during the </v>

3084
02:21:14.571 --> 02:21:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Bush administration when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it came to stem cell research,</v>

3085
02:21:17.961 --> 02:21:18.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3086
02:21:18.470 --> 02:21:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was fucking shackled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped because everybody,</v>

3087
02:21:21.921 --> 02:21:22.754
<v Speaker 2>they're gold sail bay bees and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to kill babies and just </v>

3088
02:21:25.941 --> 02:21:29.020
<v Speaker 2>get the stem cells from embryos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

3089
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Satan mean stem cells from skin you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

3090
02:21:32.751 --> 02:21:36.600
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has like advanced in progress.</v>

3091
02:21:36.601 --> 02:21:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the Indians and South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Koreans?</v>

3092
02:21:38.271 --> 02:21:39.104
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just we got fucked by </v>

3093
02:21:40.521 --> 02:21:43.130
<v Speaker 2>religious ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got in the way of medical innovation.</v>

3094
02:21:43.310 --> 02:21:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Itchy I think.</v>

3095
02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I think part of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about this a lot.</v>

3096
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:49.543
<v Speaker 2>I think part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way that we can at least dent this </v>

3097
02:21:52.861 --> 02:21:56.540
<v Speaker 2>problem is by promoting the value of </v>
<v Speaker 2>honesty.</v>

3098
02:21:57.260 --> 02:21:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Because if we promote the value of </v>
<v Speaker 2>honesty,</v>

3099
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.823
<v Speaker 2>then with that comes the willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 2>revise people's beliefs and we have to </v>

3100
02:22:04.341 --> 02:22:05.900
<v Speaker 2>make it okay to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3101
02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:07.190
<v Speaker 2>like I'm totally cool.</v>

3102
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:08.780
<v Speaker 2>It's you sitting here and you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these guys.</v>

3103
02:22:08.781 --> 02:22:09.614
<v Speaker 2>I don't know all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the beautiful </v>

3104
02:22:11.421 --> 02:22:12.254
<v Speaker 2>things about this new age of information</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that is impossible now clearly to </v>

3105
02:22:18.081 --> 02:22:20.360
<v Speaker 2>know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one can know everything,</v>

3106
02:22:20.690 --> 02:22:21.523
<v Speaker 2>so it's okay to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know now where it used to be a </v>

3107
02:22:24.651 --> 02:22:28.940
<v Speaker 2>sign of you are poorly motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are poorly educated or what?</v>

3108
02:22:29.100 --> 02:22:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not very educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to college for three years.</v>

3109
02:22:32.311 --> 02:22:35.580
<v Speaker 2>I barely paid attention and I only did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because I didn't want people to think</v>

3110
02:22:35.581 --> 02:22:38.040
<v Speaker 2>I was a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I barely made it out of high school,</v>

3111
02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:41.610
<v Speaker 2>but since that time I've read a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

3112
02:22:41.611 --> 02:22:42.444
<v Speaker 2>have watched a lot of documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a lot of fascinating </v>

3113
02:22:44.131 --> 02:22:47.670
<v Speaker 2>conversations with people and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulated some information.</v>

3114
02:22:47.730 --> 02:22:49.830
<v Speaker 2>So am I educated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really,</v>

3115
02:22:49.831 --> 02:22:52.440
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm an educated on certain things</v>

3116
02:22:52.441 --> 02:22:53.070
<v Speaker 2>about light.</v>

3117
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I would say maybe not formally educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

3118
02:22:55.921 --> 02:22:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

3119
02:22:57.030 --> 02:23:01.110
<v Speaker 2>where is formality now when you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>formal education?</v>

3120
02:23:01.111 --> 02:23:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on with your school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

3121
02:23:02.911 --> 02:23:04.560
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not La sit now.</v>

3122
02:23:04.561 --> 02:23:05.820
<v Speaker 2>All schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all schools.</v>

3123
02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:08.340
<v Speaker 2>What is it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's not education.</v>

3124
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:09.031
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3125
02:23:09.031 --> 02:23:13.440
<v Speaker 2>you're being indoctrinated into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous ideology.</v>

3126
02:23:13.650 --> 02:23:15.390
<v Speaker 2>If you're participating in that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

3127
02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:18.030
<v Speaker 2>it's worse than it's anti education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Kata.</v>

3128
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in a lot of ways.</v>

3129
02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:21.990
<v Speaker 2>In a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3130
02:23:21.991 --> 02:23:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is just like religion and,</v>

3131
02:23:24.861 --> 02:23:25.694
<v Speaker 2>and that's what my friend Kurt Metzger </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying about the social justice </v>

3132
02:23:28.441 --> 02:23:29.490
<v Speaker 2>warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3133
02:23:29.491 --> 02:23:30.121
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3134
02:23:30.121 --> 02:23:31.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this.</v>

3135
02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:34.680
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a fucking call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what this is.</v>

3136
02:23:34.770 --> 02:23:36.780
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me I can't think about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other way.</v>

3137
02:23:36.781 --> 02:23:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his reaction to it is very bright.</v>

3138
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:42.720
<v Speaker 2>He gets angry at it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's not like a violent guy,</v>

3139
02:23:42.721 --> 02:23:43.840
<v Speaker 2>but he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

3140
02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:45.060
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking bullshit.</v>

3141
02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is bullshit.</v>

3142
02:23:46.290 --> 02:23:47.760
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making me think a certain way.</v>

3143
02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3144
02:23:48.781 --> 02:23:51.270
<v Speaker 2>And in the bigger picture of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3145
02:23:51.271 --> 02:23:52.104
<v Speaker 2>America has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a somewhat of a controversial </v>

3146
02:23:54.181 --> 02:23:54.630
<v Speaker 2>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3147
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:55.463
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not the great superpower we used </v>

3148
02:23:56.911 --> 02:23:57.744
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the one thing that we make for </v>

3149
02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:00.063
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one thing we've always had is we've </v>

3150
02:24:03.061 --> 02:24:03.894
<v Speaker 2>had strong institutions and strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities and now we're seeing those </v>

3151
02:24:07.890 --> 02:24:08.723
<v Speaker 2>being undermined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the humanities in general </v>

3152
02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:12.990
<v Speaker 2>and even to a certain extent in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences and it,</v>

3153
02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:14.220
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't assign it.</v>

3154
02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:16.500
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I said,</v>

3155
02:24:16.501 --> 02:24:17.430
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't,</v>

3156
02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know because I'm not in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sciences so I can't speak to that.</v>

3157
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:24.030
<v Speaker 2>But just anecdotally from what I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard of people,</v>

3158
02:24:24.031 --> 02:24:24.331
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

3159
02:24:24.331 --> 02:24:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak to that.</v>

3160
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:26.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about,</v>

3161
02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:31.110
<v Speaker 2>but anecdotally can come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific examples because that's where I</v>

3162
02:24:31.111 --> 02:24:31.944
<v Speaker 2>haven't heard it interfered with except </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the idea of promoting more women in </v>

3163
02:24:36.961 --> 02:24:38.820
<v Speaker 2>science and there's some how or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sex.</v>

3164
02:24:38.821 --> 02:24:40.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was in science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was thinking.</v>

3165
02:24:40.501 --> 02:24:42.570
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's the problem with that.</v>

3166
02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:43.823
<v Speaker 2>Why are there no diversity requirements </v>
<v Speaker 2>with sports teams that will write like </v>

3167
02:24:48.931 --> 02:24:49.764
<v Speaker 2>football teams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come they don't need to have a </v>

3168
02:24:50.701 --> 02:24:52.380
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of women because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to win,</v>

3169
02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:55.080
<v Speaker 2>but also they don't want women to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>

3170
02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:56.513
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's different because it's </v>

3171
02:24:57.541 --> 02:24:58.770
<v Speaker 2>physical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3172
02:24:58.830 --> 02:25:00.240
<v Speaker 2>well why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't they say,</v>

3173
02:25:00.241 --> 02:25:03.330
<v Speaker 2>well we need so many Puerto Ricans here </v>
<v Speaker 2>or we need so many,</v>

3174
02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:07.650
<v Speaker 2>there aren't diversity requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's a word flight exogenous.</v>

3175
02:25:07.651 --> 02:25:08.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like an X.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that word.</v>

3176
02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:09.241
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

3177
02:25:09.241 --> 02:25:14.241
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because because they want to win.</v>

3178
02:25:14.251 --> 02:25:16.470
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're telling you this is important to</v>

3179
02:25:16.471 --> 02:25:17.304
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you impose a value on a system </v>

3180
02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is winning is the value</v>

3181
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:26.170
<v Speaker 3>and that's an marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3182
02:25:26.171 --> 02:25:27.640
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a con competition.</v>

3183
02:25:27.641 --> 02:25:29.560
<v Speaker 3>That's a free market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime you say,</v>

3184
02:25:29.561 --> 02:25:32.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you also need diversity,</v>

3185
02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:37.800
<v Speaker 3>then you're making it more difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to win a meritocracy is like that.</v>

3186
02:25:38.111 --> 02:25:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want people in a system to have in,</v>

3187
02:25:42.371 --> 02:25:43.720
<v Speaker 3>in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you what those are.</v>

3188
02:25:43.721 --> 02:25:44.554
<v Speaker 3>You need to be well published.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had works need to be cited by </v>

3189
02:25:46.181 --> 02:25:47.570
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to have the,</v>

3190
02:25:47.610 --> 02:25:48.760
<v Speaker 3>we have all these metrics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3191
02:25:48.761 --> 02:25:49.594
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty straightforward and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>either live up to the metrics or you </v>

3192
02:25:51.611 --> 02:25:52.444
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now this is why I was talking about </v>

3193
02:25:55.661 --> 02:25:56.494
<v Speaker 3>the sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you tried to put people in </v>

3194
02:25:58.181 --> 02:26:01.720
<v Speaker 3>positions who are not qualified for </v>
<v Speaker 3>those positions,</v>

3195
02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:05.920
<v Speaker 3>you undermine the meritocracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're trying to put people,</v>

3196
02:26:06.010 --> 02:26:07.780
<v Speaker 3>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's not enough women here,</v>

3197
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:09.070
<v Speaker 3>we need to find more women.</v>

3198
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:11.220
<v Speaker 3>There are not enough African American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well enough.</v>

3199
02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:12.430
<v Speaker 3>That's a trickier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there,</v>

3200
02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:15.070
<v Speaker 3>there are very few African Americans who</v>
<v Speaker 3>study philosophy.</v>

3201
02:26:15.610 --> 02:26:18.010
<v Speaker 3>If you are an African American with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>phd in philosophy,</v>

3202
02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:21.310
<v Speaker 3>may you are your gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is awesome.</v>

3203
02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:22.473
<v Speaker 3>So an African American with a phd for </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy can kind of write their own </v>

3204
02:26:25.541 --> 02:26:26.374
<v Speaker 3>ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3205
02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] a good thing cause they want</v>

3206
02:26:30.481 --> 02:26:31.314
<v Speaker 3>to promote more African Americans get </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in philosophy and then perhaps </v>

3207
02:26:34.811 --> 02:26:38.780
<v Speaker 3>that will sort of engage more people </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

3208
02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:39.673
<v Speaker 3>Now this is now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a really interesting </v>

3209
02:26:41.051 --> 02:26:41.884
<v Speaker 3>conversation that we should have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the kind of thing at this point </v>

3210
02:26:45.970 --> 02:26:46.803
<v Speaker 3>in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to shut down the discourse </v>

3211
02:26:48.251 --> 02:26:51.550
<v Speaker 3>because someone's going to be offended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's an important question</v>

3212
02:26:51.730 --> 02:26:55.930
<v Speaker 3>because your question is basically it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a kind of utilitarian calculus like,</v>

3213
02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:56.590
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3214
02:26:56.590 --> 02:26:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

3215
02:26:59.561 --> 02:27:01.030
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to look at the evidence.</v>

3216
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:02.560
<v Speaker 3>Regressives don't like evidence very </v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

3217
02:27:02.561 --> 02:27:06.100
<v Speaker 3>but we have to look at the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the evidence?</v>

3218
02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:09.040
<v Speaker 3>If there are more African Americans in </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>

3219
02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:11.170
<v Speaker 3>can they mentor more African American </v>
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>

3220
02:27:11.171 --> 02:27:12.490
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

3221
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:15.280
<v Speaker 3>I would think that we would want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a good thing.</v>

3222
02:27:15.310 --> 02:27:19.330
<v Speaker 3>That would be something that would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful.</v>

3223
02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:20.463
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that mean that we would hire a </v>

3224
02:27:23.141 --> 02:27:28.141
<v Speaker 3>candidate who does not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would not be hired if that candidate</v>

3225
02:27:29.891 --> 02:27:31.180
<v Speaker 3>had a different skin color?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3226
02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Like that whole thing undermines the </v>
<v Speaker 3>meritocracy,</v>

3227
02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:35.433
<v Speaker 3>but the moment that you start talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about putting a diversity requirement </v>

3228
02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:39.610
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

3229
02:27:39.611 --> 02:27:41.770
<v Speaker 3>my discipline philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in essence,</v>

3230
02:27:41.771 --> 02:27:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're saying is it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

3231
02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:48.910
<v Speaker 3>Your discipline isn't important because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't do that when the outcome really</v>

3232
02:27:48.911 --> 02:27:51.610
<v Speaker 3>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't do that with brain surgery.</v>

3233
02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:53.290
<v Speaker 3>We don't do that with sports teams.</v>

3234
02:27:53.650 --> 02:27:57.160
<v Speaker 3>So we're not looking for the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>candidates.</v>

3235
02:27:57.430 --> 02:27:58.263
<v Speaker 3>What we're looking for is to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>people into these disciplines that may </v>

3236
02:28:03.761 --> 02:28:08.761
<v Speaker 3>not have had the opportunity and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be bad for the overall discipline.</v>

3237
02:28:10.030 --> 02:28:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad for the overall institution.</v>

3238
02:28:12.461 --> 02:28:13.294
<v Speaker 3>It's bad for the discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because you're not finding the best </v>

3239
02:28:15.401 --> 02:28:16.234
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is that you're trying to </v>

3240
02:28:17.081 --> 02:28:20.860
<v Speaker 3>promote these disciplines in places </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people aren't,</v>

3241
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.943
<v Speaker 3>as it were not represented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also they don't have the same </v>

3242
02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:28.820
<v Speaker 3>advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have privileges there,</v>

3243
02:28:28.821 --> 02:28:30.700
<v Speaker 3>don't have good as privileged as another</v>
<v Speaker 3>word we talked about.</v>

3244
02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:32.030
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're underrepresented.</v>

3245
02:28:32.031 --> 02:28:32.864
<v Speaker 3>So we want more people to discipline in </v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as that's not bad in and of </v>

3246
02:28:37.971 --> 02:28:40.820
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we need to have a conversation about</v>

3247
02:28:40.821 --> 02:28:41.690
<v Speaker 3>what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3248
02:28:41.691 --> 02:28:42.524
<v Speaker 3>part of the problem with regressives is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at outcomes instead of </v>

3249
02:28:46.251 --> 02:28:47.084
<v Speaker 3>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to construct systems to give </v>

3250
02:28:49.731 --> 02:28:51.890
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of their skin color,</v>

3251
02:28:51.891 --> 02:28:56.030
<v Speaker 3>of their ethnicity and equal opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and an education or the first rate.</v>

3252
02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:01.280
<v Speaker 3>And what we're seeing instead is systems</v>
<v Speaker 3>being created to orchestrate or engineer</v>

3253
02:29:01.281 --> 02:29:05.600
<v Speaker 3>outcomes produce this many black African</v>
<v Speaker 3>about whatever it is,</v>

3254
02:29:05.601 --> 02:29:06.860
<v Speaker 3>or Hispanic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

3255
02:29:07.310 --> 02:29:09.350
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3256
02:29:09.351 --> 02:29:12.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a bad way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a horrible way to think about it.</v>

3257
02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:17.560
<v Speaker 3>But the other problem is in meritocracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>matters we need,</v>

3258
02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:22.220
<v Speaker 3>we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anything should be institutionalized.</v>

3259
02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:27.520
<v Speaker 3>It should be systems that are raced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blind systems that don't look,</v>

3260
02:29:28.551 --> 02:29:30.350
<v Speaker 3>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could also think about like this,</v>

3261
02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:32.660
<v Speaker 3>think about the black guy who is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>

3262
02:29:32.690 --> 02:29:35.750
<v Speaker 3>who's incredibly smart and qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a student of mine,</v>

3263
02:29:35.751 --> 02:29:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Matt Hernandez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kid is freaking genius,</v>

3264
02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:42.920
<v Speaker 3>like truly one in a million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like much smarter than I am.</v>

3265
02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:44.870
<v Speaker 3>He's published off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>

3266
02:29:44.871 --> 02:29:47.120
<v Speaker 3>the kid's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's Hispanic.</v>

3267
02:29:47.210 --> 02:29:49.640
<v Speaker 3>He's going to get his phd in philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a full ride,</v>

3268
02:29:49.641 --> 02:29:50.474
<v Speaker 3>a full scholarship.</v>

3269
02:29:51.860 --> 02:29:55.970
<v Speaker 3>The crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shame is that when Matt gets in,</v>

3270
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.841
<v Speaker 3>people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3271
02:29:56.841 --> 02:29:58.940
<v Speaker 3>he just got it because he's Hispanic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3272
02:29:59.000 --> 02:29:59.833
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3273
02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:01.580
<v Speaker 3>he got is going to say that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3274
02:30:01.581 --> 02:30:03.770
<v Speaker 3>no one's going to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna think it.</v>

3275
02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>

3276
02:30:05.541 --> 02:30:06.374
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that we can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation to ask people if they're </v>

3277
02:30:08.481 --> 02:30:10.040
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if they say yes,</v>

3278
02:30:10.041 --> 02:30:11.510
<v Speaker 3>there'll be smeared as a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3279
02:30:11.511 --> 02:30:12.344
<v Speaker 3>So then how do you address the issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>with inequality inside of these </v>

3280
02:30:18.261 --> 02:30:20.660
<v Speaker 3>marginalized community?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great question.</v>

3281
02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:23.353
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I think we need to do when </v>

3282
02:30:24.651 --> 02:30:25.484
<v Speaker 3>you look at surveys of if people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think that these lines are </v>

3283
02:30:30.711 --> 02:30:33.260
<v Speaker 3>primarily a po on class drawn upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>

3284
02:30:33.261 --> 02:30:35.990
<v Speaker 3>which is something else no one wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about instead of race.</v>

3285
02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:39.020
<v Speaker 3>It just so happens that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3286
02:30:39.170 --> 02:30:42.140
<v Speaker 3>fewer African Americans frame it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other way.</v>

3287
02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:44.840
<v Speaker 3>More African Americans have bond born </v>
<v Speaker 3>into poverty then,</v>

3288
02:30:44.930 --> 02:30:46.280
<v Speaker 3>then white folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the,</v>

3289
02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:47.233
<v Speaker 3>that's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can also talk about something that's </v>

3290
02:30:50.091 --> 02:30:53.840
<v Speaker 3>really an interesting about criminigenic</v>
<v Speaker 3>factors or risk predictors.</v>

3291
02:30:53.841 --> 02:30:54.674
<v Speaker 3>They're not what you think for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who would be violent criminals did just </v>

3292
02:30:56.601 --> 02:30:58.610
<v Speaker 3>not what you think at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3293
02:30:58.611 --> 02:31:00.320
<v Speaker 3>but people try to make that a ratio </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

3294
02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:05.500
<v Speaker 3>But when you look at these systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at these school systems,</v>

3295
02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:09.050
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3296
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.943
<v Speaker 3>I just totally lost my train of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started thinking about race and Jimi </v>

3297
02:31:12.470 --> 02:31:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Hendrix's photo back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3298
02:31:13.461 --> 02:31:15.440
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you were talking about,</v>

3299
02:31:15.490 --> 02:31:18.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get more,</v>

3300
02:31:18.270 --> 02:31:19.103
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Addressing the issue of income </v>

3301
02:31:20.310 --> 02:31:21.540
<v Speaker 3>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3302
02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:23.760
<v Speaker 3>so what we need to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3303
02:31:23.850 --> 02:31:27.090
<v Speaker 3>we need to start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities.</v>

3304
02:31:27.390 --> 02:31:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is we need to think long</v>

3305
02:31:29.541 --> 02:31:31.140
<v Speaker 3>term and not short term.</v>

3306
02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:33.870
<v Speaker 3>We need to look at the problem and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest.</v>

3307
02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:34.733
<v Speaker 3>And there are some structural issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>with our electorate and the way that </v>

3308
02:31:37.951 --> 02:31:38.784
<v Speaker 3>we've established politics in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country of offices of four years and </v>

3309
02:31:41.491 --> 02:31:42.324
<v Speaker 3>then eight years in numerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to have a longer term vision in </v>

3310
02:31:45.631 --> 02:31:47.860
<v Speaker 3>a look at what this wants to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

3311
02:31:48.260 --> 02:31:49.093
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now we face a problem and that </v>

3312
02:31:52.501 --> 02:31:55.890
<v Speaker 3>we're not adequately educating poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in our country.</v>

3313
02:31:55.891 --> 02:31:57.870
<v Speaker 3>And the majority of those happened to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

3314
02:31:58.230 --> 02:32:02.790
<v Speaker 3>and this is an enormous problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is going to come back to haunt us.</v>

3315
02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:08.040
<v Speaker 3>But the solution to that problem is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity initiatives.</v>

3316
02:32:08.430 --> 02:32:11.310
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the other reason why that's bad.</v>

3317
02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:13.890
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a bandaid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worse.</v>

3318
02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.840
<v Speaker 3>It's because people then say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3319
02:32:15.841 --> 02:32:17.070
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this floss department,</v>

3320
02:32:17.071 --> 02:32:19.560
<v Speaker 3>this department has so many minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things must be going well,</v>

3321
02:32:19.620 --> 02:32:21.090
<v Speaker 3>actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going well.</v>

3322
02:32:21.150 --> 02:32:21.983
<v Speaker 3>It was an artificial solution that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>put in and the underlying structural </v>

3323
02:32:25.441 --> 02:32:28.230
<v Speaker 3>inequality and economic disparity hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>been addressed.</v>

3324
02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:29.093
<v Speaker 3>That's a great way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what about all the poor people that </v>

3325
02:32:32.011 --> 02:32:32.844
<v Speaker 3>live in West Virginia or Kentucky?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's families have been generations </v>

3326
02:32:35.551 --> 02:32:36.384
<v Speaker 3>and generations of coal miners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just because other white people </v>

3327
02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:43.980
<v Speaker 3>have made it into universities and made </v>
<v Speaker 3>an into certain institutions.</v>

3328
02:32:43.981 --> 02:32:48.030
<v Speaker 3>You're being racist if you think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people shouldn't get an equal shot</v>

3329
02:32:48.031 --> 02:32:50.610
<v Speaker 3>of things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the way we fix it is,</v>

3330
02:32:50.611 --> 02:32:51.990
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is John rawls idea,</v>

3331
02:32:52.020 --> 02:32:54.240
<v Speaker 3>public education in the first rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

3332
02:32:54.390 --> 02:32:57.210
<v Speaker 3>every time I would say that people would</v>
<v Speaker 3>say two things.</v>

3333
02:32:57.211 --> 02:32:58.044
<v Speaker 3>They'd play identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just what you're saying that </v>

3334
02:33:00.211 --> 02:33:01.680
<v Speaker 3>because you're white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gives them,</v>

3335
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:03.990
<v Speaker 3>that's their ticket to discredit what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying.</v>

3336
02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:06.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why people,</v>

3337
02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:09.990
<v Speaker 3>they use that as an excuse to not listen</v>
<v Speaker 3>to your arguments.</v>

3338
02:33:10.110 --> 02:33:11.730
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's perverted.</v>

3339
02:33:12.210 --> 02:33:12.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3340
02:33:12.960 --> 02:33:16.010
<v Speaker 3>it's really despicable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3341
02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:17.100
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

3342
02:33:17.170 --> 02:33:19.800
<v Speaker 3>so they use that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use that idea as an excuse.</v>

3343
02:33:20.070 --> 02:33:23.460
<v Speaker 3>So you've just said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other thing that it does,</v>

3344
02:33:24.330 --> 02:33:29.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you really start to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what kind of society do we want to</v>

3345
02:33:29.761 --> 02:33:30.511
<v Speaker 3>move to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3346
02:33:30.511 --> 02:33:33.300
<v Speaker 3>what are the limits of our institutions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

3347
02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:36.540
<v Speaker 3>what role should the meritocracy play?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should you disrupt that?</v>

3348
02:33:36.541 --> 02:33:39.120
<v Speaker 3>If there are racial inequalities or </v>
<v Speaker 3>imbalances,</v>

3349
02:33:39.570 --> 02:33:40.403
<v Speaker 3>these are questions we have to address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People had democracy have to address </v>

3350
02:33:44.671 --> 02:33:45.504
<v Speaker 3>this and you cannot have fear of talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this because someone's going to </v>

3351
02:33:48.991 --> 02:33:51.150
<v Speaker 3>call you a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't.</v>

3352
02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:53.400
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to put a proposal forward</v>
<v Speaker 3>that says,</v>

3353
02:33:53.401 --> 02:33:54.510
<v Speaker 3>or an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3354
02:33:54.511 --> 02:33:55.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3355
02:33:55.710 --> 02:33:58.500
<v Speaker 3>hiring should be this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to have that conversation.</v>

3356
02:33:58.650 --> 02:33:59.850
<v Speaker 3>But there's one other issue.</v>

3357
02:33:59.910 --> 02:34:00.743
<v Speaker 3>There's one of the tactic that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>regressive left use and that's the idea </v>

3358
02:34:03.871 --> 02:34:06.420
<v Speaker 3>of privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love that word privilege.</v>

3359
02:34:06.750 --> 02:34:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even see your privilege.</v>

3360
02:34:09.061 --> 02:34:12.540
<v Speaker 3>You don't privileges yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another thing that's used and look,</v>

3361
02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:16.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the impetus for that is good.</v>

3362
02:34:16.930 --> 02:34:21.520
<v Speaker 3>The danger here is that because these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are so nasty,</v>

3363
02:34:21.610 --> 02:34:22.443
<v Speaker 3>so mean spirited and so generally insane</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we discard everything that they're </v>

3364
02:34:26.891 --> 02:34:27.724
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We throw the baby out with the bath </v>

3365
02:34:28.761 --> 02:34:32.500
<v Speaker 3>water and now we need to be conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>and careful that we don't do that.</v>

3366
02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:36.820
<v Speaker 3>We need to acknowledge that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying some important things there.</v>

3367
02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:38.013
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racial treatment of people in the basis </v>

3368
02:34:40.601 --> 02:34:41.590
<v Speaker 3>of race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>

3369
02:34:41.591 --> 02:34:42.424
<v Speaker 3>sexual orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not discriminating against someone </v>

3370
02:34:44.171 --> 02:34:45.004
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel comfortable in a male </v>

3371
02:34:46.331 --> 02:34:47.164
<v Speaker 3>body or a female or Guy Mark Fisher I </v>
<v Speaker 3>roll with just is a gay and has his </v>

3372
02:34:51.090 --> 02:34:51.500
<v Speaker 3>gauges.</v>

3373
02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Just think these things are important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things matter.</v>

3374
02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:58.150
<v Speaker 3>These things are things that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about and if I have privilege,</v>

3375
02:34:58.300 --> 02:34:59.133
<v Speaker 3>I want to be conscious of that in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm treating someone in a way that's </v>

3376
02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:04.600
<v Speaker 3>unjust or if it's unkind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3377
02:35:04.690 --> 02:35:06.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know about that.</v>

3378
02:35:06.401 --> 02:35:08.530
<v Speaker 3>That's not the guy I want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3379
02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:12.280
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how do we talk about these things?</v>

3380
02:35:12.370 --> 02:35:14.890
<v Speaker 3>How do we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we engage these?</v>

3381
02:35:14.891 --> 02:35:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how you don't talk about them.</v>

3382
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:20.830
<v Speaker 3>You don't talk about them by constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>smearing people with privilege.</v>

3383
02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:23.130
<v Speaker 3>You saying you have privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

3384
02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:27.190
<v Speaker 3>or Portland state my university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had an event where students,</v>

3385
02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:29.170
<v Speaker 3>minority students were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

3386
02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:31.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could speak about all these things,</v>

3387
02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:33.610
<v Speaker 3>but students who were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the exact phrasing,</v>

3388
02:35:33.611 --> 02:35:35.920
<v Speaker 3>not of color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were invited to listen.</v>

3389
02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were invited to listen.</v>

3390
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:45.900
<v Speaker 3>They have institutionalized racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that is.</v>

3391
02:35:48.270 --> 02:35:51.720
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It certainly racism in that sense.</v>

3392
02:35:51.721 --> 02:35:52.554
<v Speaker 4>But isn't it an opportunity for people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have been marginalized to express </v>

3393
02:35:55.711 --> 02:35:56.544
<v Speaker 4>themselves in a platform that maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that have been </v>

3394
02:35:59.281 --> 02:36:00.810
<v Speaker 4>marginalized haven't had the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity?</v>

3395
02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:07.220
<v Speaker 4>Isn't there room for people of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific race to speak,</v>

3396
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:08.423
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about some issues that maybe they would </v>

3397
02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:14.070
<v Speaker 4>understand intimately that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't because we're white folks.</v>

3398
02:36:14.071 --> 02:36:16.020
<v Speaker 4>There's no question at all that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>

3399
02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:18.060
<v Speaker 4>And you know what I was at at bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

3400
02:36:18.061 --> 02:36:20.300
<v Speaker 4>to have someone have the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3401
02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:21.203
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's allow African Americans speak and </v>

3402
02:36:23.401 --> 02:36:25.950
<v Speaker 4>let's allow these white folks to listen </v>
<v Speaker 4>to what they have to say.</v>

3403
02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:27.053
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe you have another </v>
<v Speaker 4>conference or maybe a debate or maybe a </v>

3404
02:36:31.051 --> 02:36:34.650
<v Speaker 4>conversation where you allow someone to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a retort.</v>

3405
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:35.543
<v Speaker 4>So the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first problem with that is if you </v>

3406
02:36:37.411 --> 02:36:39.930
<v Speaker 4>frame it in terms of an opportunity than</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I say yes,</v>

3407
02:36:39.931 --> 02:36:40.764
<v Speaker 4>it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it should be like I'm denying </v>

3408
02:36:41.851 --> 02:36:42.684
<v Speaker 4>people the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that's the best way to frame </v>

3409
02:36:44.311 --> 02:36:45.144
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3410
02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:48.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that one price,</v>

3411
02:36:48.460 --> 02:36:50.710
<v Speaker 3>my buddy who's an appellate court judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said one,</v>

3412
02:36:50.830 --> 02:36:53.680
<v Speaker 3>he said he thinks it's unwise or his son</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually said this,</v>

3413
02:36:53.681 --> 02:36:54.640
<v Speaker 3>he didn't say this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His son is,</v>

3414
02:36:54.641 --> 02:36:55.181
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

3415
02:36:55.181 --> 02:36:55.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3416
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:59.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the clerks for some supreme court.</v>

3417
02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:02.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what he's put some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has his lawyer,</v>

3418
02:37:02.381 --> 02:37:03.330
<v Speaker 3>board certified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

3419
02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:04.810
<v Speaker 3>have a pass the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>

3420
02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:06.313
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the problem is that if you do </v>

3421
02:37:07.301 --> 02:37:09.880
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was amazed that that was legal.</v>

3422
02:37:09.940 --> 02:37:11.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't pretend to be a lawyer,</v>

3423
02:37:11.801 --> 02:37:12.634
<v Speaker 3>but he said it's actually legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that you then need to </v>

3424
02:37:14.681 --> 02:37:18.560
<v Speaker 3>hold than white people or whoever any </v>
<v Speaker 3>other group can hold and say,</v>

3425
02:37:18.561 --> 02:37:20.630
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blacks can't speak basically.</v>

3426
02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:22.820
<v Speaker 3>So we can get in and we can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how great it is.</v>

3427
02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:24.890
<v Speaker 3>Good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're right.</v>

3428
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:27.190
<v Speaker 3>So you're so it's not so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3429
02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:28.053
<v Speaker 3>you're creating an opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are genuine racists to </v>

3430
02:37:31.221 --> 02:37:33.800
<v Speaker 3>undermine the whole system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other thing is like,</v>

3431
02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:37.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important you can totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that and say,</v>

3432
02:37:37.491 --> 02:37:40.130
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have people for two hours</v>

3433
02:37:40.131 --> 02:37:41.870
<v Speaker 3>speak about their experiences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppression.</v>

3434
02:37:41.930 --> 02:37:44.480
<v Speaker 3>I think that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that they should do that.</v>

3435
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:45.463
<v Speaker 3>And I think we need to be more sensitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think we need to correct any </v>

3436
02:37:48.411 --> 02:37:51.920
<v Speaker 3>structural inequalities or remove biases</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have with people.</v>

3437
02:37:51.921 --> 02:37:53.300
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure I still have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3438
02:37:53.420 --> 02:37:55.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know of any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to remove them.</v>

3439
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have them.</v>

3440
02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:57.283
<v Speaker 3>But the idea is that shouldn't people of</v>
<v Speaker 3>any race then be allowed to ask people </v>

3441
02:38:01.341 --> 02:38:03.980
<v Speaker 3>questions about those experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't we then say,</v>

3442
02:38:03.981 --> 02:38:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've had this experiences of,</v>

3443
02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:07.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gang Jujitsu again,</v>

3444
02:38:07.071 --> 02:38:09.470
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or being black in the academy are being,</v>

3445
02:38:09.471 --> 02:38:11.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said this,</v>

3446
02:38:11.331 --> 02:38:13.070
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to explain that to me.</v>

3447
02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:13.933
<v Speaker 3>Explain that to all know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you shutting down possibilities for </v>

3448
02:38:16.911 --> 02:38:21.500
<v Speaker 3>people who don't understand those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way we understand things.</v>

3449
02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:24.350
<v Speaker 3>We come to understand through asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions like,</v>

3450
02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:24.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3451
02:38:24.801 --> 02:38:27.200
<v Speaker 3>well why do you do the rear naked choke </v>
<v Speaker 3>list?</v>

3452
02:38:27.201 --> 02:38:27.681
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3453
02:38:27.681 --> 02:38:28.514
<v Speaker 3>because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy will pull your arm off so you </v>

3454
02:38:29.691 --> 02:38:31.160
<v Speaker 3>put in the back of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

3455
02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:35.700
<v Speaker 3>we need environments that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3456
02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:40.580
<v Speaker 3>encourage genuine inquirers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions and that here's the problem so</v>

3457
02:38:40.590 --> 02:38:42.020
<v Speaker 3>that someone could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3458
02:38:42.021 --> 02:38:42.854
<v Speaker 3>what if someone goes in there and starts</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouting racial epitaphs or horrible </v>

3459
02:38:45.561 --> 02:38:46.250
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3460
02:38:46.250 --> 02:38:47.570
<v Speaker 3>well there are a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3461
02:38:47.571 --> 02:38:49.250
<v Speaker 3>they're horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're a file person.</v>

3462
02:38:49.310 --> 02:38:50.143
<v Speaker 3>But that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what should be clear to </v>

3463
02:38:51.141 --> 02:38:51.974
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only way that's going to be </v>

3464
02:38:52.881 --> 02:38:55.580
<v Speaker 3>clear to everybody is if you allow open </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

3465
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:56.623
<v Speaker 3>open speech and allow people to express </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and you accumulate all that </v>

3466
02:38:59.241 --> 02:39:02.420
<v Speaker 3>data and you get an understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is okay and what's not okay,</v>

3467
02:39:02.421 --> 02:39:03.890
<v Speaker 3>what's hurtful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's not hurtful.</v>

3468
02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:07.820
<v Speaker 3>And if you're constantly in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment where you don't even,</v>

3469
02:39:07.850 --> 02:39:09.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monkey hear no evil,</v>

3470
02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:10.573
<v Speaker 3>you can't even hear a bad idea when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone does something legitimately </v>

3471
02:39:14.540 --> 02:39:17.000
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would the reaction be?</v>

3472
02:39:17.090 --> 02:39:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Your threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll constantly be decreasing.</v>

3473
02:39:20.721 --> 02:39:21.554
<v Speaker 3>If you're not hearing ideas right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not hearing ideas that run </v>

3474
02:39:24.381 --> 02:39:28.460
<v Speaker 3>contrary or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenging than your threshold for what</v>

3475
02:39:28.461 --> 02:39:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you find offensive will constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower.</v>

3476
02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:33.890
<v Speaker 3>So then anything will offend you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Thaddeus Russell on,</v>

3477
02:39:34.010 --> 02:39:34.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a great guy and he teaches at a </v>

3478
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:39.440
<v Speaker 3>occidental and we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3479
02:39:39.441 --> 02:39:42.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue where there was a,</v>

3480
02:39:42.141 --> 02:39:46.160
<v Speaker 3>a young man and a young woman who got </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and they got drunk and they had</v>

3481
02:39:46.161 --> 02:39:48.590
<v Speaker 3>some consent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The girl decided that,</v>

3482
02:39:49.090 --> 02:39:50.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either she decided,</v>

3483
02:39:50.751 --> 02:39:51.584
<v Speaker 3>her friends convinced her into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she had been raped even though she </v>

3484
02:39:53.871 --> 02:39:56.300
<v Speaker 3>had sent him a bunch of text messages </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

3485
02:39:56.301 --> 02:39:57.890
<v Speaker 3>are you coming over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bring condoms,</v>

3486
02:39:58.130 --> 02:40:00.170
<v Speaker 3>told their friends I'm getting laid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lol.</v>

3487
02:40:00.470 --> 02:40:02.450
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had gotten to her,</v>

3488
02:40:02.451 --> 02:40:05.300
<v Speaker 3>they were both intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because he's a man,</v>

3489
02:40:05.690 --> 02:40:09.260
<v Speaker 3>he was kicked off the campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was kicked out of school.</v>

3490
02:40:09.261 --> 02:40:11.240
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're suing is a big lawsuit.</v>

3491
02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:13.560
<v Speaker 3>She stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they both sex.</v>

3492
02:40:13.561 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 3>There was no</v>

3493
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:15.570
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>

3494
02:40:15.850 --> 02:40:18.150
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no lies.</v>

3495
02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:21.060
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one held anyone down.</v>

3496
02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:23.370
<v Speaker 2>No one did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did anything against anyone's will.</v>

3497
02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:24.293
<v Speaker 2>But they had decided that he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed sexual assault because they </v>

3498
02:40:27.061 --> 02:40:29.220
<v Speaker 2>were both drunk and they could not </v>
<v Speaker 2>consent,</v>

3499
02:40:29.790 --> 02:40:32.670
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>End Rady.</v>

3500
02:40:32.671 --> 02:40:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexist.</v>

3501
02:40:34.051 --> 02:40:34.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

3502
02:40:34.771 --> 02:40:36.840
<v Speaker 2>It's sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sexist towards men.</v>

3503
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:38.420
<v Speaker 2>And if that's just in the pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

3504
02:40:38.490 --> 02:40:39.630
<v Speaker 2>it disempowers women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3505
02:40:39.631 --> 02:40:40.381
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>

3506
02:40:40.381 --> 02:40:41.214
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous because how come you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for your own actions and </v>

3507
02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:46.350
<v Speaker 2>every other realm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you drive a car and you're drunk,</v>

3508
02:40:46.351 --> 02:40:47.184
<v Speaker 2>you can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3509
02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:48.061
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was drunk.</v>

3510
02:40:48.061 --> 02:40:51.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not responsible for plowing into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking school bus full of kids.</v>

3511
02:40:51.570 --> 02:40:53.250
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you say,</v>

3512
02:40:53.251 --> 02:40:54.084
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was drunk.</v>

3513
02:40:54.090 --> 02:40:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not responsible for my consent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have sex with this man.</v>

3514
02:40:57.960 --> 02:40:58.830
<v Speaker 2>That was preposterous.</v>

3515
02:40:58.830 --> 02:41:01.530
<v Speaker 2>We all know that alcohol limits your </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibitions.</v>

3516
02:41:01.531 --> 02:41:04.200
<v Speaker 2>It lowers your inhibitions and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do things you might regret.</v>

3517
02:41:04.380 --> 02:41:05.213
<v Speaker 2>But there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big thing amongst people </v>

3518
02:41:07.490 --> 02:41:10.320
<v Speaker 2>online that are trying to say this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pass it on.</v>

3519
02:41:10.770 --> 02:41:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Regret does not equal rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People make mistakes.</v>

3520
02:41:14.100 --> 02:41:15.900
<v Speaker 2>We've all made mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's made was,</v>

3521
02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:17.910
<v Speaker 2>and if you drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to make more mistakes.</v>

3522
02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:18.773
<v Speaker 2>That's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that the person </v>

3523
02:41:20.011 --> 02:41:22.080
<v Speaker 2>you made a mistake with is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapist.</v>

3524
02:41:22.081 --> 02:41:22.914
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've also made a mistake and maybe </v>

3525
02:41:24.331 --> 02:41:25.380
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

3526
02:41:25.410 --> 02:41:26.243
<v Speaker 2>maybe you guys just had sex and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're around a bunch of fucking nutty </v>

3527
02:41:28.981 --> 02:41:29.814
<v Speaker 2>people who are trying to convince you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anytime you have sex and you're </v>

3528
02:41:31.741 --> 02:41:32.574
<v Speaker 2>drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been raped and there is a lot of </v>

3529
02:41:34.201 --> 02:41:35.034
<v Speaker 2>that too loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was going to say that's a cultural </v>

3530
02:41:36.331 --> 02:41:37.164
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

3579
02:43:31.991 --> 02:43:32.824
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to like process that I didn't say </v>

<v Speaker 3>I can pull the same regressive card that</v>

<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people have been choosing their own </v>

3590
02:43:55.841 --> 02:43:56.674
<v Speaker 3>pronouns.</v>

<v Speaker 3>broke loose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the mistake?</v>

3602
02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:31.990

<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3603
02:44:31.991 --> 02:44:32.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3604
02:44:32.461 --> 02:44:33.310
<v Speaker 3>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3606
02:44:34.311 --> 02:44:36.160

<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3607
02:44:36.220 --> 02:44:37.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now</v>

<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy.</v>

3609
02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:49.130
<v Speaker 4>It's not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that possible?</v>

3610
02:44:49.430 --> 02:44:50.263
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching a video listening to a </v>

3611
02:44:51.471 --> 02:44:55.010
<v Speaker 4>radio lab podcast and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>interviewing this guy who got a guy.</v>

3612
02:44:55.011 --> 02:44:56.810
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it's a girl,</v>

3613
02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:00.650
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it goes back and forth and his</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender is fluid and in the middle of the</v>

3614
02:45:00.651 --> 02:45:03.080
<v Speaker 4>conversations like I just switched.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a guy now.</v>

3615
02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:05.140
<v Speaker 4>I just switched.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just felt it.</v>

3616
02:45:05.141 --> 02:45:05.974
<v Speaker 4>It was immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm listening to this and I'm </v>

3617
02:45:08.091 --> 02:45:08.571
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3618
02:45:08.571 --> 02:45:13.571
<v Speaker 4>this is a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clearly this is obviously a nutty person</v>

3619
02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:19.000
<v Speaker 4>that has a very loose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slippery mineral oil grip on reality.</v>

3620
02:45:20.421 --> 02:45:21.254
<v Speaker 4>It's like what just flies were out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their fingers and they want you to give </v>

3621
02:45:25.281 --> 02:45:29.810
<v Speaker 4>in to this slippery reality and focus on</v>
<v Speaker 4>them constantly.</v>

3622
02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:30.793
<v Speaker 4>Now he now mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's another way to divert attention </v>

3623
02:45:33.561 --> 02:45:34.394
<v Speaker 4>from anything that's going on and focus </v>
<v Speaker 4>it on them and something completely </v>

3624
02:45:37.581 --> 02:45:38.720
<v Speaker 4>trivial like that.</v>

3625
02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:41.260
<v Speaker 4>They decide there are female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they decided they're a male.</v>

3626
02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:43.490
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3627
02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:46.370
<v Speaker 4>And I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even care if,</v>

3628
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:50.630
<v Speaker 4>if it's pointless piece feel different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Different Times of the day.</v>

3629
02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:52.700
<v Speaker 4>If you feel different sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

3630
02:45:52.701 --> 02:45:53.534
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're pansexual or it's just you're </v>

3631
02:45:55.851 --> 02:45:56.684
<v Speaker 4>just thinking too much and projecting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're projecting that off on other </v>

3632
02:46:00.381 --> 02:46:01.214
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you really think that you become </v>

3633
02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:03.943
<v Speaker 4>transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we assist gender and all like it </v>

3634
02:46:06.501 --> 02:46:08.840
<v Speaker 4>switches back and forth all throughout </v>
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>

3635
02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:11.420
<v Speaker 4>You're probably fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it?</v>

3636
02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:12.313
<v Speaker 4>Was it you who tweeted the link about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who is a six year old girl or </v>

<v Speaker 4>Don't judge.</v>

3645
02:46:34.110 --> 02:46:36.080
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so instead of,</v>

3646
02:46:36.081 --> 02:46:36.914
<v Speaker 4>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so have a hat with apple's hanging from </v>

3647
02:46:38.331 --> 02:46:39.164
<v Speaker 4>it that don't disrespect this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that's part of the problem </v>

3648
02:46:44.451 --> 02:46:46.950
<v Speaker 4>with not being able to Morley triage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3649
02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:47.833
<v Speaker 4>It's part of the problem with not being </v>
<v Speaker 4>triage is a great way to describe it </v>

3650
02:46:51.261 --> 02:46:52.820
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a great way to his crime.</v>

3651
02:46:53.130 --> 02:46:54.140
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so instead of saying,</v>

3652
02:46:54.141 --> 02:46:54.651
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

<v Speaker 4>whatever's going on in his,</v>

<v Speaker 4>great run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3657
02:47:00.740 --> 02:47:03.200
<v Speaker 4>it's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not worth my time.</v>

3658
02:47:03.220 --> 02:47:05.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If a guy wants to be trivial world girl,</v>

3659
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:06.583
<v Speaker 4>you go forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we have a problem with mister </v>

<v Speaker 4>whole life.</v>

3668
02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:29.960
<v Speaker 4>In the Diane Sawyer interview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said he and he said,</v>

3669
02:47:29.961 --> 02:47:32.360

<v Speaker 4>I'm sticking with that.</v>

3670
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:36.020
<v Speaker 4>You can't keep making new noises that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to make with my face.</v>

3671
02:47:36.021 --> 02:47:36.854
<v Speaker 4>They make you feel better about yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if that's all it takes for you </v>

3672
02:47:38.691 --> 02:47:41.240
<v Speaker 4>to feel better about yourself is people </v>
<v Speaker 4>call you a new noise.</v>

3673
02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:43.550
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I decide tomorrow,</v>

<v Speaker 4>But you just laughed.</v>

3676
02:47:48.231 --> 02:47:50.400
<v Speaker 4>That's a micro aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a microaggression.</v>

3677
02:47:50.930 --> 02:47:52.010
<v Speaker 4>Why wide?</v>

<v Speaker 4>don't know which Joe after look.</v>

<v Speaker 4>don't know what Joe you're referring to.</v>

3688
02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:22.070
<v Speaker 4>This is a noise that you make that </v>
<v Speaker 4>represents you.</v>

3689
02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a shit?</v>

<v Speaker 4>There was some noises that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>ambiguous,</v>

3692
02:48:27.550 --> 02:48:28.101
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3693
02:48:28.101 --> 02:48:29.690
<v Speaker 4>like it's Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember that?</v>

3694
02:48:30.050 --> 02:48:30.883
<v Speaker 4>I'm not fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We couldn't figure out what gender she </v>

3695
02:48:32.121 --> 02:48:34.100
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's women named shelly,</v>

3696
02:48:34.220 --> 02:48:35.870
<v Speaker 4>there's men named shelly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

3697
02:48:35.871 --> 02:48:36.590
<v Speaker 4>what are we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris.</v>

3698
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:37.423
<v Speaker 4>Christine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's genes that are girls and genes </v>

3699
02:48:39.321 --> 02:48:39.780
<v Speaker 4>that are guides.</v>

3700
02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:41.750
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so confusing.</v>

3701
02:48:41.751 --> 02:48:45.110
<v Speaker 4>So you see how crazy that is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is confusing.</v>

3702
02:48:45.230 --> 02:48:46.063
<v Speaker 4>But here's what makes it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What makes it worse is that if you make </v>

3703
02:48:49.401 --> 02:48:50.690
<v Speaker 4>a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3704
02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:51.673
<v Speaker 4>there's a rule to punish you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like right now you have your operating </v>

3705
02:48:55.161 --> 02:48:56.360
<v Speaker 4>freely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have no rules.</v>

3706
02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:00.890
<v Speaker 4>People in people out that their pr,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're paranoid.</v>

3707
02:49:01.010 --> 02:49:05.840
<v Speaker 4>They're paranoid about making a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So of course,</v>

3708
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:07.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3709
02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:11.130
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have a bunch of people that are</v>

3710
02:49:11.131 --> 02:49:15.720
<v Speaker 4>hypersensitive and that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>enforce these ridiculous ideas on people</v>

3711
02:49:15.930 --> 02:49:17.580
<v Speaker 4>and they're trying to pound these things</v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

3712
02:49:17.730 --> 02:49:21.930
<v Speaker 4>they're looking for these moments with </v>
<v Speaker 4>aiken solidify.</v>

3713
02:49:21.931 --> 02:49:24.780
<v Speaker 4>This is the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they could point at you these moments</v>

3714
02:49:24.781 --> 02:49:25.614
<v Speaker 4>where I call them green lights are </v>
<v Speaker 4>called them green lights because they </v>

3715
02:49:28.801 --> 02:49:30.870
<v Speaker 4>might not be upset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might not really be upset,</v>

3716
02:49:30.871 --> 02:49:32.610
<v Speaker 4>but they have a green light to act </v>
<v Speaker 4>upset.</v>

3717
02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:35.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's their battery.</v>

3718
02:49:35.131 --> 02:49:36.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole buffalo battery,</v>

3719
02:49:36.541 --> 02:49:37.374
<v Speaker 4>that's where I found one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they have community support because </v>

3720
02:49:41.131 --> 02:49:43.890
<v Speaker 4>now the victim is the highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3721
02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:46.530
<v Speaker 4>And they're all social retards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other part of the problem,</v>

3722
02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:49.320
<v Speaker 4>and I say retards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll like,</v>

3723
02:49:49.321 --> 02:49:50.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's politically incorrect.</v>

3724
02:49:50.761 --> 02:49:51.594
<v Speaker 4>Word retarded means slowed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the that is socially retarded to </v>

3725
02:49:56.461 --> 02:49:57.960
<v Speaker 4>like operate this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3726
02:49:57.961 --> 02:49:59.640
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's slows everything down.</v>

3727
02:49:59.641 --> 02:50:00.630
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's awkward.</v>

3728
02:50:00.631 --> 02:50:03.210
<v Speaker 4>It's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessary.</v>

3729
02:50:03.390 --> 02:50:06.300
<v Speaker 4>What's necessary is friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kindness,</v>

3730
02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:08.400
<v Speaker 4>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>open mindedness.</v>

3731
02:50:08.580 --> 02:50:11.670
<v Speaker 4>And those things don't exist when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were pointing fingers at people.</v>

3732
02:50:11.700 --> 02:50:14.460
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And shaming them over innocuous things.</v>

3733
02:50:14.461 --> 02:50:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

3737
02:50:20.431 --> 02:50:23.850

<v Speaker 4>their own interest.</v>

3738
02:50:24.210 --> 02:50:26.760
<v Speaker 4>That creates adversary relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause then you're like,</v>
