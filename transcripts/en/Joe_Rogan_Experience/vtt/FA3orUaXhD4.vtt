00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I just had the worst massage thing.</v>

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm done now.</v>

5
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I was in Santa Monica and it was like,</v>

6
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think carefully if you want to say this on the area.</v>

7
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.833
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

9
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>But I was actually thinking like I'll just get a legitimate savage.</v>

10
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>This place was open really late though and it,</v>

11
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>but it looked really nice outside or you know,</v>

12
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:18.971
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

13
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.041
<v Speaker 1>are you open?</v>

15
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think they might've just sent the last girl home because I saw this pretty</v>

16
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>decent looking girl.</v>

17
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Walk out the side door.</v>

18
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>And then Tom,</v>

19
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>is it 9:30?</v>

20
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Really for the most part,</v>

21
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:34.430
<v Speaker 1>no legit massages happening after 9:30.</v>

22
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Why would say it's like most of the massage places closed down around nine.</v>

23
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.510
<v Speaker 1>But this was the right down the street from Bolus.</v>

25
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.771
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

26
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

27
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 1>can't be too crazy all.</v>

28
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

29
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I go in and this really old fat Asian lady was there and I was like,</v>

31
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:48.571
<v Speaker 1>are you open?</v>

32
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

33
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

34
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

35
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

36
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>So I go in the room and I now just always take all my clothes off.</v>

37
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't even keep boxers on all the time now just in case if,</v>

38
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.533
<v Speaker 1>the girls is really high.</v>

40
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>That's cool,</v>

41
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>but I just wanted to real massage and then she walks in wearing like a dress,</v>

43
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>no underwear,</v>

44
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>nice and like cut really short and just fat and old,</v>

45
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

46
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>like a grandma old lady and she was dressed up like totally changed clothes.</v>

47
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I heard somebody go to the bathroom so that means she went into the bathroom,</v>

48
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>washed herself,</v>

49
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:22.450
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that because she smelled like this perfume and then she shot,</v>

51
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>she gets on top of me,</v>

52
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.051
<v Speaker 1>removes the towel,</v>

53
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>gets on top of me and just kept on bouncing like I hurt a vagina was like all my</v>

54
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>butthole,</v>

55
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>like it was just on.</v>

56
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

57
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>me just bouncing and it's like not really massage or anything,</v>

58
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>shaved it.</v>

59
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

60
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I think I was freaked out and so I was just like,</v>

61
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.341
<v Speaker 1>play dead,</v>

62

<v Speaker 1>play dead,</v>

63
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:42.161

<v Speaker 1>Like don't even like don't make a noise.</v>

65
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.020

66
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.410

68
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>So suddenly she starts rubbing her hands on my back and her shit calluses or</v>

69

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>And then like she flips me over eventually and stuff like that.</v>

76
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>At any point where you're like,</v>

77
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just leave.</v>

96
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I've done that yet it ended really bad and then when she flipped me over she</v>

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

148
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.791
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

149
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

150
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>That's legit.</v>

151
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.663
<v Speaker 1>Legit massage.</v>

152
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>So this is a place I've been going to for 10 years.</v>

153
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.201
<v Speaker 1>Not that much,</v>

154
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

155
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>every time I know that I just want a regular massage,</v>

156
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I know that some chick that looks like my mom or my aunt is going to give me a</v>

157
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>great massage and then I'm done.</v>

158
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

159
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>

160
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>But I haven't been back for a few.</v>

161
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I moved to New York,</v>

162
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:15.934
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

163
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>And my way of dealing with that whole thing with me puking before going on shows</v>

164
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>is I started getting massages and I like hard ones.</v>

165
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

166
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a hard deep tissue,</v>

167
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:27.130

168
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go back to that place,</v>

209
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>It was always like a $40 massage place,</v>

210
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>like a cheap Korean massage and then it was $75 now or something like that.</v>

211
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.811
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Could they be doing different?</v>

219
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's an intense tax.</v>

220
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.901
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

221
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's scented candles that they have to pay.</v>

222
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>She flips me over and,</v>

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 1>like she just does a couple of ball flicks,</v>
