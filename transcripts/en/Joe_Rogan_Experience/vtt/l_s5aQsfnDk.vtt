00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.121
<v Speaker 1>The Marxists,</v>

2
00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:06.760
<v Speaker 1>we're happy that religion had collapsed because they thought that that would</v>

3
00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>eliminate an entire strata of oppression.</v>

4
00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:11.500
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that it's not like the Catholic church,</v>

5
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:12.101
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

6
00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>was free of corruption.</v>

7
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:17.950
<v Speaker 1>it was in many ways it corrupt enterprise and you could read it as solely a</v>

9
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:18.940
<v Speaker 1>corrupt enterprise.</v>

10
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:19.360
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

11
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.961
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it,</v>

12
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>it's good that it's gone.</v>

13
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.971
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

14
00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:22.804
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>the Friday and it's basically thought the same way.</v>

17
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:28.370
<v Speaker 1>And so did most intellectuals,</v>

18
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought that religion was nothing than,</v>

19
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>than a childish delusion that people</v>

21
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>identified with because they were afraid of dying.</v>

22
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

23
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:41.180
<v Speaker 1>it was a defense against death,</v>

25
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

26
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.261
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

27
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>the Marxist argument and the,</v>

28
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>and the Friday and argument,</v>

29
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>those are bloody powerful arguments,</v>

30
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>cause you can see it.</v>

32
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.051
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>

33
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>People use the religious belief as a defense against things.</v>

34
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>They're too terrified to confront.</v>

35
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

37
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>there's the Churchill press,</v>

39
00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:56.691
<v Speaker 1>people did it.</v>

40
00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:56.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

41
00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:57.441
<v Speaker 1>press people,</v>

42
00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:57.771
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>

43
00:00:57.771 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Engage in,</v>

44
00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.940
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies with people in power across centuries.</v>

46
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

47
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

48
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

50
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of that?</v>

52
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

53
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 1>partly you make of it that all sorts of structures do that.</v>

54
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like structures do that and you know,</v>

55
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>you can't just damn one structure and thanked the others are going to,</v>

56
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:18.020
<v Speaker 1>it's like the right wingers,</v>

58
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>they're always owned about big government,</v>

59
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>how terrible that isn't.</v>

60
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Left wingers are always on about how big corporations are terrible.</v>

61
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

62
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Bang is terrible.</v>

64
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it's government or corporations because things tend to tilt</v>

65
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:34.580
<v Speaker 1>towards corruption across time and then that has to be taken into account.</v>

66
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

67
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 1>so the Friday ends and the intellectuals and the Marxists,</v>

68
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>we're all pretty happy when the religious dream started to come apart and they</v>

69
00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>believe that the new edifice is that they were going to construct fascist and</v>

70
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>communist would be so much better than what they replaced that,</v>

71
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>everybody would be drowning in utopia and uh,</v>

73
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of too bad that isn't how it turned out,</v>

74
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly not how it turned out.</v>

75
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>How it turned out was,</v>

76
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.943
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

77
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you tear something down,</v>

78
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 1>even if you think it's terrible,</v>

79
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>you end up constructing something on its ruins that makes the previous terrible</v>

80
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>look like the work of rank amateurs.</v>

81
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's certainly what happened in the 20th century.</v>

82
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you say about the Catholic Church and its basic barbarism,</v>

84
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>especially when you know they were involved in the witch hunt in the middle</v>

85
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.721
<v Speaker 1>ages,</v>

86
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like those guys,</v>

87
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 1>they were amateurs compared to the fascists and the communists.</v>

88
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>they were counting their victims in the tens of thousands,</v>

90
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.860
<v Speaker 1>not the hundreds of millions.</v>
