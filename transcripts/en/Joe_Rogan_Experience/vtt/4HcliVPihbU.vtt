00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spitting down stuff.</v>

129
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.880

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

130
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.850
<v Speaker 3>he's a master at using a fake turntable.</v>

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

132
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:17.261
<v Speaker 3>And make them look like turntables to </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of just pushing a lever or </v>

133
00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:17.261
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

134
00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:21.981
<v Speaker 3>they're crafty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These fucks with their ipad technology </v>

135
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:25.530
<v Speaker 3>with the things they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had that Neil degrasse Tyson guy on </v>

136
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.481
<v Speaker 3>the podcast yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been seen videos on him for a long </v>

137
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:29.481
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of fun,</v>

138
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:29.970
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>

139
00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:31.020
<v Speaker 3>really interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

140
00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:33.870
<v Speaker 3>What an inspirational dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Cute.</v>

141
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Great response for the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except for me talking about the moon </v>

142
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 3>landing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost universally hated.</v>

143
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Hated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

144
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I want to just say that it was not my </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea to talk about that.</v>

145
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.370
<v Speaker 3>That's something that he wanted to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about in advance.</v>

146
00:06:47.371 --> 00:06:49.680
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of alluded to the fact that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to bring that up.</v>

147
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my laptop.</v>

148
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.500
<v Speaker 3>The she got mad at Ralph and maybe once </v>
<v Speaker 3>because were all sitting around like </v>

149
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.800
<v Speaker 3>late night in Vegas or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Ralphie goes,</v>

150
00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:00.660
<v Speaker 3>so tell me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about the moon landing</v>

151
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:01.780
<v Speaker 3>and the edge of this motherfucker?</v>

152
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.930
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to start it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serious thing.</v>

153
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>We went into the psychology of a looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a hidden things and how fascinating </v>

154
00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:19.620
<v Speaker 1>they are too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about the,</v>

155
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>the idea of that if there's a planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>there somewhere outside of Pluto that </v>

156
00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:27.120
<v Speaker 1>they believe might exist to successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

157
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>what was he as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a thing called the Kuiper belt </v>

158
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.330
<v Speaker 1>is a massive amount of asteroids that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are out there,</v>

159
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.200
<v Speaker 1>but they think it's very possible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a large planet that's out there,</v>

160
00:07:37.201 --> 00:07:42.201
<v Speaker 1>but it's so far away it has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of light from the sun and we </v>

161
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:45.201
<v Speaker 1>can't even see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're sort of guessing by some of </v>

162
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:45.600
<v Speaker 1>the things that have gone on in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>area as far as like a.</v>

163
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

164
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and so we were talking about that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just commenting on how weird it is </v>

165
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.961
<v Speaker 1>that we have this desire to find shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not there when the shit that we </v>

166
00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:01.110
<v Speaker 1>know is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really haven't looked into it all.</v>

167
00:08:01.111 --> 00:08:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Like I've really not looked into Jupiter</v>
<v Speaker 1>that much.</v>

168
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I kind of know that it's a gas </v>

169
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got The spot on it.</v>

170
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

171
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I know that a shoemaker levy hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this comment and blew up and I know that</v>

172
00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:15.660
<v Speaker 1>recently they found another common </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact.</v>

173
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I know like little things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like as far as like,</v>

174
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.190
<v Speaker 3>like the real</v>

175
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 1>know as far as like it's a fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and all the information is readily</v>

176
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:30.340
<v Speaker 1>available and right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead I'm like,</v>

177
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.960
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be hidden.</v>

178
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Planted out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The planets that are here,</v>

179
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even.</v>

180
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm so bored with the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon didn't exist.</v>

181
00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Then one day above you is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mooney.</v>

182
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:50.401
<v Speaker 1>Be shitting your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be freaking out that the planet </v>

183
00:08:50.401 --> 00:08:51.070
<v Speaker 1>was that close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would be going nuts.</v>

184
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>You just wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would just be sitting down and </v>

185
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>parks just looking up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staring that moon.</v>

186
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.070
<v Speaker 1>If it was a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like you'd have four parks filled</v>

187
00:09:00.071 --> 00:09:02.290
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would come and cities and gather up</v>

188
00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.150
<v Speaker 1>and they would try to make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>

189
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some new thing is invaded their </v>

190
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.280
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's floating above their planet.</v>

191
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.020
<v Speaker 1>That would freak people out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead like,</v>

192
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:17.021
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the moon because it's always been </v>

193
00:09:17.021 --> 00:09:17.021
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

194
00:09:17.021 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>It's always been there and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you look up and you see like </v>

195
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Saturn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem like virgin was offering one </v>

196
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.080
<v Speaker 1>for 10 grand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even a crazy amount,</v>

197
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.090
<v Speaker 1>like 10 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you go for it?</v>

198
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I would have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be a few years in.</v>

199
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I would have to see it first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

200
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Because you know someone's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it back.</v>

201
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I got a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like we know it's a matter </v>

202
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 1>of time with air flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's some,</v>

203
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.660
<v Speaker 1>some plane somewhere is going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

204
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Just like some car somewhere is gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>crash.</v>

205
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.870
<v Speaker 1>So are you willing to die in space?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question.</v>

206
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Are you willing to die in space?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be bad at diamond space.</v>

207
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Forget A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>because at least they sort of find your </v>

208
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:03.370
<v Speaker 1>body like maybe generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna.</v>

209
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.090
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be a long time because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing they have to do before they </v>

210
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.021
<v Speaker 1>do anything is the day after they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do commercial space flight </v>

211
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:10.021
<v Speaker 1>where it's just the orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>

212
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.560
<v Speaker 1>so they'll probably do that for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

213
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I have stations where people can go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen what the things look like?</v>

214
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>They like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a plain sort of divergence</v>

215
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.240
<v Speaker 1>ship to use to go into space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone just has a seat.</v>

216
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have seats.</v>

217
00:10:23.741 --> 00:10:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many seats there are on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

218
00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:30.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's more complicated than a </v>

219
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:33.001
<v Speaker 1>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it essentially looks like some sort </v>

220
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.450
<v Speaker 1>of a double a hold plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks weird.</v>

221
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.910
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it would look like a spaceship</v>

222
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.040
<v Speaker 1>and you can dock with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With the people up there.</v>

223
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the plan for the future.</v>

224
00:10:43.091 --> 00:10:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do initially.</v>

225
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's probably a bunch of </v>

226
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.641
<v Speaker 1>options on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take him out there and then bring </v>

227
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:53.641
<v Speaker 1>them back.</v>

228
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:53.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a space you got to think.</v>

229
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 1>How long can people deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

230
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>If you're up there with some dude who </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't taken us pack salt and fucking </v>

231
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.070
<v Speaker 1>blows a gasket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to make a person proof.</v>

232
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta make it person proof.</v>

233
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.780
<v Speaker 1>This would be a lot of good going mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing the whole Earth Day.</v>

234
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

235
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's clothing.</v>

236
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:09.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

237
00:11:09.431 --> 00:11:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I've wasted my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

238
00:11:10.451 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 1>when you were in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

239
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.850
<v Speaker 1>when you're on a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those fighter jets,</v>

240
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 1>they have like a thing under your seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deca pull out and inject yourself and </v>

241
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.441
<v Speaker 1>you go flying through the air on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking parachute and you can't have </v>

242
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:29.530
<v Speaker 1>those space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that shit.</v>

243
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.560
<v Speaker 1>You got to make sure that this asshole </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

244
00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:34.810
<v Speaker 1>if this thing's going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any say in it.</v>

245
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.510
<v Speaker 1>You have no control over the buttons.</v>

246
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.750
<v Speaker 4>It is kind of weird that like regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>flights don't have at least parachutes,</v>

247
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd think that they would.</v>

248
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.690
<v Speaker 4>She's underneath each seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just don't kind of.</v>

249
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>And we've got about 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get everybody out here.</v>

250
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand how fast you're growing.</v>

251
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean like a last resort,</v>

252
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather have that than a seat cushion</v>

253
00:11:55.821 --> 00:11:59.000
<v Speaker 4>I could use as a flotation device.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather have a parachute as if like,</v>

254
00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:00.230
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this shit's going down.</v>

255
00:12:00.231 --> 00:12:02.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to use this thing,</v>

256
00:12:02.151 --> 00:12:02.990
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just going to try it.</v>

257
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.150
<v Speaker 1>That would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would make sense,</v>

258
00:12:05.151 --> 00:12:08.840
<v Speaker 1>but you would have to be willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another open up a window or a</v>

259
00:12:08.841 --> 00:12:12.470
<v Speaker 1>door while that fuckers in the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>stewardess would have to do it for us.</v>

260
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you understand what </v>

261
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.871
<v Speaker 1>happens to your body when you're flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>500 miles an hour and you jump out into </v>

262
00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:22.520
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

263
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.030
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got down with a trooper.</v>

264
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.520
<v Speaker 1>He said you got knocked out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

265
00:12:25.521 --> 00:12:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get knocked unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be able to breathe.</v>

266
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.430
<v Speaker 1>You're going 500 miles an hour with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>face and you're still going 500 miles an</v>

267
00:12:32.431 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 1>hour when you jump out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

268
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>You really have to wrap your head around</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you're being protected by </v>

269
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.740
<v Speaker 1>this tube to the point where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unaware of the velocity.</v>

270
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.280
<v Speaker 1>You're flying through the fucking air </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you just get shot through it and </v>

271
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 1>just let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

272
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:46.820
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hit a bird,</v>

273
00:12:46.821 --> 00:12:48.120
<v Speaker 1>you can explode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

274
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

275
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.720
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't get one for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

276
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.090
<v Speaker 4>the other option is pavement inside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

277
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.210
<v Speaker 4>Target that you're playing.</v>

278
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.240
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way you know you're done.</v>

279
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.060
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't want to fucking sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of survive.</v>

280
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.360
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everyone was leaving the plane with </v>

281
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:05.360
<v Speaker 1>your flotation device,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you forget yours and it's like,</v>

282
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.050
<v Speaker 1>but you're only like an aisle or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of where you started.</v>

283
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to go back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's any chance people </v>

284
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.181
<v Speaker 1>will let you back there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if he'd scream I needed a </v>

285
00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:14.181
<v Speaker 1>flotation device,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's so such a.</v>

286
00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:17.790
<v Speaker 1>We needed a name for that stupid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facilitation of US flotation device,</v>

287
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.590
<v Speaker 1>if she can be used as a flotation </v>
<v Speaker 1>device,</v>

288
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.000
<v Speaker 1>should be a buoy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hell have a fucking name,</v>

289
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.580
<v Speaker 1>but we think that there's something with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin.</v>

290
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something should ever fucking name.</v>

291
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Where's my flotation device?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A flotation gives me more life.</v>

292
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Live on the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the picture of Neil Degrasse </v>

293
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Tyson discusses simulation theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suspiciously Asian looking person </v>

294
00:13:43.471 --> 00:13:46.240
<v Speaker 1>appears behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

295
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Brian has always said that like </v>

296
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.470
<v Speaker 1>when you start talking about simulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory in Asia and will show up.</v>

297
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like French and that to let you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that you're.</v>

298
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.910
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

299
00:13:56.911 --> 00:13:59.550
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is really all just a simulation.</v>

300
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.520
<v Speaker 1>It was actually somebody that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>photoshop that in.</v>

301
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:03.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

302
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.630
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's actually Mike Brown who was on </v>

303
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:08.630
<v Speaker 4>that pointless podcast following this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he came early.</v>

304
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 4>I met so many photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The writing.</v>

305
00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

306
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:12.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

307
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.420
<v Speaker 6>Puppets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bigger issue here.</v>

308
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 6>Then the Asian Person Chem trails,</v>
<v Speaker 6>floating leather letters talking about </v>

309
00:14:34.621 --> 00:14:34.920
<v Speaker 6>us.</v>

310
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

311
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.030
<v Speaker 4>he said he was like a big time mixmax </v>
<v Speaker 4>mixing shop.</v>

312
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.740
<v Speaker 4>He was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does video mixing.</v>

313
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.700
<v Speaker 4>So instead of doing like deejaying with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Odey,</v>

314
00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 4>he takes video clips and mixes like </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos and stuff</v>

315
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.720
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

316
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

317
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:56.670
<v Speaker 7>Let's throw one out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is a.</v>

318
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 7>What is it about a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>let me find tall dicks.</v>

319
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.230
<v Speaker 7>Just dicks going into Dick's and </v>
<v Speaker 7>splicing.</v>

320
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 7>Becoming Celtic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dick's to here.</v>

321
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 7>We're going to Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People are really.</v>

322
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.820
<v Speaker 7>When was this Dutch people?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Twenty,</v>

323
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 7>20,</v>
<v Speaker 7>19.</v>

324
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 7>Ain't gonna make it or taking volunteers</v>
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>

325
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:18.250
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's why Neil Tyson says that's what </v>

326
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.171
<v Speaker 7>we need.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We need somebody else going to go there </v>

327
00:15:20.171 --> 00:15:20.171
<v Speaker 7>first and that's the only way we'll go </v>
<v Speaker 7>to Mars.</v>

328
00:15:20.171 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like let some males pave the way.</v>

329
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.740
<v Speaker 7>I didn't do a good job guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was his reasoning behind the idea </v>

330
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:27.550
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

331
00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:27.980
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

332
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:31.720
<v Speaker 7>the racist to the moon was won by the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Americans.</v>

333
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:36.750
<v Speaker 7>Then it was pretty much over like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Russians didn't even want to go to the </v>

334
00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:36.750
<v Speaker 7>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's the point?</v>

335
00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.460
<v Speaker 7>The United States already there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's Mike Relm.</v>

336
00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:42.461
<v Speaker 7>He remixes an old spice commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How can I smell like space shows?</v>

337
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 7>That's easy.</v>

338
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to vote and he has a whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of different ones.</v>

339
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.590
<v Speaker 5>Like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what kind of stuff,</v>

340
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.310
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not gay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but very sexy video.</v>

341
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.000
<v Speaker 5>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So confident man with his shirt off,</v>

342
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.950
<v Speaker 7>he's making silly noises with his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

343
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.980
<v Speaker 7>Scott Pilgrim.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if you've ever seen that </v>

344
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.471
<v Speaker 7>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a really great guy having sex </v>

345
00:16:35.471 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 7>with a girl from behind.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What was the other thumbnail?</v>

346
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.640
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Someone's horning.</v>

347
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.920
<v Speaker 7>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is.</v>

348

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.041
<v Speaker 7>like or it's just the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Two of them coming together doesn't </v>

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.400
<v Speaker 7>I like kid rock at that last kid rock </v>
<v Speaker 7>song was like a combination of sweet </v>

360
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:48.930
<v Speaker 7>home Alabama and something else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

361
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 7>know I spent doing</v>

362
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.890
<v Speaker 3>that a lot lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

363
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 3>But it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

364
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

365
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:55.200
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like.</v>

366
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like when vanilla ice was doing ice</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice baby,</v>

367
00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 3>it was like under pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was the rift,</v>

368
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.270
<v Speaker 3>is that under pressure riff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least in the mashups.</v>

369
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Like you can clearly tell which songs </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're using.</v>

370
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:06.900
<v Speaker 3>We're not trying to say this is our </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like kid rock stuff.</v>

371
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:11.901
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess as a tribute and you </v>

372
00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:11.901
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a really popular songs,</v>

373
00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 3>so what the fuck do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm like man,</v>

374
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 3>I would rather hear the actual songs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

375
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.330
<v Speaker 3>That's how I feel sometimes with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mashups sometimes,</v>

376
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 3>but it just feels lame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard good though?</v>

377
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Voodoo problems?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No child and 99 problems.</v>

378
00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.590

<v Speaker 3>They're sort of catchy,</v>

379
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:30.330
<v Speaker 3>but then I feel like I shouldn't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

380
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Plagiarists Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tricked you.</v>

381
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.660
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's some,</v>

382
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:40.000
<v Speaker 3>some of them don't work with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them don't say unhip.</v>

383
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

384
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't into it that much until I heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>that 99 problems.</v>

<v Speaker 3>hokiest videos together,</v>

408
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially because like Steven Tyler </v>

409
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.351
<v Speaker 3>gets crazy with his mic stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He breaks through the wall where the </v>

<v Speaker 3>rappers are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

411
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:25.780
<v Speaker 3>and then they have respect for each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

412
00:20:25.781 --> 00:20:30.781
<v Speaker 3>Like bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of it would have </v>

<v Speaker 3>you just made.</v>

414
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:35.620
<v Speaker 3>It looks like an old lady at his crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>hair.</v>

415
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:40.650

<v Speaker 3>They would have beat the fuck out of </v>

416
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

417
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird to see that guy as a on </v>
<v Speaker 3>American idol</v>

418
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.360
<v Speaker 1>when people get old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have.</v>

419
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

420
00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't expect.</v>

421
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I have not grown up even remotely other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than my responsibilities have widened </v>

422
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.150
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my mindset,</v>

423
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of a little bit more </v>

424
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:06.720
<v Speaker 1>disciplined 15 more years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 more years,</v>

425
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.750
<v Speaker 1>but it happens to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Howard Stern.</v>

426
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's all in.</v>

427
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.830
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to make sure that you're having </v>

428
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.121
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to make sure the friends that </v>

429
00:21:18.121 --> 00:21:20.311
<v Speaker 1>are also having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta like keep a community of </v>

430
00:21:20.311 --> 00:21:20.311
<v Speaker 1>people together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what these people are all.</v>

431
00:21:20.311 --> 00:21:21.970
<v Speaker 1>They're not keeping community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think that comes with a lot of,</v>

432
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them,</v>

433
00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 1>they go solo and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

434
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:29.971
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking them and the wife and </v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally go on stage and just get </v>

435
00:21:29.971 --> 00:21:29.971
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

436
00:21:29.971 --> 00:21:31.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you reconsider revitive.</v>

437
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Something happens new again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get old and you know,</v>

438
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:38.470
<v Speaker 1>they always love to use that quote is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one quote that I've used.</v>

439
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I've used it to show me a young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on the liberal.</v>

440
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you a man without a heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me an old man.</v>

441
00:21:45.251 --> 00:21:47.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not conservative and I'll show you </v>
<v Speaker 1>a man who has no brain.</v>

442
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

443
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Because he's mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are just a bunch of weak cuts.</v>

444
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.440
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to really tell people to man up.</v>

445
00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>boulder and we even loved hippies until </v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived in boulder.</v>

448
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

449
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.570
<v Speaker 1>when you live around hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they're the majority,</v>

450

452
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:21.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small percentage of hippies when </v>

453
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.611
<v Speaker 1>they're around all the time acting where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets really annoying like there they </v>

454
00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:23.950
<v Speaker 1>can be fucking annoying.</v>

478
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.090
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a kind of a weird.</v>

479
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Becomes a kind of a weird thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

480
00:23:36.551 --> 00:23:41.551
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

482
00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:44.191

<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

483
00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 1>the real problem with the hippie life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a life of meandering,</v>

484
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:53.180
<v Speaker 1>a life of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that my next meal find its way </v>

485
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I'm going to do it,</v>

486
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure my next meal will find its </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to me.</v>

487
00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I have trust in the universe and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thinking.</v>

488
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:01.830
<v Speaker 1>They were like hippies that there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

494
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:13.820

<v Speaker 1>The majority were really cool,</v>

495
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 1>like it's like 90 percent of them were </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking outstanding human beings.</v>

496
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:21.940
<v Speaker 1>The people there in boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the 10 percent of these fucking </v>

500
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:34.301
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you're holding the baby </v>

<v Speaker 1>it was just like something to do.</v>

513
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:07.260

<v Speaker 1>surrounded by people that are also </v>

520
00:25:16.401 --> 00:25:19.730
<v Speaker 1>trying to get shit done,</v>

<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

527
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I know that was a big deal for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you did that,</v>

528
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:39.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you said that you do that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

530
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:45.671
<v Speaker 1>I get inspired when I hear other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>really working at something towards </v>

531
00:25:45.671 --> 00:25:46.960
<v Speaker 1>something and really.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that if you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not around people that are </v>

<v Speaker 1>you can get fucking dull.</v>

538
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:05.530
<v Speaker 1>You can fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can let this push in your </v>

539
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:05.530
<v Speaker 1>outstanding person without doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

579
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:56.061
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's you don't just for a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and then you can go back and like </v>

580
00:27:56.061 --> 00:27:56.061
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about when you were</v>

581
00:27:56.061 --> 00:27:59.460
<v Speaker 3>talking about buying a house because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way cheaper houses and it's like,</v>

582
00:27:59.461 --> 00:28:01.620
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have to live there.</v>

583
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.450
<v Speaker 3>She's not just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>

584
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:04.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to live there.</v>

585
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the desert.</v>

586
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:10.050
<v Speaker 3>He can get a whole acre for $180.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

587
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:15.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing every day that's </v>

588
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.661
<v Speaker 3>worth the amount of money that you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>say if you bought a home in the Nevada </v>

589
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:18.870
<v Speaker 3>desert?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Living my life.</v>

590
00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I talked to the guy once it's a while </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in a truck stop.</v>

591
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Just being like a salesman of the front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

592
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 3>like a store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

593
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:29.880
<v Speaker 3>how was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you got to go crazy by herself a</v>

594
00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:34.881
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met this guy of like Vancouver or </v>

595
00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:34.881
<v Speaker 3>something and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

596
00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:34.881
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm not there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

597
00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:37.650
<v Speaker 3>because it was so fucking lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't see anyone except strangers</v>

598
00:28:37.651 --> 00:28:40.120
<v Speaker 3>and very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus,</v>

599
00:28:40.121 --> 00:28:41.940
<v Speaker 3>that must be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a prison.</v>

600
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

601
00:28:42.691 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 3>get away from everybody for a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>while and then it becomes your life.</v>

602
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am of the opinion.</v>

603
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Especially as I get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not healthy to be away from </v>

604
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.301
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to have some sense of </v>

605
00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:56.301
<v Speaker 3>community and they're loners or any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

606
00:28:56.301 --> 00:29:00.520
<v Speaker 3>any person that just wants to be by </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves alone in the woods all the </v>

607
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:00.520
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

608
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 3>like no friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not saying hi to people.</v>

609
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Keep an eye on that motherfucker because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

610
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.810
<v Speaker 3>that's some uni bomber type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

611
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.900
<v Speaker 3>I think it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every person has a different </v>

612
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:11.900
<v Speaker 3>level of how much they need other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>around them.</v>

613
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and at some point they'll just be a </v>

614
00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:16.660
<v Speaker 3>curve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like don't need anybody,</v>

615
00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.111
<v Speaker 3>don't need anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when somebody like 10 minutes </v>

616
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:19.111
<v Speaker 3>in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were people,</v>

617
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 3>I need people with some people that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be 10 days.</v>

618
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good for two days without saying </v>

619
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:24.680
<v Speaker 3>anybody I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>

620
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.050
<v Speaker 3>I like a day every now and then I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 3>decompression decompression day where I </v>

621
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.801
<v Speaker 3>don't have to talk to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could just sit and chill and get some </v>

622
00:29:33.801 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 3>reading done and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe watch a documentary or something.</v>

623
00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:36.450
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just literally not communicated at all.</v>

624
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.890
<v Speaker 3>Your underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice.</v>

625
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:38.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those days are nice,</v>

626
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>but they're just so rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most important thing</v>

627
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 1>is that you're stimulated on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

628
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa,</v>

629
00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:51.791
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa have people around you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are stimulating and as soon as you get </v>

630
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:55.471
<v Speaker 1>stuck in some sort of a rut where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have anything going on with your </v>

631
00:29:55.471 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 1>mind or it's challenging you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have slowly rot away.</v>

632
00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.280
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fall into that Rut to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

633
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.440
<v Speaker 1>I bet for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

634
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

635
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:09.120
<v Speaker 1>we need a bunch of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to be stimulated by our </v>

636
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever our interests are,</v>

637
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:14.581
<v Speaker 1>whether you're interested in cooking or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's carpentry or whether it's </v>

638
00:30:14.581 --> 00:30:16.480
<v Speaker 1>drawing or whether it's fucking golfing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your interests are,</v>

639
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 1>those dumb shits are important in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

640
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interests are important because </v>

641
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 1>interests stimulate your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in the job you have.</v>

642
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.010
<v Speaker 1>You fucking hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

643
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.350
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about it later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not your interest.</v>

644
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people.</v>

645
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it is your lucky as fuck.</v>

646
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 1>If you're a comedian and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually love comedy man.</v>

647
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:39.300
<v Speaker 1>What have huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge fucking blessing that is.</v>

648
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.660
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of folks what they're good at </v>

649
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 1>and what they make can make a living and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really what the thing is.</v>

650
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.410
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.430
<v Speaker 1>they go bowling on the weekends so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

652
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.480
<v Speaker 1>go through some duck hunting but they </v>
<v Speaker 1>find something that stimulates them and </v>

653
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:59.311
<v Speaker 1>I never really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of didn't understand that even </v>

654
00:30:59.311 --> 00:31:01.411
<v Speaker 1>though I was doing all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me a long time to sort of piece </v>

655
00:31:01.411 --> 00:31:04.801
<v Speaker 1>that together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people do open my comedy like that </v>

656
00:31:04.801 --> 00:31:05.060
<v Speaker 1>in their forties and fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just first coffee shops.</v>

657
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like I'm not trying to be </v>

658
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.160
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like doing it.</v>

659
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Then when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they act as the same no matter what.</v>

660
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're painting on your back porch </v>

661
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:16.170
<v Speaker 1>with a grandmother or painting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your seller ship for a million dollars,</v>

662
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.650
<v Speaker 1>you're still just trying to make a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>painter.</v>

663
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing it the right way,</v>

664
00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:22.140
<v Speaker 1>it will be exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for the joy of that.</v>

665
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:24.130
<v Speaker 1>The joy of the creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

666
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

667
00:31:24.911 --> 00:31:29.911
<v Speaker 1>I'm like you like if I have any one flub</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in a bit it will drive me </v>

668
00:31:31.811 --> 00:31:34.510
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a hiccup in the jug,</v>

669
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:39.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a transition job that just seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial shit will drive me crazy so I</v>

670
00:31:39.641 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 1>could rush for an hour and 10 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they just loved it and I'd get off</v>

671
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:46.810
<v Speaker 1>the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet that fucking on the fucking bed</v>

672
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:50.050
<v Speaker 1>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to fix that fucking bed and that's</v>

673
00:31:50.051 --> 00:31:51.880
<v Speaker 1>all I'll think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

674
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I can but it's Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

675
00:31:54.461 --> 00:31:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but I did that for awhile.</v>

676
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got no fucking.</v>

677
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It was just like for months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are.</v>

678
00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.690
<v Speaker 1>But as you work through something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

679
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of Hash them out on the stage </v>

680
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.701
<v Speaker 1>and I think is another thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when you're working out new </v>

681
00:32:08.701 --> 00:32:11.221
<v Speaker 1>materials that you get to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you said it so many times that as </v>

682
00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:11.710
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're saying it,</v>

683
00:32:11.711 --> 00:32:14.680
<v Speaker 1>your brain seeks new ways to approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

684
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you like an isolation chamber </v>

685
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 1>for your fucking material material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a mantra.</v>

686
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you say it so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it loses its meaning.</v>

687
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.610
<v Speaker 1>So as you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find like God saying this again,</v>

688
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.950
<v Speaker 1>you have some new way and or it could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and then you all of a sudden you go</v>

689
00:32:29.951 --> 00:32:33.040
<v Speaker 1>into a new direction just to entertain </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

690
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many times have you done </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

691
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:39.511
<v Speaker 1>Gone down like completely ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>paths with a bit where it's like babies </v>

692
00:32:39.511 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 1>with big dicks</v>

693
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.990
<v Speaker 3>and machine guns and they fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like doing,</v>

694
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 3>it could have a machine gun safety latch</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was one machine doesn't seem </v>

695
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:53.410
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those kind of like ridiculous </v>

696
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.160
<v Speaker 3>territory of your peanuts would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>lacking and you might do one of those </v>

697
00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 3>and it would only work that night and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was for that night,</v>

698
00:32:57.411 --> 00:33:02.411
<v Speaker 3>but every now and then you do one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those and then there'll be a piece in </v>

699
00:33:02.411 --> 00:33:02.820
<v Speaker 3>there that becomes a new chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

700
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

701
00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:04.160
<v Speaker 3>That's how you</v>

702
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.470
<v Speaker 7>fine things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's how I do it way I find.</v>

703
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do that in the writing itself through </v>

704
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 7>both.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a.</v>

705
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.600
<v Speaker 7>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I find I get a lot of ideas lately from </v>

706
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.940
<v Speaker 7>driving around with the car radio off </v>
<v Speaker 7>often do that.</v>

707
00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:19.900
<v Speaker 7>I do that when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I'm,</v>

708
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:24.950
<v Speaker 7>I don't allow myself when I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 7>for the next storyteller show and I've </v>

709
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:25.120
<v Speaker 7>thought of one yet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

710
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.920
<v Speaker 7>I don't let myself use the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

711
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.320
<v Speaker 7>I get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like it.</v>

712
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.730
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's smart.</v>

713
00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:36.390
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's something about the act of </v>

714
00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.720
<v Speaker 7>driving without a radio that your mind </v>
<v Speaker 7>has to take in all those things.</v>

715
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.430
<v Speaker 7>You can't tune it out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

716
00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:40.960
<v Speaker 7>I saw a study that when you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>phone,</v>

717
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:42.640
<v Speaker 7>even when you have an ear buds in or </v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever,</v>

718
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.700
<v Speaker 7>your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your peripheral vision goes down 20 </v>

719
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:47.700
<v Speaker 7>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not me.</v>

720
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe.</v>

721
00:33:48.311 --> 00:33:52.390
<v Speaker 3>But the studies show Super Douchey guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's invulnerable,</v>

722
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.090
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because your mind is not focusing on</v>

723
00:33:55.091 --> 00:33:56.500
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mentality,</v>

724
00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:02.030
<v Speaker 3>my mentality is I see everything always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll rock that test and I got a 180 </v>

725
00:34:02.051 --> 00:34:04.240
<v Speaker 3>degree vision of doctors.</v>

726
00:34:04.241 --> 00:34:06.880

<v Speaker 1>Somebody wants something bad coming up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me asking me if where I can probably </v>

811
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 1>just a dumb person.</v>

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have pretty good instincts,</v>

818
00:37:29.631 --> 00:37:30.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

819
00:37:30.421 --> 00:37:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing obviously the little edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>could grow in my imagination over time,</v>

820
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 1>but I was very convinced that this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was fishy as fuck.</v>

821
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Did you wait?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

822

<v Speaker 1>when people are lying to you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know someone's bullshitting you or </v>

825
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
<v Speaker 1>He was up to something and I've entered </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a few of those circumstances </v>

826
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.000
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing this yourself?</v>

<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

832
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:01.350
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Adam Carolla.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you heard about what?</v>

981
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.580
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the first podcasters to get </v>

982
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.860
<v Speaker 4>sued by who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for what a,</v>

983
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.440
<v Speaker 4>this big company that owns a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>patents,</v>

984
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

985
00:45:54.921 --> 00:45:58.790
<v Speaker 4>after Adam Corolla and the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>make,</v>

986
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some other podcasts that's pretty big </v>

987
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.860
<v Speaker 4>and there are suing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe something.</v>

988
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.560
<v Speaker 4>See how stuff works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dot Com.</v>

989
00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.070
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about a playlist.</v>

990
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.040
<v Speaker 4>So it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's a playlist?</v>

991
00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.080
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

992
00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.450
<v Speaker 4>this company called Personal Audio Llc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

993
00:46:17.451 --> 00:46:22.451
<v Speaker 4>did a patent infringement lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 4>against apple recently in one and now </v>

994
00:46:22.451 --> 00:46:24.500
<v Speaker 4>they're going after podcasters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are they suing for using the,</v>

995
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.020
<v Speaker 4>using the algorithm to do a list?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

996
00:46:27.021 --> 00:46:31.820
<v Speaker 4>They're not really saying much yet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Corolla hasn't sent anything yet,</v>

997
00:46:31.821 --> 00:46:35.360
<v Speaker 4>but it's a Adam curl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I continue to say girls aren't funny.</v>

998
00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.810
<v Speaker 4>I love the opportunity to lift others up</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it,</v>

999
00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.500
<v Speaker 4>but it says that a personal audio is web</v>
<v Speaker 4>a website.</v>

1000
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.500
<v Speaker 4>The company says its patents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A pioneer techniques now commonly used </v>

1001
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:50.870
<v Speaker 4>today in portable players,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smartphones,</v>

1002
00:46:50.871 --> 00:46:52.160
<v Speaker 4>tablets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and other products.</v>

1003
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:57.520
<v Speaker 4>And it says that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it lists several pants from music </v>

1004
00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:57.520
<v Speaker 4>playlists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcasting,</v>

1005
00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.420
<v Speaker 4>personalized recommendations and auto </v>
<v Speaker 4>audio messaging.</v>

1006
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:04.450
<v Speaker 4>So is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did he have a application that they're </v>

1007
00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:07.421
<v Speaker 4>saying infringed on a patent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it sort of sounds like it seems </v>

1008
00:47:07.421 --> 00:47:08.030
<v Speaker 4>like this company has patents and </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcasting,</v>

1009
00:47:08.031 --> 00:47:10.670
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know what that means because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it can't just be like,</v>

1010
00:47:10.671 --> 00:47:15.671
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put an audio file up and now you're </v>

1011
00:47:15.671 --> 00:47:15.671
<v Speaker 4>suing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1012
00:47:15.671 --> 00:47:18.700
<v Speaker 4>so it has to be something about maybe he</v>
<v Speaker 4>has his own personal app and something </v>

1013
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.130
<v Speaker 4>in that App.</v>

1014
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why I say that because smart</v>
<v Speaker 3>phones and tablets,</v>

1015
00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.220
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it looks like it.</v>

1016
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:28.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping you don't really need calls </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sue somebody.</v>

1017
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.740
<v Speaker 3>You can just sue.</v>

1018
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's out there.</v>

1019
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:36.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm sure that they just won a </v>

1020
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:39.780
<v Speaker 4>million dollar a lawsuit against apple </v>
<v Speaker 4>so that they have going on here.</v>

1021
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe there's some sort of </v>

1022
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.360
<v Speaker 3>application that apple has available.</v>

1023
00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:52.410
<v Speaker 4>Probably some kind of playlist thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's involved with making the APP and </v>

1024
00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:52.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they want.</v>

1025
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:55.390
<v Speaker 4>It also says that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an involved with making the APP.</v>

1026
00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.600
<v Speaker 4>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've entered the license agreements </v>

1027
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:00.600
<v Speaker 4>with Sirius Xm radio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coby,</v>

1028
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:00.600
<v Speaker 4>Samsung,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazon,</v>

1029
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.700
<v Speaker 4>Motorola,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and have.</v>

1030
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:07.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it looks like there's companies that </v>

1031
00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.881
<v Speaker 4>are actually entering licensing </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreement agreements against probably </v>

1032
00:48:08.881 --> 00:48:09.190
<v Speaker 4>some kind of playlist thing or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1033
00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.390
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

1034
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:15.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I guess it's probably the personal </v>

1035
00:48:15.391 --> 00:48:15.650
<v Speaker 4>apps that are doing it.</v>

1036
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you asked me if I have my </v>

1037
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:20.900
<v Speaker 3>own APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1038
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

1039
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.270
<v Speaker 3>I have an APP but I didn't make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be the maker of the APP?</v>

1040
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:30.260
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think I'm responsible for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fan made am I can't be.</v>

1041
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't.</v>

1042
00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.680
<v Speaker 3>What am I gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna stop everybody from making.</v>

1043
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:36.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be stupid.</v>

1044
00:48:36.421 --> 00:48:39.570
<v Speaker 3>Like they're making something for free </v>
<v Speaker 3>that other people can enjoy.</v>

1045
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Why would I stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1046
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:46.280
<v Speaker 4>And also it makes me wonder if like </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies like Lipson who offers like </v>

1047
00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.700
<v Speaker 4>free APP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that makes lipson </v>

1048
00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:50.860
<v Speaker 4>accountable or every single one person </v>
<v Speaker 4>who does that.</v>

1049
00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's fucked if that's the case.</v>

1050

<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1052
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.240
<v Speaker 4>if somebody makes printing supplies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they haven't done anything wrong.</v>

1053
00:48:58.241 --> 00:49:01.420
<v Speaker 4>If you fucking cop just pirate a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>of shirts.</v>

1054
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.030

<v Speaker 4>Makes San Francisco 40 niners shirts.</v>

1055
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:05.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

1056

<v Speaker 4>Do you think this is a real picture of </v>

1058
00:49:11.221 --> 00:49:11.221
<v Speaker 4>Photoshop?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's very.</v>

1059
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

1060
00:49:16.381 --> 00:49:21.381
<v Speaker 3>I hate that word by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole giant fucking rant on twitter </v>

1061
00:49:21.691 --> 00:49:24.180
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no hit and people were saying that,</v>

1062
00:49:24.181 --> 00:49:26.310
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to represent like,</v>

1063
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1064
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:32.600
<v Speaker 3>not having hate now it just represents </v>
<v Speaker 3>no trend represents celebrities.</v>

1065
00:49:34.131 --> 00:49:34.680
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at me.</v>

1066
00:49:34.681 --> 00:49:36.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm there to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cool too.</v>

1067
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:41.300
<v Speaker 3>It's the dumbest idea ever that the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to avoid hate is to draw on your face </v>

1068
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.901
<v Speaker 3>and cover your lips with tape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much it's been nice to have to be </v>

1069
00:49:44.901 --> 00:49:48.081
<v Speaker 3>anti gay just because you're against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking look of an ad campaign and why </v>

1070
00:49:48.081 --> 00:49:51.531
<v Speaker 3>does Amparo looks so gay in this photo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks like he's wearing maker gate </v>

1071
00:49:51.531 --> 00:49:52.380
<v Speaker 3>them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gave them on Photoshop.</v>

1072
00:49:52.381 --> 00:49:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like given blush and no know.</v>

1073
00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just how they shot it.</v>

1074
00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an odd little thing there and let</v>

1075
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.360
<v Speaker 3>her know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1076
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.040
<v Speaker 3>I saw that on so many people's pages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the table.</v>

1077
00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.010
<v Speaker 3>So many people walk in and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's like,</v>

1078
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.530
<v Speaker 3>I want that too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not supporting the thing.</v>

1079
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.540
<v Speaker 3>It's about a trendy DM message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the way to stop pain is to put tape</v>

1080
00:50:13.541 --> 00:50:14.610
<v Speaker 3>over your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1081
00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:16.290
<v Speaker 3>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that represent?</v>

1082
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Blow jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of image is that?</v>

1083
00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.770
<v Speaker 3>A piece of tape over your fucking mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>

1084
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.110
<v Speaker 3>How about just smiles?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about people?</v>

1085
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Smile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:50:25.611 --> 00:50:27.010
<v Speaker 3>What's the table with us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the silence.</v>

1087
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason for it.</v>

1088
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 3>The reason is to get us to talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes out.</v>

1089
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.350
<v Speaker 3>That means you can't have cake come out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your mouth.</v>

1090
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is not the hateful one.</v>

1091
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.780
<v Speaker 3>Or not saying he's not the hey buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the hateful ones.</v>

1092
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 3>There's all these celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different people that put tape</v>

1093
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:43.580
<v Speaker 3>over their fucking mouth and wrote no </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate on their face.</v>

1094
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:47.630
<v Speaker 3>They're dumb or they got talked into </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it by a chick.</v>

1095
00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:52.790
<v Speaker 3>That could be it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if anyone trying to put tape </v>

1096
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.391
<v Speaker 3>over their mouth and put it over there </v>
<v Speaker 3>in those two and then started to </v>

1097
00:50:55.391 --> 00:50:55.391
<v Speaker 3>suffocate a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1098
00:50:55.391 --> 00:50:59.390
<v Speaker 3>I think they would suffocate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trendiness sort of thing before they </v>

1099
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.570
<v Speaker 3>would run out of air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1100
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:04.950
<v Speaker 3>hate and it's an h with a red eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's mission eight.</v>

1101

<v Speaker 3>Proposition eight was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1102
00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:07.660

<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1103
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.520
<v Speaker 3>the proposition that made it illegal to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have gay marriage.</v>

1104
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:13.550
<v Speaker 3>But why tape over your fucking mouth,</v>

<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they break up the show into like little </v>

1132
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:19.990
<v Speaker 3>chunks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do a bunch of them,</v>

<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just start reading paper.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I guarantee that it'll get out there.</v>

1216
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's,</v>

1217
00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:49.480

<v Speaker 3>I wonder why can't you like,</v>

1218
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:54.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a black male and I'm putting this </v>

1219
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:55.030
<v Speaker 3>video out of him saying what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1220
00:55:55.031 --> 00:55:58.360
<v Speaker 3>The Punch was not worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just admitting to the thing he did.</v>

1221
00:55:58.550 --> 00:55:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1222
00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1223
00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.010
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about being exposed.</v>

1224
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Like once you're exposed to sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>predator,</v>

1225
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:10.510
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine that they'd got away his</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life and got away with it.</v>

1226
00:56:10.511 --> 00:56:12.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean probably is already a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>Predator somewhere.</v>

1227
00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Wait til they find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really think they got away with it </v>

1228
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:21.181
<v Speaker 3>all this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the pretty policy that's </v>

1229
00:56:21.181 --> 00:56:22.120
<v Speaker 3>so fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just always assumed that if someone is</v>

1230
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:27.240
<v Speaker 3>out there and molesting and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they try to keep doing it and then get </v>

1231
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.180
<v Speaker 3>caught because he can't do anything now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's been over what,</v>

1232
00:56:28.181 --> 00:56:29.800
<v Speaker 3>seven years or whatever it is.</v>

1233
00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.760
<v Speaker 3>What is the statute of limitations </v>
<v Speaker 3>expires and child molesting her.</v>

1234
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:34.690
<v Speaker 3>So you can just talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

1235
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:37.300
<v Speaker 3>So right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ball doesn't get arrested.</v>

1236
00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.220
<v Speaker 3>That's Kinda fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1237
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:44.700
<v Speaker 3>I know the statute of limitations </v>
<v Speaker 3>limitations apply to everything it does </v>

1238
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:45.240
<v Speaker 3>not apply to and there's federal statute</v>
<v Speaker 3>of limitations.</v>

1239
00:56:45.241 --> 00:56:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Is there a state statute of limitations </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well?</v>

1240
00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 3>Like if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they're probably still going to do </v>

1242
00:56:52.861 --> 00:56:52.861
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old were you?</v>

1243
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:57.130

<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

1247
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's plenty of time.</v>

1248
00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.820
<v Speaker 3>You should brag about it to the family </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if they do anything you can sue them</v>

1249
00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.040
<v Speaker 3>and do the guy tell you he was a cop </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows they don't tell you you're a cop,</v>

1250
00:57:13.041 --> 00:57:13.420
<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>

1251
00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Get off Scott free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did that in breaking bad was </v>

1252
00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:19.870
<v Speaker 3>something early on with somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like trusted a cop and he was like,</v>

1253
00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:24.750
<v Speaker 3>you'll copy goes because you got to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>them that if you already I need set.</v>

1254
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.400
<v Speaker 3>It sold them and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1255
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:29.890
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:57:29.891 --> 00:57:33.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird sort of a myth that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to tell someone.</v>

1257
00:57:33.071 --> 00:57:34.810
<v Speaker 3>If they asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you a cop?</v>

1258
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.780
<v Speaker 3>I think there was always like hookers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and movies would ask the Johns,</v>

1259
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:42.810
<v Speaker 3>are you a cop?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you get arrested for getting a </v>

1260
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:42.810
<v Speaker 3>hooker in college?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1261
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you get arrested in college?</v>

1262
00:57:43.091 --> 00:57:43.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a joke.</v>

1263
00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Got completely drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I learned in college is </v>

1264
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:48.900
<v Speaker 3>avoid hookers with walkie talkies was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>

1265
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.450
<v Speaker 3>It was just a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1266
00:57:49.451 --> 00:57:49.820
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1267
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a complete fabrication.</v>

1268
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:56.040
<v Speaker 3>That was back in the days when I used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>write jokes.</v>

1269
00:57:56.041 --> 00:57:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good to have to once in awhile.</v>

1270
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a good,</v>

1271
00:58:01.241 --> 00:58:06.241
<v Speaker 3>like a good solid one liner to pull you </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of a ditch or to just set the stage </v>

1272
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:12.790
<v Speaker 3>as long as it's like a good crisp one </v>
<v Speaker 3>could have a complete game changer.</v>

1273
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Just like completely changed the tempo </v>
<v Speaker 3>of where the show's going.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I guess they're trying to save that as </v>

1281
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:37.870
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the trailer they didn't show it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>had done anything that really resonated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>man doing heavy opiod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brittany Murphy had opiates in our </v>

1390
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's so many people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are having problems right now with </v>

1392
01:02:51.081 --> 01:02:51.081
<v Speaker 1>opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's which one's opiates?</v>

1393
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Oxycontin's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroin.</v>

1394
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:56.700

<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of jokes about,</v>

1395
01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:01.730
<v Speaker 1>about pill sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I go to the Midwest </v>

<v Speaker 1>sometimes my drug stuff,</v>

1402
01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.080
<v Speaker 1>it was oxycontins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that I say that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a nasal decongestant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 1>decongestants.</v>

1442
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.860
<v Speaker 1>So she was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was taking oxys and she got sick.</v>

1443

<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

1444
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:14.100
<v Speaker 1>she died from sickness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't die from the drugs.</v>

1445
01:05:14.101 --> 01:05:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>much like Duisburg would.</v>

1447
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1448
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:21.280
<v Speaker 3>we do have someone who's got to debate </v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Duesberg.</v>

1449
01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:26.610
<v Speaker 3>We have a professor of biology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy duty phd dude who's down for the </v>

1450
01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:28.440
<v Speaker 3>program that he's a professor Tyson to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

1451
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.070
<v Speaker 3>but he's going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to do it.</v>

1452
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1453
01:05:31.051 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think much like his assertions,</v>

1454
01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying he says a lot of crazy </v>

1455
01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:39.720
<v Speaker 3>shit about HIV that HIV only exists in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the immune system.</v>

1456
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:42.070
<v Speaker 3>People that are already compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what's really going on is those</v>

1457
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:44.080
<v Speaker 3>people are partying.</v>

<v Speaker 3>sick as fuck.</v>

1459
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:51.810

<v Speaker 3>he's taken all his nasal decongestants </v>

1460
01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:54.541
<v Speaker 3>and really what it was is her body was </v>
<v Speaker 3>too weak to fight off anything because </v>

1461
01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:56.390
<v Speaker 3>she was as red lining and on heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what was going on.</v>

1462

<v Speaker 1>but that's me.</v>

1528
01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people really like talking to </v>

1529
01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:44.710
<v Speaker 1>celebrities to today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got up at eight,</v>

1530
01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>9:00</v>

1531
01:08:45.981 --> 01:08:50.981
<v Speaker 1>in the morning on Sunday and drove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove down to bellflower to play in a </v>

1532
01:08:50.981 --> 01:08:55.421
<v Speaker 1>pool tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many fucking people excited to do </v>

1533
01:08:55.421 --> 01:08:59.591
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tiny fraction of the world's </v>

1534
01:08:59.591 --> 01:08:59.591
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1535
01:08:59.591 --> 01:08:59.870
<v Speaker 1>if you told them they were going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1536
01:08:59.871 --> 01:09:01.250
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like the flood.</v>

1537
01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go play 30 am fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>suck at pool and I'm not going to get up</v>

1538
01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:07.550
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and then drive all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the fuck down there,</v>

1539
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:09.740
<v Speaker 1>but to me it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get up,</v>

1540
01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.660
<v Speaker 1>have a good breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get some coffee in me,</v>

1541
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:13.580
<v Speaker 1>wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get there early and Knox and balls.</v>

1542
01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.040
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you finished off in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tournament,</v>

1543
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:17.120
<v Speaker 1>went right back to another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1544
01:09:17.121 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I play it again on Monday night because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday night it didn't play good.</v>

1545
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I was not awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1546
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:26.830
<v Speaker 1>My.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I'm ever going to play in a </v>

1547
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.110
<v Speaker 1>tournament in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta at least do some calisthenics,</v>

1548
01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:30.410
<v Speaker 1>like I think maybe some jumping jacks or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like really?</v>

1549
01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe run up a couple flights of stairs </v>

1550
01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.430
<v Speaker 1>or something because I feel like my eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't see that good yet.</v>

1551
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like blinking a lot and my arm </v>

1552
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:42.430
<v Speaker 1>wasn't loosened up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

1553
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I was still stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd barely,</v>

1554
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:49.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a week for like two hours or </v>

1555
01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:49.151
<v Speaker 1>whatever it fucking was when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first started playing.</v>

1556
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:53.390
<v Speaker 1>So I realized that like I need more </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation.</v>

1557
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.760
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>toms to people on the phone,</v>

1558
01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:57.970
<v Speaker 1>get loose a little more around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fun though.</v>

1559
01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Stretch beforehand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1560
01:09:59.631 --> 01:10:02.540
<v Speaker 1>but I stretched during it sometimes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like one out.</v>

1561
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:04.370
<v Speaker 1>So not my chance to shine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just sort of like,</v>

1562
01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put my leg on something that's,</v>

1563
01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wear a batman outfit Bro.</v>

1564
01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And a Cape and were a Mexican mask and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>n a n a fucking coward.</v>

1565
01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Intimidate people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody came into a pool,</v>

1566
01:10:18.411 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll just like that wanting to actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be like,</v>

1567
01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:21.250
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting my action.</v>

1568
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Do unique thing about pool is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody gives a fuck about anything else </v>

1569
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:31.430
<v Speaker 1>in the poolroom except can you play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like all they ever care about.</v>

1570
01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:36.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a place like pool halls are a </v>

1571
01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:39.451
<v Speaker 1>place where you have a whole group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are addicted to a very </v>

1572
01:10:39.451 --> 01:10:44.110
<v Speaker 1>specific activity and that's hugely </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to them in that comedy.</v>

1573
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1574
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:45.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1575
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Like if you meet a guy in comedy and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy doesn't do stand up,</v>

1576
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:50.900
<v Speaker 1>it never bothers you or even if he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

1577
01:10:50.901 --> 01:10:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but like a bigger guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little,</v>

1578
01:10:52.611 --> 01:10:57.611
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bothered me for years I had to </v>

1579
01:10:57.611 --> 01:10:57.611
<v Speaker 1>learn how to get over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I came to the store,</v>

1580
01:10:57.611 --> 01:11:01.931
<v Speaker 1>I learned to get over that because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was guys that are genuinely loved and I </v>

1581
01:11:01.931 --> 01:11:05.171
<v Speaker 1>would see there every week and I give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a big hug and I just have to leave </v>

1582
01:11:05.171 --> 01:11:06.200
<v Speaker 1>the room and they went on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I realized as a person,</v>

1583
01:11:06.201 --> 01:11:09.020
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just whatever limits him up there,</v>

1584
01:11:09.021 --> 01:11:11.150
<v Speaker 1>everyone's got their own struggles to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get there or whatever.</v>

1585
01:11:11.151 --> 01:11:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Their potential is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that great.</v>

1586
01:11:12.231 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like.</v>

1587
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.620
<v Speaker 3>But if you had a pool hall and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>

1588
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:18.270
<v Speaker 3>they have no respect for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1589
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:21.960
<v Speaker 3>if the president was in the pool hall </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was fucking make it shitty shots,</v>

1590
01:11:21.961 --> 01:11:24.600
<v Speaker 3>I just shake their head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This motherfucker can't even get out.</v>

1591
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:30.570
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing when people lock onto</v>

1592
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.600
<v Speaker 3>one obsession together and like a group </v>
<v Speaker 3>of golfers all just getting good people </v>

1593
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 3>and I mean it's not even always about </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting good at.</v>

1594
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:41.220
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's just about being obsessed</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a thing like people,</v>

1595
01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.160
<v Speaker 3>people fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fantasy games,</v>

1596
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fantasy football.</v>

1597
01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Even they'll get together and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>

1598
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Those people always want to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>about their Goddamn fucking roster.</v>

1599
01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.920
<v Speaker 3>Can't believe Erin foster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All we did was six more yards to the </v>

1600
01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.370
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes,</v>

1601
01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:04.820
<v Speaker 3>why would anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the people in your league aren't </v>

1602
01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:05.910

01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:29.490
<v Speaker 3>It's very bad when people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally leaving the brains over to</v>

1616
01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:31.770
<v Speaker 3>study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the other football players don't have</v>

1617
01:12:31.771 --> 01:12:33.570
<v Speaker 3>to go through this and it's multiple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1618
01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting to think football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1619
01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1620
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.960
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very important to figure out like </v>

1621
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.220
<v Speaker 3>when this starts happening and how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut it off.</v>

1622
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Like I think you can take a few hits as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a young man and I think you could take a</v>

1623
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:50.880
<v Speaker 3>few knockouts in fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could get,</v>

1624
01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.260
<v Speaker 3>it could be fun your later years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how many Kenya?</v>

1625
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know and it varies.</v>

1626
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:58.770
<v Speaker 3>That's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also.</v>

1627
01:12:58.771 --> 01:13:00.600
<v Speaker 3>I read this thing about a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>committed suicide,</v>

1628
01:13:00.601 --> 01:13:03.540
<v Speaker 3>who got knocked unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high school football player,</v>

1629
01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:04.650
<v Speaker 3>real friendly.</v>

1630
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone loved them and then they sat </v>

1631
01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:12.771
<v Speaker 3>him out and he did this stuff that was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulating to his mind.</v>

1632
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.080
<v Speaker 3>He went to a concert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>played a bunch of video games and </v>

1633
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:18.720
<v Speaker 3>committed suicide and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1634
01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.430
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to take off from all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1635
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Barely read if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like sit alone.</v>

1636
01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.870
<v Speaker 3>No loud music because he played video </v>
<v Speaker 3>games and went to stimulate his mind too</v>

1637
01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:28.920
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just in his,</v>

1638
01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:30.630
<v Speaker 3>in his concussed mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't handle it.</v>

1639
01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.640
<v Speaker 3>So it just went out and killed himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1640
01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:37.641
<v Speaker 3>he got super depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They called him down for dinner and he </v>

1641
01:13:37.641 --> 01:13:39.030
<v Speaker 3>was like not coming down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hanging God Jesus is coming.</v>

1642
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:44.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he showed no signs of depression prior </v>

1643
01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:44.060
<v Speaker 3>and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this can easily be caused by concussions</v>

1644
01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:45.870
<v Speaker 3>until they're out of your system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much they don't understand.</v>

1645
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:51.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the kind of concussions that you </v>

1646
01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:51.650
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and football too,</v>

1647
01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:54.030
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get people running at you.</v>

1648
01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Of course when you're running that way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're running this way and also </v>

1649
01:13:59.461 --> 01:14:04.461
<v Speaker 3>it's like the ones where you don't get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>concussion and you just get wrong over </v>

1650
01:14:04.461 --> 01:14:07.911
<v Speaker 3>and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hitting helmets with other </v>

1651
01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:07.911
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1652
01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:11.181
<v Speaker 3>they say that that's the biggest issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even the actual concussions </v>

1653
01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's subconcussive trauma</v>

1654
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.400
<v Speaker 1>that accumulates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying that that's why people </v>

1655
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:17.400
<v Speaker 1>who've never been knocked out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gym,</v>

1656
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.171
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been hit so many times and then </v>

1657
01:14:22.171 --> 01:14:23.140
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

1658
01:14:23.141 --> 01:14:28.141
<v Speaker 1>they're just their brain breaks and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't get hit anymore and you can </v>

1659
01:14:28.141 --> 01:14:31.861
<v Speaker 1>hit them and they just fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a weird thing that happens to </v>

1660
01:14:31.861 --> 01:14:32.050
<v Speaker 1>guys just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just lose their chin.</v>

1661
01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.930
<v Speaker 1>They completely lose their chin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1662
01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 1>It's seen that the UFC enough to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you get knocked out once,</v>

1663
01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a little slower and that's why </v>

1664
01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.791
<v Speaker 1>it got knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you continue to get slower or just </v>

1665
01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:46.791
<v Speaker 1>your Chin is opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1666
01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>actually talked to chocolate Dell about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this case.</v>

1667
01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of to what Chuck said is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that first of all,</v>

1668
01:14:52.271 --> 01:14:56.440
<v Speaker 1>chuck was legendary for his ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a punch land touchable.</v>

1669
01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just was tough as fuck.</v>

1670
01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:02.350
<v Speaker 1>He would bite down on his mouthpiece and</v>
<v Speaker 1>swing at,</v>

1671
01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Alistair overeem and him fought in </v>

1672
01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.700
<v Speaker 1>pride in the Grand Prix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two.</v>

1673
01:15:08.701 --> 01:15:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200,</v>

1674
01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:13.060
<v Speaker 1>three pound Grand Prix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think their version of it,</v>

1675
01:15:13.061 --> 01:15:18.061
<v Speaker 1>they didn't call it light heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they called it middleweight and </v>

1676
01:15:18.061 --> 01:15:20.530
<v Speaker 1>allister put it on him in that first </v>
<v Speaker 1>round man tagged him.</v>

1677
01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:25.690
<v Speaker 1>He didn't with some vicious shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but chuck Liddell just gritted down and </v>

1678
01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:30.211
<v Speaker 1>eventually cracked out there with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overhand right and had them wobbled and </v>

1679
01:15:30.211 --> 01:15:30.460
<v Speaker 1>then jumped all over him and stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1680
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:33.730
<v Speaker 1>If he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other guys would have went down</v>

1681
01:15:33.731 --> 01:15:34.820
<v Speaker 1>in that first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1682
01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:38.260
<v Speaker 1>chuck was just so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't stop him.</v>

1683
01:15:38.261 --> 01:15:42.580
<v Speaker 1>His mind was so strong he was coming at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and he was so determined and what he</v>

1684
01:15:42.581 --> 01:15:47.581
<v Speaker 1>said was that his body recognized that </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mind was going to make it take more </v>

1685
01:15:49.121 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 1>damage so it's body would shut off.</v>

1686
01:15:52.150 --> 01:15:55.870
<v Speaker 1>His consciousness would actually shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself off because it starts to evolve.</v>

1687
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.680
<v Speaker 1>It had known that this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this leads to damage.</v>

1688
01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:02.740
<v Speaker 1>When you get hit like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you let this guy drive you,</v>

1689
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:06.010
<v Speaker 1>he's going to keep going until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheels fall off and he'll,</v>

1690
01:16:06.011 --> 01:16:08.620
<v Speaker 1>he'll take 100 shots to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just deliver one,</v>

1691
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.690
<v Speaker 1>and then you got to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that.</v>

1692
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:14.470
<v Speaker 1>So the body would shut itself off early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need to be getting.</v>

1693
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.840
<v Speaker 1>You get tagged and your brain just says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1694
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Check please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just wants to shut you off.</v>

1695
01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look in like chuck's this last</v>

1696
01:16:23.501 --> 01:16:24.980
<v Speaker 1>fight with rich Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1697
01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.640
<v Speaker 1>perfect example because he looks in </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous shape.</v>

1698
01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.190
<v Speaker 1>He looks fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's really ripped.</v>

1699
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:35.550
<v Speaker 1>His wife is a fitness enthusiast and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>got him like eating healthy and wearing </v>

1700
01:16:35.951 --> 01:16:40.951
<v Speaker 1>a like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a heart rate monitor and doing all this </v>

1701
01:16:40.951 --> 01:16:44.131
<v Speaker 1>shit that he'd never done before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy's calories every day and eating </v>

1702
01:16:44.131 --> 01:16:45.040
<v Speaker 1>really healthy foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he got in super good shape,</v>

1703
01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:47.170
<v Speaker 1>so he was down for this rich Franklin </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

1704
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.380
<v Speaker 1>broke rich Franklin's arm with a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick in the first round,</v>

1705
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:54.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe rich Franklin fucked going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that round and chuck is just going after</v>

1706
01:16:54.971 --> 01:16:59.200
<v Speaker 1>him and he gets clipped with a punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>that five years ago he would have ate it</v>

1707
01:16:59.201 --> 01:16:59.920
<v Speaker 1>like a cookie.</v>

1708
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:03.040
<v Speaker 1>He would have just ate that punch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking swing done it,</v>

1709
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's his brain said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>

1710
01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:10.021
<v Speaker 1>please just shut them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was literally not a case of </v>

1711
01:17:10.021 --> 01:17:12.800
<v Speaker 1>ability and not a case of will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in case of his,</v>

1712
01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:17.900
<v Speaker 1>his just take too many shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what happens according to him </v>

1713
01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:18.800
<v Speaker 1>and chuck and he would know better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

1714
01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:20.290
<v Speaker 1>What makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very honest about it.</v>

1715
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Then once you have been exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're just done,</v>

1716
01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:27.471
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time probably it was already </v>

1717
01:17:27.471 --> 01:17:27.970
<v Speaker 1>your body and made the decision to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked out of bodies,</v>

1718
01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 1>like just go off anytime it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

1719
01:17:30.231 --> 01:17:35.231
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's the first time or the last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always bad when you get a </v>

1720
01:17:35.231 --> 01:17:35.231
<v Speaker 1>concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never a good concussion,</v>

1721
01:17:35.231 --> 01:17:40.000
<v Speaker 1>but I think it did really varies for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people they can get knocked out a </v>

1722
01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:40.670
<v Speaker 1>few times.</v>

1723
01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For other people it's like one knockout </v>

1724
01:17:45.670 --> 01:17:46.670
<v Speaker 1>could change their entire life and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those.</v>

1725
01:17:46.671 --> 01:17:51.671
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about all the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened and when you were young </v>

1726
01:17:51.671 --> 01:17:51.671
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:52.550
<v Speaker 7>but some people love fucking killing all</v>
<v Speaker 7>the pain.</v>

1842
01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:54.520
<v Speaker 7>One of those and a beer and it's like I </v>
<v Speaker 7>mentioned,</v>

1843
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:59.550
<v Speaker 7>it's a good night.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no way you can impregnate a </v>

1844
01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:00.840
<v Speaker 7>fucking sheep and I can't even believe </v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm looking this up.</v>

1845
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:04.860
<v Speaker 7>I was in the middle of the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing this.</v>

1846
01:23:05.210 --> 01:23:05.930
<v Speaker 7>Just make it up.</v>

1847
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can I say it?</v>

1848
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1849
01:23:07.971 --> 01:23:08.280
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1850
01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:13.600
<v Speaker 3>The third closest vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone said it to me and he's not a </v>

1851
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:13.600
<v Speaker 3>dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what was.</v>

1852
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.520
<v Speaker 3>It was a very successful man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it just whatever we put in there </v>

1853
01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:17.890
<v Speaker 3>fills up a sack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1854
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:21.370
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that people need to stop</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing with shit like this.</v>

1855
01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Just go google it and then tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1856
01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:29.450
<v Speaker 3>know I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't just tell me that a sheep can get </v>

1857
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:31.570
<v Speaker 3>pregnant from a fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Son of a bitch can put this.</v>

1858
01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Apparently this is a very math because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of these questions ever </v>

1859
01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:38.880
<v Speaker 3>all over this.</v>

1860
01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:43.920
<v Speaker 3>While humans can impregnate apes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cannot impregnate.</v>

1861
01:23:43.921 --> 01:23:45.860
<v Speaker 3>She'd gotten pregnant apes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1862
01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:47.240
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Backed that up?</v>

1863
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:49.360
<v Speaker 3>Fuck back that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1864
01:23:49.361 --> 01:23:50.440
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can the human.</v>

1865
01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:53.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that humanity.</v>

1866
01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we played that a couple of days ago.</v>

1867
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1868
01:23:57.310 --> 01:24:02.310
<v Speaker 3>the weird chimpanzee that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspected was a hybrid they thought of </v>

1869
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 3>because he walked straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had like a hairless face.</v>

1870
01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:06.510
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really unusual.</v>

1871
01:24:06.511 --> 01:24:07.080
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1872
01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just so fucked up champ.</v>

1873
01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:12.530
<v Speaker 3>Just like a bunch of wacky things going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on with its,</v>

1874
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.910
<v Speaker 3>with its genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you looked at it,</v>

1875
01:24:14.911 --> 01:24:17.180
<v Speaker 3>it was really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've never seen seen that humanity.</v>

1876
01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Oliver's name's Oliver Post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Face up,</v>

1877
01:24:19.691 --> 01:24:24.691
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so you can a human and I'll look </v>

1878
01:24:24.691 --> 01:24:24.691
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can a human in pregnant an ape?</v>

1879
01:24:24.691 --> 01:24:26.200
<v Speaker 3>What's his name again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oliver.</v>

1880
01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:31.300
<v Speaker 3>The commands that humanity can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human and pregnant and a I say no,</v>

1881
01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.700
<v Speaker 3>I say someone was wrong.</v>

1882
01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:36.220
<v Speaker 3>That seems like it shouldn't be allowed </v>
<v Speaker 3>by nature.</v>

1883
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:39.880
<v Speaker 3>They had to work really hard to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>donkey and a fucking horse together.</v>

1884
01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like they tried to do it in the</v>

1885
01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:45.640
<v Speaker 3>19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who did?</v>

1886
01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the issue to chimpanzees.</v>

1887
01:24:48.071 --> 01:24:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Have the United States government did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1888
01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:53.150
<v Speaker 3>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks like Jeff Scott.</v>

1889
01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:54.930
<v Speaker 3>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1890
01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:56.280
<v Speaker 3>That's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gray,</v>

1891
01:24:56.281 --> 01:24:58.030
<v Speaker 3>the black and white one because it was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago.</v>

1892
01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Look at his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>

1893
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:05.070
<v Speaker 3>It's got no hair on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a hard one too because it's a </v>

1894
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.290
<v Speaker 3>closer look at the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that one.</v>

1895
01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:06.550
<v Speaker 3>The far left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The far left.</v>

1896
01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Far left up above that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.870
<v Speaker 3>Looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looks like a monkey to right.</v>

1898
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.370
<v Speaker 3>That looks like someone put glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not real though,</v>

1899
01:25:15.371 --> 01:25:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took.</v>

1900
01:25:16.181 --> 01:25:18.310
<v Speaker 3>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's the black guy?</v>

1901
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:21.220
<v Speaker 3>He makes other movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimps have 48 chromosomes.</v>

1902
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:23.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes like a one movie.</v>

1903
01:25:23.381 --> 01:25:24.070
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyler Perry.</v>

1904
01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Tyler Perry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimps have 48 chromosomes in,</v>

1905
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.610
<v Speaker 3>humans have 46,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it really doesn't make sense.</v>

1906
01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Apparently that they could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could mate.</v>

1907
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:36.100
<v Speaker 3>So if a fetus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horses and donkeys at the same amount of</v>

1908
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.490
<v Speaker 3>chromosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about tigers and lions?</v>

1909
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:44.940
<v Speaker 3>What the chromosome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All Tigers and lions can make that </v>

1910
01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:44.940
<v Speaker 3>become a lagger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1911
01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The laggers are barren,</v>

1912
01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:47.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1913
01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Same with mule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking to horse.</v>

1914
01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times hybrids can't breed for </v>

1915
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:55.750
<v Speaker 3>some strange reason because God says no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God says you're going to go around me so</v>

1916
01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:57.520
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucked up Mr.</v>

1917

<v Speaker 3>Rock Bass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wore a diaper all day on Tuesday,</v>

1918
01:26:00.461 --> 01:26:02.950
<v Speaker 3>son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How that just shit in it.</v>

1919
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1920
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.790
<v Speaker 3>I pissed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1921
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:09.970
<v Speaker 3>and that felt weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pooped in my and yeah,</v>

1922

<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1923
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1924
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:14.360
<v Speaker 3>depends on what they make them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like underwear looking now.</v>

1925
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:16.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really great.</v>

1926
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.460
<v Speaker 3>I pooped and then went to target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1928
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:25.390

<v Speaker 3>So apparently they tried to make like a,</v>

1929
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:30.590
<v Speaker 3>an ape pregnant with human sperm and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to do it.</v>

1930
01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 3>And the 19 twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't work.</v>

1931
01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Doing using artificial insemination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to do it.</v>

1932
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Fox,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Moreau shit out there.</v>

1934

<v Speaker 3>Half Champ.</v>

1935
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be okay with that.</v>

1936
01:26:45.710 --> 01:26:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Would you be okay with like taking a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip to go watch them?</v>

1937
01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Security like machine guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israeli Mossad.</v>

<v Speaker 3>think of giant plexiglass wall.</v>

1942
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Watching from watching them that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like having to hate you and hate </v>

<v Speaker 3>makeup.</v>

1950
01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:27.290
<v Speaker 3>That was a remake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Goldblum was a bad motherfucker.</v>

1951
01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:30.230
<v Speaker 3>He was such a bad motherfucker that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about his version of the fly,</v>

1989
01:29:06.721 --> 01:29:09.270
<v Speaker 7>but with the next generation where they </v>

<v Speaker 7>this just kind of like the remote </v>
<v Speaker 7>control for the ship.</v>

2005
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:43.740
<v Speaker 7>I thought in his quarters.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I do not remember ever seeing anybody </v>

2011
01:29:58.731 --> 01:30:02.781
<v Speaker 7>going online,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I guess that would be implied if </v>

<v Speaker 7>their funding was on tap.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>They're all messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So good.</v>

2071
01:32:56.291 --> 01:33:01.291
<v Speaker 7>And the overwhelming consensus says that</v>
<v Speaker 7>the iphone five battery life is way </v>

2072
01:33:01.541 --> 01:33:06.541
<v Speaker 7>worse than the iphone four.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It seems like they're doing major </v>

2073
01:33:06.541 --> 01:33:07.410
<v Speaker 7>complaints.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Brought a lot of complaints online.</v>

2074
01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that have actually tested it and </v>

2075
01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:13.160
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to have the same</v>

2076
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:14.180
<v Speaker 7>battery.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2077
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:15.550
<v Speaker 7>the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>

2078
01:33:15.551 --> 01:33:16.360
<v Speaker 7>the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2079
01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:20.560
<v Speaker 7>with verizon is the lte.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you're on the lte.</v>

2080
01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:23.260
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you use any internet on the lte,</v>

2081
01:33:23.261 --> 01:33:28.261
<v Speaker 7>that shit will burn battery stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Burns it ltd on my 10 son of a bitch.</v>

2082
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:32.500
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's okay.</v>

2083
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:34.660
<v Speaker 7>It's definitely worse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Battery life.</v>

2084
01:33:34.810 --> 01:33:37.720
<v Speaker 7>I guess it's a better camera.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's doesn't inspire me as much.</v>

2085
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:38.630
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2086
01:33:38.710 --> 01:33:41.380
<v Speaker 7>there's something good to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a good camera when people ask me if</v>

2087
01:33:41.381 --> 01:33:42.040
<v Speaker 7>they should get it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

2088
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:47.070
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean you don't need it if you really </v>

2089
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:47.070
<v Speaker 7>need a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but don't upgrade isn't worth that much.</v>

2090
01:33:47.610 --> 01:33:48.470
<v Speaker 7>So here's the,</v>

2091
01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:52.460
<v Speaker 4>here's the actual Gizmodo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a battery life for the iphone five,</v>

2092
01:33:52.461 --> 01:33:57.110
<v Speaker 4>iphone four s and for a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty much out of here.</v>

2093
01:33:57.111 --> 01:33:58.840
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2094
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.520
<v Speaker 4>it's a pop up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about eight hours.</v>

2095
01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:03.220
<v Speaker 4>Talk for the five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the four ss,</v>

2096
01:34:03.230 --> 01:34:05.390
<v Speaker 4>eight hours talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The four is seven.</v>

2097
01:34:05.690 --> 01:34:08.870
<v Speaker 4>And then for the iphone five for on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>web is eight hours.</v>

2098
01:34:08.871 --> 01:34:10.610
<v Speaker 4>The four es,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six hours,</v>

2099
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the iphone four is six hours.</v>

2100
01:34:12.921 --> 01:34:15.920
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe it's because it keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>searching for the Wifi,</v>

2101
01:34:15.921 --> 01:34:18.080
<v Speaker 4>it's 10 to nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you right now,</v>

2102
01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:23.260

<v Speaker 4>service?</v>

2104
01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:24.000
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but even when I'm out I,</v>

2105
01:34:24.001 --> 01:34:26.380
<v Speaker 7>it goes down faster,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but my apartment.</v>

2106
01:34:28.410 --> 01:34:29.870
<v Speaker 7>Here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's another issue.</v>

2107
01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:31.840
<v Speaker 7>The same with the four in the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And hold on,</v>

2108
01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:34.540
<v Speaker 7>there's an apple update.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you,</v>

2109
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 7>or if you've been updating your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you update your address for optics?</v>

2110
01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:40.430
<v Speaker 7>But do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you have whenever that.</v>

2111
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:41.760
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because uh,</v>

2112
01:34:41.761 --> 01:34:46.761
<v Speaker 7>there was an update to update,</v>
<v Speaker 7>made a significant impact on the </v>

2113
01:34:46.761 --> 01:34:48.570
<v Speaker 7>batteries already lives in a place I </v>
<v Speaker 7>lived there with the four.</v>

2114
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.880
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that I wouldn't notice a difference.</v>

2115
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:52.540
<v Speaker 7>You are still in the same spot </v>
<v Speaker 7>connecting</v>

2116
01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:57.540
<v Speaker 4>to a different network or connecting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lte instead of connecting to the older </v>

2117
01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:59.540
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>G meaning there's three g everywhere.</v>

2118
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:04.750
<v Speaker 4>There's not as much lte everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you take your phone off lte and put </v>

2119
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:08.861
<v Speaker 4>it on three g,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you'll have the similar battery </v>

2120
01:35:08.861 --> 01:35:11.321
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're living in a place where it's </v>

2121
01:35:11.321 --> 01:35:11.321
<v Speaker 4>constantly searching for</v>

2122
01:35:11.321 --> 01:35:12.000
<v Speaker 1>la though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when I go out though,</v>

2123
01:35:12.001 --> 01:35:12.460
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2124
01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:13.480

01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I have to take what I said back is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the Ios.</v>

2126
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:20.400
<v Speaker 1>It was killing the IPAD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it is.</v>

2127
01:35:20.630 --> 01:35:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2128
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:23.760
<v Speaker 1>it is iphone five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone five and ipad mini.</v>

2129
01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:26.250
<v Speaker 1>They were both having a problem with Ios</v>
<v Speaker 1>six point.</v>

2130
01:35:26.251 --> 01:35:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a,</v>

2131
01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:33.750
<v Speaker 1>it was a killing the battery life that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>never changed right away.</v>

2132
01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I always let some shit sit out there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile when people start complaining and</v>

2133
01:35:37.081 --> 01:35:39.200
<v Speaker 1>then they fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can get it.</v>

2134
01:35:39.210 --> 01:35:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I do find it amazing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed more fuck in the system.</v>

2135
01:35:42.391 --> 01:35:47.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly coming up with new </v>

2136
01:35:47.391 --> 01:35:47.391
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>

2138
01:35:47.461 --> 01:35:49.350
<v Speaker 1>And I think the iphone five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not,</v>

2139
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:54.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're being a bunch of whiny </v>

2140
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.470
<v Speaker 1>cons.</v>

2141
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:55.230
<v Speaker 1>It's still a fucking amazing phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2147
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:08.250
<v Speaker 1>it's faster,</v>

<v Speaker 1>images or if they said because people </v>

2150
01:36:14.811 --> 01:36:18.621

2154
01:36:27.621 --> 01:36:27.960
<v Speaker 1>could just put on my earphones press </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could download three,</v>

2155
01:36:27.961 --> 01:36:32.961
<v Speaker 1>four megabytes on an email attachment </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that with lte and watch it.</v>

2156
01:36:33.330 --> 01:36:35.580
<v Speaker 1>It's way faster than just regular three </v>
<v Speaker 1>g,</v>

2157
01:36:35.581 --> 01:36:40.581
<v Speaker 1>it's just way faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that would take like four </v>

2158
01:36:40.581 --> 01:36:40.581
<v Speaker 1>times as long and I'm not even exactly</v>

2159
01:36:40.581 --> 01:36:42.830
<v Speaker 4>and it's a great hot spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I have my,</v>

2160
01:36:42.831 --> 01:36:44.650
<v Speaker 4>like my,</v>

<v Speaker 4>hot hotspot.</v>

2162
01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:52.320

<v Speaker 4>which is like Dsl or faster Internet on </v>

2163

2164
01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:57.250

2165
01:36:57.410 --> 01:37:02.410
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to getting online or when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to looking at movies or even </v>

2166
01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:03.570
<v Speaker 1>looking at pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't fuck with those.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I remember those days when you wore </v>
<v Speaker 1>those pants.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2186
01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:55.680
<v Speaker 1>do they the</v>

2187
01:37:57.750 --> 01:38:00.840
<v Speaker 3>phone version of the IPAD mini yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or?</v>

2188
01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:01.580
<v Speaker 3>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets on.</v>

2189
01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:04.620
<v Speaker 3>So when my phone says lte and when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>says four G,</v>

2190
01:38:04.621 --> 01:38:06.210
<v Speaker 3>which one's moving faster?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lte.</v>

2191
01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what doesn't get that money is </v>

2192
01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 3>potts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the deal?</v>

2193
01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not where you live in,</v>

2194
01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:12.420
<v Speaker 3>around Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right here.</v>

2195
01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:17.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would it get it in Hollywood where </v>

2196
01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:17.540
<v Speaker 3>there's a billion people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2197
01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Why have good service there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2198
01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:22.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like Anthony Bourdain is convinced </v>
<v Speaker 3>that China's going to overtake the earth</v>

2199
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:23.770
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2200
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:28.850
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their work ethic and the way they get </v>

2201
01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:28.850
<v Speaker 3>shit done and how quickly they get shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

2202
01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:28.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like really ever seen anything like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2203
01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:34.100
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be out in the middle of a </v>

2204
01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:34.100
<v Speaker 3>fucking massive forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No people anywhere in sight.</v>

2205
01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Five bars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2206
01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:40.940
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get cell phone signals everywhere </v>

2207
01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:43.131
<v Speaker 3>and they put up a city and like a week </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to throw up a city and they're </v>

2208
01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.140
<v Speaker 3>just going crazy over everything.</v>

2209
01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Industrious worker ants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they think?</v>

2210
01:38:46.951 --> 01:38:51.951
<v Speaker 3>It's like a the world of warcraft where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just build up your area and don't </v>

2211
01:38:51.951 --> 01:38:51.951
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when you do attack it,</v>

2212
01:38:51.951 --> 01:38:53.920
<v Speaker 3>like what other people are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed by?</v>

2213
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he just came over here on boats would</v>

2214
01:38:56.581 --> 01:39:01.581
<v Speaker 3>be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If China wanted to destroy the United </v>

2215
01:39:01.581 --> 01:39:05.120
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll let us do is get every Chinese </v>

2216
01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.060
<v Speaker 3>person from China come over to America </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just start walking.</v>

2217
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:10.050
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do is walk across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire continent.</v>

2218
01:39:10.051 --> 01:39:11.280
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gonna arrest everybody.</v>

2219
01:39:11.281 --> 01:39:16.281
<v Speaker 3>You don't have the resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would overwhelm us just by sheer </v>

2220
01:39:16.281 --> 01:39:19.791
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How soon before the Chinese Americans </v>

2221
01:39:19.791 --> 01:39:19.791
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>

2222
01:39:19.791 --> 01:39:19.791
<v Speaker 3>let's just torn up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell.</v>

2223
01:39:19.791 --> 01:39:22.220
<v Speaker 3>They would learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chinese gets some of those folks.</v>

2224
01:39:22.221 --> 01:39:24.210
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't blame them with those Rosetta</v>
<v Speaker 3>stones.</v>

2225
01:39:24.211 --> 01:39:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried to use that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever tried to learn a language?</v>

2226
01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm downloading this stuff and </v>

2227
01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:33.270
<v Speaker 3>they've never listened to it many times </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard.</v>

2228
01:39:33.271 --> 01:39:36.090
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speak Hebrew.</v>

2229
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:37.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can understand a little bit,</v>

2230
01:39:37.831 --> 01:39:39.060
<v Speaker 3>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't be.</v>

2231
01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:40.380
<v Speaker 3>You used to be fluent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2232
01:39:40.381 --> 01:39:43.410
<v Speaker 3>I can get by basically if you think if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you went back to Israel,</v>

2233
01:39:43.411 --> 01:39:45.110
<v Speaker 3>you would like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>notice how I said that.</v>

2234
01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.790
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say Israel as Israel.</v>

2235
01:39:48.230 --> 01:39:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you went back there with you,</v>

2236
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:51.420
<v Speaker 3>how long would it take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think?</v>

2237
01:39:51.421 --> 01:39:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Before you could be fluent again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to leave like Jerusalem.</v>

2238
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

2239
01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Because how many English speakers are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerusalem?</v>

2240
01:39:59.041 --> 01:40:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real.</v>

2241
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're almost all center of town </v>

2242
01:40:06.010 --> 01:40:06.010
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every business owner knows English.</v>

2243
01:40:06.010 --> 01:40:07.080
<v Speaker 3>You cannot get by without it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really know.</v>

2244
01:40:07.081 --> 01:40:08.640
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's silly to try not to.</v>

2245
01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Is the tourist trade over there big?</v>

2246
01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:16.100
<v Speaker 3>What is a fucking tourists director for </v>
<v Speaker 3>his big potter really hurts him for </v>

2247
01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:16.100
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For him to spend some money.</v>

2248
01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:18.960
<v Speaker 3>People really took a plummet this most </v>
<v Speaker 3>recent.</v>

2249
01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.780
<v Speaker 3>The Intifada?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2250
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.290
<v Speaker 3>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

2251
01:40:22.291 --> 01:40:24.270
<v Speaker 3>Intifada or uprising?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The uprising.</v>

2252
01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:26.700
<v Speaker 3>The Palestinian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve years now.</v>

2253
01:40:26.701 --> 01:40:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That and that,</v>

2254
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:33.350
<v Speaker 3>that constant threat of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably recovered from </v>

2255
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:34.040
<v Speaker 3>there since the beginnings of it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last few years,</v>

2256
01:40:34.050 --> 01:40:39.050
<v Speaker 3>been more peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they could just keep a little fake </v>

2257
01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:41.841
<v Speaker 3>violence going on and keep people out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a good move in terms of </v>

2258
01:40:41.841 --> 01:40:44.080
<v Speaker 3>like those people that would go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Christian missionary types that</v>

2259
01:40:44.370 --> 01:40:46.830
<v Speaker 3>settles in the settlements when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>lucky to keep building new settlements.</v>

2260
01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Those are the Americans coming over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really the Americans that they're like,</v>

2261
01:40:49.831 --> 01:40:54.831
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to help reclaim the land of </v>

2262
01:40:54.831 --> 01:40:54.831
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all those fucking Zionists.</v>

2263
01:40:54.831 --> 01:40:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go back.</v>

2264
01:40:55.450 --> 01:40:58.570
<v Speaker 3>So the Americans come over and they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help reclaim Israel.</v>

2265
01:40:58.571 --> 01:41:00.760
<v Speaker 3>So they're settling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where in the,</v>

2266
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:06.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>argued lands and whose side are they on </v>

2267
01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Israel's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're coming over,</v>

2268
01:41:06.821 --> 01:41:08.560
<v Speaker 3>they landed and they want to live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>

2269
01:41:08.561 --> 01:41:09.880
<v Speaker 3>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is part of Israel.</v>

2270
01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.980
<v Speaker 3>And the way we can show that by building</v>
<v Speaker 3>a house right here.</v>

2271
01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2315
01:43:02.551 --> 01:43:02.551
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

01:43:10.241 --> 01:43:15.241
<v Speaker 3>There were supposed to do the robot </v>
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse movie and apparently pulled </v>

2321
01:43:15.241 --> 01:43:15.241
<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>

2322
01:43:15.241 --> 01:43:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Spielberg did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2323
01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:21.320
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he doesn't want allowed </v>

2324
01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.650
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse and his movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his version of the world is everything </v>

2325
01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:22.650

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's that.</v>

2327
01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably that he's tired.</v>

2328
01:43:26.081 --> 01:43:31.081
<v Speaker 3>The guy just got done doing lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a huge movie that took forever </v>

2329
01:43:31.081 --> 01:43:31.870
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't going to do an apocalypse.</v>

2330
01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2331
01:43:33.021 --> 01:43:34.390
<v Speaker 3>he's a science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So science fiction,</v>

2332
01:43:34.391 --> 01:43:36.790
<v Speaker 3>fucking movie dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robot apocalypse.</v>

2333
01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.840
<v Speaker 3>How would they get to do that and still </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep that worldview of like,</v>

2334
01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:41.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be okay because in the end,</v>

2335
01:43:41.891 --> 01:43:43.940
<v Speaker 3>the good guys probably when.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2336
01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:49.020
<v Speaker 3>maybe that'd be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we walk out of there feeling good </v>

2337
01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:49.020
<v Speaker 3>about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

2338
01:43:49.710 --> 01:43:51.070
<v Speaker 3>So they always hated about his movies.</v>

2339
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting that you say </v>

2340
01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:56.980
<v Speaker 1>that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2341
01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:01.270
<v Speaker 1>some of the choices that he made his </v>
<v Speaker 1>early is early movies you said he would </v>

2342
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.270
<v Speaker 1>never make now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2343
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:05.920

<v Speaker 1>like in close encounters of the third </v>

2344
01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:05.920
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember when Richard Dreyfus leaves</v>

2345
01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:07.670
<v Speaker 1>his family to go with the aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he would never do that.</v>

2346
01:44:07.671 --> 01:44:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Now he would say family's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

2347
01:44:09.321 --> 01:44:10.680
<v Speaker 1>He's to stay with his family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2348
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:13.090
<v Speaker 1>That's something a single guy would </v>

<v Speaker 1>It would be a fucking mess.</v>

2365
01:44:45.461 --> 01:44:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the experiences that he </v>

2366
01:44:49.110 --> 01:44:50.471
<v Speaker 1>had with them in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like they were a bundle of </v>

2367
01:44:50.471 --> 01:44:50.471
<v Speaker 1>joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so excited to go with them.</v>

2368
01:44:50.471 --> 01:44:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they have better ipads.</v>

2369
01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

2372
01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:57.000

<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2373
01:44:57.001 --> 01:45:02.001
<v Speaker 1>Why would they want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck would you want to go and </v>

2374
01:45:02.001 --> 01:45:02.001
<v Speaker 1>party with aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're little knock into them.</v>

2375
01:45:02.001 --> 01:45:06.881
<v Speaker 1>They fall down immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably heads crack open because </v>

2376
01:45:06.881 --> 01:45:07.270
<v Speaker 1>they're these giant heads coming out </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to violence at all.</v>

2377
01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:09.230
<v Speaker 1>They're probably super soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2378
01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.630
<v Speaker 1>just you could accidentally break them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

2379
01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:11.790
<v Speaker 1>All</v>

2380
01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:16.860
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now all it Spielberg movies were like </v>

2381
01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:16.860
<v Speaker 7>happy endings.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You only wants Schindler's list,</v>

2382
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:18.110
<v Speaker 7>but he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He did.</v>

2383
01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:21.690
<v Speaker 7>It was a fucking holocaust movie and he </v>
<v Speaker 7>still talks about overcoming and meeting</v>

2384
01:45:21.691 --> 01:45:23.310
<v Speaker 7>all these survivors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2385
01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:27.000
<v Speaker 7>He managed to do that no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but no one left the schindler's list.</v>

2386
01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:32.180
<v Speaker 7>That was the great happy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You think that saving private Ryan was </v>

2387
01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:35.571
<v Speaker 7>cute at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was kind of sweet at the end with a </v>

2388
01:45:35.571 --> 01:45:35.930
<v Speaker 7>guy who's got his family there with </v>
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

2389
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:40.160
<v Speaker 7>It's all supporting the fact that he's </v>
<v Speaker 7>spent his life.</v>

2390
01:45:40.330 --> 01:45:43.970
<v Speaker 7>Does he fucking goes over stuff and just</v>
<v Speaker 7>rewrite it so that he can.</v>

2393

<v Speaker 7>everything okay.</v>

2394
01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:56.511
<v Speaker 7>Even fucking the robot movie where he's </v>

01:46:46.330 --> 01:46:49.400
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who was that don't know.</v>

2416
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:49.990

2417
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Didn't momento no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did ai though.</v>

2418
01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:55.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a good one.</v>

2419
01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a good one.</v>

2420
01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant director,</v>

2421
01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:01.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys that uh,</v>

2422
01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:04.670
<v Speaker 1>they get older and they just get kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>softer.</v>

2423
01:47:04.671 --> 01:47:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Like George Lucas or conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just more conservative,</v>

2424
01:47:08.151 --> 01:47:11.460
<v Speaker 1>but they lose their vitality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2425
01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:15.270
<v Speaker 1>there's no spark inside of their work </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2426
01:47:15.271 --> 01:47:17.690
<v Speaker 1>It's so very strange thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some folks.</v>

2427
01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.610
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with George Carlin,</v>

2428
01:47:19.611 --> 01:47:24.611
<v Speaker 1>it never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was fucking grind and get out </v>

2429
01:47:24.611 --> 01:47:24.611
<v Speaker 1>to the day he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys,</v>

2430
01:47:24.611 --> 01:47:27.980
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some guys they get better in time.</v>

2431
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Clint Terentino's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not slowing down.</v>

2432
01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:35.770

<v Speaker 1>That django movie was a real fucking </v>

01:47:35.770 --> 01:47:39.290
<v Speaker 1>movie and with real crazy ass dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten by dogs.</v>

2434
01:47:40.190 --> 01:47:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Crazy ass fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not slowing down at all,</v>

2435
01:47:43.581 --> 01:47:44.630
<v Speaker 1>but something happens to.</v>

2436
01:47:44.630 --> 01:47:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were they just becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>pausing Lucas.</v>

2437
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Here's the worst worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd go back and we'll watch star wars </v>

2438
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:58.091
<v Speaker 1>one at the time in the error when I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a fucking masterpiece.</v>

2439
01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.520
<v Speaker 1>She's peckish now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cheesy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Even if I was six,</v>

2442
01:48:04.221 --> 01:48:09.221
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this should be Jonesville </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad or that the latest one.</v>

2443
01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:10.200

<v Speaker 1>That good</v>

2449
01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:25.430
<v Speaker 7>students were coming onto them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Snakes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>professor guy to be in someone's dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

2455
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost it all.</v>

2456
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere along the line he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's who's,</v>

2457
01:48:46.330 --> 01:48:50.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

01:48:50.110 --> 01:48:51.580
<v Speaker 1>now he's like someone's Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2459
01:48:51.581 --> 01:48:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rascally the kids.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just here to get that crystal scroll</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you back to the early one.</v>

2461
01:48:57.581 --> 01:49:02.581
<v Speaker 1>We had a runaway from fucking giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>boulders that were set his traps and </v>

2462
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:05.410
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to get these artifacts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one was great and making a new</v>

2463
01:49:05.411 --> 01:49:05.620
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2464
01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:07.420
<v Speaker 7>One five,</v>
<v Speaker 7>five.</v>

2465
01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:12.520
<v Speaker 7>I'm glad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At least they got star wars away from </v>

2466
01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:12.520
<v Speaker 7>Lucas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2467
01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:12.870
<v Speaker 7>they gave it to Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What are they going to do with it?</v>

2468
01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:17.900
<v Speaker 7>They're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe rapunzel is going to be in star </v>

2469
01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:17.900
<v Speaker 7>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's going to have.</v>

2470
01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:23.580
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at least the creature could be theater </v>

2471
01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:23.580
<v Speaker 7>like the would be adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't you have this idea that like,</v>

2472
01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:24.650
<v Speaker 7>well they can't fuck it up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

2473
01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:26.430
<v Speaker 7>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They can't mess it up completely,</v>

2474
01:49:26.431 --> 01:49:27.240
<v Speaker 7>but then you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2475
01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.250
<v Speaker 7>just property to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They can do whatever they want to.</v>

2476
01:49:29.610 --> 01:49:31.140
<v Speaker 7>They could ever puzzle in there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2477
01:49:31.141 --> 01:49:36.141
<v Speaker 7>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They could do whatever the fuck they </v>

2478
01:49:36.141 --> 01:49:36.141
<v Speaker 7>wanted and be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing we could do about it.</v>

2479
01:49:36.141 --> 01:49:40.310
<v Speaker 7>I'm worried about Pixar lost in star </v>
<v Speaker 7>wars with flying to the galaxy and </v>

2480
01:49:43.981 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 7>they're just going to Indiana Jones </v>
<v Speaker 7>popping out of their fucking helmets.</v>

2481
01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.440
<v Speaker 1>You Imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoda gets together with Mickey and </v>

2482
01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.171
<v Speaker 1>teaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mickey had a fight and then it's like </v>

2483
01:49:58.171 --> 01:49:58.171
<v Speaker 1>the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was the,</v>

2484
01:49:58.171 --> 01:50:02.191
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sword was the sorcerer in his </v>

2485
01:50:02.191 --> 01:50:02.191
<v Speaker 1>apprentice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorcerer's apprentice.</v>

2486
01:50:02.191 --> 01:50:02.191
<v Speaker 1>Was that as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2487
01:50:02.191 --> 01:50:04.060
<v Speaker 1>the Mickey Mouse one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2488
01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Sorcerer's apprentice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2489
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was that what it's called?</v>

2490
01:50:06.221 --> 01:50:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Fantasia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantasia musical.</v>

2491
01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking amazing little piece of </v>

2492
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

2493
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:13.420
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2494
01:50:13.421 --> 01:50:17.350
<v Speaker 1>about a magician's apprentice who fucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and everything goes terribly wrong.</v>

2495
01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what it does really?</v>

2496
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what we can do now.</v>

2497
01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Look at where we can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could that be any different?</v>

2498
01:50:24.881 --> 01:50:27.640
<v Speaker 1>If he was hanging out with Yoda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was hanging out with Yoda and it'd</v>

2499
01:50:27.641 --> 01:50:29.080
<v Speaker 1>be like very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2500
01:50:29.081 --> 01:50:30.820
<v Speaker 1>like he would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoda would tell him,</v>

2501
01:50:30.821 --> 01:50:32.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to force,</v>

2502
01:50:32.261 --> 01:50:34.840
<v Speaker 1>you must,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he would go off and fuck up and</v>

2503
01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:35.990
<v Speaker 1>turn everything into a river.</v>

2504
01:50:36.710 --> 01:50:41.240
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Add Yoga or add yoga.</v>

<v Speaker 3>other people find just so rude or it's </v>

2764
02:03:11.801 --> 02:03:12.670
<v Speaker 3>funny when you see a guy like Mike </v>
<v Speaker 3>holtzman character,</v>

2765
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:17.210
<v Speaker 3>you immediately start laughing at when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see and then they'll go on stage and</v>

2766
02:03:17.211 --> 02:03:22.211
<v Speaker 3>you'll see people not get it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Understand that it's an act and get </v>

02:03:22.211 --> 02:03:26.381
<v Speaker 3>like super offended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we were in the front of the comedy </v>

<v Speaker 3>ourselves,</v>

2771
02:03:29.751 --> 02:03:32.960

<v Speaker 3>away from that man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>indulging him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is Shut your fucking mouth.</v>

2776

<v Speaker 3>Wasn't even that.</v>

2779
02:03:50.841 --> 02:03:52.970
<v Speaker 3>He was doing something about Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long blowers.</v>

2780
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.400
<v Speaker 3>I put a booger in somebody's drink this </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

2781
02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:01.360
<v Speaker 3>She left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to cut her off and like this </v>

2782
02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:01.430
<v Speaker 3>girl is already more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>James says right off the bat,</v>

2783
02:04:01.431 --> 02:04:04.190
<v Speaker 3>she's already too drunk and then she </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts to orient the audience.</v>

2784
02:04:04.191 --> 02:04:06.360
<v Speaker 3>See you put put a bug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2785
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:08.530
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She went to the bathroom.</v>

2786
02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:10.490
<v Speaker 3>That place closed down to the health </v>
<v Speaker 3>violations.</v>

2787
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:14.480
<v Speaker 3>People eat your boogers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her friends saw you were a grown man.</v>

2788
02:04:14.481 --> 02:04:15.380
<v Speaker 3>You in your thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't.</v>

2789
02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:16.910
<v Speaker 3>People eat your boogers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drink,</v>

2790
02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:19.540
<v Speaker 3>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My blogger friends saw it was.</v>

2791
02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:21.080
<v Speaker 3>She's speaking to a point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2792
02:04:21.081 --> 02:04:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving you the chance to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>before me.</v>

2793
02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you think she just swallowed it or do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think she felt it and was aware?</v>

2794
02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:26.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think just swallowed it.</v>

2795
02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:30.350
<v Speaker 3>Probably didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably don't know if you really fucked</v>

2796
02:04:30.351 --> 02:04:34.400
<v Speaker 3>up because people can understand once </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're drunk.</v>

2797
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:38.380
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to keep drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You be in a good place already.</v>

2798
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:39.680
<v Speaker 3>You do if you have demons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ari?</v>

2799
02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>

2800
02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:42.270
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maintain.</v>

2801
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.450
<v Speaker 3>You're assuming that people drink to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a good time.</v>

2802
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:47.340
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't drink to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good time.</v>

2803
02:04:47.370 --> 02:04:50.130
<v Speaker 3>They drink to get fucked up because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to escape reality.</v>

2804
02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's also a good time for it.</v>

2805
02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:53.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's escape reality,</v>

2806
02:04:53.131 --> 02:04:56.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like whatever I drank to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get drunk wasn't escaping anything.</v>

2807
02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.770
<v Speaker 3>He'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd been to logical since.</v>

2808
02:04:58.771 --> 02:05:02.430
<v Speaker 3>When have you liked the average person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see it running,</v>

2809
02:05:03.170 --> 02:05:05.400
<v Speaker 3>like in college and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>

2810
02:05:05.401 --> 02:05:08.760
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to drink so you do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's new.</v>

2811
02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Not every college kid is running away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from their demons.</v>

2812
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Most of them aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just getting fucked up.</v>

2813
02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2814
02:05:14.701 --> 02:05:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're learning how to get fucked up,</v>

2815
02:05:16.710 --> 02:05:19.200
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people are running from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>demons.</v>

2816
02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>

2817
02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:22.890
<v Speaker 3>They just try to get blasted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

2818
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Really drinking alone at a bar feels </v>
<v Speaker 3>more like that to me.</v>

2819
02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Does he drink alone at a bar?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2820
02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:29.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm picturing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2821
02:05:29.370 --> 02:05:34.370
<v Speaker 3>like grizzled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pure Koski type character as opposed to </v>

2822
02:05:34.370 --> 02:05:34.370
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2823
02:05:34.370 --> 02:05:37.100
<v Speaker 6>that's perfect pressure pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So maybe it will</v>

2824
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:42.370
<v Speaker 3>and get drunk during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a problem unless you're in a </v>

2825
02:05:42.370 --> 02:05:45.281
<v Speaker 3>good place like Cancun on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you wake up and have lunch and I'm </v>

2826
02:05:47.601 --> 02:05:50.240
<v Speaker 3>going to have a beer at lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you drinking?</v>

2827
02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason.</v>

2828
02:05:51.890 --> 02:05:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no.</v>

2829
02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a beer with a sandwich or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

2830
02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:58.880
<v Speaker 3>but what if you want to get like a shot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when you start.</v>

2831
02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:04.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad said he came back from work one </v>

2832
02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:06.221
<v Speaker 3>day and he had some some booze at launch</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a lunch meeting and his boss kind of </v>

2833
02:06:06.221 --> 02:06:09.440
<v Speaker 3>smelled it on his breath and he said he </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw the look and then he was like,</v>

2834
02:06:09.441 --> 02:06:11.000
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more drinking the day time.</v>

2835
02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People make too many assumptions about </v>

2836
02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:16.240
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2837
02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:19.151
<v Speaker 3>You don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want them to put you in that </v>

2838
02:06:19.151 --> 02:06:19.151
<v Speaker 3>sort of category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2839
02:06:19.151 --> 02:06:22.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a funny thing when you really think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how responsible people actually </v>

2840
02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:24.590
<v Speaker 3>are with alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think about how available it is,</v>

2841
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:28.160
<v Speaker 3>if you're over 21,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they ever stop you from drinking?</v>

2842
02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:29.750
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could always drink.</v>

2843
02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you've done some shit,</v>

2844
02:06:31.190 --> 02:06:33.410
<v Speaker 3>but if you do some shit like Lindsay </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lohan,</v>

2845
02:06:33.411 --> 02:06:35.900
<v Speaker 3>how to wear like an ankle bracelet that </v>
<v Speaker 3>tells you when you're drunk.</v>

2846
02:06:36.170 --> 02:06:40.070
<v Speaker 3>How long can they keep that on you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't make that permanent.</v>

2847
02:06:40.071 --> 02:06:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can they make a rule?</v>

2848
02:06:42.321 --> 02:06:42.830
<v Speaker 3>Were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2849

<v Speaker 3>we'll let you roam around the street </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck head,</v>

2850
02:06:44.361 --> 02:06:49.361
<v Speaker 3>but you got to wear an ankle bracelet </v>
<v Speaker 3>that tells us if you're drinking soon </v>

2851
02:06:49.361 --> 02:06:49.361
<v Speaker 3>enough though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the CSA,</v>

2852
02:06:49.361 --> 02:06:50.360

<v Speaker 3>wear an ankle stuff for the next month.</v>

2853
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:54.710
<v Speaker 3>You'll do that soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a bad idea for people who are</v>

2854
02:06:54.711 --> 02:06:56.300
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2855
02:06:56.301 --> 02:07:01.301
<v Speaker 3>if you want to control someone who just </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't handle their alcohol and you </v>

2856
02:07:01.301 --> 02:07:01.700
<v Speaker 3>realize you get to a certain point in </v>
<v Speaker 3>time like,</v>

02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:37.900
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about this gun control </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

2873
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's a very complex issue </v>

2874
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:46.620
<v Speaker 1>and it's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that anybody should be able to </v>

2875
02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:48.130
<v Speaker 1>have fucking military grade weapons I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is ridiculous.</v>

2876
02:07:48.690 --> 02:07:50.600
<v Speaker 1>But it comes from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

2877
02:07:51.190 --> 02:07:55.210
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real issue is not the.</v>

2878
02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a fucking cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the gun.</v>

2879
02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:03.060
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is what would happen to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person to make them grow up to be </v>

2880
02:08:03.731 --> 02:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>someone who could be a school shooter </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready?</v>

2881
02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a mental health issue.</v>

2882
02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:09.760
<v Speaker 1>She explored 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

2883
02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:11.080
<v Speaker 1>can I just say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>

2884
02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:13.780
<v Speaker 1>for the obamacare parts of Obamacare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're already put into place,</v>

2885
02:08:14.050 --> 02:08:16.420
<v Speaker 1>which is you have to cover mental health</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to cover for everybody,</v>

2886
02:08:16.860 --> 02:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>for all your means that I don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health coverage because it's not </v>

2887
02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:22.930
<v Speaker 1>cost effective because they can't afford</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

2888
02:08:22.930 --> 02:08:24.520
<v Speaker 1>So they cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't let it.</v>

2889
02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:29.860
<v Speaker 1>They can't give it to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it amazing how so many people are</v>

2890
02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:34.920
<v Speaker 1>so adamant against people or taxpayers </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying for healthcare,</v>

2891
02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:40.320
<v Speaker 1>but don't express nearly the same amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of concern about your money being used </v>

2892
02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:44.590
<v Speaker 1>for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of shocking because the</v>

2893
02:08:44.591 --> 02:08:47.110
<v Speaker 1>war money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like where is it even going?</v>

2894
02:08:47.111 --> 02:08:52.111
<v Speaker 1>It's going into another part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world where you're most likely never </v>

2895
02:08:52.111 --> 02:08:54.100
<v Speaker 1>going to visit unless you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military and it's all going to tanks and</v>

2896
02:08:54.101 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 1>it's craziness you've seen on TV and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just shelling out their money</v>

2897
02:08:58.781 --> 02:09:01.420
<v Speaker 1>in taxes and no one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the moment someone says,</v>

2898
02:09:01.421 --> 02:09:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2899
02:09:01.841 --> 02:09:04.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should make it so that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get some help.</v>

2900
02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.</v>

2901
02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Can fucking week pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2902
02:09:08.621 --> 02:09:09.670
<v Speaker 1>there's something about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2903
02:09:09.671 --> 02:09:11.380
<v Speaker 1>we don't need health care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2904
02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:14.410
<v Speaker 1>what we need is to get back to what made</v>
<v Speaker 1>America great.</v>

2905
02:09:14.530 --> 02:09:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And as corporations having all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

2906
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:19.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that separations are going to</v>

2907
02:09:19.271 --> 02:09:24.271
<v Speaker 1>become corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're run by people and people are </v>

2908
02:09:24.271 --> 02:09:24.271
<v Speaker 1>corruptible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will always fuck up.</v>

2909
02:09:24.271 --> 02:09:26.530
<v Speaker 1>You give somebody power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a chance they will fuck up.</v>

2910
02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not even just a fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird diffusion of </v>

2911
02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:34.501
<v Speaker 1>responsibility thing that happens when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are many steps removed from the </v>

2912
02:09:34.501 --> 02:09:37.720
<v Speaker 1>actual deed and you're involved with </v>
<v Speaker 1>many other people.</v>

2913
02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:42.460
<v Speaker 1>They say it's easier to rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A woman in a crowd was woman in front of</v>

2914
02:09:42.461 --> 02:09:42.560
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2915
02:09:42.650 --> 02:09:44.030
<v Speaker 7>I can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It becomes like,</v>

2916
02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:45.470
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not responsible for this.</v>

2917
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:47.300
<v Speaker 7>They would tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this study,</v>

2918
02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:48.740
<v Speaker 7>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't Pfizer,</v>

2919
02:09:48.741 --> 02:09:51.860
<v Speaker 7>but it was some drug company about polio</v>
<v Speaker 7>vaccines.</v>

2920
02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:55.670
<v Speaker 7>They were giving me these polio vaccines</v>
<v Speaker 7>to these African kids.</v>

2921
02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:58.370
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they were lying to them.</v>

2922
02:09:58.371 --> 02:10:00.980
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't a polio vaccine was just </v>
<v Speaker 7>another drug that we're testing.</v>

2923
02:10:01.390 --> 02:10:03.080
<v Speaker 7>And the polio vaccine in 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

2924
02:10:03.081 --> 02:10:04.310
<v Speaker 7>And 10 percent on the game of the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2925
02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:05.020
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2926
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:06.550
<v Speaker 7>whatever it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the sugar pill,</v>

2927
02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.520
<v Speaker 7>because that's a control group.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the 90 percent of them took the new </v>

2928
02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:15.050
<v Speaker 7>drug that we're testing all died.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well under 10 percent of them got polio.</v>

2929
02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:20.440
<v Speaker 7>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because they weren't even getting the </v>

2930
02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:21.941
<v Speaker 7>vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were thought they were being </v>

2931
02:10:21.941 --> 02:10:21.941
<v Speaker 7>tested.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ouch.</v>

2932
02:10:21.941 --> 02:10:26.440
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's just what some corporation </v>

2933
02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:26.440
<v Speaker 7>does that make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just a normal sort of situation.</v>

2934
02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:27.350
<v Speaker 7>It's over there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't worry about it.</v>

2935
02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:29.630
<v Speaker 7>Exxon has that with a rape,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the land,</v>

2936
02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:33.830
<v Speaker 7>wherever they go and just buy out their </v>
<v Speaker 7>government and say new rules.</v>

2937
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get John Perkins on and </v>

2938
02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll try again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2939
02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:41.690
<v Speaker 1>now that we have matt stags on the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you hearing us Matt?</v>

2940
02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Go get the economic hitman guy because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

2941
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:47.600
<v Speaker 1>he's a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to do that for the government.</v>

2942
02:10:47.601 --> 02:10:49.970
<v Speaker 1>He will go and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh there's Alex Jones.</v>

2943
02:10:50.410 --> 02:10:55.410
<v Speaker 7>You will not take our guns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jon Stewart reacting to Alan.</v>

2944
02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:03.160
<v Speaker 7>So taking away all the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But now I get it.</v>

2945
02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:07.060
<v Speaker 7>Now I see what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this is what it is.</v>

2946
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:12.990
<v Speaker 7>They're paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fear of a possible dystopic future </v>

2947
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:17.440
<v Speaker 7>prevents us from addressing our actual </v>
<v Speaker 7>dystopic present.</v>

2948
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.020
<v Speaker 7>We can't even begin to</v>

2949
02:11:20.150 --> 02:11:22.360
<v Speaker 1>too many uses of the words that stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>

2950
02:11:22.630 --> 02:11:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live in New York and you're Jewish.</v>

2951
02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:26.600
<v Speaker 1>They got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is huge.</v>

2952
02:11:26.601 --> 02:11:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During this thing,</v>

2953
02:11:27.650 --> 02:11:31.850
<v Speaker 1>like did he come in any way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because it was such a crazy story.</v>

2954
02:11:32.010 --> 02:11:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Talking about Alex Jones is off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rails.</v>

2955
02:11:35.511 --> 02:11:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it though.</v>

2956
02:11:36.711 --> 02:11:39.590
<v Speaker 1>With the military grade weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point was never to be able to hunt.</v>

2957
02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:44.591
<v Speaker 1>We're at the point was able to drive off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government and you're not going to </v>

2958
02:11:44.591 --> 02:11:44.591
<v Speaker 1>do it with a fucking six pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will.</v>

2959
02:11:44.591 --> 02:11:49.010
<v Speaker 1>The idea is to protect yourself against </v>
<v Speaker 1>threats to this nation,</v>

2960
02:11:49.011 --> 02:11:52.640
<v Speaker 1>both domestic and abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea is that,</v>

2961
02:11:52.641 --> 02:11:57.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to worry about being overtaken </v>

2962
02:11:57.641 --> 02:12:00.371
<v Speaker 1>from within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have the right to bear </v>

2963
02:12:00.371 --> 02:12:00.371
<v Speaker 1>arms and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody says,</v>

2964
02:12:00.371 --> 02:12:04.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those book when people had muskets and </v>

2965
02:12:04.241 --> 02:12:04.241
<v Speaker 1>this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government's corrupt now that it was</v>

2966
02:12:04.241 --> 02:12:04.490
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

2967
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:09.550
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government had muskets as well back </v>

2968
02:12:09.550 --> 02:12:12.371
<v Speaker 1>then and now the government doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>any and they didn't have the ability to </v>

2969
02:12:12.371 --> 02:12:12.371
<v Speaker 1>arrest you for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2970
02:12:12.371 --> 02:12:17.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that you should go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking overtake the government with </v>

2971
02:12:17.231 --> 02:12:17.231
<v Speaker 1>forest because I definitely don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that.</v>

2972
02:12:17.231 --> 02:12:19.070
<v Speaker 1>But what do you think is the way to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of people?</v>

2973
02:12:19.190 --> 02:12:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I think that the issue is not people </v>
<v Speaker 1>being armed.</v>

2974
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:24.020
<v Speaker 1>The issue is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

2975
02:12:24.050 --> 02:12:27.980
<v Speaker 1>The issue is disenfranchised people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue is people that have legitimate</v>

2976
02:12:27.981 --> 02:12:30.830
<v Speaker 1>mental problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue is diagnosing them.</v>

2977
02:12:30.831 --> 02:12:35.831
<v Speaker 1>The issue is trying to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck a person becomes that </v>

2978
02:12:35.831 --> 02:12:38.150
<v Speaker 1>sociopathic fucking psychopathic killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that.</v>

2979
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:40.250
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our real problem.</v>

2980
02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Because when you look at the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers of human beings and you look at </v>

2981
02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:48.791
<v Speaker 1>the actual numbers of human beings with </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns and then you look at the actual </v>

2982
02:12:48.791 --> 02:12:48.791
<v Speaker 1>numbers of crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people like to say,</v>

2983
02:12:48.791 --> 02:12:50.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>England has no guns,</v>

2984
02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:51.860
<v Speaker 1>so they have no gun crimes.</v>

2985
02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:56.570
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like 30 or something shootings</v>

2986
02:12:56.571 --> 02:12:58.880
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like nothing compared to the United</v>

2987
02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:00.950
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the overall number of</v>

2988
02:13:00.951 --> 02:13:05.570
<v Speaker 1>armed people in Britain to the overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of armed people in America,</v>

2989
02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:10.840
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of shocking that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have as few murders by guns that we do </v>

2990
02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:14.681
<v Speaker 1>and rose to the murders by guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a good 70 percent of the assault </v>

2991
02:13:14.751 --> 02:13:19.751
<v Speaker 1>rifle type killings or gang related or </v>
<v Speaker 1>really high percentage of them have to </v>

2992
02:13:19.911 --> 02:13:22.880
<v Speaker 1>do with gang violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to tell you that's it.</v>

2993
02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:26.240
<v Speaker 1>That's why up mean largely an economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

2994
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:29.570
<v Speaker 1>largely a poverty issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a drug dealing issue.</v>

2995
02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:33.450
<v Speaker 1>A couple of different aspects of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society that are obviously sick,</v>

2996
02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2997
02:13:34.371 --> 02:13:38.400
<v Speaker 1>the illegal access to drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that anybody sells drugs,</v>

2998
02:13:38.401 --> 02:13:40.500
<v Speaker 1>that's criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one,</v>

2999
02:13:40.530 --> 02:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>that's one aspect that leads to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized crime,</v>

3000
02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:43.740
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3001
02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And then the other aspect of course is </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>

3002
02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:49.170
<v Speaker 1>People growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchise needing someone somewhere</v>

3003
02:13:49.171 --> 02:13:54.171
<v Speaker 1>to belong to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become a part of gangs and gangs </v>

3004
02:13:54.171 --> 02:13:54.171
<v Speaker 1>are fucking huge and they're killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

3005
02:13:54.171 --> 02:13:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3006
02:13:54.291 --> 02:13:58.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a super common thing that they use </v>
<v Speaker 1>those types of weapons in,</v>

3007
02:13:58.930 --> 02:14:01.260
<v Speaker 1>in gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder like drive bys and stuff.</v>

3008
02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I look,</v>

3009
02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think everybody should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to those guns.</v>

3010
02:14:04.411 --> 02:14:06.540
<v Speaker 1>That's where I parked from the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

3011
02:14:06.541 --> 02:14:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I think if you have a reason to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>those guns,</v>

3012
02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:11.780
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're.</v>

3013
02:14:11.850 --> 02:14:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were looking for something to </v>

3014
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:16.850
<v Speaker 1>protect yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3015
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:17.910
<v Speaker 1>do you really need machine guns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3016
02:14:17.911 --> 02:14:20.760
<v Speaker 1>can you get by with a shotgun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you get by with a rifle?</v>

3017
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that if somebody wanted to </v>

3018
02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:30.021
<v Speaker 1>go and kill a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be far harder if you had </v>

3019
02:14:30.021 --> 02:14:31.380
<v Speaker 1>something like a single loading rifle or</v>
<v Speaker 1>shotgun.</v>

3020
02:14:31.710 --> 02:14:34.050
<v Speaker 1>But then the argument of course from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>NRA people would be,</v>

3021
02:14:34.051 --> 02:14:37.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to apply the language</v>

3022
02:14:37.770 --> 02:14:41.070
<v Speaker 1>and the declaration of independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Second Amendment being that you have</v>

3023
02:14:41.071 --> 02:14:46.071
<v Speaker 1>the right to bear arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea means that you have the right </v>

3024
02:14:46.071 --> 02:14:49.341
<v Speaker 1>to protect yourself against whoever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be who easily could be overpowering </v>

3025
02:14:49.861 --> 02:14:51.450
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can have more fire power than you.</v>

3026
02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:55.140
<v Speaker 1>So if you have what they have and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a 50 caliber machine gun,</v>

3027
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you have what they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3028
02:14:56.870 --> 02:15:01.870
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on an equal playing field and </v>

3029
02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:03.651
<v Speaker 1>they can't come and take your land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is they won't let you like </v>

3030
02:15:03.651 --> 02:15:06.590
<v Speaker 1>doesn't happen at Waco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they started taking a bunch of </v>

3031
02:15:06.590 --> 02:15:06.590
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they also fucking their kids.</v>

3032
02:15:06.590 --> 02:15:10.700
<v Speaker 1>But who knows if that's true because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first thing I was there and </v>

3033
02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:13.400
<v Speaker 1>blew them all up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to go and get somebody to </v>

3034
02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:14.000
<v Speaker 1>come and become a threat to the powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>person in government,</v>

3035
02:15:14.130 --> 02:15:15.150
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to wipe you out.</v>

3036
02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:18.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's why people in Libya and need </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual machine guns to make change.</v>

3037
02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:24.010
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it through voting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're starting to not be able to do it </v>

3038
02:15:24.010 --> 02:15:24.010
<v Speaker 1>through voting either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

3039
02:15:24.010 --> 02:15:25.320
<v Speaker 1>And I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more I look at it,</v>

3040
02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:28.050
<v Speaker 1>the situation we have here with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>government not representing us,</v>

3041
02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I only really see one way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3042
02:15:31.670 --> 02:15:36.670
<v Speaker 1>he's talking crazy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the end of this podcast and if </v>

3043
02:15:36.670 --> 02:15:36.670
<v Speaker 1>you want to continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conversation will be on there.</v>

3044
02:15:36.670 --> 02:15:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Skeptic tank available on itunes and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of me will be paid by Jason Team.</v>

3045
02:15:41.650 --> 02:15:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3046
02:15:42.481 --> 02:15:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3047
02:15:43.251 --> 02:15:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the government has </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger businesses.</v>

3048
02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:50.360
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would exceed any control if they don't </v>

3049
02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:52.491
<v Speaker 1>have to and they no longer have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the problem is it's eating itself.</v>

3050
02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:58.700
<v Speaker 1>See the access to information that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government has now and the ability to </v>

3051
02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:02.241
<v Speaker 1>wire tap phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to spy on people's lives is </v>

3052
02:16:02.241 --> 02:16:05.031
<v Speaker 1>now eating itself because the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>FBI investigated CIA,</v>

3053
02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:09.540
<v Speaker 1>another director of the CIA is no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>there because they went digging into his</v>

3054
02:16:09.541 --> 02:16:10.110
<v Speaker 1>privacy.</v>

3055
02:16:10.590 --> 02:16:12.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

3056
02:16:12.001 --> 02:16:15.540
<v Speaker 1>they're spying on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking spy versus spy.</v>

3057
02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Our tax dollars being spent to expose a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy getting some pussy.</v>

3058
02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you think if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could go back and remove every </v>

3059
02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:25.800
<v Speaker 1>great leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every man of power.</v>

3060
02:16:25.801 --> 02:16:28.050
<v Speaker 1>If you're military combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially military.</v>

3061
02:16:28.230 --> 02:16:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're talking about a in David </v>
<v Speaker 1>betray us that had been in Baltimore for</v>

3062
02:16:31.841 --> 02:16:36.841
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had seen a lot of death and you're </v>

3063
02:16:36.841 --> 02:16:38.820
<v Speaker 1>going to deny him some extra pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that his sensual?</v>

3064
02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a hot chick who's young,</v>

3065
02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:42.820
<v Speaker 1>that's what he got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was in trouble for.</v>

3066
02:16:43.450 --> 02:16:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he got in trouble for.</v>

3067
02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:48.760
<v Speaker 1>But it also had to do somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>relating it to Bengazi,</v>

3068
02:16:48.761 --> 02:16:52.900
<v Speaker 1>the attack on Libya where they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>woefully unprotected.</v>

3069
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Their information failed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they attack those people in the.</v>

3070
02:16:56.770 --> 02:16:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Killed The American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3071
02:16:58.570 --> 02:16:59.820
<v Speaker 1>American ambassador.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3072
02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:05.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's that as well that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe is somehow or another connected </v>

3073
02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:08.281
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they made up that story that it was </v>

3074
02:17:08.281 --> 02:17:08.281
<v Speaker 1>all about some movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3075
02:17:08.281 --> 02:17:08.281
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was through.</v>

3076
02:17:08.281 --> 02:17:10.120
<v Speaker 1>It was really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She made up a story,</v>

3077
02:17:10.121 --> 02:17:11.620
<v Speaker 1>eat up a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucks.</v>

3078
02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:16.800
<v Speaker 1>They made up a story about this all </v>
<v Speaker 1>being inspired by a crazy bad movie,</v>

3079
02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:24.620
<v Speaker 1>a web movie that most likely was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sponsored and made by the spooks </v>

3080
02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:30.400
<v Speaker 1>that they made it themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really hired some actors and they </v>

3081
02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:32.170
<v Speaker 1>put together a Shitty fucking propaganda</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie and they made it themselves.</v>

3082
02:17:32.290 --> 02:17:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that were in the movie,</v>

3083
02:17:34.191 --> 02:17:37.120
<v Speaker 1>he said that they said certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when they watched the movie,</v>

3084
02:17:37.121 --> 02:17:38.830
<v Speaker 1>other words were dubbed into their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouths.</v>

3085
02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3086
02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:45.080
<v Speaker 1>so the idea was that this movie was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>created as a scapegoat and then everyone</v>

3087
02:17:45.081 --> 02:17:50.081
<v Speaker 1>would react to that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so while we can't bow down to these </v>

3088
02:17:50.081 --> 02:17:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Muslims or like you've got to be up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least aware of their feelings and that </v>

3089
02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:54.160
<v Speaker 1>just throwing us off the real trail.</v>

3090
02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saw pieces of it?</v>

3091
02:17:56.610 --> 02:17:58.390
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking unbelievably bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3092
02:17:58.391 --> 02:17:59.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3093
02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:00.250
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Peter Term.</v>

3094
02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3095
02:18:01.690 --> 02:18:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's just a complete madness </v>
<v Speaker 1>just ended up here,</v>

3096
02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:06.640
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like America world police.</v>

3097
02:18:06.641 --> 02:18:08.620
<v Speaker 1>If it was people just got a video </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>

3098
02:18:08.970 --> 02:18:09.730
<v Speaker 1>isn't it Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

3099
02:18:09.731 --> 02:18:12.300
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen it pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3100

<v Speaker 1>I'm an actor,</v>

3101
02:18:15.010 --> 02:18:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I have to go and save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ridiculous,</v>

3102
02:18:17.111 --> 02:18:19.420
<v Speaker 1>crazy cheesy dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not funny,</v>

3103
02:18:19.421 --> 02:18:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not on purpose.</v>

3104
02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:23.260
<v Speaker 1>What they're trying to do is really make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really,</v>

3105
02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:28.261
<v Speaker 1>really dumb propaganda movie to justify </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why these terrorists would </v>

3106
02:18:28.261 --> 02:18:29.500
<v Speaker 1>sent to warships over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost instantly.</v>

3107
02:18:29.501 --> 02:18:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3108
02:18:29.861 --> 02:18:30.970
<v Speaker 1>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what,</v>

3109
02:18:30.971 --> 02:18:35.320
<v Speaker 1>man is a guy who was a mob deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep in the world of intelligence.</v>

3110
02:18:35.350 --> 02:18:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Since I've been addicted to homeland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

3111
02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Be a little bit alien to you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the system works.</v>

3112
02:18:42.130 --> 02:18:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I've become a fan of the CIA from doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeland option that showed.</v>

3113
02:18:45.371 --> 02:18:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah.</v>

3114
02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:51.180
<v Speaker 1>That show literally changes my opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>on what it must be like for the CIA to </v>

3115
02:18:52.511 --> 02:18:57.511
<v Speaker 1>try to thwart terrorism and it makes me </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why they would want to take </v>

3116
02:18:57.511 --> 02:19:02.251
<v Speaker 1>rights away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't agree with their ability </v>

3117
02:19:02.251 --> 02:19:03.961
<v Speaker 1>to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I understand the kind of shit that </v>

3118
02:19:03.961 --> 02:19:04.730
<v Speaker 1>they probably only do you have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

3119
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:06.060
<v Speaker 1>The only problem with taking their </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights away.</v>

3120
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:07.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's from a reason it's been good.</v>

3121
02:19:07.961 --> 02:19:09.730
<v Speaker 1>It's that let's say your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3122
02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:14.820
<v Speaker 1>your reasons are pure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just want to go after terrorists </v>

3123
02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:15.100
<v Speaker 1>when there's fewer full terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what happens?</v>

3124
02:19:15.101 --> 02:19:18.280
<v Speaker 1>The next guy who was in office who might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not share your sentiment about fair,</v>

3125
02:19:18.310 --> 02:19:19.750
<v Speaker 1>that's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an old statement.</v>

3126

<v Speaker 1>The man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying yes to today's not the </v>

3128
02:19:26.611 --> 02:19:28.231
<v Speaker 1>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give someone access to your </v>

3129
02:19:28.231 --> 02:19:28.231
<v Speaker 1>privacy today and he's a good guy,</v>

3130
02:19:28.231 --> 02:19:33.190

<v Speaker 3>He was used to cook cellular was nothing</v>

3170
02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:05.980

02:21:05.980 --> 02:21:07.530
<v Speaker 3>with a bowl of milk in the morning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticking his eyes.</v>

3172
02:21:10.350 --> 02:21:13.150
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even react.</v>

3177
02:21:27.570 --> 02:21:32.570
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it as far as like a peek into what </v>

3178
02:21:34.171 --> 02:21:39.171
<v Speaker 3>happens when a dictator gets overcome by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rebels and you actually get to watch</v>

3179
02:21:40.051 --> 02:21:42.150
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that before where we saw</v>

3180
02:21:42.151 --> 02:21:42.780
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were there.</v>

3181
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:43.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were there.</v>

3182
02:21:43.890 --> 02:21:48.890
<v Speaker 3>We knew that doesn't exist anywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 3>history and it was on a fucking cell </v>

3183
02:21:48.890 --> 02:21:48.930
<v Speaker 3>phone camera.</v>

<v Speaker 3>blood and looking for someone to come in</v>

02:21:54.911 --> 02:21:56.230
<v Speaker 3>and rescue them and has someone ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes.</v>

3187
02:21:56.231 --> 02:21:58.810
<v Speaker 3>They're sticking sticks up his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just fucking start shooting them.</v>

3188
02:21:58.990 --> 02:21:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3189
02:21:59.921 --> 02:22:00.430
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3190
02:22:00.431 --> 02:22:03.040
<v Speaker 3>they dragged that guy around on the roof</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a car.</v>

3191
02:22:03.310 --> 02:22:08.310
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was like literally everything </v>

3192
02:22:08.310 --> 02:22:09.550
<v Speaker 3>that you would see like in a movie about</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dictator getting overthrown,</v>

3193
02:22:09.551 --> 02:22:14.551
<v Speaker 3>but you never saw that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to see the look of terror on his </v>

3194
02:22:14.551 --> 02:22:18.841
<v Speaker 3>face and to know that man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a story that has been playing </v>

3195
02:22:18.911 --> 02:22:22.540
<v Speaker 3>itself out exactly the same way over and</v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

3196
02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Throughout time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You changed dictators.</v>

3197
02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:25.900
<v Speaker 3>That's the way</v>

3198
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:28.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the normal route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

3199
02:22:28.340 --> 02:22:33.340
<v Speaker 1>That phrase that the tree of liberty </v>
<v Speaker 1>must be occasionally watered with the </v>

3200
02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:39.990
<v Speaker 1>death of enemies and patriots under his </v>
<v Speaker 1>end patriots.</v>

3201
02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Pinterest fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the quote,</v>

3202
02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:48.320
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you just need in order to </v>

3203
02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:48.320
<v Speaker 1>stay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

3204
02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:51.490
<v Speaker 1>you want liberty every now and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta fuck some people up because the </v>

3205
02:22:51.490 --> 02:22:55.610
<v Speaker 1>normal pattern that people follow for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason is once they get into </v>

3206
02:22:55.610 --> 02:22:56.970
<v Speaker 1>position of being able to tell what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people what to do,</v>

3207
02:22:57.150 --> 02:22:59.040
<v Speaker 1>they separate them from those other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3208
02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Did I seen that the comedy store had it </v>
<v Speaker 1>where managers worked as a.</v>

3209
02:23:02.850 --> 02:23:04.810
<v Speaker 1>When I worked as a security guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3210
02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I worked for a few months as a security </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard in a concert place.</v>

3211
02:23:08.011 --> 02:23:13.011
<v Speaker 1>Every night we're shutting up drunks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every night and it became us versus </v>

3212
02:23:13.011 --> 02:23:13.011
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't a cop.</v>

3213
02:23:13.011 --> 02:23:17.600
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't arrest anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got to see and I would have to </v>

3214
02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:20.901
<v Speaker 1>tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't bring your booze and he can't </v>

3215
02:23:20.901 --> 02:23:20.901
<v Speaker 1>bring bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he came and they would yell at me,</v>

3216
02:23:20.901 --> 02:23:20.901
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

3217
02:23:20.901 --> 02:23:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And it became us versus them and we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>banded together,</v>

3218
02:23:23.161 --> 02:23:25.020
<v Speaker 1>all the security guards in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes.</v>

3219
02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Least cons coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking assholes.</v>

3220
02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Like right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you're hired to make sure </v>

3221
02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:32.600
<v Speaker 1>everyone's having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3222
02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you're hired to keep everybody from </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing in booze.</v>

3223
02:23:33.301 --> 02:23:38.301
<v Speaker 1>Mostly our main job was we would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>there at the beginning like James Taylor</v>

3224
02:23:38.311 --> 02:23:43.311
<v Speaker 1>to play and all these people who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going bring a nice bottle of wine goes </v>

3225
02:23:43.311 --> 02:23:43.311
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Taylor.</v>

3226
02:23:43.311 --> 02:23:44.520
<v Speaker 1>You can't bring bottles of wine to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that sells wine.</v>

3227
02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you get there and we take your </v>

3228
02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:49.840
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd have to take people's bags.</v>

3229
02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:53.151
<v Speaker 1>We opened them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have anything in here that we </v>

3230
02:23:53.151 --> 02:23:53.151
<v Speaker 1>should know about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3231
02:23:53.151 --> 02:23:53.151
<v Speaker 1>Did you bring any alcohol in a bottle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3232
02:23:53.151 --> 02:23:54.570
<v Speaker 1>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pulled out a bottle of wine plunk.</v>

3233
02:23:54.850 --> 02:23:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It didn't kick them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd put the wine in like a bucket.</v>

3234
02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:03.620
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of the night we'd have </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant garbage buckets with booze,</v>

3235
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:05.520
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's like,</v>

3236
02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:06.370
<v Speaker 1>you're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

3237
02:24:06.390 --> 02:24:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Then we took their boots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the attitude of all the </v>

3238
02:24:11.390 --> 02:24:13.791
<v Speaker 1>people that work there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you work there like you </v>

3239
02:24:13.791 --> 02:24:14.390
<v Speaker 1>develop that sort of attitude too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody's like,</v>

3240
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:16.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

3241
02:24:17.290 --> 02:24:20.730
<v Speaker 1>security guard or a great woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But granted I was 18,</v>

3242
02:24:20.731 --> 02:24:23.610
<v Speaker 1>19 and I recognize it as it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

3243
02:24:23.611 --> 02:24:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking,</v>

3244
02:24:25.730 --> 02:24:28.340
<v Speaker 7>that's the same thing as Tsa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're going to do the same shit.</v>

3245
02:24:28.430 --> 02:24:33.430
<v Speaker 7>Exactly the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I finally realized this now with </v>

3246
02:24:33.430 --> 02:24:37.061
<v Speaker 7>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like people they excuse it always </v>

3247
02:24:37.061 --> 02:24:38.531
<v Speaker 7>made me troubled with Tsa while they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking infringing on our rights and </v>

3248
02:24:38.531 --> 02:24:39.290
<v Speaker 7>looking through all my shit and make me </v>
<v Speaker 7>take my shoes off.</v>

3249
02:24:39.291 --> 02:24:41.120
<v Speaker 7>And all this stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>

3250
02:24:41.121 --> 02:24:42.680
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is uh,</v>

3251
02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:44.300
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're just doing their jobs.</v>

3252
02:24:44.390 --> 02:24:47.090
<v Speaker 7>It's not their fault individually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I tell him to go fuck themselves.</v>

3253
02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:48.350
<v Speaker 7>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're just doing their jobs.</v>

3254
02:24:48.770 --> 02:24:50.360
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why is that an excuse?</v>

3255
02:24:50.900 --> 02:24:55.900
<v Speaker 7>You know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're taking a job fucking with people </v>

3256
02:24:55.900 --> 02:24:56.450
<v Speaker 7>because it's the job.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're allowed to do whatever you want.</v>

3257
02:24:56.451 --> 02:25:01.451
<v Speaker 7>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think because someone check </v>

3258
02:25:01.451 --> 02:25:01.451
<v Speaker 7>attached to it.</v>

3259
02:25:01.451 --> 02:25:01.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Tsa fucks with people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most part.</v>

3260
02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I have not had a single problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tsa.</v>

3261
02:25:04.131 --> 02:25:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I have not seen a single problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tsa ever</v>

3262
02:25:07.430 --> 02:25:09.510
<v Speaker 7>except for like when I mentioned go </v>
<v Speaker 7>through this exercise,</v>

3263
02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:10.370
<v Speaker 7>things they didn't test</v>

3264
02:25:11.350 --> 02:25:12.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those extra things.</v>

3265
02:25:12.611 --> 02:25:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Which ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that spin the penis.</v>

3266
02:25:16.290 --> 02:25:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones they didn't test,</v>

3267
02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:18.550
<v Speaker 1>but they were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3268
02:25:18.551 --> 02:25:20.170
<v Speaker 1>we'll take their word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or The guy who owns it,</v>

3269
02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:25.230
<v Speaker 1>what I read according to what I've read </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the that you get inside a plane is </v>

3270
02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:27.880
<v Speaker 1>way worse than that and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to worry about.</v>

3271
02:25:28.570 --> 02:25:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I would love if they just actually put </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the tests they did instead of hide </v>

3272
02:25:33.570 --> 02:25:33.570
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good idea.</v>

3273
02:25:33.570 --> 02:25:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And or allow independent testing.</v>

3274
02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:39.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that what they're worried </v>

3275
02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:39.480
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right or wrong,</v>

3276
02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with it because I think there</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be full disclosure always when it</v>

3277
02:25:42.041 --> 02:25:44.770
<v Speaker 1>comes to things in regard health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation and shit like that,</v>

3278
02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:50.190
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to release the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you get a lot of radiation on a </v>

3279
02:25:50.190 --> 02:25:50.190
<v Speaker 1>fucking plane.</v>

3280
02:25:50.190 --> 02:25:54.540
<v Speaker 1>You get so much radiation on a plane </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes they have to fly </v>

3281
02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:58.021
<v Speaker 1>different paths because they're solar </v>
<v Speaker 1>flares and you're flying in weird spots.</v>

3282
02:25:58.361 --> 02:26:03.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fly in areas where there's too </v>

3283
02:26:03.361 --> 02:26:06.121
<v Speaker 1>much solar activity and it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>British gamma radiation closer to the </v>

3284
02:26:06.121 --> 02:26:06.121
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3285
02:26:06.121 --> 02:26:08.710
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet and space.</v>

3286
02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:10.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really high up there,</v>

3287
02:26:10.601 --> 02:26:15.601
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little metal tube and you're getting </v>

3288
02:26:15.601 --> 02:26:16.090
<v Speaker 1>blasted by gamma rays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really close to,</v>

3289
02:26:16.091 --> 02:26:16.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3290
02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:19.810
<v Speaker 1>you're close to space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to space by.</v>

3291
02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:22.130
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is 30,000</v>

3292
02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:23.410
<v Speaker 1>people at three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many miles is that?</v>

3293
02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:24.960
<v Speaker 1>How many was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five thousand miles.</v>

3294
02:26:24.961 --> 02:26:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five hundred miles is a 5,000</v>

3295
02:26:29.081 --> 02:26:30.280
<v Speaker 1>feet is a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3296
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:32.710
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're high up there man.</v>

3297
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:37.830
<v Speaker 1>So apparently that is not good for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't want people to really </v>

3298
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:40.570
<v Speaker 1>dwell on that because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's radiation in all things,</v>

3299
02:26:40.571 --> 02:26:42.550
<v Speaker 1>there's radiation and trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you.</v>

3300
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want people to dwell on it </v>

3301
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>because if you start telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some,</v>

3302
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:49.120
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next time you're on a plane,</v>

3303
02:26:49.121 --> 02:26:54.121
<v Speaker 1>why don't you do it for a skeptic tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring a geiger counter geiger counter </v>

3304
02:26:54.121 --> 02:26:55.180
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go online on Amazon.com</v>

3305
02:26:55.181 --> 02:26:58.990
<v Speaker 1>and get something that is a radiation </v>
<v Speaker 1>reader and see if it works that way.</v>

3306
02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know if that's how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

3307
02:27:00.851 --> 02:27:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how you would do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3308
02:27:02.530 --> 02:27:04.900
<v Speaker 1>So anyway you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would get that and you know,</v>

3309
02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:10.020
<v Speaker 1>get a reading and then compare that </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another you would have to </v>

3310
02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:11.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking get a reading off of one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those x ray machines at the airport.</v>

3311
02:27:11.681 --> 02:27:13.630
<v Speaker 1>But they wouldn't let you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you did,</v>

3312
02:27:13.690 --> 02:27:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I bet the plane would probably be at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least as radioactive if not way more.</v>

3313
02:27:20.050 --> 02:27:21.310
<v Speaker 1>What I've read is that it's more.</v>

3314
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.790
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much information is really available</v>

3315
02:27:24.791 --> 02:27:27.970
<v Speaker 1>out there about those folks and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>your putting ingredients on everything.</v>

3316
02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:31.030
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have to get fucking x </v>
<v Speaker 1>rayed everywhere.</v>

3317
02:27:31.031 --> 02:27:36.031
<v Speaker 1>It's just the it people want to blow </v>
<v Speaker 1>things up all the time and it's always </v>

3318
02:27:36.031 --> 02:27:39.190
<v Speaker 1>planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when is it going to happen?</v>

3319
02:27:39.191 --> 02:27:40.330
<v Speaker 1>We're enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuts.</v>

3320
02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Blow up a mall where every time you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the mall you have to put your fucking</v>

3321
02:27:43.931 --> 02:27:48.931
<v Speaker 1>change in a bucket and go through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then someone's going to be stealing </v>

3322
02:27:48.931 --> 02:27:48.931
<v Speaker 1>watches and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

3323
02:27:48.931 --> 02:27:51.640
<v Speaker 1>they do a tsa every now and then you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rogue employee.</v>

3324
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I hate it when they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they fight,</v>

3325
02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:55.750
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they catch some guy as news company</v>

3326
02:27:55.751 --> 02:28:00.751
<v Speaker 1>will catch some guys stealing who works </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the airline and the airline is the </v>

3327
02:28:00.751 --> 02:28:04.191
<v Speaker 1>only reaction is they no longer work </v>
<v Speaker 1>here that have been been been </v>

3328
02:28:04.191 --> 02:28:04.191
<v Speaker 1>terminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3329
02:28:04.191 --> 02:28:07.051
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should fucking put print off for </v>

3330
02:28:07.051 --> 02:28:07.051
<v Speaker 1>trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3331
02:28:07.051 --> 02:28:08.140
<v Speaker 1>stealing while the representing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government should have been way worse.</v>

3332
02:28:08.290 --> 02:28:10.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't try and they just fucking say</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out.</v>

3333
02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:11.460
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out.</v>

3334
02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Just like the prettiest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst thing that'll happen to</v>

3335
02:28:13.151 --> 02:28:18.151
<v Speaker 1>him or her out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they figured that the prisons </v>

3336
02:28:18.151 --> 02:28:21.221
<v Speaker 1>today are so fucking overcrowded and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice system is so understaffed and </v>

3337
02:28:21.221 --> 02:28:22.190
<v Speaker 1>overworked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I knew my only</v>

3338
02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:27.220
<v Speaker 7>fucking repercussions were that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>have this job where I get to steal </v>

3339
02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:27.920
<v Speaker 7>anymore just to like crazy still.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3340
02:28:27.921 --> 02:28:29.830
<v Speaker 7>until you get caught and then now you </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't get to steal anymore.</v>

3341
02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:34.840
<v Speaker 7>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to steal some steel wire </v>

3342
02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:36.890
<v Speaker 7>can.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's really funny when they get super </v>

3343
02:28:36.890 --> 02:28:37.580
<v Speaker 7>ghetto at the TSA station,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like someone will say something.</v>

3344
02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:38.640
<v Speaker 9>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh no,</v>

3346
02:28:39.121 --> 02:28:40.560
<v Speaker 9>no.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I wasn't involved with that.</v>

3347
02:28:40.590 --> 02:28:41.980
<v Speaker 9>I wasn't involved with that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like,</v>

3348
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:43.840
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know you were with that guy</v>

3349
02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:50.200
<v Speaker 7>and the like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't forget that like this is their </v>

3350
02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:53.320
<v Speaker 7>security officers for the government,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but just he has just sort of dumb people</v>

3351
02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:55.160
<v Speaker 7>are just folks who that's the job of </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

3352
02:28:55.161 --> 02:28:56.480
<v Speaker 7>You get started.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Raise your hands.</v>

3353
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:58.040
<v Speaker 7>This is what I always say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't raise my hands.</v>

3354
02:28:58.490 --> 02:28:59.820
<v Speaker 7>Why I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

3355
02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:02.450
<v Speaker 7>I'm not under arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Am I doing things that make me seem like</v>

3356
02:29:02.451 --> 02:29:04.100
<v Speaker 7>I'm under arrest?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So when you go through the thing,</v>

3357
02:29:04.101 --> 02:29:06.000
<v Speaker 7>you won't raise your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

3358
02:29:06.150 --> 02:29:07.640
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they say,</v>

3359
02:29:07.641 --> 02:29:08.570
<v Speaker 7>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't trust me.</v>

3360
02:29:08.571 --> 02:29:10.700
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't trust the company you work for.</v>

3361
02:29:10.701 --> 02:29:12.410
<v Speaker 7>And the fact that you work for them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3362
02:29:12.411 --> 02:29:13.760
<v Speaker 7>I don't trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who are you?</v>

3363
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:16.220
<v Speaker 7>Some lady.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So when you go through security,</v>

3364
02:29:16.221 --> 02:29:17.810
<v Speaker 7>do you cause a stink,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you say?</v>

3365
02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:19.530
<v Speaker 7>Usually I try to time it up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Any Jew?</v>

3366
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:21.050
<v Speaker 7>I'm not here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't say it like that.</v>

3367
02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:23.270
<v Speaker 7>But when they had the pat me down,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like we got to patch it down.</v>

3368
02:29:23.271 --> 02:29:24.320
<v Speaker 7>Did you say you prefer that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

3369
02:29:24.321 --> 02:29:25.370
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't prefer that.</v>

3370
02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:27.170
<v Speaker 7>But if you could give me no fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>options,</v>

3371
02:29:27.260 --> 02:29:30.040
<v Speaker 7>do whatever the fuck you want to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

3372
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:31.370
<v Speaker 7>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck them.</v>

3373
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:34.730
<v Speaker 7>You could tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You tell Brian to go from punch somebody</v>

3374
02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:37.520
<v Speaker 7>and then he does it really mean Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you shouldn't have done that.</v>

3375
02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:38.030
<v Speaker 7>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3376
02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:38.330
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

3377
02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:40.010
<v Speaker 7>He gave me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Rogan gave me 20 bucks.</v>

3378
02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:42.160
<v Speaker 7>So it was just my job.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I was working okay.</v>

3379
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:45.480
<v Speaker 7>That's a bit extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they're just going to have rights.</v>

3380
02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:48.560
<v Speaker 7>They're making us all feel really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they're just doing a job.</v>

3381
02:29:48.561 --> 02:29:49.610
<v Speaker 7>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're just doing.</v>

3382
02:29:49.611 --> 02:29:51.880
<v Speaker 7>Their job is not an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3383
02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:52.700
<v Speaker 7>Wouldn't be if there were</v>

3384
02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:55.270
<v Speaker 1>being violent to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the analogy is not fair.</v>

3385
02:29:55.300 --> 02:30:00.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're not getting you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just making sure you don't have bombs </v>

3386
02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:00.340
<v Speaker 1>and most likely you don't have bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See for you,</v>

3387
02:30:00.341 --> 02:30:00.820
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3388
02:30:00.821 --> 02:30:01.930
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking.</v>

3389
02:30:01.931 --> 02:30:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm a handsome young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3390
02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:04.630
<v Speaker 1>obviously</v>

3391
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:10.750
<v Speaker 7>now I'll just search your shit just </v>
<v Speaker 7>because they're just making sure you </v>

3392
02:30:10.750 --> 02:30:10.750
<v Speaker 7>don't have bombs.</v>

3393
02:30:10.750 --> 02:30:11.100
<v Speaker 1>But they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're allowed.</v>

3394
02:30:11.101 --> 02:30:12.870
<v Speaker 1>That's the agreement that we've all </v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

3395
02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:14.670
<v Speaker 1>We've given up a little slice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

3396
02:30:14.940 --> 02:30:17.810
<v Speaker 1>And so because some monkeys want to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>on one guy,</v>

3397
02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:23.780
<v Speaker 1>one man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me think about all the people that </v>

3398
02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:23.910
<v Speaker 1>have done fucked up shit on planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an for whatever reason,</v>

3399
02:30:23.911 --> 02:30:28.911
<v Speaker 1>our fear of flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very real along with the </v>

3400
02:30:28.911 --> 02:30:32.160
<v Speaker 1>terrorist need to send a big message by </v>
<v Speaker 1>making a huge event happen.</v>

3401
02:30:32.610 --> 02:30:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Planes like a perfect thing for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3402
02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:36.720
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why we got to watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3403
02:30:36.721 --> 02:30:41.721
<v Speaker 1>it's too good for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we to put air marshals up there as </v>

3404
02:30:41.721 --> 02:30:45.021
<v Speaker 1>dudes are secretly a cops that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with reactionary to a time </v>

3405
02:30:45.021 --> 02:30:46.290
<v Speaker 1>where room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you spawn air marshals?</v>

3406
02:30:46.291 --> 02:30:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever seen one seen someone's gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that?</v>

3407
02:30:49.351 --> 02:30:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Like peeking out from other shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice?</v>

3408
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Either when I feel like fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always the ones that are always </v>

3409
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:58.440
<v Speaker 1>sitting on the plane before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know why that wasn't.</v>

3410
02:30:58.590 --> 02:30:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how,</v>

3411
02:30:59.521 --> 02:31:00.810
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do that?</v>

3412
02:31:01.050 --> 02:31:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Then you would know what you think they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would go.</v>

3413
02:31:03.361 --> 02:31:06.260
<v Speaker 1>They would they be in first class or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd been way back way,</v>

3414
02:31:06.270 --> 02:31:08.340
<v Speaker 1>way back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know a couple people that actually</v>

3415
02:31:08.341 --> 02:31:12.090
<v Speaker 1>sat down next to him and they talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them being the air marshal too.</v>

3416
02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:13.360
<v Speaker 1>That was a dude trying to get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>poster.</v>

3417
02:31:13.361 --> 02:31:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3418
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:16.180
<v Speaker 7>Really what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm out here for freedom.</v>

3419
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:18.500
<v Speaker 7>Where the girls told you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3420
02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 7>Fighting for freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to</v>

3421
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.890
<v Speaker 1>see my gun zip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's not my gun.</v>

3422
02:31:21.900 --> 02:31:23.670
<v Speaker 1>But you could hold that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just lock the door.</v>

3423
02:31:24.090 --> 02:31:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Just locked the door in the bathroom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying cockpit.</v>

3424
02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if everybody.</v>

3425
02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:33.460
<v Speaker 1>He locked the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plane lands everybody insides debt </v>

3426
02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:34.630
<v Speaker 1>that went and fucking kill everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can't take over the planet.</v>

3427
02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Everyone died anyway</v>

3428
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:37.250
<v Speaker 7>when died.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>

3429
02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:42.260
<v Speaker 7>they opened up the door and everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those kills the guy spending on locking </v>

3430
02:31:43.081 --> 02:31:44.220
<v Speaker 7>the door.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just shot you theory.</v>

3431
02:31:44.221 --> 02:31:49.221
<v Speaker 7>Full holes employed a navy seal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm saying as opposed not as opposed to </v>

3432
02:31:49.221 --> 02:31:49.800
<v Speaker 7>the air marshal as opposed to all the </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking things they do with that.</v>

3433
02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:52.890
<v Speaker 1>There was a good book called the strain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say.</v>

3434
02:31:52.891 --> 02:31:55.020
<v Speaker 1>It was a half of a good book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3435
02:31:55.520 --> 02:31:58.740
<v Speaker 1>It started off really good and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned to shit towards the end.</v>

3436
02:31:58.741 --> 02:32:00.780
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like he just wanted to </v>

02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to figure out what the </v>

3553
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.830
<v Speaker 1>hell they're going to do in Washington </v>
<v Speaker 1>state now and in Colorado because of the</v>

3554
02:36:40.831 --> 02:36:44.190
<v Speaker 1>legality issues that go in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking march on Washington.</v>

3555
02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:49.340
<v Speaker 1>The real question is who's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first crazy fuck to open up a store </v>

3556
02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:51.720
<v Speaker 1>and try to sell weed because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem like you can sell it.</v>

3557
02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you could have it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal to have and you can grow it.</v>

3558
02:36:55.740 --> 02:36:57.660
<v Speaker 1>It's legal to grow like up to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of plants.</v>

3559
02:36:57.661 --> 02:36:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I think they made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah know,</v>

3560
02:36:59.100 --> 02:37:04.100
<v Speaker 1>like a reasonable amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like five or six plants or something </v>

3561
02:37:04.100 --> 02:37:06.081
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you can't do is you can't sell </v>

3562
02:37:06.081 --> 02:37:06.081
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Selling it as an issue.</v>

3563
02:37:06.081 --> 02:37:10.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not legal to sell now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really defeats the purpose of </v>

3564
02:37:10.690 --> 02:37:14.250
<v Speaker 1>the idea of legalization should be taxed</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue man or one of them anywhere.</v>

3565
02:37:14.310 --> 02:37:16.610
<v Speaker 1>He should not legal your right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>

3566
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good point actually.</v>

3567
02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

3568
02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:21.620
<v Speaker 1>They should be able to make money off </v>
<v Speaker 1>that man.</v>

3569
02:37:21.621 --> 02:37:24.580
<v Speaker 1>The state should make money and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be something that benefits not</v>

3570
02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:26.500
<v Speaker 1>just the growth of your own self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3571
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:28.190
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a budweiser plant.</v>

3572
02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:30.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Van Nuys.</v>

3573
02:37:30.910 --> 02:37:35.910
<v Speaker 6>I pass by it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like one that Grove Budweiser on </v>

3574
02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:42.550
<v Speaker 6>only refreshing buds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's great that that Budweiser plant.</v>

3575
02:37:42.570 --> 02:37:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Van Nuys is great for the community.</v>

3576
02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

3577
02:37:46.601 --> 02:37:51.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean the employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that require that money </v>

3578
02:37:51.601 --> 02:37:51.601
<v Speaker 1>for their livelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3579
02:37:51.601 --> 02:37:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Employs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how many people.</v>

3580
02:37:53.251 --> 02:37:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge builder,</v>

3581
02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:56.580
<v Speaker 1>a giant parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine.</v>

3582
02:37:58.020 --> 02:37:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with Budweiser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3583
02:37:59.580 --> 02:38:04.410
<v Speaker 1>but why can't we'd have that same sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of status in a community?</v>

3584
02:38:04.411 --> 02:38:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Like why wouldn't it be looked on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law the way it should be like that.</v>

3585
02:38:07.891 --> 02:38:12.891
<v Speaker 1>It's a commodity now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can help the in the </v>

3586
02:38:12.891 --> 02:38:12.891
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can help.</v>

3587
02:38:12.891 --> 02:38:12.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we have the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3588
02:38:12.891 --> 02:38:17.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a big weed farm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They employ like 700 people in this </v>

3589
02:38:17.100 --> 02:38:17.720
<v Speaker 1>community and know everybody's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>waving,</v>

3590
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:19.560
<v Speaker 1>but it makes a good living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're selling weed.</v>

3591
02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:21.930
<v Speaker 1>The government gets the tax revenue from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3592
02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:27.260
<v Speaker 1>That is so possible and it's really kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of amazing that it's taken this long </v>

3593
02:38:28.051 --> 02:38:33.051
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the seeds get planted for that to </v>

3594
02:38:33.051 --> 02:38:36.561
<v Speaker 1>be possible because the amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a community could make off of </v>

3595
02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:38.840
<v Speaker 1>selling marijuana and the amount of tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue,</v>

3596
02:38:38.850 --> 02:38:43.850
<v Speaker 1>you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could literally change agricultural </v>

3597
02:38:43.850 --> 02:38:43.850
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

3598
02:38:43.850 --> 02:38:45.150
<v Speaker 6>She would just have to have the FDA step</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a little bit.</v>

3599
02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:48.740
<v Speaker 6>Make sure people aren't growing and like</v>
<v Speaker 6>really shitty conditions with Salmonella</v>

3600
02:38:48.741 --> 02:38:50.030
<v Speaker 6>can get out or anything like that.</v>

3601
02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to like look at shitty </v>

3602
02:38:55.500 --> 02:38:56.380
<v Speaker 1>conditions for a lot of different foods </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we ingest on a regular basis.</v>

3603
02:38:56.381 --> 02:39:01.381
<v Speaker 1>Mycotoxins are something that we've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff that I'm drinking this </v>

3604
02:39:01.381 --> 02:39:03.180
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof coffee stuff that the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

3605
02:39:03.340 --> 02:39:04.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

3606
02:39:04.031 --> 02:39:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to not drink starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

3607
02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:09.700
<v Speaker 1>You're very convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

3608
02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:14.910
<v Speaker 1>according to the Dave Asprey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a very common to have </v>

3609
02:39:14.910 --> 02:39:18.961
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins which are fungus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like different types of toxic fungus </v>

3610
02:39:20.501 --> 02:39:22.930
<v Speaker 1>that grows on coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also grow on corn.</v>

3611
02:39:22.931 --> 02:39:27.910
<v Speaker 1>They grow in a bunch of different things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says that one of the bad feelings</v>

3612
02:39:27.911 --> 02:39:32.911
<v Speaker 1>that you get from drinking coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because your body is dealing with </v>

3613
02:39:32.911 --> 02:39:34.340
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you just ingested a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of boys and feelings from coffee.</v>

3614
02:39:34.341 --> 02:39:35.930
<v Speaker 1>That I get the greatest feelings ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Summer.</v>

3615
02:39:35.950 --> 02:39:36.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

3616
02:39:36.671 --> 02:39:41.671
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually gotten like sleepy after </v>

3617
02:39:41.671 --> 02:39:42.070
<v Speaker 1>drinking coffee before and I can never </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what the fuck that was.</v>

3618
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And someone said it's because you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>80.</v>

3619
02:39:43.451 --> 02:39:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work with this stuff.</v>

3620
02:39:46.721 --> 02:39:51.721
<v Speaker 1>I don't get sleepy when I take this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff because the extra stuff is put in </v>

3621
02:39:51.721 --> 02:39:51.721
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3622
02:39:51.721 --> 02:39:55.411
<v Speaker 1>It's because mycotoxins occur when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee beans are not processed </v>

3623
02:39:55.511 --> 02:40:00.511
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That between the time of growing them </v>

3624
02:40:00.511 --> 02:40:00.550
<v Speaker 1>and between the time you getting them </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another,</v>

3625
02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:05.560
<v Speaker 1>they sat in a funky place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They develop some mold and that shit's </v>

3626
02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:07.510
<v Speaker 1>not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff that he gets is from a single</v>

3627
02:40:07.511 --> 02:40:12.511
<v Speaker 1>source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the company that grows it </v>

3628
02:40:12.511 --> 02:40:12.511
<v Speaker 1>packages it and they take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3629
02:40:12.511 --> 02:40:14.910
<v Speaker 1>They make sure that they have very non </v>
<v Speaker 1>life conditions,</v>

3630
02:40:14.911 --> 02:40:16.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they use to do that.</v>

3631
02:40:17.070 --> 02:40:22.070
<v Speaker 1>He swears by that and now when I drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and it also has grassfed </v>

3632
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:25.680
<v Speaker 1>butter in it and you blend it and butter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mct oil,</v>

3633
02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:27.180
<v Speaker 1>which is what's the grass fed butter?</v>

3634
02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Grass fed butter is butter that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from grass fed cows because apparently </v>

3635
02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:36.540
<v Speaker 1>all the cows that we're getting from </v>
<v Speaker 1>milk and all the cows that we're getting</v>

3636
02:40:36.541 --> 02:40:41.541
<v Speaker 1>for food for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're looking for grass fed </v>

3637
02:40:41.541 --> 02:40:42.780
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're eating corn and corn is not what</v>

3638
02:40:42.781 --> 02:40:44.930
<v Speaker 1>a cow supposed to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When cows eat corn,</v>

3639
02:40:44.931 --> 02:40:47.670
<v Speaker 1>they get fat as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they so delicious.</v>

3640
02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:49.920
<v Speaker 1>When they get all those layers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>marbles,</v>

3641
02:40:49.921 --> 02:40:54.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a nice fat steak and it's got </v>

3642
02:40:54.921 --> 02:40:54.921
<v Speaker 1>all that marbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll cook sop and Oh,</v>

3643
02:40:54.921 --> 02:40:56.220
<v Speaker 1>it's popping in juicy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting hungry.</v>

3644
02:40:56.221 --> 02:40:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're excited.</v>

3645
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not normal.</v>

3646
02:40:59.490 --> 02:41:02.850
<v Speaker 1>When a cow has is grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have much less fat.</v>

3647
02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have like a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat on there,</v>

3648
02:41:04.980 --> 02:41:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but they're far more lean and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really different kind of tasting meat.</v>

3649
02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:10.200
<v Speaker 1>It's much healthier system.</v>

3650
02:41:10.230 --> 02:41:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually works to burn fat it,</v>

3651
02:41:12.690 --> 02:41:15.250
<v Speaker 1>it builds muscle better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tremendous like,</v>

3652
02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:18.930
<v Speaker 1>like people were athletes swear by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of grass fed meat.</v>

3653
02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:20.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

3654
02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Would that help you if you just ate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>once in a while?</v>

3655
02:41:23.131 --> 02:41:24.990
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to fully switch like gluten,</v>

3656
02:41:24.991 --> 02:41:29.991
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna have to get completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>edited system before you start saying </v>

3657
02:41:29.991 --> 02:41:29.991
<v Speaker 1>that affects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3658
02:41:29.991 --> 02:41:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I would think that if you want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the utmost benefit,</v>

3659
02:41:32.431 --> 02:41:37.431
<v Speaker 1>you would want to take it completely out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your system and then you could still </v>

3660
02:41:37.431 --> 02:41:37.431
<v Speaker 1>have cheat days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it,</v>

3661
02:41:37.431 --> 02:41:40.170
<v Speaker 1>would it be worth somebody for somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>once in a while when they can be like,</v>

3662
02:41:40.171 --> 02:41:41.910
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me the grass fed beef still.</v>

3663
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I don't hear it every day,</v>

3664
02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:46.280
<v Speaker 1>but I try to eat it as much as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3665
02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3666
02:41:46.951 --> 02:41:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really inconvenient.</v>

3667
02:41:48.750 --> 02:41:50.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find,</v>

3668
02:41:50.641 --> 02:41:53.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's way more common than it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few years ago.</v>

3669
02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:58.050
<v Speaker 1>People because of guys like rob wolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of guys like Dave Asprey,</v>

3670
02:41:58.070 --> 02:42:03.070
<v Speaker 1>who is a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge proponent of grass fed meat and </v>

3671
02:42:03.070 --> 02:42:03.520
<v Speaker 1>grass fed milk and grassfed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3672
02:42:03.730 --> 02:42:04.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3673
02:42:04.460 --> 02:42:07.890
<v Speaker 1>the butter that you get from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the butter that you get from a corn</v>

3674
02:42:07.891 --> 02:42:10.980
<v Speaker 1>fed cow is sick and so it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3675
02:42:11.050 --> 02:42:13.200
<v Speaker 1>The butter tastes different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a weird sort of a,</v>

3676
02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a slightly different flavor </v>

3677
02:42:18.620 --> 02:42:18.620
<v Speaker 1>to the butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly different flavors.</v>

3678
02:42:18.620 --> 02:42:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It's been able to roam out fruit groves </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're free roaming.</v>

3679
02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:26.870
<v Speaker 1>The meat tastes different game and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>color is different.</v>

3680
02:42:26.980 --> 02:42:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

3681
02:42:29.311 --> 02:42:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3682
02:42:29.821 --> 02:42:34.821
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was because there were </v>

3683
02:42:34.821 --> 02:42:34.821
<v Speaker 1>weak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like this little pussy ass.</v>

3684
02:42:34.821 --> 02:42:36.420
<v Speaker 1>They don't eat insects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3685
02:42:36.421 --> 02:42:41.421
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the type of wild insects and larva and </v>

3686
02:42:41.421 --> 02:42:41.680
<v Speaker 1>shit that they dine on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3687
02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what apparently a changes the </v>

3688
02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:47.420
<v Speaker 1>color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their flesh salmon.</v>

3689
02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:48.900
<v Speaker 1>So they should have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also dyed pink.</v>

3690
02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

3691
02:42:49.771 --> 02:42:49.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3692
02:42:49.951 --> 02:42:54.951
<v Speaker 1>but those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the reasons why they died and </v>

3693
02:42:54.951 --> 02:42:58.190
<v Speaker 1>those are the ones that are pawn fed Sam</v>
<v Speaker 1>and apparently something along those </v>

3694
02:42:58.190 --> 02:42:59.610
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apparently like nutrition wise,</v>

3695
02:42:59.790 --> 02:43:04.790
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that much a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A real like a lot of people think there </v>

3696
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.790
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

3697
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know exactly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>measuring when you.</v>

3698
02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many salmon filets get broken</v>
<v Speaker 1>down by vitamin content?</v>

3699
02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.490
<v Speaker 1>How often are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3700
02:43:12.491 --> 02:43:17.491
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what control group where they work in </v>

3701
02:43:17.491 --> 02:43:17.491
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3702
02:43:17.491 --> 02:43:17.850
<v Speaker 1>what tests that they've done on salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I just talking out of my ass?</v>

3703
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Ari?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear control of it,</v>

3704
02:43:19.661 --> 02:43:20.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3705
02:43:21.410 --> 02:43:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't think those pellets can be </v>

3706
02:43:26.410 --> 02:43:26.410
<v Speaker 1>as good as all those bugs they eat.</v>

3707
02:43:26.410 --> 02:43:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably better.</v>

3708
02:43:26.410 --> 02:43:28.990
<v Speaker 1>That's an actual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When wild salmon tastes better.</v>

3709
02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Does it tastes different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tastes different.</v>

3710
02:43:31.770 --> 02:43:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saw that juicy bug juice you're getting </v>

3711
02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:36.770
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delicious bug juice.</v>

3712
02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3713
02:43:37.661 --> 02:43:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3714
02:43:38.261 --> 02:43:40.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't like the taste of </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

3715
02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:45.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people like they think that </v>

3716
02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Venice and tastes funky and I've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>had bear.</v>

3717
02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had parents who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's who sorts bear?</v>

3718
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:51.240
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Special Shit.</v>

3719
02:43:51.490 --> 02:43:53.920
<v Speaker 1>According to Steven now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who'll be on the podcast Monday.</v>

3720
02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Hala.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Praise Odin.</v>

3721
02:43:56.020 --> 02:43:57.700
<v Speaker 1>A corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Rinella.</v>

3722
02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:02.470
<v Speaker 1>If a bear is eating blueberries and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spring fucking delicious.</v>

3723
02:44:02.770 --> 02:44:07.770
<v Speaker 1>You said when they get out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right when they get out of their dens </v>

3724
02:44:07.770 --> 02:44:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and they start eating massive amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>blueberries.</v>

3725
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they taste so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bear does.</v>

3726
02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you find a baptist near blueberries </v>

3727
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and they eat a shitload of blueberries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's most their diet like blue flesh,</v>

3728
02:44:17.190 --> 02:44:19.960
<v Speaker 1>like they're fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fat is like blue,</v>

3729
02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:21.760
<v Speaker 1>like he saves their bear fat.</v>

3730
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:24.830
<v Speaker 1>He's seems like cooks with it and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3731
02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's unbelievably good.</v>

3732
02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3733
02:44:27.580 --> 02:44:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but it can vary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get a bear and like New </v>

3734
02:44:32.580 --> 02:44:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you apparently don't like to eat </v>

3735
02:44:34.890 --> 02:44:34.890
<v Speaker 1>brown bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like to eat black bears.</v>

3736
02:44:34.890 --> 02:44:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Brown bears don't taste good because </v>
<v Speaker 1>brown bears are mostly predators.</v>

3737
02:44:37.150 --> 02:44:38.670
<v Speaker 1>So they're full of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3738
02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:40.120
<v Speaker 1>they're full of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're mostly,</v>

3739
02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:43.090
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of them are full of fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>like grizzlies,</v>

3740
02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:46.060
<v Speaker 1>but a black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what the is vegetables.</v>

3741
02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:51.480
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get them and they eat like a </v>

3742
02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:52.150
<v Speaker 1>lot of blueberries are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're eating like your garbage,</v>

3743
02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:57.180
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suburban New Jersey has a real problem </v>

3744
02:44:57.180 --> 02:44:57.180
<v Speaker 1>with bears and just eat whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can find.</v>

3745
02:44:57.180 --> 02:45:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Black bears get into suburban </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods like place where like Jim </v>

3746
02:45:01.770 --> 02:45:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Brewer lives and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go and they tip over garbage </v>

3747
02:45:05.430 --> 02:45:08.851
<v Speaker 1>cans and they just eat all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's food and they become a real </v>

3748
02:45:08.851 --> 02:45:11.521
<v Speaker 1>problem because once they know that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can come into a neighborhood and eat </v>

3749
02:45:11.521 --> 02:45:13.060
<v Speaker 1>garbage and everybody's a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>through anything.</v>

3750
02:45:13.150 --> 02:45:18.150
<v Speaker 1>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they opened up hunting season on </v>

3751
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.150
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they open up hunting season,</v>

3752
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:22.201
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people went out and hunted these </v>

3753
02:45:22.201 --> 02:45:23.701
<v Speaker 1>bands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they found out the bears that were </v>

3754
02:45:23.701 --> 02:45:23.830
<v Speaker 1>near people that tasted like shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage,</v>

3755
02:45:24.130 --> 02:45:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3756
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:29.670
<v Speaker 1>they're just fucking donuts and whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck they find in a parking lot </v>

3757
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.750
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and never see the wild boys </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

3758
02:45:29.751 --> 02:45:34.751
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had tried to lower bear into their </v>

3759
02:45:34.751 --> 02:45:34.751
<v Speaker 1>tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3760
02:45:34.751 --> 02:45:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Those were like that video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that chick doing the back flip.</v>

3761
02:45:36.791 --> 02:45:41.791
<v Speaker 1>I could barely watch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what the fuck do you ever see the </v>

3762
02:45:41.791 --> 02:45:42.700
<v Speaker 1>one where they were throwing a ham </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and these hyenas,</v>

3763
02:45:42.701 --> 02:45:44.520
<v Speaker 1>they're playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep away.</v>

3764
02:45:46.210 --> 02:45:47.570
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to eat it.</v>

3765
02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:48.880
<v Speaker 1>They're nipping at them.</v>

3766
02:45:51.490 --> 02:45:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Can literally break right through your </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>

3767
02:45:54.780 --> 02:45:58.630
<v Speaker 1>It would just bite through your arm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hand would fall one side.</v>

3768
02:45:58.750 --> 02:46:03.750
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of your arm would go lamp </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would take that piece out of </v>

3769
02:46:03.750 --> 02:46:04.720
<v Speaker 1>the middle out and it'd be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's cool.</v>

3770
02:46:04.750 --> 02:46:06.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the heinous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now snap.</v>

3771
02:46:06.460 --> 02:46:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

3772
02:46:08.410 --> 02:46:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the one when he got up in the </v>

3773
02:46:13.410 --> 02:46:15.560
<v Speaker 1>tree and the lion climbed up and got on </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of him and just started touching his</v>

3774
02:46:15.561 --> 02:46:20.480
<v Speaker 1>hat and didn't kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that Brian on the podcast.</v>

3775
02:46:21.340 --> 02:46:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got so close so many times out of his </v>

3776
02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:27.380
<v Speaker 1>fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking mind in jacket.</v>

3777
02:46:27.381 --> 02:46:32.381
<v Speaker 1>He hooked himself or the nipple with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hook and then they us for real man by </v>

3778
02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:38.250

<v Speaker 1>constructive.</v>

3839
02:49:07.121 --> 02:49:07.121
<v Speaker 1>constructive criticism that I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard,</v>

3840
02:49:07.230 --> 02:49:10.800
<v Speaker 1>whether it was from my time time hosting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fear factor,</v>

3841
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:16.070
<v Speaker 1>whether it's from doing the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary or whether it's from doing </v>

3842
02:49:16.070 --> 02:49:19.671

3843
02:49:19.671 --> 02:49:19.671
<v Speaker 1>better at what I do.</v>

02:50:37.791 --> 02:50:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm better now than I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>been before.</v>

3873
02:50:39.390 --> 02:50:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Definitely had the most experience being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comic on this one.</v>

3874
02:50:43.290 --> 02:50:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked my last one.</v>

3875
02:50:45.061 --> 02:50:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I really liked shiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy jihad.</v>

3876
02:50:46.591 --> 02:50:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I really liked talking monkey's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

3877
02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I think everything that I've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>since I stopped doing fear factors,</v>

3878
02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:52.280
<v Speaker 1>my best stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3879
02:50:52.470 --> 02:50:54.360
<v Speaker 1>from that 2006 on.</v>

3880
02:50:54.370 --> 02:50:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

3882
02:50:55.441 --> 02:50:57.240
<v Speaker 1>But I think this is the best one at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

3883
02:50:57.660 --> 02:50:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I just think I'm better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3884
02:50:59.430 --> 02:51:03.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of spending time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice reaction has been really good.</v>

3885
02:51:03.690 --> 02:51:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3887
02:51:06.511 --> 02:51:07.710
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super happy with it.</v>

3888
02:51:07.950 --> 02:51:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few complaints only that I had</v>

3889
02:51:10.741 --> 02:51:13.020
<v Speaker 1>talked about some of the subjects on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

3890
02:51:13.021 --> 02:51:18.021
<v Speaker 1>but that's impossible to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing podcasts for three hours a </v>

3891
02:51:18.021 --> 02:51:21.471
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

3892
02:51:21.471 --> 02:51:23.240
