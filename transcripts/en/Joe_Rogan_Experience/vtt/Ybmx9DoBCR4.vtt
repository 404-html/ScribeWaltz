00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:01.801
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Speaker 1>he's not being mean.</v>

4
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I stopped doing racial jokes,</v>

5
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>like being heavy on racial jokes just cause I was like,</v>

6
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know.</v>

7
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

8
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

9
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't give a shit enough about equality to put my job on the line to try</v>

10
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>to make everyone even like I'll,</v>

11
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll get into nights if it's an all black room.</v>

12
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I just do black jokes but not mean,</v>

13
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:20.641
<v Speaker 1>but just what I do.</v>

14
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:21.474
<v Speaker 1>Black jokes.</v>

15
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.433
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

16
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.281
<v Speaker 1>and then you do that.</v>

17
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:23.761
<v Speaker 1>Once you do that,</v>

18
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>you have a fucking power of attorney to do anything.</v>

19
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Cause even the clean people go my kid's finger,</v>

20
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>they're asked to write right now and then,</v>

21
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.093
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

22
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>and then I talked to the audience a little when you were saying that you,</v>

23
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>you used to do a real racist jokes or racial jokes,</v>

25
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.673
<v Speaker 1>racial jokes,</v>

26
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>w you and you stopped doing them because they offended too many people.</v>

28
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

29
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I never gotten,</v>

30
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>no one ever got offended,</v>

31
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>but I just noticed that I was up for one.</v>

32
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I was obsessing on it.</v>

33
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

34
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I would write,</v>

35
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I could write all day long.</v>

36
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I could write jokes about black people.</v>

37
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>if you've sent me,</v>

39
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

40
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>if you put me in a room with a black audience,</v>

41
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>all I'll do is talk about black people all I'll do.</v>

42
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>And like now the dirt,</v>

43
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>the one only the furthest I go is I have a joke about,</v>

44
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.313
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

46
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.371
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

48
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I think is racist that they don't make black baby powder.</v>

49
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.971
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

50
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I just think that from a company named Johnson and Johnson,</v>

51
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>they would have thought of that by now.</v>

52
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.861
<v Speaker 1>And then they go,</v>

53
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

54
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.800
<v Speaker 1>that's home and make $1 million.</v>

56
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna make by baby powder.</v>

57
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.911
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

58
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.393
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

60
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll call it magic Johnson and Johnson's.</v>

61
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So then one night there's one,</v>

62
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.851
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

63
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 1>One night this black dude's,</v>

64
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>it's of an audience in Miami.</v>

65
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.054
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

66
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>hey motherfucker,</v>

67
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.191
<v Speaker 1>when you get done,</v>

68
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you did a joke about black baby powder.</v>

69
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you I don't make shit.</v>

70
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.593
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>

71
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm think I'm done with a joke now.</v>

72
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Like with,</v>

73
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>why don't they make it?</v>

74
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:41.364
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

75
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a problem with moisture the way you guys do it goes.</v>

76
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.930
<v Speaker 1>Every time I hung a white guy,</v>

77
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like hugging a dolphin.</v>

78
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

79
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>black people have a problem retaining moisture.</v>

80
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>So they have a problems getting ashy so they have to always stay moist.</v>

81
00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Whereas white people are constantly fucking moist.</v>

82
00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.933
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

83
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.601
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like,</v>

84
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>they just never needed black baby powder like people don't use.</v>

85
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.741
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

86
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>but it was awesome.</v>

87
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>It was like a great moment.</v>

88
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I love dude,</v>

89
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:09.174
<v Speaker 1>if I could,</v>

90
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.100

<v Speaker 1>You can't follow that.</v>

191
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Can't follow it.</v>

192
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

193
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.080
<v Speaker 1>and I've white glow in the dark Casper that goes Dick.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was beautiful and it was big.</v>

196
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.140
<v Speaker 1>It was big.</v>

197
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.761
<v Speaker 1>I swear to you.</v>

198
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.251
<v Speaker 1>It was big.</v>

199
00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:20.084
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

200
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.751
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

201
00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I was like fucking and then and then they all waited for me out at the bar and</v>

202
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:24.680
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

203
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.921
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

204
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:25.760
<v Speaker 1>we're taking you out.</v>

205
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.623
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

206
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.640
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't end this way.</v>

207
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I love it when he bombs</v>

208
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.570
<v Speaker 1>so rare.</v>

209
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:34.940
<v Speaker 1>He's really fucking funny man.</v>

210
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:38.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like when it's like when you shoot a bear with a bow and Arrow,</v>

211
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.620
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know they've been injured yet,</v>

212
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Speaker 1>but they know there has to be shot with a bow and arrow.</v>

213
00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I watched a lot of hunting.</v>

214
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I watched a lot of hunting videos like I used to.</v>

215
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

216
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.731
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

217
00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 1>if I ever got too fucked up within,</v>

218
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.281
<v Speaker 1>I'd watch hunting.</v>

219
00:04:49.281 --> 00:04:49.821
<v Speaker 1>In Florida,</v>

220
00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:52.730
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to get really bear bear hunting from,</v>

221
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

222
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.841
<v Speaker 1>you've done it.</v>

223
00:04:53.841 --> 00:04:54.291
<v Speaker 1>I've never done it,</v>

224
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:55.520
<v Speaker 1>but all the videos are,</v>

225
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 1>they like put a box out full of food and then they'd sit in a tent and then the</v>

226
00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:02.090
<v Speaker 1>bear would come out and they shoot it with a bow and Arrow and the bear would</v>

227
00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:02.924
<v Speaker 1>get hit.</v>

228
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.830
<v Speaker 1>But it would almost feel,</v>

229
00:05:03.831 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Speaker 1>it would seem like the bear be like,</v>

230
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.181
<v Speaker 1>ow,</v>

231
00:05:05.181 --> 00:05:06.014
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was that?</v>

232
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.660
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd see the look in the bear's face where they'd be like,</v>

233
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel good.</v>

234
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go rest for a little bit.</v>

235
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.440
<v Speaker 1>That's how Supergirl girl looks.</v>

236
00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:13.274
<v Speaker 1>When he bombs.</v>

237
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.503
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

238
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.901
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

239
00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:15.500
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

240
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.771
<v Speaker 1>he like,</v>

241
00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:16.700
<v Speaker 1>he looks at you like,</v>

242
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 1>did I get,</v>

243
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.293
<v Speaker 1>I get hit?</v>

244
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.801
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

245
00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:19.131
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

246
00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:19.641
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

247
00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 1>he's been hit by an arrow.</v>

248
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.010
<v Speaker 1>My favorite one was in,</v>

262
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.230

263
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's totally fine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

270
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Tom's opening joke.</v>

271
00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:44.901
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

272

277
00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:54.650
<v Speaker 1>So then he says I got lost walking around.</v>

278
00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Luckily a Japanese guy pointed out the directions.</v>

279
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.891
<v Speaker 1>Those Japanese?</v>

280

<v Speaker 1>I went up,</v>

295
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:23.931
<v Speaker 1>I was a little dirty.</v>

296
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I think Tom went up,</v>

297
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.024
<v Speaker 1>had a rough set.</v>

298
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>He kind of want them back.</v>

299
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 1>We know Tom is not right for corporate gig in that opinion.</v>

300
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>And there's a corporate game gives the,</v>

301
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

302
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>it was like maybe I want to say 3000 people on at Pearl Harbor sitting in lawn</v>

303
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>chairs with their families.</v>

304
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>What was the Gig like?</v>

305
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:40.551
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

306
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 1>who is it for?</v>

307
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.991
<v Speaker 1>For the Pearl.</v>

308
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:42.824
<v Speaker 1>For the USO.</v>

309
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

310
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 1>that's on,</v>

311
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.690
<v Speaker 1>that's a military guy.</v>

312
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

313
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Corporate kid will be that same.</v>

314
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Same Energy.</v>

315
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.941
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

316
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 1>and so then Tom sits next to me.</v>

317
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>This is my favorite part.</v>

318
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Thompson texted me and Russell Peters comes on stage and you can hear there's a</v>

319
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 1>murmuring now mind you,</v>

320
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 1>we're at war with Iraq and Russell Peters is a little brown for their taste.</v>

321
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>And Tom Goes,</v>

322
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I never realized he looks like the enemy.</v>

323
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>And Russell Peters is by the way,</v>

324
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>didn't acknowledge it did had a great set,</v>

325
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 1>but you could hear that kind of like they brought up one of the like and Tom and</v>

326
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I were in the back.</v>

327
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Like this is bad.</v>

328
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.293
<v Speaker 1>We the next day.</v>

329
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

330
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was bad because he was brown.</v>

332
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>It was only because we had gone to rifle training the day before and Russell had</v>

333
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 1>randomly chose not to go randomly.</v>

334
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 1>And the first words that rifle training was,</v>

335
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.720
<v Speaker 1>there's one rule here.</v>

336
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 1>If it's Brown,</v>

337
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.921
<v Speaker 1>it moves.</v>

338
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:34.754
<v Speaker 1>You kill it.</v>

339
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.893
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

340
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.771

429
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 1>And if I do this all day long,</v>

432
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sound like a psycho into five minutes.</v>

433
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 1>You could take the freight elevator to the basement and no one could get down</v>

434
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>there cause you had the elevator.</v>

435
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.210

441
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.211
<v Speaker 1>And then it was,</v>

442
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:51.871
<v Speaker 1>there was no AC.</v>

443
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>So then I'd wait and I called down,</v>

444
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>put all my clothes back on,</v>

445
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 1>getting the freight elevator walk up and I just killed like 30 minutes.</v>

446
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 1>When you have a job like that to kill 30 minutes is a,</v>

447
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like fucking calm that much closer to being over done.</v>

448
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.621
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

449
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:05.000
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

450
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>and I'm eating rip fuel.</v>

451
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 1>You remember ritual pop and fucking three refuels every three hours,</v>

452
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

453
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

454
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Like a tweaker running around Shelvin travel books,</v>

455
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 1>going down to the basement,</v>

456
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:15.810
<v Speaker 1>pounding like I'm in fucking Oz</v>

457
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>and then come up sweating like a motherfucker with a name tag on.</v>

458
00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

459
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

460
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>and so like two weeks into it,</v>

461
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:25.140
<v Speaker 1>my boss Duane pulls me aside and he was like,</v>

462
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:25.531
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

463
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

465
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

466
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:28.981
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

467
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:31.020
<v Speaker 1>cause I got to get travel books and that's where we keep them all down there.</v>

468
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

469
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:31.801
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

470

<v Speaker 1>do you know we have video cameras?</v>

471
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.630
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

472
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

473
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.451
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

474
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking fired.</v>

475
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

476
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 1>I can explain to you is no I can't,</v>

479
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I can't have someone getting into their underwear basement working out when they</v>

480
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 1>should be working and then coming back up and then interacting with people and I</v>

481
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:56.310
<v Speaker 1>was trying to be a comic so I was trying to think alternatively and I'm on</v>

482
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 1>speed,</v>

483
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.280
<v Speaker 1>which is Kim.</v>

484
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.830
<v Speaker 1>So theoretically like I would do funny shit,</v>

485
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 1>but it was crazy if you didn't know me exactly.</v>

486
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Some guy told me that the day we were doing a promo shoot phrase Steve TV and I</v>

487
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 1>did a joke at the end of the day like it was that funny.</v>

488
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:11.401
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

489
00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Bert,</v>

490
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>everything you do is only funny if you spent fucking 24 hours with you.</v>

491
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.791
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah.</v>

492
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 1>So I got fired and then came home.</v>

493
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll be great to have that tape if anyone at Barnes a level.</v>

494
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And so God,</v>

495
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 1>his name is Dwayne.</v>

496
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I remember he asked me if I wanted to be a manager like a week before that and I</v>

497
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:27.691
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

498
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

499
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:28.801
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

500
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

501
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:29.851
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

502
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:30.151
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

503
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:30.871
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be manager.</v>

504
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:31.171
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

505
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

506
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.101
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

507
00:11:32.101 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

508
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.323
<v Speaker 1>Why do you,</v>

509
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.680
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do?</v>

510
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:35.241
<v Speaker 1>Then I was like,</v>

511
00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:36.074
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a comedian.</v>

512
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.081
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

513
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

514
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 1>this isn't what I do.</v>

515
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me dead in the face.</v>

516
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:39.451
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

517
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do.</v>

518
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 1>This is who you are.</v>

519
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 1>You worked at Barnes and noble.</v>

520
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Don't think you're better than us.</v>

521
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.244
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

522
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.571
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

523
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of here soon.</v>

524
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I was going to get fired,</v>

525
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:51.650
<v Speaker 1>but don't think you're better than us with Burke.</v>

526
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Chrysler was telling what I smell might be one of the great stories.</v>

527
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:55.961
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he shit his pants.</v>

587
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

588
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.640
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you just use the bathroom?</v>

589
00:12:57.641 --> 00:12:57.851
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

590
00:12:57.851 --> 00:12:58.331
<v Speaker 1>where's the bathroom?</v>

591
00:12:58.331 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 1>She goes downstairs and I went,</v>

592
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.101
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

593
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I probably should have told him that and so</v>

594
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I was in panic mode.</v>

595
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 1>It was black Friday and I'm waiting in line too when I've got a leather jacket</v>

596
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:09.541
<v Speaker 1>on sale,</v>

597
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's even worse I think if you shit your pants in line for the bathroom</v>

598
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 1>because then everybody's going to know if there's a big line of people and you</v>

599
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:17.530
<v Speaker 1>just blow up is dumping your pants,</v>

600
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 1>then you're like close proximity.</v>

601
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 1>No way to play off shitting your pain when you shit your pants.</v>

602
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 1>I say this shitting your pants is a lot like getting a Dui.</v>

603
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.930
<v Speaker 1>You roll the dice so much and get away with it that when you do get caught with</v>

604
00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:29.770
<v Speaker 1>your hand and cookie jar,</v>

605
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you're like mother fucker and then she never thought that was going to happen.</v>

606
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

607
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.380
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

608
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Why today?</v>

609
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's so true.</v>

610
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.020
<v Speaker 1>When his thirties he was running marathons and he used to shoot his pants all</v>

611
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.590
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

612
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Not even like,</v>

613
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even saying like,</v>

614
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even saying like,</v>

615
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 1>oh once a month.</v>

616
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking once a week.</v>

617
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 1>He would,</v>

618
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.020
<v Speaker 1>this is before cell phones too.</v>

619
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 1>He was in his thirties he was in his thirties I was a,</v>

620
00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.111
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid.</v>

621
00:13:56.111 --> 00:13:59.590
<v Speaker 1>We were living in north Tampa and not in like the nicer north Tampa,</v>

622
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 1>but in the Shittier redneck verse,</v>

623
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Black North Tampa.</v>

624
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 1>And a first time I ever heard her,</v>

625
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:05.800
<v Speaker 1>the n word was in this neighborhood.</v>

626
00:14:05.801 --> 00:14:06.820
<v Speaker 1>But my dad used to run marathons,</v>

627
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 1>so we'd run like five miles,</v>

628
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:09.641
<v Speaker 1>10 miles,</v>

629
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.590
<v Speaker 1>and you can go out and on these 10 mile runs,</v>

630
00:14:11.591 --> 00:14:12.424
<v Speaker 1>he shit his pants.</v>

631
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.080
<v Speaker 1>So he go into these orange groves,</v>

632
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:14.921
<v Speaker 1>shit himself,</v>

633
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

634
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Clean himself the best he could and then run home.</v>

635
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 1>But there were some nights,</v>

636
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I remember these distinctly,</v>

637
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.630
<v Speaker 1>it was before cell phones were to get dark and my mom's like,</v>

638
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.950
<v Speaker 1>we've got to go look for your dad.</v>

639
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.190
<v Speaker 1>And we'd be driving his route where he'd run and all of a sudden like a naked</v>

640
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:27.700
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

641
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 1>My Dad would come out of the fucking orange groves.</v>

642
00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

643
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:30.640

644
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.260
<v Speaker 1>give me in the car right now.</v>

645
00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>If he knew who he come get him,</v>

646
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.040
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

647
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:35.730
<v Speaker 1>it would be.</v>

648
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I remember thundering lightning and he's just sitting in an orange grove naked.</v>

649
00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:38.831
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

650
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:40.620
<v Speaker 1>how did he shit his pants and,</v>

651
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.520
<v Speaker 1>and we'd be like over here and he'd be like,</v>

652
00:14:42.521 --> 00:14:42.881
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

653
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:43.810
<v Speaker 1>and you just hop in the front seat,</v>

654
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.261

655
00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:45.970

657
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.020
<v Speaker 1>He hates my stories.</v>

658
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:50.621
<v Speaker 1>I hope someone,</v>

659
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:51.650

674
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even go lucid.</v>

675
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't try to control it or move around.</v>

676
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I just let the dream play out.</v>

677
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 1>But I realized it was a dream and I still didn't wake up.</v>

678
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

679
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a rare thing.</v>

680
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Pills just for that shit.</v>

681
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.451
<v Speaker 1>Dreams.</v>

682
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I have dreams,</v>

683
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I have fucking crazy dreams,</v>

684
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:28.520
<v Speaker 1>but I am totally lucid inside my dreams.</v>

685
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Like all dreams that I'm reading something and I'll go,</v>

686
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll be,</v>

687
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:32.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go.</v>

688
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:32.511
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

689
00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 1>that's so funny that I'm reading something because nothing's there in the dream.</v>

690
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I'll pick this.</v>

691
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's there in my mind is making up these words,</v>

692
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still reading them.</v>

693
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 1>That's so interesting.</v>

694
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I had a dream one time that me and Elvis walked into his hotel room and there</v>

695
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:44.901
<v Speaker 1>were four dudes,</v>

696
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:45.630
<v Speaker 1>but fucking</v>

697
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:45.990
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

698
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.180
<v Speaker 2>and I just hear me where they were.</v>

699
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 1>So just that might be one of the best sentences ever created.</v>

700
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I had a dream that I was with Elvis and we walked into his dressing room.</v>

701
00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:57.770
<v Speaker 1>There was four dudes,</v>

702
00:15:57.771 --> 00:15:59.210
<v Speaker 1>but fucking dot,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dot,</v>

704
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 1>dot.</v>

705
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Now hear me out.</v>

706
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.950
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

707
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:03.231
<v Speaker 2>Weirder.</v>

708
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:05.430
<v Speaker 2>They're throwing up in Burger King cups should</v>

709
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.450
<v Speaker 2>just fucking each other.</v>

710
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And then I swear to you when I say this,</v>

711
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 2>I fucking just shut the door.</v>

712
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:12.891
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at Elvis.</v>

713
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:13.071
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

714
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's going on in your room?</v>

715
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 2>He said to me,</v>

00:16:22.851 --> 00:16:23.421
<v Speaker 2>I wake up.</v>

00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:25.960

722
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.430
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>

729
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.210

<v Speaker 1>you just don't know that they are.</v>

734
00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:50.110
<v Speaker 1>It's way to interject advertising into your dream.</v>

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:50.993
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

736
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.070
<v Speaker 1>burger king in the future.</v>

745
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.140

747
00:17:07.231 --> 00:17:11.880
<v Speaker 1>experimental thing that would make you think about burger king in a dream and</v>
