00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.101
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

3
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>you've kicked the green bitch.</v>

5
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.961
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

7
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>After a 24 year intense relationship with the,</v>

8
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>the green goddess or the Green Bitch,</v>

10
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>depending on what mood she's in,</v>

11
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop.</v>

12
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.313
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

14
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I've come in for some,</v>

15
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I've convinced for some,</v>

16
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 1>for some criticism for their son and I feel it's important to say that,</v>

17
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I hugely value and a love cannabis.</v>

19
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a wonderful herbal ally and I think that,</v>

20
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I would ever have written my books off historical mystery if</v>

21
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I had not encountered cannabis rather late in life.</v>

22
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I did not smoke,</v>

23
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Dope until I was 37 years old and I'm now 62 wire and roughly rad about</v>

25
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>the age of 38.</v>

26
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>That's when I started getting into historical mysteries for that.</v>

27
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>It was all,</v>

28
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.811
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

29
00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>it's total stoner style.</v>

30
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.443
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

31
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Before that it was all carried.</v>

32
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:02.671
<v Speaker 1>The fairs,</v>

33
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

35
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>but suddenly something opened up for me and I'm very,</v>

36
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>and I'm very grateful to the herb for that.</v>

37
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And initially my eye,</v>

38
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.271
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

39
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I need to emphasize this.</v>

40
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem I eventually ended up having with cannabis,</v>

41
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not the fault of cannabis,</v>

42
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>it's the fault of Graham Hancock.</v>

43
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I think my relationship became abusive with the herb.</v>

44
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 1>It was not initially.</v>

45
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Initially it was something I would do evenings and weekends.</v>

46
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I would not try to write while I was actually stoned.</v>

47
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I would do my days work and then chill out in the evening with a pipe or a</v>

48
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>joint.</v>

49
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

50
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>that was how it was for me for quite awhile.</v>

51
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And I went through my first big historical mystery book,</v>

52
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>the sign and the seal,</v>

53
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>which was published in 1992 with that pattern.</v>

55
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.401
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

56
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>that I would be,</v>

57
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I would be smoking only after I down tools at the end of the evening and I was</v>

58
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>ready to chill.</v>

59
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>and that worked fine.</v>

61
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>But then when I started,</v>

62
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>when I started writing fingerprints of the gods,</v>

63
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>which was the biggest book I've,</v>

64
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I've ever done,</v>

65
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>a 5 million copy bestseller all around the world,</v>

66
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>when I started writing that,</v>

67
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:06.901
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

68
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll experiment.</v>

69
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if I can be stoned and right.</v>

70
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>And I discovered that I could,</v>

71
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.893
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be stolen.</v>

72
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.733
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

73
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>And I like being stuck so much that in a way it,</v>

74
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>it urged me to just write all the time,</v>

75
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>because then I had this,</v>

77
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I had this incredibly good reason to be stoned all the time and,</v>

78
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

79
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>it took away all the physical boredom of sitting there in my chair in front of</v>

80
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>my computer screen,</v>

81
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Speaker 1>just everything went away and I went into,</v>

82
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>drifted into this space where I could explore ideas and manifest those ideas</v>

83
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

84
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>down on the page.</v>

85
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>And I literally,</v>

86
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>that's when I began what was to become ultimately an abusive relationship with</v>

87
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:51.031
<v Speaker 1>cannabis,</v>

88
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>which that I would fire up in those days,</v>

89
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:57.810
<v Speaker 1>might my joint or my pipe at a nine or 10 in the morning.</v>

90
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.003
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>

91
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hard worker.</v>

92
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I work 16 hours a day very often when I'm writing.</v>

93
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>So come two o'clock the next morning,</v>

94
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd still be there smoking away.</v>

95
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

96
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>and as the years went by,</v>

97
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>this became a permanent daily pattern for me.</v>

98
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Whether I was writing or not,</v>

99
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I would be stoned from the moment I got up until the moment I went to bed.</v>

100
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>And most people who came by my house or talk to me on the phone,</v>

101
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>they would have had absolutely no idea because I was,</v>

102
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>I was completely in control.</v>

103
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't seem hi,</v>

104
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I could hold a rational conversation.</v>

105
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.051
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

106
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I was just fine.</v>

107
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.521
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

108
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>and I've just felt,</v>

109
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I just felt really good.</v>

110
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

111
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>and this is how it went on for many years.</v>

112
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:37.991
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

113
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>later on about in the early to that Renova 2005 actually I think perhaps a</v>

114
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.114
<v Speaker 1>little earlier,</v>

115
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>one of my kids told me that,</v>

116
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:45.161
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>

118
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>this smoke is,</v>

119
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to have combustion products.</v>

120
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you use a vaporizer?</v>

121
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.140
<v Speaker 1>So I bought myself a volcano and on the Internet and,</v>

122
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.703
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

123
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>and then I heard that the British government was going to ban the use of ban all</v>

124
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:01.594
<v Speaker 1>peripherals.</v>

125
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>So I bought myself two more volcanoes.</v>

126
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Volcanoes are quite expensive,</v>

127
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 1>but that shows how dedicated I was to make sure that you're covering your bases.</v>

128
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I had to make sure that I covered my bases.</v>

129
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

130
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and then I would be vaporizing from nine in the morning until two o'clock the</v>

131
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:15.101
<v Speaker 1>next morning,</v>

132
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:15.980
<v Speaker 1>seven days a weekend,</v>

133
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>and increasingly strong strains.</v>

134
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>And this is one thing that I would say if we lived in a regime and irrational</v>

135
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>regime where there was no attempt by the government to police our states of</v>

136
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:26.314
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

137
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>we could have much more choice in the kind of cannabis we get hold of.</v>

138
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:30.191
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

139
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I would have liked to have canvas with much more CBD and maybe less THC.</v>

140
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>But the varieties I were smoking were very,</v>

141
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>very THC,</v>

142
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>THC,</v>

143
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

144
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>loaded as the difference in effect.</v>

145
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:43.841
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

147
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:44.674
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

148
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>it depends how much you buy into the research on this,</v>

149
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

150
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>but the law,</v>

151
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 1>a lot of good science has been done.</v>

152
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:55.441
<v Speaker 1>And the suggestion is that THC can promote or reveal.</v>

153
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

154
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to blame the herb.</v>

155
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Anything I,</v>

156
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>it can reveal certain psychotic tendencies in oneself.</v>

157
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>And this is the well known paranoia,</v>

158
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

159
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.080
<v Speaker 1>which many people associate with,</v>

160
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>with smoking cannabis.</v>

161
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.200
<v Speaker 1>The CBD is an antipsychotic agent.</v>

162
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>So the natural herb is balanced with CBD and THC and,</v>

163
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>and it looks after you very well,</v>

164
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>but where we go into intensive breeding of the herb,</v>

165
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the element that makes you really high,</v>

166
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>which is the Thc,</v>

167
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>then we get,</v>

168
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>get a herb that is somewhat unbalanced as a result of the interference of,</v>

170
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.281
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

171
00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:31.501
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

172
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:32.334
<v Speaker 1>of humanity and,</v>

173
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

174
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

175
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>but you get more bang for your buck.</v>

176
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:35.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

177
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:35.914
<v Speaker 1>that's a very,</v>

178
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>that's a very strong herb.</v>

179
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And I began to like a particular variety called cheese,</v>

180
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called cheese because it smells like old socks or,</v>

181
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:46.871
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

182
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

183
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Stilton in like a blue cheese.</v>

184
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.760
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

185
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I found a grower who lived local to me who,</v>

186
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:56.250
<v Speaker 1>who was just heading amazing green fingers and,</v>

187
00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:57.084
<v Speaker 1>and I would,</v>

188
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I would buy from him and um,</v>

189
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>and I would sometimes have,</v>

190
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>five or six ounces of the herb in my house cause I was blazing through this</v>

192
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>stuff at the vendors at a tremendous rate.</v>

193
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.240
<v Speaker 1>That's enough to you where you could get in trouble for that.</v>

194
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the paranoia starts to become legitimate,</v>

195
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:13.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>because actually they can numb,</v>

197
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>they can break down your door and they can confiscate your home and take away</v>

198
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 1>your liberty and fuck you up forever.</v>

199
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

200
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>they can do that.</v>

201
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:22.161
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

202
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:25.220
<v Speaker 1>and so every time I had a ring at the door or you know,</v>

203
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>a car came up the street,</v>

204
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

205
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

206
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.371
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

208
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:28.661
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

209
00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>get paranoid and get paranoid.</v>

210
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>And you were high and I was high and I was high.</v>

211
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>You get paranoid when you were a high,</v>

212
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

213
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the reasons why,</v>

214
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.960
<v Speaker 1>look what happened to me was that run about 2003,</v>

215
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I started for reasons of research initially,</v>

216
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>working with Iowasca,</v>

218
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>the vine of souls.</v>

219
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>This is the powerful psychedelic brew,</v>

220
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.940
<v Speaker 1>which has been consumed by shamanistic cultures in the Amazon for thousands and</v>

221
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

222
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And it's not called the vine of souls for nothing.</v>

223
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:04.694
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

224
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

225
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

226
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.041
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

227
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>it's an extraordinary portal into other realms.</v>

228
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

229
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>and in some ways,</v>

230
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:15.060
<v Speaker 1>those realms are associated with death and perhaps of what waits for us after</v>

231
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.261
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

232
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows the answer to that.</v>

233
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:17.354
<v Speaker 1>But in I was,</v>

234
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you have certain experiences relating to that and right from the beginning when</v>

235
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I started to drink Iowasca,</v>

236
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean this sounds nuts to anybody who hasn't done DMT or who hasn't drunk</v>

237
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca but you do meet intelligent entities and more and more around the world,</v>

238
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>people drinking Iowasca a meeting,</v>

239
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>this goddess figure,</v>

240
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>she might appear as a serpent,</v>

241
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>she might appear as a woman,</v>

242
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 1>she might appear as some kind of panther or Jaguar,</v>

243
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 1>a very powerful,</v>

244
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.520
<v Speaker 1>tough love kind of lady who reveals to you the truth about yourself and just</v>

245
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:50.121
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

246
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 1>you fucking deal with it cause that's how you are.</v>

248
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And what the truth that was revealed to me from quite early on was my</v>

249
00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 1>relationship with cannabis and got out of balance and I needed to get it back</v>

250
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:00.441
<v Speaker 1>into balance.</v>

251
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 1>And of course I ignored those messages completely because I was so,</v>

252
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I was so much in,</v>

253
00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 1>in love with my cannabis relationship,</v>

254
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>but that my wife said that really it was like a head,</v>

255
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:10.964
<v Speaker 1>a mistress.</v>

256
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

257
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 1>who I spent all my time with was the camp was the cannabis rather than rather</v>

258
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 1>than her,</v>

259
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>and this went on for many,</v>

260
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:17.811
<v Speaker 1>many years.</v>

261
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Now the paranoia aspect,</v>

262
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:19.551
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

263
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bare my heart here.</v>

264
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.760
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

265
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I believe in being honest,</v>

266
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 1>the paranoia aspect began to affect my relationship with my beloved partner,</v>

267
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.841
<v Speaker 1>Santa,</v>

268
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:34.841
<v Speaker 1>who I just love from the bottom of my heart and she is the best,</v>

269
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:35.301
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

270
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>the most pure hearted,</v>

271
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.461
<v Speaker 1>generous,</v>

272
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:38.061
<v Speaker 1>spirited,</v>

273
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>loving lady.</v>

274
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>

275
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 1>possible to imagine,</v>

276
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>but I started to develop all kinds of suspicions about her,</v>

277
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>which were completely groundless.</v>

278
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I started to imagine all sorts of stuff we're going on and then I started to act</v>

279
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 1>to act towards her as though those suspicions were real.</v>

280
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 1>And all of this was also related to my consumption of cannabis.</v>

281
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 1>It was not caused by my consumption of cannabis.</v>

282
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a latent aspect of my own personality.</v>

283
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>It was being revealed by this over abuse of,</v>

284
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

285
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.670
<v Speaker 1>of the cannabis herp and,</v>

286
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.920
<v Speaker 1>and therefore I was making my beautiful partner's life a misery sometimes,</v>

287
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.643
<v Speaker 1>not every day,</v>

288
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes.</v>

289
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And she was patiently putting up with this,</v>

290
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:24.351
<v Speaker 1>but she was suffering and we went down to Brazil in October,</v>

291
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>2011 and if I had been told when we got on that plane and went down to Brazil,</v>

292
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.390
<v Speaker 1>that when I came back two weeks later,</v>

293
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I would probably never smoked cannabis again.</v>

294
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I would have laughed in the face of the person who told me that.</v>

295
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 1>But the encounters that I had with the spirit of Iowasca,</v>

296
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.801
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>

297
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to accept that there is no spirit of Iowasca,</v>

298
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 1>that it's all something we generate out of our brains.</v>

299
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:45.924
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>

300
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 1>she manifests as a real,</v>

301
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>like a goddess and the encounters I had with that,</v>

302
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 1>and I do think she's real.</v>

303
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 1>That's just my personal belief system.</v>

304
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>And those encounters that I had were incredibly powerful and she took me to a</v>

305
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 1>place that was something like hell and she took me to a place that was something</v>

306
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 1>like the judgment scene in the ancient Egyptian religion.</v>

307
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Now the judgment scene is a place where your heart is weighed in the scales</v>

308
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:14.340
<v Speaker 1>against the feather of truth and harmony and cosmic justice and you do not want</v>

309
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>your heart to be heavy in those skills.</v>

310
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 1>You want to be able to look back on your life and say,</v>

311
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I did good.</v>

312
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I did not add to the misery in the world.</v>

313
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I did something worthwhile with this incredible gift of life that the university</v>

314
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:27.620
<v Speaker 1>gave me and I and,</v>

315
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>and everything you've done every second,</v>

316
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>every minute of your life is completely transparent.</v>

317
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Every thought,</v>

318
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 1>every action,</v>

319
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.150
<v Speaker 1>everything you did from the moment that you became conscious until the moment of</v>

320
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>your death is laid out before you and there's no hiding from it.</v>

321
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Like we great at creating illusions about our own behavior and persuading</v>

322
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 1>ourselves that we're behaving just fine in the judgment hall of Osiris,</v>

323
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 1>which is also called the hall of mark,</v>

324
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 1>where the scene takes place.</v>

325
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 1>All of that stripped away and you confront the truth.</v>

326
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>And I was put there and I confronted the truth about myself and I saw the way</v>

327
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:02.380
<v Speaker 1>that I was behaving towards my partner and,</v>

328
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:02.691
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

329
00:11:02.691 --> 00:11:02.961
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

330
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 1>and I was shown that this had to stop otherwise,</v>

331
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 1>otherwise I was going to pay a huge price for it.</v>

332
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

333
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I had a series of terrifying,</v>

334
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.420
<v Speaker 1>terrifying experiences,</v>

335
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:18.870
<v Speaker 1>which my partner saw the science I've shared with me because we were drinking</v>

336
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.130
<v Speaker 1>IOWASCA together.</v>

337
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>And at a certain point entities came to her and she had the experience of her</v>

338
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 1>heart being pulled out of her chest.</v>

339
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 1>And the entity said to her,</v>

340
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and she thought she was going to die.</v>

341
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 1>And the entity said to her,</v>

342
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do this to you to teach grammar lesson.</v>

343
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 1>And Santa's communicated that to me.</v>

344
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.690
<v Speaker 1>And I would rank that as probably the single most terrifying night of my entire</v>

345
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:43.050
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

346
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And I've had some terrifying nights that was just absolutely scared,</v>

347
00:11:48.361 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 1>rigid.</v>

348
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.471
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

349
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 1>and I came out of that with,</v>

350
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

351
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.330
<v Speaker 1>a feeling of very clear feeling in a,</v>

352
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 1>in Iowasca we have sharings the next day after you've drunk the brew,</v>

353
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.310
<v Speaker 1>you share with the rest of the group who you've drunk with the experiences you</v>

354
00:12:01.311 --> 00:12:02.081
<v Speaker 1>had the night before,</v>

355
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>as much as you want to share.</v>

356
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And what I shared,</v>

357
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>because I still didn't believe that I could stop smoking cannabis.</v>

358
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:13.140
<v Speaker 1>What I shared was that I was going to change my relationship with cannabis and,</v>

359
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and to get to a place where cannabis was serving me again rather than me serving</v>

360
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:18.424
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

361
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

362
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.331
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

363
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I believed.</v>

364
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 1>But when I got back to England,</v>

365
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.193
<v Speaker 1>long flight,</v>

366
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.850
<v Speaker 1>what's the first thing I do?</v>

367
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I get out my vaporizer,</v>

368
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 1>get out my stash,</v>

369
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.010
<v Speaker 1>fire up the vaporizer,</v>

370
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.400
<v Speaker 1>and fill a nice bag of</v>

371
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:33.843
<v Speaker 1>the vapor.</v>

372
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.410
<v Speaker 1>You said sort of stylistically,</v>

373
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

374
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:36.844
<v Speaker 1>I miss it.</v>

375
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.481
<v Speaker 1>I miss it.</v>

376
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:37.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

377
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:38.270
<v Speaker 1>this was a,</v>

378
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:43.270
<v Speaker 1>that would be a cannabis is such a beautiful sensual ally if she's used right.</v>

379
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:43.961
<v Speaker 1>And what do you think?</v>

380
00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just an imbalance issue with the CBD THC ratio and the,</v>

381
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:47.741
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

382
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:48.300
<v Speaker 1>let me just,</v>

383
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 1>let me just finish with what,</v>

384
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 1>with what happened to me.</v>

385
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>So I fill up the bag and I'm down there in my basement and I take the first and</v>

386
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I take the first drawer and I'm suddenly filled with the most intense feelings</v>

387
00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 1>of horror and loading.</v>

388
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>And it is exactly like I'm back in that space that Iowaska took me to,</v>

389
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 1>and I try a second puff and I can't do it.</v>

390
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I physically could not continue.</v>

391
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

392
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I just,</v>

393
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I just could not continue.</v>

394
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I expressed the vapor out of the bag,</v>

395
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I crumpled up the bag,</v>

396
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I put it away.</v>

397
00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:21.170
<v Speaker 1>And the next day I got rid of several ounces of coke.</v>

398
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis.</v>

399
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

400
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.201
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

401
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:23.381
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

402
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

403
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible thing to do.</v>

404
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.580
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

405
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:25.800
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

406
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.280
<v Speaker 1>but for me it was the right thing to do.</v>

407
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.480
<v Speaker 1>24 years,</v>

408
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>nonstop relationship with cannabis,</v>

409
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.680
<v Speaker 1>definitely abusing the herb.</v>

410
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I had got to the point where the only rational course of action was what I was</v>

411
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:37.870
<v Speaker 1>shown in Iowasca,</v>

412
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:38.531
<v Speaker 1>which was to stop.</v>

413
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:42.250
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know whether it was because there was way too much THC and not</v>

414
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:43.180
<v Speaker 1>enough CBD,</v>

415
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:47.680
<v Speaker 1>or whether it was just me not being responsible for my own behavior.</v>

416
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:48.221
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

417
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:48.401
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

418
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:48.971
<v Speaker 1>go around,</v>

419
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:49.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

420
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:51.430
<v Speaker 1>saying that I believe in adult responsibility,</v>

421
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:51.851
<v Speaker 1>and I do,</v>

422
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:53.620
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think I was being responsible.</v>

423
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I was using the herb in a responsible way.</v>

424
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I was using it in a respectful way,</v>

425
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.290
<v Speaker 1>and I paid a price for that.</v>

426
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:05.130
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

427
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.003
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

428
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Freaks and geeks level.</v>
