<v Speaker 1>if you're talking about white people</v>

00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>that live in trailer parks,</v>

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.140
<v Speaker 1>corncob pipe and he hangs out</v>

59
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 2>drinks from his jug at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a bunch of cars on blocks in</v>

63
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>the title was miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you feel that?</v>

64
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing and all of journalism,</v>

65
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 2>like it's all leveled out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes you read an article in</v>

66
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>the Huffington post and they suck you</v>
<v Speaker 2>into like some article and it's written</v>

67
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 2>by like a high school journalism</v>
<v Speaker 2>student.</v>

68
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

69
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 2>it just goes like three paragraphs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>before it even comes out,</v>

70
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 2>like the heading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

71
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 2>It had been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you read some stuff from the New</v>

72
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 2>York Times or other places and some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

73
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 2>some of it's definitely much smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of it is a little opinionated.</v>

74
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Has these little things in it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy.</v>

75
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's because there's such</v>

76
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>a rush.</v>

77
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 2>You can't spend as much time on stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get lazy and careless.</v>

78
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 2>While I also think that when people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>at their best,</v>

79
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 2>they write about what they love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you read a really lazy Article</v>

80
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 2>From The New York Times writer about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

81
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that guy would write an amazing</v>

82
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 2>article about handmade furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

83
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Because maybe he's like into it into</v>
<v Speaker 2>handmade furniture,</v>

84
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of articles that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>people writing.</v>

85
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>They're just fucking just trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>them done.</v>

86
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that a lot of that's</v>

87
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

88
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't you feel that way about the</v>

89
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:25.024
<v Speaker 2>new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes like,</v>

90
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

91
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to digest the news.</v>

92
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>

93
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of my crusades for real.</v>

94
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I have a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the newspaper in the morning</v>

95
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 2>because I want to spend maybe 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

96
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 2>maybe a half hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at some news stories and then</v>

97
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

98
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 2>That's all Tom Papa needs to know about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's events because I can't do</v>

99
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 2>anything about it and if I just check in</v>
<v Speaker 2>another half hour check in another half,</v>

100
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 2>a 24 hours of that day's gone and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel sick,</v>

101
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 2>you're paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sick,</v>

102
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 2>you're upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turn the news off.</v>

103
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a barrage and I need to talk to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking New York time about what</v>

104
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 2>constitutes breaking news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen New York Times just because</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's not fucking breaking news.</v>

106
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty great story though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good story,</v>

107
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the New York Times the</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying this is war.</v>

108

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've heard the earth is flat</v>
<v Speaker 2>content and how they gonna make you pay</v>

119
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>attention to the content by scaring the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out of you,</v>

120
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 2>scaring the shit out of you or making</v>
<v Speaker 2>you angry or writing something</v>

121
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous</v>

122
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>like sexism is why women like to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is ridiculous.</v>

123
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a near 100 percent.</v>

124
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.070
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

125
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was at the New York Times</v>

126
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>building because of the sourdough</v>
<v Speaker 1>article and I saw no such thing.</v>

127
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty cool to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was cool to like be inside the</v>

128
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this was my point about Huffington</v>

129
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>post when you were saying that it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's written by a high school kid.</v>

130
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 1>It could easily have been like there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of contributors to the Huffington</v>

131
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Lot,</v>

132
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>a lot of contributors to a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>online news sources.</v>

133
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How Wall Street pros talk,</v>

134
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.980
<v Speaker 1>talk women down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's on it now.</v>

135
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.110
<v Speaker 1>It was out today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about sexism and drinking sexism</v>

136
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:45.221
<v Speaker 1>and drinking a that the patriarchy makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>women drink.</v>

137
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It was like the pressure of dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexism all day.</v>

138
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 1>It makes women drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

139
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so unbelievably ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for anybody who hates those</v>

140
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 1>arguments and it's beautiful because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so stupid that it's like self</v>

141
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>parody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

142
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 1>it's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

143
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes you drink because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody who doesn't drink,</v>

144
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 1>how come it doesn't work on them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like that headline is to a</v>

145
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 1>level of this will piss them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

146
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here we are talking about it.</v>

147
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she might be right.</v>

148
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

149
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

150
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Women must face sexism because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are sexist for sure,</v>

151
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>but many pegs you have to work with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy for eight hours a day for five</v>

152
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's not gonna try to fuck you.</v>

153
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be thinking about fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all the time and he's definitely</v>

154
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>gonna play like little games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>See how far he can go to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what you say when he says this.</v>

156
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we work with guys when they are</v>

157
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 1>completely free when we're alone with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like when you're in school or</v>

158
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:49.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever and working with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you get jobs with these men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>and when we're alone with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit is sad.</v>

161
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

162
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's filtered is brutal about</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the office about their</v>

163
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 1>wives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pulling out their parts.</v>

164
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the opposite of that.</v>

165
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Says sexism isn't driving women to</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

166
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I found something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not seeing something from the times</v>

167
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

168
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find it here.</v>

169
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.970
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

170
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>You don't even need to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an article.</v>

171
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are such pigs,</v>

172
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.960
<v Speaker 1>pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be in an office with another guy</v>

173
00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coast is clear the stuff.</v>

174
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 1>So for him to look at each other and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 1>this never leaves this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

176
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>and that would be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do to her</v>

177
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.870
<v Speaker 1>conversations and then they walk out</v>
<v Speaker 1>among all the people and they that they</v>

178
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>can keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like knowing what we know that they can</v>

179
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>keep it together when they're mixed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else is kind of astounding.</v>

180
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the more likely a man is to</v>

181
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 1>wear loafers with those tassels,</v>

182
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.600
<v Speaker 3>the more likely has to have these deep</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark visions fantasies.</v>

183
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get out of him if you just get a</v>

184
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 3>couple of cocktails in him yet because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably pretty wealthy,</v>

185
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.540
<v Speaker 3>probably makes a good living and</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably is been married to the same</v>

186
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:20.121
<v Speaker 3>woman for quite a long time as children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably has some sort of religious</v>

187
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 3>affiliation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

188
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.810
<v Speaker 3>most likely you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep desires</v>

189
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 3>if you're living or working well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're working with that guy,</v>

190
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 3>it's almost crazier than living with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

191
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 3>You think about it like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your wife works all day,</v>

192
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 3>so if you work all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your wife works all day,</v>

193
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 3>you're not seeing each other for nine</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours out of the day,</v>

194
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Travel time.</v>

195
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're super lucky,</v>

196
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 3>then you come home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long are you awake for?</v>

197
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four hours at the most.</v>

198
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much is this really good time with</v>

199
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 3>exactly how much time is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop fighting.</v>

200
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not yours.</v>

201
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:02.971
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

202
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yours looks like that,</v>

203
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:07.040
<v Speaker 3>but yours is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is being.</v>

204
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 3>That's the reality is if your wife works</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some fucking creepy dude,</v>

205
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 3>that creepy dude sees her more than you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

206
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think work environments are very</v>

207
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 3>strange for human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not saying that we shouldn't engage in</v>

208
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is that being in a</v>

209
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 3>traditional work environment where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're working your way up the corporate</v>

210
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:26.490
<v Speaker 3>ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everybody's full of Shit.</v>

211
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is at certain point in time</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying the thing that's the right thing</v>

212
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 3>to say for their career versus what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>really feel about things.</v>

213
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was probably not a lot of room for</v>

214
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is about the company and how</v>

215
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 3>important that company is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then fucking,</v>

216
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 3>if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to like crack a joke by the</v>

217
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 3>water cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

218
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:46.770
<v Speaker 3>That's like your little freedom of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day or maybe they'll let you dress your</v>

219
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.810
<v Speaker 3>cubicle up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have like a little fucking</v>

220
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 3>star wars guy in the cubicle.</v>

221
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Joe's a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show them your socks.</v>

222
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Look at the death star my cubicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big star wars fan.</v>

223
00:10:56.631 --> 00:10:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait for the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's the guy.</v>

224
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:00.680
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people come up to go,</v>

225
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.270
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy in my office.</v>

226
00:11:02.271 --> 00:11:04.610
<v Speaker 2>He is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

227
00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:06.650
<v Speaker 2>it's star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>

228
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Thoreau quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most men live lives of silent</v>

229
00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:11.660
<v Speaker 2>desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

230
00:11:11.661 --> 00:11:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Most women too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most humans,</v>

231
00:11:13.731 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot a lot of doing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do what?</v>

232
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I find though,</v>

233
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.680
<v Speaker 2>like people who are in those jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

234
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.680
<v Speaker 2>and they get pretty high up and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were creative people.</v>

235
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

236
00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:29.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't question things as much as we</v>

237
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:30.670
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't you?</v>

238
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.670
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

239
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.680
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's why they're able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into it.</v>

240
00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think their heads are.</v>

241
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's what causes it or if that's</v>

242
00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:43.790
<v Speaker 2>like a mindset that one sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxes themselves into it.</v>

243
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:47.180
<v Speaker 2>An early age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a little of both,</v>

244
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.190
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely have a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends who are just fun guys.</v>

245
00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>They work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been in corporations</v>

246
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.010
<v Speaker 1>their whole careers and they just don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>question it.</v>

247
00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 1>There's never a part of them that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

248
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 1>that's ever thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

249
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just got out of school and said,</v>

250
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go do this and then you</v>

251
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 1>go watch the rangers and it'll be fine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't think about it.</v>

252
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 1>And he was always that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he just kind of slid in and it's</v>

253
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 1>almost like ignorance is bliss in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

254
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Those guys generally like to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

255
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one because the drinking is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to say who gives a fuck at</v>

256
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day when you're done with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your work,</v>

257
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you have a couple of pops with the boys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden you're laughing.</v>

258
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a shit about the stock</v>
<v Speaker 1>profile?</v>

259
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a shit about the lawn?</v>

260
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.270
<v Speaker 1>He gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be in that environment like,</v>

261
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's acting like a dick to me.</v>

262
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.000
<v Speaker 1>What is he trying to do and why do they</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate me so much?</v>

263
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw him,</v>

264
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:44.860
<v Speaker 1>he's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd go and go and get to work</v>

265
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 1>with a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

266
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do that's done?</v>

267
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.710
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that separates</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol from marijuana.</v>

268
00:12:53.711 --> 00:12:58.711
<v Speaker 1>Like that's like the dividing line</v>
<v Speaker 1>between how it makes you look at things</v>

269
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 1>in your life that aren't desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes them like really radically</v>

270
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.940
<v Speaker 1>because alcohol way God gives a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but marijuana will go,</v>

271
00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta do something about this.</v>

272
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking with your head all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and you know what's fucking with</v>

273
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.070
<v Speaker 1>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the background of everything you</v>

274
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:15.540
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

275
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.530
<v Speaker 1>It's constantly looming over you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadowing you like a backhand ready to</v>

276
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why you don't read philosophy.</v>

277
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 1>You're just opening up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening up and there's no way to solve</v>

278
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

279
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.730
<v Speaker 1>It's the pot God damn pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's illegal.</v>

280
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 1>It would ruin this fucking society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would ruin the fiber of society,</v>

281
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.720
<v Speaker 1>would stop all these jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hope in that pot legalization</v>

282
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>coincides with excellent new robots to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conduce shitty jobs,</v>

283
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:48.510
<v Speaker 1>so it all flows together the way you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all those people that are now</v>

284
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.260
<v Speaker 1>running through the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

285
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Let the robots killing the robot's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat them.</v>

286
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 1>They're going to use them as fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the Matrix,</v>

287
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:01.510
<v Speaker 1>each robot that kills most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas it's face going to have a Taco</v>

288
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Bell Fan club and whoever shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the first people to get eaten.</v>

289
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things like that.</v>

290
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:10.381
<v Speaker 1>They'll take like really obvious robot</v>
<v Speaker 1>traps like donor parks.</v>

291
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is your kids.</v>

292
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about fully grown adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be some real traps.</v>

293
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 1>You got to take care of robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eat people.</v>

294
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.090
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over here.</v>

295
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a few rogue robots like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

296
00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 1>viruses that computers catch a few rogue</v>
<v Speaker 1>robots found out they can eat people and</v>

297
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>they just go off and eat people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're very ethical about it.</v>

298
00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:32.200
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat the dumbest fucking people they</v>

299
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:34.810
<v Speaker 1>could find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a crocodile doesn't go after</v>

300
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>the fastest gazelle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes by that wounded motherfucker</v>

301
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 1>lips up to the waterhole and just gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacked.</v>

302
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old One can hear anything anymore.</v>

303
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:46.460
<v Speaker 1>It's got one gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see everybody running.</v>

304
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>The crocodile gets and so much like much</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the crocodile,</v>

305
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:56.570
<v Speaker 1>the robots that eat people will become</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the natural predators.</v>

306
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 1>The weeders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great of the week just walking</v>

307
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.440
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're no,</v>

308
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 1>they're no better than just gang up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack a city because we just make it</v>

309
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:05.650
<v Speaker 1>rain on him or something and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>rusty.</v>

310
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Explode or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will shoot them.</v>

311
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have guns.</v>

312
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 1>We know they're coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can keep an eye on them,</v>

313
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.310
<v Speaker 1>but if they can just talk really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid people into traps and then just</v>

314
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:19.670
<v Speaker 1>eat them and do our bidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a Taco Bell Fan club.</v>

315
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Are you a fan of Taco Bell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are to come celebrate Taco Bell Fan</v>

316
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 1>night and you go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on town.</v>

317
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not even free food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just give away like Taco bell tee</v>

318
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 1>shirts and hats and shit and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking socked about Taco bell broad.</v>

319
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Our three choices on my corner got</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthed here and got Wendy's.</v>

320
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I always go to Taco Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taco Bell's my shit.</v>

321
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Look at this free tee shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the best to the burst that the</v>

322
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 1>quality of their ingredients is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented.</v>

323
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>They get me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

324
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.960
<v Speaker 1>We'll get fucking seriously into like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be ridiculous to get that way</v>

325
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 1>about Taco Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not ridiculous to get that way</v>

326
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:53.744
<v Speaker 1>over apple.</v>

327
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want me to put fucking people?</v>

328
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 1>When I was working on news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like during the days before</v>

329
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Osx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this was like the days of like</v>

330
00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:09.191
<v Speaker 1>windows 95 and the operating system for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mac was all like it wasn't that good and</v>

331
00:16:11.691 --> 00:16:15.140
<v Speaker 1>the way I've seen it be described like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interface is really cool,</v>

332
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.760
<v Speaker 1>like the way you use it was very simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>and easy to remember and a lot of</v>

333
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 1>creative type people like to use it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different reasons,</v>

334
00:16:22.491 --> 00:16:27.491
<v Speaker 1>but there was no memory protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no preemptive multitasking.</v>

335
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:31.430
<v Speaker 1>It was like a clunky operating system</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like high end users.</v>

336
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't code video games on</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

337
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 1>People that really needed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously this I'm regurgitating</v>

338
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.310
<v Speaker 1>regurgitating because I don't know shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about computers so what I've read,</v>

339
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm blaming it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people that I was working with on</v>

340
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 1>news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking radical Mac fanatics.</v>

341
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.700
<v Speaker 1>They were radical and like the news will</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out when we're going to get them</v>

342
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:55.000
<v Speaker 1>with this new operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new operating system,</v>

343
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:56.670
<v Speaker 1>spending less sex was coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

344
00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.300
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get them with sex</v>

345
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.490

417
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:25.290
<v Speaker 1>machine time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine backups.</v>

<v Speaker 1>malware in them.</v>

419
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

421
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.690
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

422
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.790

<v Speaker 1>And then it's another backup.</v>

423
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.550
<v Speaker 1>But if the files are infected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's gotta be a way like how</v>

424
00:20:38.551 --> 00:20:40.860
<v Speaker 1>does windows do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how windows does their,</v>

425
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.660
<v Speaker 1>their backups?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

426
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Is it something that never used on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating system?</v>

00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:29.550
<v Speaker 3>on right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just a little too much elasticity.</v>

463
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Little loose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not tight enough.</v>

464
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Now I want to say elasticy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

465
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:36.380
<v Speaker 3>because the last test would allow to</v>
<v Speaker 3>snap back.</v>

466
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 3>It's a little too little elasticity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just getting kind of late and</v>

467
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:44.870
<v Speaker 3>fluffy anymore college into my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of fallen off your face and</v>

468
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.240
<v Speaker 3>there's no way to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is apparently no,</v>

469
00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:50.290
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the same doctor who invented</v>

470
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Regena King,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a process that I used to deal</v>

471
00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 3>with a bulging disc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they take your blood out and it's</v>

472
00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:02.200
<v Speaker 3>kinda like platelet rich plasma in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>except the heat it up and by heating up</v>

473
00:23:02.201 --> 00:23:05.800
<v Speaker 3>your blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your blood produces a response to the</v>

474
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:09.940
<v Speaker 3>heat and it creates this yellow serum</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his yellow serum.</v>

475
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.390
<v Speaker 3>They spin in a centrifuge and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>extract that yellow car and it's one of</v>

476
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:16.660
<v Speaker 3>the most potent anti inflammatory</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicines ever discovered.</v>

477
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Scott discovered he discovered a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>inventions ever discovered in your body.</v>

478
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't reject it because it's your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood and it has a great effect on</v>

479
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 3>people with like inflammation injuries</v>
<v Speaker 3>and helping healing times would it do</v>

480
00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:32.590
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had the disrobe bulging from</v>

481
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 3>repeated use from Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from just too much sparring and not</v>

482
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 3>enough time off and getting injured and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not taking enough time off in between</v>

483
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:44.860
<v Speaker 3>the injury and getting right back into</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is really fun.</v>

484
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.000
<v Speaker 3>It's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a video game like that kind of</v>

485
00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.950
<v Speaker 3>fun or like I like to play pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

486
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's way more exciting than that and</v>

487
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 3>the only way you could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta do it with your body.</v>

488
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.790
<v Speaker 3>So it's like you have this game piece</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're playing with and his game</v>

489
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:01.340
<v Speaker 3>piece get banged up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an old controller.</v>

490
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

491
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:05.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was developing some back issues from</v>

492
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:10.001
<v Speaker 3>numb fingers and usually those indicate</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your disc is pushing against the</v>

493
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:12.710
<v Speaker 3>nerve so it means a disc is bulging out.</v>

494
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.010
<v Speaker 3>So then I went through a bunch of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>with spinal decompression</v>

495
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.630
<v Speaker 3>and Regena keen was a big part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy who developed Regena King,</v>

496
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.960
<v Speaker 3>all these athletes like Peyton Manning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coby Bryant,</v>

497
00:24:25.961 --> 00:24:29.210
<v Speaker 3>they all flew to Germany to get this</v>
<v Speaker 3>procedure and then slowly they brought</v>

498
00:24:29.211 --> 00:24:32.900
<v Speaker 3>it up to the United States and now they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it in California.</v>

499
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they do it in Santa Monica is where</v>

500
00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 3>I had it done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they'd do it also in Dallas</v>

501
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 3>and they do it a couple other places</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe in Las Vegas,</v>

502
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 3>the same doctor who came up with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>procedure has some new procedure that</v>

503
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Speaker 3>they're preparing to release which is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to kickstart to production of</v>

504
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Collagen and people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is the thing that makes your</v>

505
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:55.880
<v Speaker 3>skin look like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that makes your face</v>

506
00:24:55.881 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 3>sag and your wrinkles appear and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body just looks like an old bag what</v>

507
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:00.950
<v Speaker 3>your college and goes away.</v>

508
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.880
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're stuffing in your face basically.</v>

509
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 3>You're more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's stuffing Collagen is responsible</v>

510
00:25:09.501 --> 00:25:11.780
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of the elasticity of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>skin.</v>

511
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 3>It's responsible for a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>things as well.</v>

512
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 3>But the elasticity of your skin is</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently a lot of it's based on your</v>

513
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:23.651
<v Speaker 3>body's healthy production of Collagen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're losing it now and we're getting</v>

514
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.080
<v Speaker 3>just a little loose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll loosen up this hill,</v>

515
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thermitight.</v>

516
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.710
<v Speaker 3>What is this injectable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

517
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:31.603
<v Speaker 3>What is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy?</v>

518
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.220
<v Speaker 3>This is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>College and injection.</v>

519
00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like just a little video of it.</v>

520
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

521
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.420
<v Speaker 3>This looks like they're tightening you</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

522
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:39.410
<v Speaker 3>That's a college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

523
00:25:39.411 --> 00:25:43.010
<v Speaker 3>People get college and just injected</v>
<v Speaker 3>into college and injected.</v>

524
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 3>How long does that last?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

525
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 3>This is all new stuff that has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught to me by people who have gone</v>

526
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 3>over to Germany and talked to this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and had procedures done by this guy.</v>

527
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.370
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it help your spine?</v>

528
00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Like a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did a big difference.</v>

529
00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.461
<v Speaker 3>Big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big difference.</v>

530
00:25:58.461 --> 00:25:59.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

531
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:02.090
<v Speaker 3>Big Difference in relief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Difference in recovery time.</v>

532
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 3>I did a bunch of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty proactive about it.</v>

533
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 3>The spinal decompression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of Rolfing,</v>

534
00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:11.980
<v Speaker 3>which is super painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Torturous method of massage where</v>

535
00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're manipulating your limbs and</v>

536
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.990
<v Speaker 3>digging their elbows and you're back in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking.</v>

537
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.150
<v Speaker 3>The guys did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was this football player dude.</v>

538
00:26:19.151 --> 00:26:20.630
<v Speaker 3>He was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big,</v>

539
00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:23.510
<v Speaker 3>giant dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just beat me up.</v>

540
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.060
<v Speaker 3>It was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing worse than when you get</v>

541
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:28.150
<v Speaker 3>a massage and it's just like this little</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl hands,</v>

542
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that I'm used to the painful</v>

543
00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:32.690
<v Speaker 3>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those are the ones,</v>

544
00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:35.000
<v Speaker 3>the painful ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that like break up the tissue</v>

545
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 3>and allow it all to relax and heal</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

546
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.640
<v Speaker 3>And that helped a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The decompression helped a lot.</v>

547
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.380
<v Speaker 3>That was a big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are you able to tell how much this</v>

548
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:44.680
<v Speaker 3>process help?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

549
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

550
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't know how much that process</v>
<v Speaker 3>helped overall because I did them all</v>

551
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

552
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.170
<v Speaker 3>But everything together worked awesome</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounding.</v>

553
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a bulge at all anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really important to talk about</v>

554
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:59.760
<v Speaker 3>because there's a lot of people to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>bulging discs and they immediately want</v>

555
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 3>to go get surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in some cases that's the right move.</v>

556
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.190
<v Speaker 3>In some cases like Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

557
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.410
<v Speaker 3>a good friend of mine had a discreet</v>
<v Speaker 3>place on his back and uh,</v>

558
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Eddie is a longtime Jujitsu guy and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>disc,</v>

559
00:27:11.731 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 3>it's been squashed and deteriorated so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much that it was essentially like bone</v>

560
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:18.510
<v Speaker 3>on bone was lower back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constant state of inflammation,</v>

561
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that case the doctors decided it</v>

562
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Speaker 3>was a very smart move to replace the</v>
<v Speaker 3>disk with these new titanium disks that</v>

563
00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 3>they have.</v>

564
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.080
<v Speaker 3>They have some pretty cool artificial</v>
<v Speaker 3>discs,</v>

565
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.670
<v Speaker 3>but there's other specialties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His was really bad for a long period of</v>

566
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:37.590
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's other injuries where you</v>

567
00:27:37.591 --> 00:27:39.820
<v Speaker 3>could mitigate all the issues without</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

568
00:27:39.821 --> 00:27:42.390
<v Speaker 3>It's just going to take a little time</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like it took time to create the</v>

569
00:27:42.391 --> 00:27:44.220
<v Speaker 3>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take time to heal it.</v>

570
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And spinal decompressions big.</v>

571
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:48.960
<v Speaker 3>Like even those things we hang by your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ankles.</v>

572
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Just doing that a little bit every day</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really good for pain,</v>

573
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 3>really good for relief of your lower</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

574
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 3>There is also the other ones you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>do with your neck.</v>

575
00:27:56.821 --> 00:28:00.450
<v Speaker 3>I have one that's like a harness as</v>
<v Speaker 3>straps to my neck and it hangs from a</v>

576
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:01.550
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

577
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you can actually pull.</v>

578
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 3>It stretches your neck out and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

579
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.020
<v Speaker 3>You could feel it like relaxing your</v>
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>

580
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.070
<v Speaker 3>It's attached to the door.</v>

581
00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually the thing for your head.</v>

582
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this metal bracket that clamps</v>

583
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:16.230
<v Speaker 3>down on the top of the door and then it</v>
<v Speaker 3>has like this arm that comes off of it</v>

584
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:20.300
<v Speaker 3>and then a rope comes down from the arm</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is attached to this velcro like</v>

585
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.250
<v Speaker 3>face thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put it on your velcroed in place so it's</v>

586
00:28:23.251 --> 00:28:24.850
<v Speaker 3>tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he pulled on the string.</v>

587
00:28:24.851 --> 00:28:25.441
<v Speaker 3>It's like click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>

588
00:28:25.441 --> 00:28:25.861
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>

589
00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:29.850
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just like a poll on your neck</v>

590
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.160
<v Speaker 3>and could use that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great man.</v>

591
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm not lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it right there.</v>

592
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.680
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

593
00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:39.681
<v Speaker 3>you look cool too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it looks like a diaper was like</v>

594
00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.220
<v Speaker 3>pulling that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can like feel the relaxation and if</v>

595
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:47.940
<v Speaker 3>you do it on a regular basis it really</v>
<v Speaker 3>does offer you some nice relief.</v>

596
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no affiliation with any of these</v>

597
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:50.450
<v Speaker 3>companies.</v>

598
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:52.270
<v Speaker 3>You can just some things I used</v>
<v Speaker 3>instilled,</v>

599
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.240
<v Speaker 3>you can put it in the door jamb and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>have it land on your head is your hand.</v>

600
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be careful because one time it</v>

601
00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.880
<v Speaker 3>didn't fucking Ding me in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>

602
00:28:59.881 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was an asshole.</v>

603
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I didn't tighten it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

604
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I be worried and when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>came down it,</v>

605
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.050
<v Speaker 3>it fucking in the forehead and left this</v>
<v Speaker 3>big cut and I was doing all this press</v>

606
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.080
<v Speaker 3>for a spike spike tv because it was at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time where I was doing or Scifi</v>

607
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 3>rather because it was the same time I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing a Joe Rogan questions.</v>

608
00:29:18.331 --> 00:29:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Everything is TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all the pressure I did with a divot</v>

609
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.020
<v Speaker 3>in my head like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for spike it probably helped.</v>

610
00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.060
<v Speaker 3>It was Saifai helper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psi Phi.</v>

611
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.430
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

612
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.700
<v Speaker 3>those things were all really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>

613
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.440
<v Speaker 3>something happened just in the last two</v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

614
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:36.930
<v Speaker 3>sleeping and woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can happen.</v>

615
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Just Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Love Yoga.</v>

616
00:29:39.391 --> 00:29:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Yoga is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

617
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 3>hot yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fucking clears</v>

618
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.560
<v Speaker 2>all that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't the strength in who knows how to</v>

619
00:29:44.561 --> 00:29:45.394
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be.</v>

620
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.220
<v Speaker 2>I like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The regular yoga where I'm sweating like</v>

621
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:52.370
<v Speaker 2>a pig over hot yoga just opens you up</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

622
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Just the extra little millimeter of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stretch.</v>

623
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:56.190
<v Speaker 2>You get out of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

624
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.610
<v Speaker 2>it's too hot too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

625
00:29:57.611 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's also mental toughness to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>build mental toughness.</v>

626
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Ninety minutes net class tough enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you are at.</v>

627
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.510
<v Speaker 2>What do I need it for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

628
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I have to say I just got to pick my</v>

629
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:09.850
<v Speaker 2>kids up and these are all rhetorical</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions not to drink.</v>

630
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Sexism is causing you to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been meaning to talk to you.</v>

631
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

632
00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know that men are awful and we</v>

633
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:24.130
<v Speaker 2>attack and do horrible things and we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

634
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 2>You've yelled at us now and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with it now.</v>

635
00:30:27.761 --> 00:30:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Back off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know there's a problem.</v>

636
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:32.510
<v Speaker 2>We're working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right art is 12.</v>

637
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it okay to only want to work with</v>

638
00:30:37.531 --> 00:30:39.240
<v Speaker 3>men?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So say if you start a company,</v>

639
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.930
<v Speaker 3>at what size can the company be before</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to start hiring women?</v>

640
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan experience enterprises,</v>

641
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.400
<v Speaker 3>very small company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only a couple employees and they</v>

642
00:30:50.401 --> 00:30:52.620
<v Speaker 3>happened to be male.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now one of the more higher.</v>

643
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.400
<v Speaker 3>What if we keep going with eventually I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hire 50 people.</v>

644
00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Who is anybody gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you have 50 dudes?</v>

645
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.113
<v Speaker 3>How come?</v>

646
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

647
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 2>you're not meeting the quota.</v>

648
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Is that really the case?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is it that these are the people that</v>

649
00:31:06.381 --> 00:31:09.860
<v Speaker 3>I want and I just happened to find out</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all men.</v>

650
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.800
<v Speaker 2>You have to at a certain data now you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to hire and meet these numbers.</v>

651
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.160
<v Speaker 2>What number is probably probably like 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of your staff?</v>

652
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.191
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

653
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:22.480
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at what number does,</v>

654
00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:23.440
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do it.</v>

655
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Get Away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With two people I think.</v>

656
00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you bring in one more person,</v>

657
00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 2>really it's going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

658
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.030
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I bring in one girl,</v>

659
00:31:31.031 --> 00:31:33.310
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to hear some of the shit.</v>

660
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Jamie says the mics off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to go,</v>

661
00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:37.660
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to be quietly building a</v>

662
00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 2>case against Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

663
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:41.140
<v Speaker 2>that does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

664
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at.</v>

665
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Look at Anthony Wiener.</v>

666
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:44.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a different.</v>

667
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:48.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a different case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know this girl who worked with</v>

668
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is actually the sister of a good</v>

669
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:54.100
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I giving you all the details?</v>

670
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:56.200
<v Speaker 3>You're going to know who it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

671
00:31:56.201 --> 00:32:00.310
<v Speaker 3>she worked with this guy for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Writing down anytime he said anything</v>

672
00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:03.820
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate and building a file,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all total.</v>

673
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean all clearly her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her word against his that he said all</v>

674
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:11.680
<v Speaker 3>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she made this file of all the</v>

675
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate things that he had said at</v>
<v Speaker 3>picnics included everywhere.</v>

676
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Company picnics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wrote a bunch of things down and</v>

677
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.420
<v Speaker 3>she's thinking about suing the company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are going to burry you.</v>

678
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.500
<v Speaker 3>Are you out of your fucking mind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My God.</v>

679
00:32:23.501 --> 00:32:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What w?</v>

680
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 3>What were these things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless they were like really fucked up.</v>

681
00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:28.950
<v Speaker 3>But that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing</v>

682
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:33.330
<v Speaker 2>about the corporate or like white</v>
<v Speaker 2>working in a corporation would be so</v>

683
00:32:33.331 --> 00:32:35.850
<v Speaker 2>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinking that he has a good</v>

684
00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:37.150
<v Speaker 2>relationship with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

685
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>she's probably doesn't not dislike</v>

686
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.000
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

687
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:43.210
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's this play acting that</v>

688
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:46.790
<v Speaker 3>they're doing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's really being honest ever,</v>

689
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 3>but there's also the real possibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could make some money if you</v>

690
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 3>sue them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

691
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 3>Like that kids grow up today and knowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>about like,</v>

692
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 3>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the lawsuit example.</v>

693
00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a woman who was a single</v>

694
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a single mom,</v>

695
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:08.540
<v Speaker 3>and she had this kid and she brought the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid over my house and the kids stayed</v>

696
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:12.080
<v Speaker 3>over my house for a long ass time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she was supposed to pick the kid up</v>

697
00:33:12.081 --> 00:33:14.150
<v Speaker 3>at four and then she didn't show up</v>
<v Speaker 3>until eight.</v>

698
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.880
<v Speaker 3>It was weird as weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those weird ones and she was also</v>

699
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 3>just slightly sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just something.</v>

700
00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.650
<v Speaker 3>And this isn't one of the things you</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with when you deal,</v>

701
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:27.710
<v Speaker 3>you know your kids are going to school a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of different people you run into</v>

702
00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:29.270
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to interact with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

703
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:30.860
<v Speaker 3>You're not exactly sure what to get out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

704
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.780
<v Speaker 3>So she left her kid at this other lady's</v>
<v Speaker 3>house and the other lady had a little</v>

705
00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a little fucking dog.</v>

706
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:42.020
<v Speaker 3>The dog jumped up and did the pawing</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and left a visible scratch on the</v>

707
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 3>girl's leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She sued them for 100,000 dollars.</v>

708
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.060
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

709
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Attacked her daughter might be 50 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she got $50 gross trying to</v>

710
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:58.670
<v Speaker 3>remember what the numbers were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like,</v>

711
00:33:58.671 --> 00:34:00.920
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was good.</v>

712
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:04.100
<v Speaker 3>This was this lady saying we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

713
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 3>we gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we gotta get a shot here,</v>

714
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.320
<v Speaker 3>got a shot here at some money with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people you go to school with and see all</v>

715
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:10.910
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how awful you are.</v>

716
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:14.630
<v Speaker 3>It was just the dog didn't bite anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just jumped up because he got</v>

717
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:15.630
<v Speaker 3>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is being a dog.</v>

718
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Dogs do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

719
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I could get if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was my dog and he did to someone's</v>

720
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:22.220
<v Speaker 3>door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be very upset.</v>

721
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.100
<v Speaker 3>I do whatever the fuck I could do to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it better.</v>

722
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.580
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the dog was a biter,</v>

723
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.160
<v Speaker 3>but bad dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

724
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Legally does she have a case?</v>

725
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 3>The issue is with a lot of lawsuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will cost you more to fight it than</v>

726
00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:43.400
<v Speaker 3>it will for you to just settle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

727
00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people just settled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say it'll cost you $10,000 to</v>

728
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:48.530
<v Speaker 3>settle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it'll cost you $50,000 to fight it.</v>

729
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Like that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all real.</v>

730
00:34:50.181 --> 00:34:52.460
<v Speaker 3>People have to consider those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should fight it though.</v>

731
00:34:52.461 --> 00:34:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Just to stick it to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

732
00:34:54.171 --> 00:34:59.171
<v Speaker 3>the UFC told us to not take photos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>choking people like people ask you,</v>

733
00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put me to run naked choke because two</v>

734
00:35:01.401 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 3>people got sued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them was chuck Odell and one of</v>

735
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:06.930
<v Speaker 3>them was Matt Hughes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Matt Hughes One.</v>

736
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Crazy because this guy says to ask Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to put him in a choke hold.</v>

737
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 3>People do that shit all the time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>obliges him.</v>

738
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Then the guy uses the photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tries to sue Matt Hughes,</v>

739
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:19.220

<v Speaker 3>And here's the evidence,</v>

740
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.530
<v Speaker 3>the photo evidence that you heard them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then here's where it gets even crazier</v>

741
00:35:22.531 --> 00:35:24.320
<v Speaker 3>than they do an investigation in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:27.590
<v Speaker 3>Find out he's a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they go deeper.</v>

<v Speaker 3>force.</v>

745
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a scam artist.</v>

746
00:35:36.121 --> 00:35:37.530

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 2>that just happened to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become a cop.</v>

00:35:44.131 --> 00:35:47.880
<v Speaker 2>x amount of years old that he couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>get disqualified for being a cop.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's credited as gross.</v>

<v Speaker 2>let your kids play with other kids.</v>

<v Speaker 2>kids won't put their shoes on and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there for a half hour just</v>

762

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go on the road.</v>

792
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.460
<v Speaker 2>What would I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be a stay at home dad that adjust my</v>

<v Speaker 2>income accordingly.</v>

00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:27.240
<v Speaker 2>because I just feel like being with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be more important than,</v>

795

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the applause from strangers.</v>

796
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Well first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a feminist and as a feminist I</v>

797
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.740
<v Speaker 2>always do what women want me to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't tell you you're beautiful</v>

798
00:37:37.741 --> 00:37:38.640
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

799
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not judging them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do it.</v>

800
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something you have to say.</v>

801
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just something you want to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

802
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.950
<v Speaker 2>And I would want to say especially since</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true,</v>

803
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's true and you say it okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just do,</v>

<v Speaker 2>do better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do better period just to better.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what I'm finding is the older you get,</v>

806
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:09.900
<v Speaker 2>the less you run into people because</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they're in high school,</v>

807
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.230
<v Speaker 2>they start to just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't involve the parents at all.</v>

808
00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 2>They don't want their parents around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to make an effort to be</v>

809
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:18.450
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

810
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I want to see some of these parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I let you go over to their house,</v>

811
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:22.920
<v Speaker 2>because now it's getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good point.</v>

812
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're.</v>

813
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.140
<v Speaker 2>When they're little and Weirdos and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>little they really have you.</v>

814
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.270
<v Speaker 2>There's some weird stuff that goes on</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people having parties that my</v>

815
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.620
<v Speaker 2>daughter had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was 12 I think,</v>

816
00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:39.621
<v Speaker 2>or 13 and the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids party was held at the stand.</v>

817
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Not The standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Strand,</v>

818
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fancy hotel on sunset.</v>

819
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Really what's at the stamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the standard standard</v>

820
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:50.020
<v Speaker 2>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

821
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

822
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten there twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We work.</v>

823
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 2>We work on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started across the street literally</v>

824
00:38:57.311 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 2>across the street on that diner there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's open.</v>

825
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be 24 hours.</v>

826
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.163
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

827
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good food,</v>

828
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a place where when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>new to Hollywood you have parties there</v>

829
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of people with coke</v>
<v Speaker 2>and running around.</v>

830
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Naked Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a picture.</v>

831
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I was there once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rampage Jackson came out of the back</v>

832
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:18.240
<v Speaker 2>with sunglasses on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No shirt on and a fur coat and two super</v>

833
00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:21.220
<v Speaker 2>hot Chinese checks and I took a picture</v>
<v Speaker 2>of him.</v>

834
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:24.130
<v Speaker 2>It was back in the day before instagram</v>
<v Speaker 2>and twitter.</v>

835
00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:25.690
<v Speaker 2>I put it up online somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably.</v>

836
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

837
00:39:26.861 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I doubt if you can find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could find that you're a fucking</v>

838
00:39:29.591 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 2>wizard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with that is the standard is</v>

839
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:35.350
<v Speaker 2>probably from like 2004 or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

840
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.100
<v Speaker 2>It's still the same today and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter's like,</v>

841
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:42.730
<v Speaker 2>they're having a party in the one room</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the parents are having a party in</v>

842
00:39:42.731 --> 00:39:44.320
<v Speaker 2>the other room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

843
00:39:44.321 --> 00:39:47.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just parties that want to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and then we'll put the kids in</v>

844
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:48.364
<v Speaker 2>that room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So stupid.</v>

847
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Definitely fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are going to happen because</v>

848
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.400
<v Speaker 2>parents aren't paying any attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to bond each other.</v>

849
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 2>La,</v>

853
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:10.960

<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

854
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.800
<v Speaker 2>the moms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all talking about it at good</v>

855
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parents got together,</v>

856
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:22.300
<v Speaker 2>they got date frake on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You notice the sign,</v>

857
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.340
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they want to travel with you,</v>

858
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:28.030
<v Speaker 2>that's where it all goes down with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>swapping happens a lot on those</v>

859
00:40:28.031 --> 00:40:30.490
<v Speaker 2>vacations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone comes to you is like,</v>

860
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to go uh,</v>

861
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.590
<v Speaker 2>to the Grand Canyon with me and Carol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all camp</v>

862
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.680
<v Speaker 2>camping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>camping stuff.</v>

863
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:45.430
<v Speaker 2>You gotta do like hotels where there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a gym that's 24 hours and it's like</v>

864
00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.740
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just feel like,</v>

865
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting</v>

866
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:56.470
<v Speaker 2>to one of those massage rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think camping would be an easy one to</v>

867
00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:01.390
<v Speaker 2>just go into the bathroom in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is the woods are quiet.</v>

868
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.100
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hear everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hear it all.</v>

869
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:11.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the best sleep either.</v>

870
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Write up real easy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>dead zebra and he was basically through</v>

<v Speaker 2>by a bug and I feel that I'm too young</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

922
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 2>How old are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six and eight.</v>

923
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to give him malaria</v>
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>

924
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:40.100
<v Speaker 2>They are minor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eleven and 14.</v>

925
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 2>And this was the perfect time to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

926
00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.320
<v Speaker 2>The 14 year old was aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly in the younger one at 11 is</v>

927
00:43:49.701 --> 00:43:50.451
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's good.</v>

928
00:43:50.451 --> 00:43:51.740
<v Speaker 2>She can travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she can eat food,</v>

929
00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:55.880
<v Speaker 2>she could swallow pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like a person any earlier than</v>

930
00:43:55.881 --> 00:43:56.570
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would've been,</v>

931
00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:58.040
<v Speaker 2>it would've been hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

932
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.963
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

933
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.530
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be amazing though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

934
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.350
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>

935
00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.920
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mind blowing.</v>

936
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.040
<v Speaker 2>You definitely have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

937
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:07.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

938
00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 2>those things like you go on vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

939
00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:10.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to blow me away.</v>

940
00:44:10.071 --> 00:44:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

941
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.810
<v Speaker 2>you're kinda like always this patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then it's always becomes a little</v>

942
00:44:14.811 --> 00:44:18.590
<v Speaker 2>more simple than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of hang in this place and</v>

943
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:21.260
<v Speaker 2>by the end of it you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

944
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm still thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

945
00:44:23.871 --> 00:44:26.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like seeing a great movie and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get it out of your head.</v>

946
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like these things are going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa was pretty.</v>

947
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

948
00:44:32.071 --> 00:44:35.160
<v Speaker 2>like you really see just the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

949
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 2>of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>

950
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.980
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's just cool just being by</v>

951
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 2>these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

952
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:44.940
<v Speaker 2>you're literally by all these animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Africa.</v>

953
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

954
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:49.110
<v Speaker 2>but in a lot of ways it's still like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

955
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's one of the few places where</v>

956
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.610
<v Speaker 2>you can go and there's indigenous tribes</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially all over the continent yet</v>

957
00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.280
<v Speaker 2>that are living in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

958
00:44:59.281 --> 00:45:04.281
<v Speaker 2>really kind of primitive way complete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We took a balloon ride and balloon guy.</v>

959
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.710
<v Speaker 2>This isn't dangerous enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to ground with lions.</v>

960
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:11.940
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was right after the crash.</v>

961
00:45:11.941 --> 00:45:12.691
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

962
00:45:12.691 --> 00:45:16.200
<v Speaker 2>we got in the balloon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the safest and he got off</v>

963
00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we drifted out of the Serengeti and</v>

964
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:21.930
<v Speaker 2>the grammatic river and we're just kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of going for a little bit.</v>

965
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he brought it down in this clearing we</v>

966
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.430
<v Speaker 2>ended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ended up fucking movie,</v>

967
00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 2>brutal upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A tribe that lives there,</v>

968
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.500
<v Speaker 2>comes running out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cut,</v>

969
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.690
<v Speaker 2>they saw us coming down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started running,</v>

970
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 2>it got sticks and robes and they come</v>
<v Speaker 2>running and we land.</v>

971
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.000
<v Speaker 2>They've never seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never seen us before.</v>

972
00:45:42.001 --> 00:45:44.770
<v Speaker 2>They've never seen this before and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

973
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:50.540
<v Speaker 2>my daughter held up a cell phone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys who were older than her probably 15</v>

974
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.220
<v Speaker 2>ran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally ran at the site of a cell</v>

975
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 2>phone and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

976
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.510
<v Speaker 2>and they're so primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so basic.</v>

977
00:46:00.511 --> 00:46:03.120
<v Speaker 2>They're living in these little places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just raising cattle and just doing the</v>

978
00:46:03.121 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 2>primitive things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think I was more scared of them.</v>

979
00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Then the kids running from the cell</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

980
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.150
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only heard like Rwanda or the boat</v>

981
00:46:15.151 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 2>room thing and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know these people,</v>

982
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.413
<v Speaker 2>they can eat you.</v>

983
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 2>They've got a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've got two daughters with me.</v>

984
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:22.854
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

985
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.110
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took guy just gets in my face.</v>

986
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 2>She went on a route and getting crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like I'm taking that one.</v>

987
00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 2>You landed in my territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking that one dude.</v>

988
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you be uneasy?</v>

989
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I bought Kia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was uneasy.</v>

990
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't know how to speak their</v>

991
00:46:38.581 --> 00:46:41.220
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now think if you land on a fucking</v>

992
00:46:41.221 --> 00:46:45.120
<v Speaker 2>balloon and south central Chicago or</v>
<v Speaker 2>South South side of Chicago,</v>

993
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

994
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.063
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

995
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 2>You could learn a bad neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in America and a fucking</v>

996
00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:51.690
<v Speaker 2>balloon and getting a heap load of</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble,</v>

997
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.840
<v Speaker 2>but I felt bad about myself that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming that I'm landing in that these</v>

998
00:46:57.931 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 2>people must be trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instinct kind of kicks in.</v>

999
00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:03.570
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just kind of landed in the swamps</v>

1000
00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:06.210
<v Speaker 2>of Louisiana and nobody can hear you</v>
<v Speaker 2>scream.</v>

1001
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.360
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be weird if you landed in</v>

1002
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Speaker 2>some fucking strange little swamp town</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a bunch of people just gator hunting.</v>

1003
00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:15.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is at skaters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1004
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:17.190
<v Speaker 2>It's the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not knowing.</v>

1005
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 2>All I needed was someone to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the balloon guy be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He gets it a fucking gun fight at a gas</v>

1036
00:48:50.891 --> 00:48:55.300
<v Speaker 2>station at a gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were some rebels disagree with</v>

1037
00:48:55.301 --> 00:48:58.250
<v Speaker 2>something and they shot at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy was driving the car and it's,</v>

1038
00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.730
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so primitive.</v>

1039
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:05.731
<v Speaker 2>It's so you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to a little town and you come</v>

1040
00:49:05.771 --> 00:49:10.310
<v Speaker 2>into this town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like steel siding put up and</v>

1041
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.840
<v Speaker 2>chickens running around and I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a town,</v>

1042
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:15.110
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.490
<v Speaker 2>it's what you picture in your head of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a crazy African,</v>

1044
00:49:18.491 --> 00:49:19.900
<v Speaker 2>like bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1045
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:25.050
<v Speaker 2>And there's guys on motorcycles mean up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and down the street and you don't know.</v>

1046
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how this is going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1047
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is most of the time in those parts</v>

1048
00:49:30.971 --> 00:49:33.490
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything goes fine and that's right,</v>

1049
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.270
<v Speaker 2>but there's a high percentage of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in those places as opposed to an</v>

1050
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:40.600
<v Speaker 2>America where things don't go well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when they don't go well,</v>

1051
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:43.030
<v Speaker 2>they unraveled really quickly and it can</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not come back.</v>

1052
00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Then people stuff happens here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cops show up and it'll.</v>

1053
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.780
<v Speaker 2>They'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will get controlled by reading the</v>

00:49:49.781 --> 00:49:52.540
<v Speaker 2>cops just shoot you right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet again,</v>

1055
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:55.000
<v Speaker 2>getting control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cops listen to right?</v>

1056
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:57.670
<v Speaker 2>No fuck you move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you go into those towns.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1077
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.680
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like Clint Eastwood with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abbott.</v>

1078
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a shoulder strap and it's</v>

1079
00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:59.390
<v Speaker 3>pitino leather and you could smell the</v>
<v Speaker 3>leather on.</v>

1080
00:50:59.391 --> 00:51:00.224
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>

1081
00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:05.280
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at his shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're suede with a thin bottom thin.</v>

1082
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:09.040
<v Speaker 3>How's it heal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a very small heel,</v>

1083
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:12.620
<v Speaker 3>very thin under nondescript Suede shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's where?</v>

1084
00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:15.050
<v Speaker 3>It's gray of course that he rolls his</v>
<v Speaker 3>own cigarettes.</v>

1085
00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 3>He does roll his own cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're amazing.</v>

1086
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:21.590
<v Speaker 3>And he does it well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A man who controls on cigarettes quickly</v>

1087
00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 3>and very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look at that.</v>

1088
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 3>It looks professional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a machine did.</v>

1089
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:26.711
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>

1090
00:51:26.711 --> 00:51:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm reciting poetry to that girl.</v>

1091
00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:33.521
<v Speaker 3>Before that guy was embedded with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribe of cannibals for a year and didn't</v>

1092
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:36.590
<v Speaker 3>even speak their language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing,</v>

1093
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:41.590
<v Speaker 2>but I do feel that it's my American</v>
<v Speaker 2>paranoia is part of it and that I want</v>

1094
00:51:41.591 --> 00:51:46.591
<v Speaker 2>to be a better person and and assume</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these gentle people raising cattle</v>

1095
00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:48.663
<v Speaker 2>are kind</v>

1096
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:51.740
<v Speaker 3>or you should just assume that all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit you read every 20 minutes when you</v>

1097
00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:54.860
<v Speaker 3>get up in the morning and the New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>Times about people eating people over</v>

1098
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:55.694
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1099

1100
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.910

<v Speaker 3>We just want to think the world is a</v>

1101
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.490
<v Speaker 3>diversity is awesome.</v>

1102
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I felt I did have a conflicting thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>like lucky and they had already eaten</v>

1103
00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.030
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

1104
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:20.920
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need people</v>

1105
00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:28.220
<v Speaker 2>joking around folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is how I was acting.</v>

1106
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all cool,</v>

1107
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:33.880

<v Speaker 2>I was keeping my daughters by me.</v>

1108
00:52:33.881 --> 00:52:34.900

<v Speaker 3>Big Boulder of a man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he really does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1153
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I think he might be over there now or if</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not there now,</v>

1154
00:54:22.531 --> 00:54:24.870
<v Speaker 3>he's going back soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes there all the time.</v>

1155
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.140
<v Speaker 3>He's an amazing guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that guy has had malaria three</v>

1156
00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:29.490
<v Speaker 3>fucking times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1157
00:54:29.491 --> 00:54:30.510
<v Speaker 3>there's types of area.</v>

1158
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1159
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 3>he said there's types of malaria that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get that can last years.</v>

1160
00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.540
<v Speaker 3>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like 30 fucking years.</v>

1161
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them was like five months.</v>

1162
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.660
<v Speaker 3>One of them was 10 years and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>type that lasts for like 30 years and he</v>

1163
00:54:42.661 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 3>just didn't want to take medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1164
00:54:44.371 --> 00:54:47.520
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't take medication for some of</v>

1165
00:54:47.521 --> 00:54:48.870
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did for other ones.</v>

1166
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:52.320
<v Speaker 3>There's other people that he knows that</v>
<v Speaker 3>took medication and still got malaria,</v>

1167
00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.130
<v Speaker 3>but he's in the fucking heat of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1168
00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:55.631
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1169
00:54:55.631 --> 00:54:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in the Congo.</v>

1170
00:54:57.091 --> 00:54:58.210
<v Speaker 3>The Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1171
00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that malaria has killed half</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that have ever died ever.</v>

1172
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Out of all the things that have killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and all the history is the</v>

1174
00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:11.760
<v Speaker 3>biggest lols and fucking earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wagons,</v>

1175
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.580
<v Speaker 3>drowning malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half of them,</v>

1176
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.440
<v Speaker 3>half of them died because of malaria.</v>

1177
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.700
<v Speaker 3>That's not going to last though because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were able to go in and affect</v>

1178
00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:24.180
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes and the mosquitoes are going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go and take all that out.</v>

1179
00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:28.230
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that genetically modified</v>
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes all.</v>

1180
00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Where are you now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're GML pussies.</v>

1181
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Scared Gmo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we have is everything is non GMO.</v>

1182
00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:39.120
<v Speaker 3>It's super important to me to be clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to eat,</v>

1183
00:55:39.121 --> 00:55:41.100
<v Speaker 3>clean writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking cigarettes,</v>

1184
00:55:41.101 --> 00:55:45.060
<v Speaker 3>taken acid on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dirty hippy day,</v>

1185
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Gmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gmos have been with us forever and it's</v>

1186
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:53.850
<v Speaker 3>not a good idea for here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what's not a good idea.</v>

1187
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good idea to put pesticides</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your food.</v>

1188
00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 3>You know it and I knew it and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with things like GMO round up,</v>

1189
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows that roundup was created</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they could spray it with evil</v>

1190
00:56:05.191 --> 00:56:08.400
<v Speaker 3>chemicals because it makes it easier to</v>
<v Speaker 3>grow plants,</v>

1191
00:56:08.401 --> 00:56:11.400
<v Speaker 3>but it's not how it's supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

1192
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These shortcuts that people have created</v>

1193
00:56:13.951 --> 00:56:17.490
<v Speaker 3>for industrial arts farming to kill off</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeds and things like that.</v>

1194
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Pesticides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit is fucking terrible for you</v>

1195
00:56:21.031 --> 00:56:23.590
<v Speaker 3>and it gets in the water and that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets in the water.</v>

1196
00:56:23.591 --> 00:56:27.220
<v Speaker 3>I know a dude who has bone cancer and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>has bone cancer and a bunch of people in</v>

1197
00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 3>his neighborhood have cancer and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>all got cancer because they were near a</v>

1198
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:35.530
<v Speaker 3>fucking golf course and they had wells</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they were down down water from</v>

1199
00:56:35.531 --> 00:56:39.040
<v Speaker 3>the golf course and the golf course</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly sprayed pesticide all over</v>

1200
00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:40.750
<v Speaker 3>the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to keep that grass clean.</v>

1201
00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:45.040
<v Speaker 3>It's seeped into the ground water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people all drank that groundwater</v>

1202
00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.640
<v Speaker 3>and they got cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

1203
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.580
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Load of people in this guy's</v>

1204
00:56:48.581 --> 00:56:51.700
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood got cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has instead of a thigh.</v>

1205
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:56.730
<v Speaker 3>His femur is a rod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a metal rod and they like</v>

1206
00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:01.830
<v Speaker 3>rebuilt his leg had cut his femur out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that or remove your leg.</v>

1207
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.980
<v Speaker 3>You want to try a Rod?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1208
00:57:02.981 --> 00:57:07.981
<v Speaker 3>let's go with the rod and he's a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>rod in his leg like a gmo mosquitoes,</v>

1209
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:11.230
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible,</v>

1210
00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:13.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But genetically modified foods,</v>

1211
00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:17.410
<v Speaker 3>the more I've looked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I understand it now.</v>

1212
00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been with us forever.</v>

1213
00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Everything you fucking eat from oranges</v>
<v Speaker 3>to corn to tomatoes,</v>

1214
00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.970
<v Speaker 3>all those things have been genetically</v>
<v Speaker 3>modified.</v>

1215
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Most of those things have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified by traditional</v>

1216
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:33.460
<v Speaker 3>methods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional agricultural methods that we</v>

1217
00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:37.000
<v Speaker 3>don't think of as genetically modified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have like this ignorant view of it,</v>

1218
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:41.560
<v Speaker 3>like we think it's all being done with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the going into the DNA and injecting</v>

1219
00:57:41.561 --> 00:57:44.520
<v Speaker 3>dangerous chemicals and we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of.</v>

1220
00:57:44.521 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 3>They'd been like splicing plants</v>
<v Speaker 3>together forever.</v>

1221
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:52.111
<v Speaker 3>They've been doing certain aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 3>naturals of selection and selecting the</v>

1222
00:57:52.661 --> 00:57:56.830
<v Speaker 3>type of traits in foods that they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>and taking seeds and figuring out.</v>

1223
00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the other thing that I know</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the foods that you buy,</v>

1224
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:02.290
<v Speaker 3>the seeds aren't going to even work on</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1225
00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Like if you buy like tomatoes and those</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomatoes,</v>

1226
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:08.140
<v Speaker 3>like then they're probably not even</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to grow tomatoes from them from</v>

1227
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:09.280
<v Speaker 3>the seeds and those plants.</v>

1228
00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:13.950
<v Speaker 4>That's what's the thing that freaks me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you hear Gmo and you just think,</v>

1229
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:18.840
<v Speaker 4>I think okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone big is messing with our food and</v>

1230
00:58:18.841 --> 00:58:23.520
<v Speaker 4>then there's only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's smaller number of big people who</v>

1231
00:58:23.521 --> 00:58:26.170
<v Speaker 4>are manipulating food supply and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't care about you.</v>

1232
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:29.790
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even allow those old ways of</v>

1233
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.900
<v Speaker 4>modifying stuff because there's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking seeds out away from regular</v>

1234
00:58:33.901 --> 00:58:37.080
<v Speaker 4>farmers and I mean it's really that</v>
<v Speaker 4>part.</v>

1235
00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:42.590
<v Speaker 4>It's like the big brother part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>food industry that really scary and when</v>

1236
00:58:43.111 --> 00:58:44.430
<v Speaker 4>I hear Gmo I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1237
00:58:44.431 --> 00:58:46.800
<v Speaker 4>who's doing what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what level?</v>

1238
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 3>I think the same way when we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about how many employees do you</v>

1239
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:52.210
<v Speaker 3>have to have before you have to hire a</v>
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>

1240
00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.160
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're okay if you have to,</v>

1241
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.490
<v Speaker 3>if you have more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're a part of a big</v>

1242
00:58:57.491 --> 00:58:59.680
<v Speaker 3>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people do you have to have,</v>

1243
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:04.180
<v Speaker 3>but where no one feels responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of the actions of the</v>

1244
00:59:04.181 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you working for Monsanto,</v>

1245
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:12.580
<v Speaker 3>you're working for a fucking enormous</v>
<v Speaker 3>monster of a machine that needs to make</v>

1246
00:59:12.581 --> 00:59:14.560
<v Speaker 3>more money every month and the previous</v>
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>

1247
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:16.520
<v Speaker 4>Bigger than a lot of countries.</v>

1248
00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.370
<v Speaker 3>It's bigger than a lot of countries and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1249
00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.400
<v Speaker 3>it's the amount of money that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>generates is substantial worldwide.</v>

1250
00:59:22.401 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then here's the thing with the</v>

1251
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:29.390
<v Speaker 3>universe or infinite growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is this thing that a lot of</v>

1252
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:31.910
<v Speaker 3>corporations operate under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have stockholders.</v>

1253
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.890
<v Speaker 3>People want returns on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>investments.</v>

1254
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:38.120
<v Speaker 3>You want to make more money every</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter then you did the previous</v>

1255
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.320
<v Speaker 3>quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1256
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:41.300
<v Speaker 3>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't sustain that.</v>

1257
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:44.450
<v Speaker 3>Keeps going and going and going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you're a company like Monsanto,</v>

1258
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:49.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making any excuses for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying the way giant</v>

1259
00:59:49.401 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 3>corporations operate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>

1260
00:59:51.771 --> 00:59:56.771
<v Speaker 3>The CEO has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has an obligation to stockholders to</v>

1261
00:59:56.991 --> 01:00:00.470
<v Speaker 3>generate more income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's important that he made and if they</v>

1262
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:01.790
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll write them out.</v>

1263
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 3>The a new guy in here who's going to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>the job.</v>

1264
01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:07.400
<v Speaker 3>So if you take on the job of a CEO of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>major corporation,</v>

1265
01:00:07.401 --> 01:00:11.690
<v Speaker 3>your job is to make more fucking money</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time and it's a very high pressure</v>

1266
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 3>job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why it's worth so much money.</v>

1267
01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1268
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:16.760
<v Speaker 3>you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>

1269
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:21.761
<v Speaker 3>But that's why you need someone like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>FDA to keep an eye on it and keep them</v>

1270
01:00:22.371 --> 01:00:25.400
<v Speaker 3>small and break them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure they're not putting that stuff</v>

1271
01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:28.460
<v Speaker 3>in the wells and doing all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all bought and paid.</v>

1272
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:29.210
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1273
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.500
<v Speaker 3>but you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

1274
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.220
<v Speaker 3>if the corporation's goal is to just get</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger and make more,</v>

1275
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.330
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to put the brakes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say let's not put the bad water in</v>

1276
01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:39.130
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1277
01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:39.650
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

1278
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Somebody has to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody's gotta do it.</v>

1279
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the government is far from doing it.</v>

1280
01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:47.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the FDA with food that they let so</v>

1281
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:51.140
<v Speaker 3>much stuff slide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much stuff in our food that</v>

1282
01:00:51.141 --> 01:00:52.640
<v Speaker 3>isn't allowed in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1283
01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 3>well that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're bought and sold.</v>

1284
01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Like if they were looking out for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing they would do is look</v>

1285
01:00:57.711 --> 01:00:58.544
<v Speaker 3>into cigarettes.</v>

1286
01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.150
<v Speaker 3>There would be like some major</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation as to why politicians</v>

1287
01:01:02.151 --> 01:01:05.690
<v Speaker 3>haven't spoken out against cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are Cigarettes killing 500,000 people</v>

1288
01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:08.780
<v Speaker 3>and no one's doing anything to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that would be one of the first</v>

1289
01:01:08.781 --> 01:01:11.270
<v Speaker 3>things they would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you tried to exist at all,</v>

1290
01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.900
<v Speaker 3>if you had to see a new product like</v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes,</v>

1291
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.120
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of a half million people a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year and it wasn't doing anything good.</v>

1292
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck is that going to stick</v>

1293
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:19.551
<v Speaker 3>around?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1294
01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.190
<v Speaker 3>You make a bubblegum that's killing half</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people.</v>

1295
01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Here's what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>

1296
01:01:24.441 --> 01:01:26.400
<v Speaker 3>It makes you need that gum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1297
01:01:26.401 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 3>And then you want to get that gun back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who created that gun would be</v>

1298
01:01:29.151 --> 01:01:32.450
<v Speaker 3>thought of as a monster monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like you could be like,</v>

1299
01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:33.470
<v Speaker 3>what does your dad do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1300
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 3>well he runs a tobacco company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1301
01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:36.380
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh cool.</v>

1302
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:39.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So does the rest of the state everybody</v>

1303
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:41.470
<v Speaker 3>in North Carolina?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1304
01:01:41.471 --> 01:01:42.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he employs a lot of people in this</v>

1305
01:01:42.941 --> 01:01:43.431
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1306
01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:44.960
<v Speaker 3>excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does your dad do?</v>

1307
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he makes his addictive gum.</v>

1308
01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.490
<v Speaker 3>That kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Piece of shit.</v>

1309
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1310
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:55.320
<v Speaker 3>He wears a cape and he lives in a dark</v>
<v Speaker 3>castle.</v>

1311
01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:57.290
<v Speaker 3>It's never sunny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

1312
01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Just mysteriously goes around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>basement and it's about killing people.</v>

1313
01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:05.570
<v Speaker 3>He's so happy with his product killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>half a million a year and he has all the</v>

1314
01:02:05.571 --> 01:02:07.570
<v Speaker 3>money in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He buys off politicians.</v>

1315
01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with his evil gum money.</v>

1316
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:11.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're doing.</v>

1317
01:02:11.331 --> 01:02:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1318
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much difference.</v>

1319
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:15.440
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I think I was trying to</v>

1320
01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:18.680
<v Speaker 3>think of why like your buddy goes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>helps the pygmies and all these people</v>

1321
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to just go into these</v>

1322
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.620
<v Speaker 4>places and help these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and part of me was when I was there was</v>

1323
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:28.170
<v Speaker 4>thinking that it's almost like in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberal,</v>

1324
01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:32.580
<v Speaker 4>arrogant way offensive to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm here now.</v>

1325
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 4>I can help you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You live like this.</v>

1326
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 4>Let me make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as I was thinking about it,</v>

1327
01:02:40.771 --> 01:02:44.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that desire to go to work</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the pygmies and the go to help</v>

1328
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:48.150
<v Speaker 4>these people with their water and all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that we think we're better.</v>

1329
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:52.260
<v Speaker 4>You just see people that need help,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but unlike here in the county in this</v>

1330
01:02:52.261 --> 01:02:53.910
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see people that need help.</v>

1331
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.480
<v Speaker 4>It's a mess to be able to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know if you're really there.</v>

1332
01:02:57.481 --> 01:03:00.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like a build a well and these</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are happy,</v>

1333
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say I give them education and it's a</v>

1334
01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:06.930
<v Speaker 4>clear path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no FDA.</v>

1335
01:03:06.931 --> 01:03:08.730
<v Speaker 4>I know going against what I was saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

1336
01:03:08.731 --> 01:03:12.210
<v Speaker 4>but there is no government regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no complex corporations.</v>

1337
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.310
<v Speaker 4>If I want to help somebody here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1338
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.560
<v Speaker 4>how do you help people in Detroit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do you start?</v>

1339
01:03:16.561 --> 01:03:19.740
<v Speaker 4>How does it make an impact?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There he goes and sees pygmies.</v>

1340
01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.680
<v Speaker 4>He helps the pygmies and at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day he's helped pygmies.</v>

1341
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1342
01:03:23.941 --> 01:03:25.860
<v Speaker 4>There's a direct way to help people</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1343
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:29.640
<v Speaker 1>There is that thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you do something charitable</v>

1344
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:33.360
<v Speaker 1>that people think that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like peacocking your charitable</v>

1345
01:03:33.361 --> 01:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it for yourself and your</v>

1346
01:03:35.761 --> 01:03:36.710
<v Speaker 1>own ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1347
01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the other side of</v>

1348
01:03:38.191 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>looking at it like who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as the good work gets done.</v>

1349
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Like even if you have kind of Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish,</v>

1350
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ambitious sort of feared intentions</v>

1351
01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:49.560
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I do something good for people,</v>

1352
01:03:49.561 --> 01:03:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I want other people to know I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll admit it.</v>

1353
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

1354
01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:59.880
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a shitty motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did help somebody,</v>

1355
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got something out of it for sure.</v>

1356
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I got something out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Praise Tom Papa.</v>

1357
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pretty good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what I did.</v>

1358
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:12.103
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1359
01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.530
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

1360
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I will admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I go back,</v>

1361
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:20.700
<v Speaker 1>if I went back to Africa and help these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out with their drinking water.</v>

1362
01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:23.040
<v Speaker 1>This one wants to do a documentary on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them cash.</v>

1363
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a special and Kilimanjaro on my way</v>

1368
01:04:37.201 --> 01:04:39.120
<v Speaker 1>There's no conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no rebels.</v>

1369
01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.650
<v Speaker 1>It's nice and peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are kind of Nice.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What kind of jokes would you.</v>

1372
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.000
<v Speaker 1>When you're in Kilimanjaro,</v>

1373
01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:56.940

<v Speaker 4>so you have to be to get a little</v>

1374
01:04:57.101 --> 01:04:57.934
<v Speaker 4>physical.</v>

1375
01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Do the old grandpa and grandpa running</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the lion gag?</v>

1376
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:10.230
<v Speaker 1>A couple boob jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds good.</v>

1377
01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I saw the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the lion king.</v>

1378
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Jungle book last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1379
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.770
<v Speaker 3>I saw it on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spoiler alert.</v>

1380
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.780
<v Speaker 3>All the animals can talk in the kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

1381
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.780
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just took itself.</v>

1382
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.650
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as I heard Liam Neeson in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

1383
01:05:29.651 --> 01:05:32.110
<v Speaker 3>taking themselves too seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was out well,</v>

1384
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:34.410
<v Speaker 3>and also they had a gigantic pithy gus</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

1385
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 3>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was fascinating,</v>

1386
01:05:36.071 --> 01:05:39.360
<v Speaker 3>but they made it an orangutan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They decided that a gigantic Pythius</v>

1387
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:44.370
<v Speaker 3>wasn't orangutan an enormous orangutan</v>
<v Speaker 3>that knocked over a building.</v>

1388
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:48.280
<v Speaker 3>It was just 10 foot tall orangutan that</v>
<v Speaker 3>can talk.</v>

1389
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

1390
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.580
<v Speaker 3>Is it bad that I still want to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>Orangutang because it's sounds familiar.</v>

1391
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Were you saying it wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's neander tall also by the list.</v>

1392
01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not fall too tall.</v>

1393
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 4>Some of the oldest human remains were</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tanzania.</v>

1394
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:07.143
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1395
01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1396
01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:09.080
<v Speaker 3>how old were they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1397
01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think that's where people evolve.</v>

1398
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:14.510
<v Speaker 3>If you believe all that evolution</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense and not the Bible,</v>

1399
01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do believe it.</v>

1400
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I pity you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put your soul because you're going to</v>

1401
01:06:20.991 --> 01:06:23.480
<v Speaker 3>burn in a fiery pit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoops.</v>

1402
01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:24.530
<v Speaker 3>I pity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or twitter,</v>

1403
01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:29.620
<v Speaker 3>I guess you fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where people evolved,</v>

1404
01:06:30.081 --> 01:06:32.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or one of the main places.</v>

1405
01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.700
<v Speaker 3>I think the original place where human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

1406
01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1407
01:06:36.111 --> 01:06:36.561
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1408
01:06:36.561 --> 01:06:39.890
<v Speaker 3>And then obviously they branched out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>different species of human,</v>

1409
01:06:39.891 --> 01:06:44.870
<v Speaker 3>different branches of human evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always keep finding over the</v>

1410
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:47.300
<v Speaker 3>last few years a bunch of new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know these new branches,</v>

1411
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they finally some teeth and go what us</v>

1412
01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.420
<v Speaker 3>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we got a new job bone here guys.</v>

1413
01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.730
<v Speaker 3>And then they do some DNA on it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1414
01:06:55.731 --> 01:06:57.090
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck stick.</v>

1415
01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Did humans have tails?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll do via Tanzania.</v>

1416
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1417
01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:07.460
<v Speaker 3>This site in Tanzania that holds the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earliest evidence of the existence of</v>

1418
01:07:07.461 --> 01:07:09.170
<v Speaker 3>human ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta go,</v>

1419
01:07:09.171 --> 01:07:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1421
01:07:11.721 --> 01:07:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They found hundreds of fossilized bones</v>

1422
01:07:14.151 --> 01:07:18.770
<v Speaker 3>and stone tools in the area dating back</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of years leading them to</v>

1423
01:07:18.771 --> 01:07:21.440
<v Speaker 3>conclude that humans evolved in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1424
01:07:21.441 --> 01:07:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Millions.</v>

1425
01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know they had stone tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of years ago,</v>

1426
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:29.570
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of their saying fossilized bones and</v>

1427
01:07:29.571 --> 01:07:31.360
<v Speaker 3>stone tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also millions.</v>

1428
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Like how old was the oldest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had to guess right now,</v>

1429
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.680
<v Speaker 3>without any looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how old do you think the oldest stone</v>

1430
01:07:36.681 --> 01:07:37.970
<v Speaker 3>tool ever found was?</v>

1431
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.040
<v Speaker 4>The oldest stone tool was discovered by</v>
<v Speaker 4>Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia.</v>

1432
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:50.070
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's his,</v>

1433
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:51.500
<v Speaker 3>his beard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his old tool.</v>

1434
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:54.170
<v Speaker 3>That's what we call this stone tool.</v>

1435
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm very bad with thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1436
01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:58.450
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1437
01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:02.530
<v Speaker 4>numbers like back into the past and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and things out into the universe.</v>

1438
01:08:02.531 --> 01:08:04.390
<v Speaker 4>Like these billions don't make any</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>

1439
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:09.430
<v Speaker 4>but I would guess I'm in my dumb way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

1440
01:08:09.431 --> 01:08:13.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tool would be about a 2 million years</v>

1441
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:14.464
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Old.</v>

1442
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go with you.</v>

1443
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.530
<v Speaker 3>I'll say about 2 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm impressed.</v>

1444
01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Let's say two point 8 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1445
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a long time.</v>

1446
01:08:23.710 --> 01:08:26.000
<v Speaker 3>It's so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The artifacts are by far the oldest</v>

1447
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:28.790
<v Speaker 3>handmade stone tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet discovered the previous record</v>

1448
01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 3>holders known as the older ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't tools.</v>

1449
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:32.780
<v Speaker 3>We're about two point 6 million years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:12.890
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to put the pipeline</v>
<v Speaker 3>through North Dakota and they call them</v>

1491
01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:17.210
<v Speaker 3>the Lakota Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't say the Lakota native</v>

1492
01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not being offensive.</v>

1493
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:21.890
<v Speaker 3>The lakota people I think is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're supposed to be calling</v>

1494
01:10:21.891 --> 01:10:23.900
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they called them Indians in the</v>

1495
01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:25.790
<v Speaker 3>article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that other Indians called</v>

1496

1497
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.440
<v Speaker 3>Su means enemy who the Lakota people</v>
<v Speaker 3>were on notorious war like people.</v>

1498
01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:35.630

<v Speaker 3>That guy never didn't kill anybody,</v>

1525
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.310

1531
01:11:40.321 --> 01:11:42.810

<v Speaker 3>They all die really young back then.</v>

1532
01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.950
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1533
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:45.540
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that was true is he</v>
<v Speaker 3>survived.</v>

1534
01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:49.140
<v Speaker 3>He found an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a moose or an elk that</v>

1535
01:11:49.141 --> 01:11:52.080
<v Speaker 3>had been killed by wolves and he ate</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of that and he killed and ate a</v>

1536
01:11:52.081 --> 01:11:55.470
<v Speaker 3>snake and that's all he had to eat his</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire way back and his body's all</v>

1537
01:11:55.471 --> 01:11:57.690
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did crawl his way back to</v>

1538
01:11:57.691 --> 01:12:00.060
<v Speaker 3>wherever the fuck he was going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually,</v>

1539
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:01.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he,</v>

1540
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:02.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he got a horse you've got,</v>

1541
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:06.650
<v Speaker 3>you've got a horse swimming Indian and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote it to a fort and then it just kind</v>

1542
01:12:06.651 --> 01:12:09.630
<v Speaker 3>of ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he fell off the cliff and</v>

1543
01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:11.820
<v Speaker 3>landed in the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit never happened.</v>

1544
01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.820
<v Speaker 3>Made up the book is pretty accurate to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real account.</v>

1545
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my buddy told me to read it.</v>

1546
01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:17.693
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1547
01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:19.800
<v Speaker 3>putting together a little summer reading</v>
<v Speaker 3>list,</v>

1548
01:12:19.801 --> 01:12:22.740
<v Speaker 3>I threw that into the pile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that phrase.</v>

1549
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Pretty accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about like historical</v>

1550
01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:28.440
<v Speaker 3>events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have an obligation to have zero</v>

1551
01:12:28.441 --> 01:12:30.840
<v Speaker 3>bullshit that you add in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story better,</v>

1552
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:33.510
<v Speaker 3>but I think the book is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't tell you 100 percent,</v>

1553
01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.360
<v Speaker 3>but all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as I was reading it,</v>

1554
01:12:36.361 --> 01:12:40.380
<v Speaker 3>it's really good book because it really</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets into the smallness of like what you</v>

1555
01:12:40.381 --> 01:12:43.800
<v Speaker 3>have in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your utility bag and like walking</v>

1556
01:12:43.801 --> 01:12:46.080
<v Speaker 3>through and with this Indian would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is all,</v>

1557
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:49.020
<v Speaker 3>it's very little subtle day to day stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes the book great.</v>

1558
01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1559
01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:52.621
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1560
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:54.540
<v Speaker 3>it just kinda like drifted off in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ended.</v>

1561
01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:56.340
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot less drama.</v>

1562
01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:58.170
<v Speaker 3>The book was pretty dry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:12:58.171 --> 01:13:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the real life story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1564
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.790
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the account of all the stuff</v>

1565
01:13:02.791 --> 01:13:06.600
<v Speaker 3>that they carried with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like flint to start fires and things</v>

1566
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:07.850
<v Speaker 3>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1567
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:09.510
<v Speaker 3>The Flint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did they carry with them?</v>

1568
01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.880
<v Speaker 3>A little rope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little less fat,</v>

1569
01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.350
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>

1570
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.550
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1571
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:15.930
<v Speaker 3>to oil up their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1572
01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.810
<v Speaker 3>their tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1573
01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.670
<v Speaker 3>to make sure that their tools didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>rusted.</v>

1574
01:13:19.671 --> 01:13:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Probably a lot of stuff for their gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their gun maintenance.</v>

1575
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:27.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm what they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a supplies bag or it was a cooler name</v>

1576
01:13:28.051 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they had muskets back then.</v>

1577
01:13:30.151 --> 01:13:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would have like black powder and</v>

1578
01:13:32.071 --> 01:13:35.700
<v Speaker 3>they would pour it into the barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they would have to pack it down and</v>

1579
01:13:35.701 --> 01:13:39.810
<v Speaker 3>put a primer in and they had a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of flint they would drop down on a</v>

1580
01:13:39.811 --> 01:13:43.410
<v Speaker 3>hammer and the spark from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What had caused the explosion.</v>

1581
01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fucking primitive.</v>

1582
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:46.350
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

1583
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

1584
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:51.790
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how people just not just</v>

1585
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.060
<v Speaker 3>got by back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually would go out into the</v>

1586
01:13:54.061 --> 01:13:56.190
<v Speaker 3>woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like barely,</v>

1587
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:59.540
<v Speaker 3>barely supply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

1588
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just against the weather.</v>

1589
01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Prepared.</v>

1590
01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:06.600
<v Speaker 3>You'll one pair of clothes I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much food they would bring and how</v>

1591
01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:09.930
<v Speaker 3>much that we just rely upon the land</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't really know what the</v>

1592
01:14:09.931 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 3>hell was ahead of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would</v>

1593
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.970
<v Speaker 2>salt a lot of meat right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would salt it and jerk it and carry</v>

1594
01:14:15.971 --> 01:14:17.220
<v Speaker 2>that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1595
01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:20.500
<v Speaker 2>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ate that when you were in a fix,</v>

1596
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had no food for awhile,</v>

1597
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:24.590
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't carry a lot of stuff.</v>

1598
01:14:24.591 --> 01:14:26.110
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't refrigerate stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1599
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.490
<v Speaker 2>you're just living out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite.</v>

1600
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Think about a scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be just like sleeping there and</v>

1601
01:14:33.701 --> 01:14:34.780
<v Speaker 2>knowing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1602
01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.840
<v Speaker 2>native Americans are coming through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woods.</v>

1603
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got really stuck that you're on their</v>

1604
01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:40.891
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1605
01:14:40.891 --> 01:14:41.980
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1606
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:44.140
<v Speaker 2>and you really are on their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

1607
01:14:44.141 --> 01:14:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Like you're really not supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1608
01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Brian Invading Army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I put this article up yesterday that</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody tweeted that I retweeted.</v>

1610
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:59.980
<v Speaker 2>It was just a shocking article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started reading it about all of the</v>

1611
01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:01.040
<v Speaker 2>northern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1612
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.000
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1613
01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:06.280
<v Speaker 2>southern California murders that</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved Indians and then California in</v>

1614
01:15:06.281 --> 01:15:08.410
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many native Americans were</v>

1615
01:15:08.411 --> 01:15:12.850
<v Speaker 2>murdered when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in establishing California when they</v>

1616
01:15:12.851 --> 01:15:14.440
<v Speaker 2>were pioneering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they were first coming,</v>

1617
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:16.410
<v Speaker 2>oh my God did this.</v>

1618
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:21.450
<v Speaker 2>But these accounts were horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like firsthand accounts of thousands of</v>

1619
01:15:22.091 --> 01:15:24.370
<v Speaker 2>people are getting slaughtered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including children,</v>

1620
01:15:24.371 --> 01:15:25.540
<v Speaker 2>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

1621
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

1622
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:28.660
<v Speaker 2>This all happened a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1623
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:34.510
<v Speaker 2>After reading the revenant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided I was so excited about reading</v>

1624
01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:36.350
<v Speaker 2>about the west I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1625
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:39.110
<v Speaker 2>let me learn about how the Indians</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually live.</v>

1626
01:15:39.111 --> 01:15:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're small bags.</v>

1627
01:15:40.421 --> 01:15:42.250
<v Speaker 2>What did they carry and what was their</v>
<v Speaker 2>day to day?</v>

1628
01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I really wanted to kind of get into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an idiot.</v>

1629
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I pick up a barry may have wounded knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the most horrific account of</v>

1630
01:15:51.911 --> 01:15:55.030
<v Speaker 2>the slaughter of native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1631
01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:56.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe after tribe.</v>

1632
01:15:56.231 --> 01:15:59.710
<v Speaker 2>It just takes you through our expansion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going into each state and lying and</v>

1633
01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:02.410
<v Speaker 2>destroying and killing men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women and children.</v>

1634
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.590
<v Speaker 2>It's unreadable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally can't get through it.</v>

1635
01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:07.160
<v Speaker 2>It's so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1636
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I want to read a nice Indian story where</v>
<v Speaker 2>a white guy comes out and they know he's</v>

1637
01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 2>cool and he gets a girlfriend and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the one cool white guy and hangs</v>

1638
01:16:17.231 --> 01:16:18.040
<v Speaker 2>with the Indians.</v>

1639
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I love Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dancing with wolves is my favorite</v>

1640
01:16:21.821 --> 01:16:24.490
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the beautiful white man becomes the</v>

1641
01:16:24.491 --> 01:16:26.530
<v Speaker 2>best Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1642
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking horrible movie.</v>

1643
01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:35.050
<v Speaker 2>The best of the group who gets the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hottest woman is a beautiful white man</v>

1644
01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:37.030
<v Speaker 2>with a ponytail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts off slow.</v>

1645
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:39.300
<v Speaker 2>He gets his ass kicked early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>

1646
01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:40.990
<v Speaker 2>some of the young guys don't trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1647
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.400
<v Speaker 2>it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of rivalries.</v>

1648
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Here's the story arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take a long time.</v>

1649
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:49.930
<v Speaker 2>We need three plus hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three hours kind of fucking movie as</v>

1650
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:51.460
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has to win the Indians.</v>

1651
01:16:51.461 --> 01:16:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take time.</v>

1652
01:16:52.721 --> 01:16:55.180
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Kevin Costner's onboard,</v>

1653
01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.150
<v Speaker 2>so Kevin believes in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sold.</v>

1654
01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Kevin is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1655
01:17:00.281 --> 01:17:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Kevin has been researching this for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

1656
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be within your best interest to</v>

1657
01:17:05.861 --> 01:17:09.050
<v Speaker 2>make this film because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone will just tell you that now.</v>

1658
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're</v>

1659
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.310
<v Speaker 1>here out of respect because of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous relationship that we have with</v>

1660
01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:17.570
<v Speaker 1>universal getting made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is getting is getting made.</v>

1661
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:20.590
<v Speaker 1>This is an amazing film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

1662
01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Kevin becomes the best Indian at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the movie.</v>

1663
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:29.050
<v Speaker 1>He kicks everyone's ass and Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's Pocahontas fucks their wives</v>

1664
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.350
<v Speaker 1>and think about all the Indians you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to employ in this movie.</v>

1665
01:17:33.351 --> 01:17:35.480
<v Speaker 1>You won't have to hire black people for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the year,</v>

1666
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:40.570
<v Speaker 1>and there was a young man at one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>in time in the film who seemed like he</v>

1667
01:17:41.961 --> 01:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>and Kevin would be rivals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually he worships Kevin.</v>

1668
01:17:45.210 --> 01:17:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin is amazing.</v>

1669
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Kevin begins to dress like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another though goes to a</v>

1670
01:17:50.211 --> 01:17:53.780
<v Speaker 1>barber and gets his haircut perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>around his ears.</v>

1671
01:17:53.781 --> 01:17:55.630
<v Speaker 1>It's weird like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you looked at St Louis?</v>

1672
01:17:55.631 --> 01:17:59.000
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't waterworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of melody,</v>

1673
01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.410
<v Speaker 1>but whatever's going on at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously got some product in that</v>

1674
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:04.370
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1675
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's.</v>

1676
01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:07.130
<v Speaker 1>What's happening big time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1677
01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:08.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in a.</v>

1678
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:11.050
<v Speaker 1>In a hair metal band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1679
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:14.170
<v Speaker 1>My favorite is Wyatt earp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see when he played wider</v>

1680
01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.270
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he played wider and wider.</v>

1681
01:18:17.271 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Was Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just put a wig on a 40 year old</v>

1682
01:18:19.671 --> 01:18:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Costner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1683
01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just make them one of these aging and</v>

1684
01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.870
<v Speaker 1>give him a fucking word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>

1685
01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:25.010
<v Speaker 1>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. I don't know,</v>

1686
01:18:25.011 --> 01:18:27.590
<v Speaker 1>why did you beat me up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy beats him up and he's got this</v>

1687
01:18:27.591 --> 01:18:30.320
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a 40 year old guy with a wig on and</v>

1688
01:18:30.321 --> 01:18:31.850
<v Speaker 1>no one's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's freaking out.</v>

1689
01:18:31.851 --> 01:18:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1690
01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:37.900
<v Speaker 1>your kid's weird looking and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking 25 years later it looks exactly</v>

1691
01:18:39.771 --> 01:18:41.390
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so strange.</v>

1692
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Voices a little deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got the loose skin thing going</v>

1693
01:18:46.071 --> 01:18:50.180
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got a mop of hair crazy fast.</v>

1694
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have CGI back then.</v>

1695
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.750
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't make it look like an 18</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old.</v>

1696
01:18:55.751 --> 01:18:58.060
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't four k.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one was really looking back.</v>

1697
01:18:58.061 --> 01:19:01.520
<v Speaker 1>It looks so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like not even the healthiest</v>

1698
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.700
<v Speaker 1>40 year old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 40 year old guy that probably does</v>

1699
01:19:04.701 --> 01:19:06.950
<v Speaker 1>a little coke every now and then I lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>

1700
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I let him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

1701
01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Mr. I don't want that trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him in wider,</v>

1702
01:19:12.141 --> 01:19:14.690
<v Speaker 1>but that's not him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was the youngest,</v>

1703
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:19.340
<v Speaker 1>that's him in the movie somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had an also lazy bitch.</v>

1704
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even bother losing any weight for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that moving because he has a little bit</v>

1705
01:19:23.181 --> 01:19:26.510
<v Speaker 1>of a double chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a movie star.</v>

1706
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1707
01:19:27.711 --> 01:19:28.371
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

1708
01:19:28.371 --> 01:19:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm directing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm acting,</v>

1709
01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to snack.</v>

1710
01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm dealing with a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1711
01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.600
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Kevin called and dances with</v>

1712
01:19:38.601 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 1>wolves is a fucking awesome movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it,</v>

1713
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:43.930
<v Speaker 1>but that is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're going in thinking like</v>

1714
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:47.930
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get that level of Indian</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun and then you read bury me at wounded</v>

1715
01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:50.390
<v Speaker 1>knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first chapter alone is like a</v>

1716
01:19:50.391 --> 01:19:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's really rough.</v>

1717
01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It is incredibly fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you stop and think about the time</v>

1718
01:19:57.531 --> 01:20:02.300
<v Speaker 1>period of the 18 hundreds and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous to that how,</v>

1719
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:05.150
<v Speaker 1>how recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was incredibly fucked up.</v>

1720
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly fucked up and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

1721
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.810
<v Speaker 2>How much has happened is has happened up</v>
<v Speaker 2>till now.</v>

1722
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean walking through this area in</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the dark with no lights and it</v>

1723
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:20.030
<v Speaker 2>was like being in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1724
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:23.770
<v Speaker 2>And now they didn't have overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys camped at night and they</v>

1725
01:20:23.771 --> 01:20:25.080
<v Speaker 2>didn't have flashlights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1726
01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:27.600
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't even light a fire because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought it was going to track the</v>

1727
01:20:27.601 --> 01:20:30.120
<v Speaker 2>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1728
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.420
<v Speaker 2>This is not long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1729
01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not long ago at all.</v>

1730
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.960
<v Speaker 2>What people do when they find new spots</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what they've done throughout</v>

1731
01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:42.180
<v Speaker 2>history to find out who's owning those</v>
<v Speaker 2>bots.</v>

1732
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:43.740
<v Speaker 2>What's all the good stuff in those</v>
<v Speaker 2>spots.</v>

1733
01:20:44.050 --> 01:20:45.210
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to kill those people to get</v>

1734
01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:46.230
<v Speaker 2>that good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1735
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:50.070
<v Speaker 2>and then they just jack them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why more parts of</v>

1736
01:20:50.071 --> 01:20:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Africa were exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to it to.</v>

1737
01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enormous.</v>

1738
01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.630
<v Speaker 2>If you think about the sheer size of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa and then there was also a lot of</v>

1739
01:20:57.631 --> 01:20:58.970
<v Speaker 2>stuff they tried to exploit.</v>

1740
01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.020
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the famous things about the Congo</v>

1741
01:21:01.021 --> 01:21:06.021
<v Speaker 2>is that European settlers tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to take the Congo and they</v>

1742
01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:10.320
<v Speaker 2>tried to colonize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tried to move in and they tried to</v>

1743
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:13.320
<v Speaker 2>gentrify the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to like build houses and</v>

1744
01:21:13.321 --> 01:21:17.760
<v Speaker 2>they're still the remains of a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these incredible mansions.</v>

1745
01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.950
<v Speaker 2>He tried to put like plantations up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Congo.</v>

1746
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:22.130
<v Speaker 2>You go through all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was of.</v>

1747
01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:24.480
<v Speaker 2>That's when the Germans were here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when the French owned it.</v>

1748
01:21:24.481 --> 01:21:26.970
<v Speaker 2>That's when the British owned it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the way it was.</v>

1749
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:29.790
<v Speaker 2>People just came from Europe and took it</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and owned it.</v>

1750
01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:35.060
<v Speaker 2>The difference is they didn't come in in</v>
<v Speaker 2>most cases and slaughter everybody and</v>

1751
01:21:35.341 --> 01:21:39.900
<v Speaker 2>try and take it over for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came in and just try to adapt those</v>

1752
01:21:39.901 --> 01:21:42.150
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people weren't moving down.</v>

1753
01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:44.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a hostile environment and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1754
01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's diamonds and all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and.</v>

1755
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:52.340
<v Speaker 2>But there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no real like minor thing that</v>

1756
01:21:52.591 --> 01:21:56.290
<v Speaker 2>you could exploit and bring to the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world in these areas that are.</v>

1757
01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:59.460
<v Speaker 2>There is in some areas and those areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>of deep trouble,</v>

1758
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:02.460
<v Speaker 2>that's where you get like conflict</v>
<v Speaker 2>minerals.</v>

1759
01:22:02.770 --> 01:22:07.020
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that is they're getting some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these minerals that they need for cell</v>

1760
01:22:07.021 --> 01:22:10.260
<v Speaker 2>phones and for some different things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of those from Africa,</v>

1761
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was coming in big in Africa is China.</v>

1762
01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 2>China is going in and building stadiums,</v>
<v Speaker 2>building football stadiums,</v>

1763
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:20.640
<v Speaker 2>soccer stadiums,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really going in and building them for</v>

1764
01:22:20.641 --> 01:22:23.610
<v Speaker 2>free so they get and then they get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the government and they get all</v>

1765
01:22:23.611 --> 01:22:27.300
<v Speaker 2>these contracts because they see Africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the place that's going to be</v>

1766
01:22:27.301 --> 01:22:30.180
<v Speaker 2>exploited in the future in China's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

1767
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard they're buying up enormous</v>

1769
01:22:33.451 --> 01:22:34.920
<v Speaker 2>swaths of land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1770
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of weird.</v>

1771
01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Bended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that China has gone on is that</v>

1772
01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:41.520
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of capitalists now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1773
01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:42.900
<v Speaker 2>a fiercely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:47.930
<v Speaker 2>But they're also not in that they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely control their people can shut</v>

1775
01:22:47.971 --> 01:22:51.360
<v Speaker 2>down aspects of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a friend who was an executive</v>

1776
01:22:51.361 --> 01:22:55.320
<v Speaker 2>at Google and they were going over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to talk with the Chinese and</v>

1777
01:22:55.321 --> 01:22:57.060
<v Speaker 2>trying to negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring google,</v>

1778
01:22:57.061 --> 01:23:02.061
<v Speaker 2>but they had like some really bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 2>demands as far as their ability to enact</v>

1779
01:23:02.131 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 2>censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of it they have no</v>

1780
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:11.550
<v Speaker 3>laws when it comes to enforcing</v>
<v Speaker 3>copyright protection and um,</v>

1781
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:16.030
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fraudulent items like they have full</v>

1782
01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:18.970
<v Speaker 3>apple stores in China that are all</v>
<v Speaker 3>fakes.</v>

1783
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.100
<v Speaker 3>It's 100 percent counterfeit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1784
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.530
<v Speaker 3>It has a giant apple logo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go in there,</v>

1785
01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 3>you buy apple laptops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have the right names,</v>

1786
01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:30.160
<v Speaker 3>the right specifications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of it's fake and apple can't do</v>

1787
01:23:30.161 --> 01:23:31.670
<v Speaker 3>anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do a damn thing.</v>

1788
01:23:31.671 --> 01:23:34.990
<v Speaker 3>I can't do a damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing they can do and the</v>

1789
01:23:34.991 --> 01:23:36.320
<v Speaker 3>government's not going to do shitty</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1790
01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:38.740
<v Speaker 3>There's just what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1791
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:43.800
<v Speaker 3>This is a fake apple store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in China and it looks exactly like</v>

1792
01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.280
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has the same images on the wall.</v>

1793
01:23:48.281 --> 01:23:51.160
<v Speaker 3>They copied the images.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is top of the logo.</v>

1794
01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Now that you know it is off just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

1795
01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't think so.</v>

1796
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:56.830
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't think so at all.</v>

1797
01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Look to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has all the same ads.</v>

1798
01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:02.230
<v Speaker 3>They steal everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They steal all the ads.</v>

1799
01:24:02.231 --> 01:24:05.380
<v Speaker 3>They steal the font,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they steal the same sort of tables,</v>

1800
01:24:05.381 --> 01:24:08.530
<v Speaker 3>the thick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know earthy wooden tables that make</v>

1801
01:24:08.531 --> 01:24:12.250
<v Speaker 3>you feel good when you sit down on those</v>
<v Speaker 3>are our children and it's spelled store</v>

1802
01:24:12.251 --> 01:24:17.251
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>S t e r s t o u r get away with it.</v>

1803
01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1804
01:24:19.530 --> 01:24:20.030
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1805
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Your apple store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apple store.</v>

1806
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:24.610
<v Speaker 3>This can't be common though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1807
01:24:24.611 --> 01:24:25.450
<v Speaker 3>It's common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1808
01:24:25.451 --> 01:24:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is common.</v>

1809
01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1810
01:24:27.021 --> 01:24:30.100
<v Speaker 3>they just do this constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a problem with this.</v>

1811
01:24:30.101 --> 01:24:34.420
<v Speaker 3>In the archery world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a company called rage.</v>

1812
01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:39.760
<v Speaker 3>They make probably the most popular</v>
<v Speaker 3>broadhead for hunting.</v>

1813
01:24:40.331 --> 01:24:44.560
<v Speaker 3>It's called a rage hypodermic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very complicated design because</v>

1814
01:24:44.561 --> 01:24:46.390
<v Speaker 3>it's what's called a mechanical</v>
<v Speaker 3>broadhead.</v>

1815
01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:51.430
<v Speaker 3>And what this means is with archery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the accuracy in archery</v>

1816
01:24:51.431 --> 01:24:54.010
<v Speaker 3>involves drag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how little drag you have,</v>

1817
01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.750
<v Speaker 3>meaning how much air impacts the Arrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>wind drift things on those lines.</v>

1818
01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:02.380
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have an Arrow that's cutting</v>

1819
01:25:02.381 --> 01:25:06.040
<v Speaker 3>through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it has to be aerodynamic and it has</v>

1820
01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:09.100
<v Speaker 3>to operate in a specific way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the most accurate ones are these,</v>

1821
01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.460
<v Speaker 3>these arrowheads that are called</v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanical broadheads.</v>

1822
01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:15.060
<v Speaker 3>The problem with these things is they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1823
01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:18.910
<v Speaker 3>they open up on impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they hit and then they open up and</v>

1824
01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:22.480
<v Speaker 3>they create this huge wound channel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it goes open to like two inches.</v>

1825
01:25:22.481 --> 01:25:26.530
<v Speaker 3>But everything has to be like high</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality steel,</v>

1826
01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:30.040
<v Speaker 3>razor sharp blades that it has to fit</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly.</v>

1827
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:33.130
<v Speaker 3>The tolerances are incredibly small</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everything has to be.</v>

1828
01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:36.160
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about like to be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical hunter,</v>

1829
01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:39.130
<v Speaker 3>you have to not just be good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to make an accurate shot,</v>

1830
01:25:39.131 --> 01:25:41.170
<v Speaker 3>you have to practice and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the best equipment.</v>

1831
01:25:41.171 --> 01:25:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like one of the best pieces</v>

1832
01:25:43.031 --> 01:25:46.840
<v Speaker 3>of equipment you could buy if it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is they're making fake</v>

1833
01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:50.470
<v Speaker 3>ones in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No blades are dull and the metals cheap</v>

1834
01:25:50.471 --> 01:25:52.360
<v Speaker 3>and they break off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they selling them here?</v>

1835
01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:53.680
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't know.</v>

1836
01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.150
<v Speaker 3>They don't even know if they're buying</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1837
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could buy them from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>disreputable company that's getting them</v>

1838
01:25:58.541 --> 01:26:00.340
<v Speaker 3>from China and they look exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

1839
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.200
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has the same logo,</v>

1840
01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 3>the same fonts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you buy</v>

1841
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:06.390
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're shooting amount on animal,</v>

1842
01:26:06.391 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 1>like it's entirely likely you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting a cheap piece of steel against</v>

1843
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:14.090
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for this company that's put all this</v>

1844
01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:16.130
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company a rage that's put</v>

1845
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:20.150
<v Speaker 1>incredible amounts of money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and designing this incredible</v>

1846
01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:22.900
<v Speaker 1>piece of archery hunting equipment</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1847
01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:27.710
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course China is ruthless.</v>

1848
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean with us like that with all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff we're saying that like if</v>

1849
01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.080
<v Speaker 1>she's dead right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she died,</v>

1850
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>she did die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was nice.</v>

1851
01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:40.430
<v Speaker 1>She was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole poaching problem in Africa.</v>

1852
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:41.900
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1853
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:43.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1854
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.990
<v Speaker 1>They don't get what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want Rhino Horn and uh,</v>

1855
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:49.220
<v Speaker 1>they'll pay millions of dollars for</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing what it does to your Dick.</v>

1856
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:51.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't do anything.</v>

1857
01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Let's check and see if they're paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

1858
01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.550
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you really happy for a second?</v>

1859
01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Because they were saying because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about how they work in this</v>

1860
01:27:02.151 --> 01:27:05.090
<v Speaker 1>whole like Serengeti area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like a place just for rhinos.</v>

1861
01:27:05.091 --> 01:27:07.790
<v Speaker 1>It's the only animal that they've walled</v>
<v Speaker 1>off because they were in there trying to</v>

1862
01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:09.620
<v Speaker 1>protect it from these poachers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Credible.</v>

1863
01:27:09.650 --> 01:27:10.940
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1864
01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:14.540
<v Speaker 1>the only explanation is do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>here to.</v>

1865
01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see that they three d printed a</v>

1866
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.690
<v Speaker 1>fake rhino horns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1867
01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.870
<v Speaker 1>use cellulose and all the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1868
01:27:20.871 --> 01:27:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's cellulose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1869
01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Like what are they used to make them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they are three d printing,</v>

1870
01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:27.920
<v Speaker 1>fake rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horn.</v>

1871
01:27:27.921 --> 01:27:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That literally the seemed to be rhino</v>

1872
01:27:30.561 --> 01:27:31.900
<v Speaker 1>horns to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to collectors.</v>

1873
01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:33.290
<v Speaker 1>They're going to flood the market with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1874
01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.420
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is great.</v>

1875
01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:37.460
<v Speaker 1>But it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should also put chips in.</v>

1876
01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm in busted with people buying it.</v>

1882
01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:52.100

<v Speaker 1>I went by a in Tanzania next to the</v>

1883
01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Serengeti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Serengeti is this huge national</v>

1884
01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:58.790
<v Speaker 1>preserve and the place where I stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Guy Paul Tudor Jones,</v>

1885
01:27:59.090 --> 01:28:03.440
<v Speaker 1>who's a focusing is a guy in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in New York,</v>

1886
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Hedge Fund guy who a philanthroper now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1887
01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:11.540
<v Speaker 1>he bought all the land next to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serengeti where people were poaching and</v>

1888
01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:13.430
<v Speaker 1>people were destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole population.</v>

1889
01:28:13.431 --> 01:28:16.940
<v Speaker 1>There were no animals and he went in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought the land,</v>

1890
01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.240
<v Speaker 1>bought up all the hunting licenses from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1891
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:25.300
<v Speaker 1>from Tanzania for 99 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in 10 years time it just exploded</v>

1892
01:28:27.021 --> 01:28:29.750
<v Speaker 1>with animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole population is back.</v>

1893
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poaching is major,</v>

1894
01:28:32.451 --> 01:28:33.284
<v Speaker 1>Major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major problem.</v>

1895
01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with poaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1896
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:40.960
<v Speaker 1>the word poaching [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is really fucking poor</v>

1897
01:28:41.151 --> 01:28:45.710
<v Speaker 1>people that are just trying to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like to say that like poaching is an</v>

1898
01:28:45.711 --> 01:28:49.280
<v Speaker 1>issue in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is an issue in Africa,</v>

1899
01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poaching is a symptom of the poverty in</v>

1900
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting lunch,</v>

1901
01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:57.440
<v Speaker 1>not even necessarily talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big money stuff like the ivory trade</v>

1902
01:28:57.441 --> 01:29:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and the Rhino Horn trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be applied to that as well.</v>

1903
01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 1>But a big part of poaching</v>

1904
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.200
<v Speaker 3>is just meat is just eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stealing meat.</v>

1905
01:29:04.201 --> 01:29:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call them poachers,</v>

1906
01:29:05.701 --> 01:29:08.040
<v Speaker 3>but what they really are is that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters.</v>

1907
01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:10.710
<v Speaker 3>They're aren't property owners right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these guys,</v>

1908
01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:11.760
<v Speaker 3>they run around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1909
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:14.730
<v Speaker 3>they do snares to catch these animal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>snares.</v>

1910
01:29:14.731 --> 01:29:16.560
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have these really shitty,</v>

1911
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:19.400
<v Speaker 3>almost like musket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like guns that they've devised,</v>

1912
01:29:19.401 --> 01:29:21.600
<v Speaker 3>like really similar to take a rifle and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1913
01:29:21.601 --> 01:29:24.180
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have bullets so they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rocks in it.</v>

1914
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:28.860
<v Speaker 3>They put things in it and then they pack</v>
<v Speaker 3>in gunpowder and they light it and make</v>

1915
01:29:28.861 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 3>it blow like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking rifle or like a musket.</v>

1916
01:29:31.831 --> 01:29:32.720
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1917
01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:34.800
<v Speaker 3>they use some really shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some of them.</v>

1918
01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:37.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you can't put your western.</v>

1919
01:29:37.391 --> 01:29:39.790
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a tendency to put</v>

1920
01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:42.310
<v Speaker 4>everything through our western prism and</v>
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

1921
01:29:42.311 --> 01:29:43.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just a horrible thing,</v>

1922
01:29:43.901 --> 01:29:47.650
<v Speaker 4>but when you go through these villages</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they literally are walking a mile</v>

1923
01:29:47.651 --> 01:29:50.290
<v Speaker 4>for water and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get meat,</v>

1924
01:29:50.291 --> 01:29:52.030
<v Speaker 4>that's like a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean look,</v>

1925
01:29:52.031 --> 01:29:54.790
<v Speaker 4>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was my wife's birthday when we were</v>

1926
01:29:54.791 --> 01:29:57.430
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have the phrase happy</v>

1927
01:29:57.431 --> 01:30:00.040
<v Speaker 4>birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't celebrate birthdays.</v>

1928
01:30:00.041 --> 01:30:04.240
<v Speaker 4>Like they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because you'll have to have gifts,</v>

1929
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:06.520
<v Speaker 4>will have to take time away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>working.</v>

1930
01:30:06.521 --> 01:30:09.280
<v Speaker 4>We'll have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just never came up with the concept</v>

1931
01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:12.040
<v Speaker 4>happy birthday because their life is</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>

1932
01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.630
<v Speaker 4>They don't have a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1933
01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:16.900
<v Speaker 4>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a word for dessert,</v>

1934
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:19.540
<v Speaker 4>they don't celebrate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're hardworking,</v>

1935
01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.230
<v Speaker 4>surviving people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just to the point that you're right,</v>

1936
01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:27.600
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of people that just need</v>
<v Speaker 4>meet for their family and they're not</v>

1937
01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:31.600
<v Speaker 4>thinking that a tourist from La is</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming in and wants to take pictures of,</v>

1938
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:33.700
<v Speaker 4>of the Zebra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1939
01:30:33.850 --> 01:30:37.660
<v Speaker 4>But there's gotta be a way to Parse it</v>
<v Speaker 4>out because China's still is a huge</v>

1940
01:30:37.661 --> 01:30:41.530
<v Speaker 4>problem and they're taking all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals for endangered animals,</v>

1941
01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:43.540
<v Speaker 4>not for meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1942
01:30:43.541 --> 01:30:46.450
<v Speaker 4>They're coming in and taking rhinos are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're taking cheetahs,</v>

1943
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:49.930
<v Speaker 4>were not many survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even just the nature taking Cheetah's</v>

1944
01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:53.020
<v Speaker 4>just for the coats they'd like to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>hats out of them.</v>

1945
01:30:53.170 --> 01:30:54.250
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cheetahs,</v>

1946
01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:56.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably jockstraps.</v>

1947
01:30:56.441 --> 01:31:00.140
<v Speaker 4>It's all jockstrap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the steps in China.</v>

1948
01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:03.260
<v Speaker 4>You don't know that well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've seen the Cheetah judge</v>

1949
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:04.123
<v Speaker 4>jockstraps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1950
01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Most of the articles I'm finding on pull</v>
<v Speaker 4>it up,</v>

1951
01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:08.320
<v Speaker 4>three d printed rhino horns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1952
01:31:08.321 --> 01:31:09.070
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1953
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:11.640
<v Speaker 4>they have them in their make or there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of companies that aren't going</v>

1954
01:31:11.641 --> 01:31:13.690
<v Speaker 4>to start making them the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are people that are saying</v>

1955
01:31:13.691 --> 01:31:16.630
<v Speaker 4>it's not a good idea to have them</v>
<v Speaker 4>introduce because it's going to cause</v>

1956
01:31:16.631 --> 01:31:20.380
<v Speaker 4>more problems than they're already</v>
<v Speaker 4>having with just the real ones.</v>

1957
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:22.120
<v Speaker 4>They look real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is,</v>

1958
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:24.160
<v Speaker 4>is that a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are those real or fake?</v>

1959
01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:26.290
<v Speaker 4>These are the picture I'm showing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>real ones,</v>

1960
01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:30.490
<v Speaker 4>but a national geographic problems that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to come.</v>

1961
01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:34.080
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucked up that what's killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>these crazy animals.</v>

1962
01:31:34.081 --> 01:31:36.950
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to miss so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a dinosaur.</v>

1963
01:31:36.951 --> 01:31:37.990
<v Speaker 3>It's a dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1964
01:31:37.991 --> 01:31:40.350
<v Speaker 3>it's like a stegosaurus or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might as well be.</v>

1965
01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:44.610
<v Speaker 3>But what's killing them is this</v>
<v Speaker 3>erroneous idea that the horns make your</v>

1966
01:31:44.611 --> 01:31:45.480
<v Speaker 3>dick hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1967
01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:50.580
<v Speaker 3>if that's not symptomatic or symbolic of</v>
<v Speaker 3>how fucking bizarre humans are.</v>

1968
01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:56.130
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile at the same time there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>plenty of fucking pills that actually do</v>

1969
01:31:56.131 --> 01:31:58.500
<v Speaker 3>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're asking these rhino</v>

1970
01:31:58.501 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 3>horns to do something that no pill could</v>

1971
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:05.040
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've solved this problem to see Anna</v>

1972
01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Nicole Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>j Howard Marshall,</v>

1973
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 1>that old guy who married a creepy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like in his eighties and he married</v>

1974
01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:15.520
<v Speaker 1>that big titted sloppy slut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did he do that?</v>

1975
01:32:15.521 --> 01:32:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Because they had Viagra finally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could fucker.</v>

1976
01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:23.080
<v Speaker 1>It's right on a bit of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just fucking kept his cowboy boots on</v>

1977
01:32:23.081 --> 01:32:25.780
<v Speaker 1>and that is a great point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like why?</v>

1978
01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Why the Rhino thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1979
01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:31.480
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not probably not just for their</v>

1980
01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:33.580
<v Speaker 1>hard on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably also because they think</v>

1981
01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:35.080
<v Speaker 1>they can cure cancer with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1982
01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.340
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really more.</v>

1983
01:32:36.341 --> 01:32:38.110
<v Speaker 1>There's j Howard Marshall and Anna</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicole.</v>

1984
01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.060
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think more of anything.</v>

1985
01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:42.340
<v Speaker 1>A status symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come over a man's house,</v>

1986
01:32:42.341 --> 01:32:44.710
<v Speaker 1>you have some rhino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>T both were,</v>

1987
01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:45.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expense.</v>

1988
01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Cheetah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive to leap.</v>

1989
01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Watches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1990

<v Speaker 1>He has a Rolls Royce.</v>

1991
01:32:52.151 --> 01:32:54.010
<v Speaker 1>You talk about real estate.</v>

1992
01:32:54.010 --> 01:32:56.710
<v Speaker 1>You're buying and you do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would pull out a Cuban cigar.</v>

1993
01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where'd you get the Cubans?</v>

1994
01:32:58.811 --> 01:33:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a buddy who lives in Miami and</v>

1995
01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.373
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

1996
01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.750
<v Speaker 1>let's sit out on the back porch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend we're gentlemen.</v>

1997
01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so many people that never</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking smoke cigars and it gets so</v>

1998
01:33:09.431 --> 01:33:13.510
<v Speaker 1>pumped about getting a Cuban Cuban Cuban</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what?</v>

1999
01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Gun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a gun to oil de Monterrey double</v>

2000
01:33:16.121 --> 01:33:18.730
<v Speaker 1>corona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of fat.</v>

2001
01:33:18.731 --> 01:33:22.000
<v Speaker 1>When I looked at afterwards today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a fake with a label on it.</v>

2002
01:33:22.290 --> 01:33:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Going to do a whole lot of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell the difference.</v>

2003
01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I used to box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was buy real ones,</v>

2004
01:33:27.670 --> 01:33:30.940
<v Speaker 1>but I used to buy real ones that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend they're fake from London.</v>

2005
01:33:31.170 --> 01:33:34.390
<v Speaker 1>That's to order them from London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would send them to be from a</v>

2006
01:33:34.391 --> 01:33:37.330
<v Speaker 1>tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they call them in London?</v>

2007
01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would send me the actual labels.</v>

2008
01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Like weeks later they'd send these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to me in boxes and they would</v>

2009
01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:49.680
<v Speaker 1>just be labeled Dominican cigars and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I get it,</v>

2010
01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:52.180
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had specific cigars that I would ask</v>

2011
01:33:52.181 --> 01:33:54.470
<v Speaker 1>for such a stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I started smoking weed at</v>

2012
01:33:54.490 --> 01:33:57.360
<v Speaker 1>dumped that habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you like this nonsense?</v>

2013
01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:58.780
<v Speaker 1>You don't find it enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2015
01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.230

<v Speaker 1>There's something about it that's very</v>

2016
01:34:02.231 --> 01:34:04.860
<v Speaker 1>fetishy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about it that's very</v>

2017
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:08.410
<v Speaker 1>effected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're putting on airs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jack Nicholson is the only one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look like an asshole.</v>

2048

<v Speaker 1>Hands are.</v>

<v Speaker 1>didn't pose.</v>

2051
01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Is there something wrong with his hands</v>

<v Speaker 1>They look weird way out in front of him.</v>

2054
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.010
<v Speaker 1>The perspective looks weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're small,</v>

2055
01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:39.220
<v Speaker 1>so like if you put it up to his chest,</v>

<v Speaker 1>compliance,</v>

2146
01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:37.920
<v Speaker 1>so voluntary compliance maybe where</v>

<v Speaker 1>But it was a,</v>

2212
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.740
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy who wrote tales from the</v>

<v Speaker 1>crypt.</v>

<v Speaker 1>starve nightbreed.</v>

2216
01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Nightbreed might read he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure that's.</v>

2217
01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:39.310
<v Speaker 1>That might be reading goodnight moon and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a Typo.</v>

2218
01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go try nightbreed.</v>

2219
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I hate breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2220
01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:48.051
<v Speaker 1>Night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:42:48.051 --> 01:42:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Who made that movie man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was one of those.</v>

2222
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:54.030
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is the,</v>

2223
01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the director and writer,</v>

2224
01:42:55.461 --> 01:42:57.160
<v Speaker 1>that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a Halloween show because</v>

2225
01:42:57.170 --> 01:43:00.170
<v Speaker 1>he was a famous sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clive barker.</v>

2226
01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Clive Barker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was clive barker.</v>

2227
01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2228
01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Clive Barker made a bunch of like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaky fucking movies,</v>

2229
01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:11.000
<v Speaker 1>like really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird takes on horror and apparently a</v>

2230
01:43:11.001 --> 01:43:12.040
<v Speaker 1>very good writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2231
01:43:12.041 --> 01:43:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Like his books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

2232
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2233
01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:16.790
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so?</v>

2234
01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're making it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2235
01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where it all started out</v>

2236
01:43:21.231 --> 01:43:22.850
<v Speaker 1>as from his writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2237
01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I think he was a famous horror writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2238
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:28.070
<v Speaker 1>And then they did a few of his movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

2239
01:43:28.071 --> 01:43:29.450
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch on.</v>

2240
01:43:29.451 --> 01:43:32.720
<v Speaker 1>But nightbreed was a really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and that Craig Schaeffer guy was in</v>

2241
01:43:32.721 --> 01:43:33.554
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2242
01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:38.000
<v Speaker 1>He was he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was He ever on Cigar Aficionado?</v>

2243
01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:39.710
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never made it.</v>

2244
01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.210
<v Speaker 1>But Brad probably did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably get mad bought,</v>

2245
01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:48.560
<v Speaker 1>bought the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Brad on this shit out here is</v>

2246
01:43:48.561 --> 01:43:53.561
<v Speaker 1>fat guys throwing kicks at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hell man,</v>

2247
01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:00.710
<v Speaker 1>because I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bryan County is a great guy to talk to</v>

2248
01:44:00.711 --> 01:44:04.010
<v Speaker 1>the stop because Brian Cowen knows a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those actors.</v>

2249
01:44:04.011 --> 01:44:05.590
<v Speaker 1>He knows a lot of actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2250
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:10.240
<v Speaker 1>And he's had friends that were like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really famous actors at one point right</v>

2251
01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:13.370
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have been forced to take these gigs</v>

2252
01:44:13.371 --> 01:44:15.140
<v Speaker 1>whenever they can get them right and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2253
01:44:15.141 --> 01:44:18.020
<v Speaker 1>they're away from their family for</v>
<v Speaker 1>months at a time and they don't make</v>

2254
01:44:18.021 --> 01:44:20.690
<v Speaker 1>much money and their hope is that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>does well.</v>

2255
01:44:20.691 --> 01:44:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually it's like you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a holding pattern hoping that you catch</v>

2256
01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:27.950
<v Speaker 1>fire with a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good film and then it gets you into</v>

2257
01:44:27.951 --> 01:44:29.090
<v Speaker 1>another film and then you're back.</v>

2258
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:31.700
<v Speaker 1>But when you drop off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially if there's a</v>

2259
01:44:31.701 --> 01:44:34.250
<v Speaker 1>transitionary period between you being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 year old man,</v>

2260
01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:38.000
<v Speaker 1>be in a 50 year old man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those 50 year old guys are Foxville</v>

2261
01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:41.000
<v Speaker 1>further fucked right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants you until you're 60.</v>

2262
01:44:41.001 --> 01:44:43.610
<v Speaker 1>And then if someone's dad it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like this period of time where</v>

2263
01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:47.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not quite old enough to be a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely not old enough to be</v>

2264
01:44:47.691 --> 01:44:49.860
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Young enough to be the hot guy.</v>

2265
01:44:50.190 --> 01:44:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be really an ass kicker.</v>

2266
01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's going to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2267
01:44:54.261 --> 01:44:57.830
<v Speaker 1>like Steven Seagal has to do all kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of crazy shit to be maintained as</v>

2268
01:44:57.831 --> 01:44:59.510
<v Speaker 1>kicking status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All dying.</v>

2269
01:44:59.511 --> 01:45:01.130
<v Speaker 1>His beard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his beard died.</v>

2270
01:45:01.131 --> 01:45:04.130
<v Speaker 1>The hares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hares have a masterpiece.</v>

2271
01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:06.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's doing the shatner thing.</v>

2272
01:45:06.381 --> 01:45:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just put the weight on and just be</v>

2273
01:45:08.091 --> 01:45:08.630
<v Speaker 1>a bigger guy.</v>

2274
01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good move.</v>

2275
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Schachner says keeps your</v>
<v Speaker 1>face fall.</v>

2276
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:15.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like the opposite of hits his</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of Collagen.</v>

2277
01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Just fill it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty smart.</v>

2278
01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Just fill that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't on purpose.</v>

2279
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:21.590
<v Speaker 1>He really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly,</v>

2280
01:45:21.591 --> 01:45:25.940
<v Speaker 1>he says he might just be an excuse for</v>
<v Speaker 1>why he just drinks every night.</v>

2281
01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't stop drinking.</v>

2282
01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:29.133
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2283
01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:31.730
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked pretty good on cigar fishing.</v>

2284
01:45:31.731 --> 01:45:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Nicholson,</v>

2285
01:45:32.961 --> 01:45:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I think agreed is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they called you tomorrow,</v>

2286
01:45:37.041 --> 01:45:38.030
<v Speaker 1>would you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:50:23.711 --> 01:50:27.190
<v Speaker 3>rolling stone cover because rolling</v>
<v Speaker 3>stone put him on the cover and he looks</v>

2404
01:50:27.191 --> 01:50:29.710
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking teen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heartthrob was douchey.</v>

2405
01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:30.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was weird.</v>

2406
01:50:30.850 --> 01:50:32.530
<v Speaker 3>It was really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't douchey.</v>

2407
01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a photo of them and it is</v>

2408
01:50:35.291 --> 01:50:38.080
<v Speaker 3>curious that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took a tremendous amount of</v>

2409
01:50:38.081 --> 01:50:39.100
<v Speaker 3>criticism for this cover.</v>

2410
01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2411
01:50:40.331 --> 01:50:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

2412
01:50:42.190 --> 01:50:45.990
<v Speaker 3>this is just what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2413
01:50:46.050 --> 01:50:47.200
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at this.</v>

2414
01:50:47.201 --> 01:50:51.160
<v Speaker 3>This is just a young man man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has.</v>

2415
01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:56.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean he has a cover of a magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your job to put things on rolling</v>

2416
01:50:57.341 --> 01:51:00.640
<v Speaker 3>stone and you know how to look at things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that make people feel a certain way,</v>

2417
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:02.770
<v Speaker 3>so maybe they were trying to make them</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like,</v>

2418
01:51:02.771 --> 01:51:05.080
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a monster.</v>

2419
01:51:05.081 --> 01:51:06.310
<v Speaker 3>Can look like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2420
01:51:06.311 --> 01:51:09.880
<v Speaker 3>but recent listened to the heading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Highly popular,</v>

2421
01:51:09.881 --> 01:51:13.060
<v Speaker 3>promising student was fueled by his</v>
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

2422
01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 3>but what was failed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2423
01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:18.430
<v Speaker 3>it was failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was failed by his family,</v>

2424
01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:22.030
<v Speaker 3>fell into radical Islam and became a</v>
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

2425
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're making that seed now with the</v>

2426
01:51:24.581 --> 01:51:27.760
<v Speaker 3>headline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dislike it even more because now</v>

2427
01:51:27.761 --> 01:51:29.680
<v Speaker 3>you're making him seem like he's just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable.</v>

2428
01:51:29.681 --> 01:51:30.820
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not his fault.</v>

2429
01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:31.840
<v Speaker 3>You're excusing him.</v>

2430
01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:34.420
<v Speaker 3>I think with that photo and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>headline combined,</v>

2431
01:51:34.690 --> 01:51:37.600
<v Speaker 3>it feels to me like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're letting them off the hook.</v>

2432
01:51:37.810 --> 01:51:39.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a weird question.</v>

2433
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:43.830
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that you do that where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>read a couple letters of a word and just</v>

2434
01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.940
<v Speaker 3>fill it in for yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do that all the time.</v>

2435
01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where I find myself,</v>

2436
01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:51.220
<v Speaker 3>even if I'm wearing reading glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fill in a word and then I go,</v>

2437
01:51:51.221 --> 01:51:52.054
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that word?</v>

2438
01:51:52.450 --> 01:51:56.560
<v Speaker 3>For whatever reason I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just saw the whole world I saw</v>

2439
01:51:56.590 --> 01:51:57.350
<v Speaker 3>fueled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2440
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:58.780
<v Speaker 3>because I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2441
01:51:58.781 --> 01:52:01.960
<v Speaker 3>They would say is fueled by hate or</v>
<v Speaker 3>fueled by his radical religion.</v>

2442
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:03.580
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have been so douchey and</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrected you,</v>

2443
01:52:03.581 --> 01:52:05.340
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't change the meaning of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2444
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:08.840
<v Speaker 3>But how old is this kid at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think if you're looking at it</v>

2445
01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:11.950
<v Speaker 3>like an 18 year old kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's relevant being you have a</v>

2446
01:52:11.951 --> 01:52:12.700
<v Speaker 3>14 year old.</v>

2447
01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if your kid grew up in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking radical,</v>

2448
01:52:16.570 --> 01:52:21.130
<v Speaker 3>crazy fuck had religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could look there.</v>

2449
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.600
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a good question though,</v>

2450
01:52:22.601 --> 01:52:24.910
<v Speaker 3>like how did this kid become this</v>
<v Speaker 3>monster?</v>

2451
01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.490
<v Speaker 3>How did he become this monster?</v>
<v Speaker 3>His when his brother,</v>

2452
01:52:27.491 --> 01:52:29.440
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His brother was a big influence.</v>

2453
01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:31.900
<v Speaker 3>His brother definitely was an influence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean he's,</v>

2454
01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:32.711
<v Speaker 3>he's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2455
01:52:32.711 --> 01:52:35.530
<v Speaker 3>So he's in this magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on the cover and they have this</v>

2456
01:52:35.531 --> 01:52:37.450
<v Speaker 3>picture of him that makes you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2457
01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:38.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2458
01:52:38.410 --> 01:52:40.210
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is wrong with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>picture?</v>

2459
01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Is What's wrong with it is that he looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a cute young guy that shouldn't</v>

2460
01:52:44.741 --> 01:52:48.080
<v Speaker 3>have that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not saying young heartthrob</v>

2461
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:52.280
<v Speaker 3>contact him behind bars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just showing an actual picture</v>

2462
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:55.790
<v Speaker 3>of what he actually looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that any different than the Ted</v>

2463
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Bundy photos?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the Ted Bundy photos.</v>

2464
01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:01.820
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that was most striking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Ted Bundy was that he's a very</v>

2465
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:04.150
<v Speaker 3>handsome guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's kind of fucking crazy</v>

2466
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:06.100
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't put them on the cover of</v>

2467
01:53:06.101 --> 01:53:08.800
<v Speaker 4>rolling stone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a space for the people in our</v>

2468
01:53:08.801 --> 01:53:12.250
<v Speaker 4>culture that you worship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2469
01:53:12.251 --> 01:53:15.850
<v Speaker 4>They didn't put Ted Bundy on the cover</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the rolling stone logo around you.</v>

2470
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:18.040
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

2471
01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:18.993
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point.</v>

2472
01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:21.980
<v Speaker 3>A good point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but should they bear the burden of that?</v>

2473
01:53:22.010 --> 01:53:24.860
<v Speaker 3>Should they be able to be flexible</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough with their covers,</v>

2474
01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:27.590
<v Speaker 3>their ideas to just say what happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>

2475
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:31.570
<v Speaker 3>We take this guy who could be on our</v>
<v Speaker 3>cover because he's a pop star.</v>

2476
01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.760
<v Speaker 3>He could be on the cover because he's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>star.</v>

2477
01:53:33.761 --> 01:53:35.360
<v Speaker 3>If some new Sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Hilarious,</v>

2478
01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks right.</v>

2479
01:53:36.930 --> 01:53:40.320
<v Speaker 4>He looks like a star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks like a star and that's what I'm</v>

2480
01:53:40.321 --> 01:53:41.490
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like these people know,</v>

2481
01:53:41.550 --> 01:53:43.980
<v Speaker 4>they know what they're doing when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're putting that cover on.</v>

2482
01:53:43.981 --> 01:53:46.470
<v Speaker 4>It's you are provoking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2483
01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:51.270
<v Speaker 4>this is a regular kid that going this</v>
<v Speaker 4>way could have been on the cover of</v>

2484
01:53:51.271 --> 01:53:52.540
<v Speaker 4>rolling stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's.</v>

2485
01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.750
<v Speaker 4>They're definitely creating it to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought provoking.</v>

2486
01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:59.460
<v Speaker 4>Bang them in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put that picture on the bag.</v>

2487
01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.980
<v Speaker 4>They've got to want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2488
01:54:03.070 --> 01:54:05.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking making it here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Banging this guy.</v>

2489
01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:08.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's beautiful.</v>

2490
01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is kind of fucked up,</v>

2491
01:54:10.771 --> 01:54:15.030
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like they're saying there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something wrong with that photograph.</v>

2492
01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:19.050
<v Speaker 3>Particularly like they could have had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of him being handcuffed in look</v>

2493
01:54:19.410 --> 01:54:20.610
<v Speaker 3>terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look on his face,</v>

2494
01:54:20.611 --> 01:54:23.760
<v Speaker 3>shock covered blood or anything along</v>
<v Speaker 3>those lines and everybody would</v>

2495
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:25.670
<v Speaker 4>been okay with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2496
01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:26.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't they be?</v>

2497
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:28.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2498
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:32.540
<v Speaker 4>It's because of it because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>psaltery innocent.</v>

2499
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:33.403
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2500
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:38.580
<v Speaker 3>That isn't that a problem with static</v>
<v Speaker 3>images in the first place,</v>

2501
01:54:38.581 --> 01:54:41.400
<v Speaker 3>like static images as such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poor representations of what a person</v>

2502
01:54:41.401 --> 01:54:44.430
<v Speaker 3>actually looks like and who would that</v>
<v Speaker 3>person actually is.</v>

2503
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:46.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the weirder things about</v>

2504
01:54:46.651 --> 01:54:49.830
<v Speaker 3>photos and then you see like a bio below</v>
<v Speaker 3>the photo and you're standing there,</v>

2505
01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:50.491
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>

2506
01:54:50.491 --> 01:54:54.270
<v Speaker 3>Papa has been doing standup clubs in</v>
<v Speaker 3>colleges all throughout the country.</v>

2507
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Like what is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a a portrayal of two dimensional</v>

2508
01:54:58.621 --> 01:55:00.420
<v Speaker 3>pull portrayal of a person.</v>

2509
01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:05.720
<v Speaker 4>There is a picture of me out from when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>hosted this game show on Fox just for a</v>

2510
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:09.110
<v Speaker 4>summer and there's this shot of me in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>suit.</v>

2511
01:55:09.111 --> 01:55:12.110
<v Speaker 4>I look so douchey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm leering at the camera.</v>

2512
01:55:12.111 --> 01:55:15.920
<v Speaker 4>I looked like a magician</v>
<v Speaker 4>for some reason.</v>

2513
01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:19.880
<v Speaker 4>That picture is every.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any time I go to a city and you go to go</v>

2514
01:55:19.881 --> 01:55:22.040
<v Speaker 4>to perform.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anytime someone puts an ad out for a</v>

2515
01:55:22.041 --> 01:55:22.960
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the.</v>

2516
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:26.660
<v Speaker 4>That's the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would not buy a ticket to see that</v>

2517
01:55:26.661 --> 01:55:29.630
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't scrub it from the Internet,</v>

2518
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:33.640
<v Speaker 3>but what'd you buy a ticket?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't buy a ticket to see any comic</v>

2519
01:55:33.641 --> 01:55:36.310
<v Speaker 3>ever based on any fucking shot have ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>

2520
01:55:36.370 --> 01:55:38.680
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes me feel a little better.</v>

2521
01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:39.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks,</v>

2522
01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks's headshot was him lighting a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarette with American flag.</v>

2523
01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:48.570
<v Speaker 3>You will rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fucking clown.</v>

2524
01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you?</v>

2525
01:55:50.490 --> 01:55:52.380
<v Speaker 3>You're on the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

2526
01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:53.521
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2527
01:55:53.521 --> 01:55:54.630
<v Speaker 3>there's no way to look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

2528
01:55:54.631 --> 01:55:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

2529
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:57.000
<v Speaker 3>that was bill's head shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2530
01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:59.520
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his defense in 1988,</v>

2531
01:55:59.670 --> 01:56:01.930
<v Speaker 3>that was a radical thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>

2532
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:06.760
<v Speaker 3>And that was back when there was like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big problem with people burning the flag</v>

2533
01:56:06.770 --> 01:56:09.660
<v Speaker 3>he had during the Bush Bush one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush one.</v>

2534
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

2535
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:14.400
<v Speaker 3>They were like trying to take measures</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop people from burning the flag.</v>

2536
01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:17.760
<v Speaker 3>We're burning the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks had a bit about it.</v>

2537
01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:19.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know my daddy fought for this flag and</v>

2538
01:56:19.951 --> 01:56:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

2539
01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:24.960
<v Speaker 3>What a coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My fly was made in Korea rape joke.</v>

2540
01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:27.780
<v Speaker 3>You hear about the controversy about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>football player this week and not</v>

2541
01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:30.810
<v Speaker 3>wanting to stand during the national</v>
<v Speaker 3>anthem for Nick.</v>

2542
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:33.090
<v Speaker 3>What did he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was he protesting?</v>

2543
01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:38.090
<v Speaker 3>The country hidden and hit whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If flat earth.</v>

2544
01:56:38.610 --> 01:56:41.820
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want to stand in for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>country that allows a violence against</v>

2545
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:44.010
<v Speaker 3>people of color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

2546
01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:46.290
<v Speaker 3>So black or white guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2547
01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:48.480
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly who's a white guy.</v>

2548
01:56:48.481 --> 01:56:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Fucking hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kinda looks pretty white to me.</v>

2549
01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:54.150
<v Speaker 3>You show that to black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2550
01:56:54.151 --> 01:56:56.610
<v Speaker 3>That's very healing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a little</v>

2551
01:56:58.530 --> 01:56:59.520
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's where?</v>

2552
01:56:59.521 --> 01:57:02.340
<v Speaker 3>He's the biggest trouble maker around</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pyramids.</v>

2553
01:57:02.710 --> 01:57:04.870
<v Speaker 3>And</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2554
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:07.530
<v Speaker 3>so he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is he saying he wants to end?</v>

2555
01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Did he have a statement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always.</v>

2556
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:14.010
<v Speaker 3>They always have a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have some fucking respect for</v>

2557
01:57:14.011 --> 01:57:16.890
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially people who says that it's on</v>

2558
01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:17.900
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boone,</v>

2559
01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:21.020
<v Speaker 3>someone's really upset drives me knowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2560
01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:24.450
<v Speaker 3>My view is that the anthem is about</v>
<v Speaker 3>honoring the people serve.</v>

2561
01:57:24.451 --> 01:57:27.270
<v Speaker 3>This is another person to find out what</v>
<v Speaker 3>his actual quote.</v>

2562
01:57:27.570 --> 01:57:28.830
<v Speaker 3>What was his quote?</v>

2563
01:57:32.090 --> 01:57:34.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to play games out here to</v>
<v Speaker 3>salute symbols.</v>

2564
01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:37.800
<v Speaker 3>You fuck heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a requirement by,</v>

2565
01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:42.480
<v Speaker 3>for NFL players to stand during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>singing of the national anthem.</v>

2566
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:44.410
<v Speaker 3>It's suggested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2567
01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:45.900
<v Speaker 3>They do not a requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2568
01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:49.320
<v Speaker 3>That's probably constitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably constitutionally can't require</v>

2569
01:57:49.321 --> 01:57:52.680
<v Speaker 3>someone to be patriotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is kind of ironic,</v>

2570
01:57:52.681 --> 01:57:55.080
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The freedoms that you get.</v>

2571
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.270
<v Speaker 3>But a company could probably in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

2572
01:57:57.870 --> 01:58:00.060
<v Speaker 3>could they require that other of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>employees.</v>

2573
01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.340
<v Speaker 3>You could put the American flag on her</v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes maybe.</v>

2574
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:06.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's the big team putting on the</v>

2575
01:58:06.211 --> 01:58:07.830
<v Speaker 3>uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Team goes to war.</v>

2576
01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:11.730
<v Speaker 3>We all get together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people go state the first</v>

2577
01:58:11.770 --> 01:58:13.890
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal local or like Husky highschool</v>

2578
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:15.460
<v Speaker 3>team versus highschool team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2579
01:58:15.570 --> 01:58:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Then they go statewide where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>state college versus other colleges.</v>

2580
01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Then they go nfl and once it go nfl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>

2581
01:58:23.821 --> 01:58:25.210
<v Speaker 3>it's like state franchises.</v>

2582
01:58:25.230 --> 01:58:27.840
<v Speaker 3>That's the big league,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real big league was an all teams</v>

2583
01:58:27.841 --> 01:58:31.340
<v Speaker 3>get together and they'd go to armies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>armies.</v>

2584
01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:33.810
<v Speaker 3>The biggest big team and then we go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck up other teams.</v>

2585
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:38.830
<v Speaker 3>So it's very important that we keep an</v>
<v Speaker 3>active organized sports program so that</v>

2586
01:58:38.851 --> 01:58:43.570
<v Speaker 3>we are investing in this idea of teams</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that we can fuel the big team.</v>

2587
01:58:43.690 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other part of it is if you</v>

2588
01:58:46.361 --> 01:58:49.390
<v Speaker 3>didn't have the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pittsburgh would be marching on</v>

2589
01:58:49.391 --> 01:58:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Cleveland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2590
01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would be right.</v>

2591
01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:56.710
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't have sport,</v>

2592
01:58:56.711 --> 01:58:58.540
<v Speaker 3>people would wear like taking that</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression.</v>

2593
01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:01.090
<v Speaker 3>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd March across and go after</v>

2594
01:59:01.091 --> 01:59:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2595
01:59:01.931 --> 01:59:02.764
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2596
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:05.770
<v Speaker 3>that's how we keep ourselves from going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to war inside the country,</v>

2597
01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:08.050
<v Speaker 3>inside the boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't keep us from doing it</v>

2598
01:59:08.051 --> 01:59:09.510
<v Speaker 3>outside the boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2599
01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:13.660
<v Speaker 3>There was a whole radio lab thing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the invention of football and what it</v>

2600
01:59:13.661 --> 01:59:14.690
<v Speaker 3>really was was the.</v>

2601
01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:17.950
<v Speaker 3>They had a bunch of men that came back</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the war and they were looking for</v>

2602
01:59:17.951 --> 01:59:19.990
<v Speaker 3>something to do to alleviate some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>

2603
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:23.140
<v Speaker 3>the creative football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the motivations for them creating</v>

2604
01:59:23.141 --> 01:59:24.760
<v Speaker 3>football in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>

2605
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Totally makes sense and you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need that.</v>

2606
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:28.610
<v Speaker 3>You need an outlet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2607
01:59:28.730 --> 01:59:32.080
<v Speaker 3>like guys just run around like maniacs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighteen minutes long,</v>

2608
01:59:32.081 --> 01:59:35.990
<v Speaker 3>but here's something I'll let you read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His men was 18 minutes.</v>

2609
01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:38.950
<v Speaker 3>It's him talking in the locker room</v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards because all the reporters</v>

2610
01:59:38.951 --> 01:59:41.020
<v Speaker 3>were asking him questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want him to explain himself.</v>

2611
01:59:41.050 --> 01:59:43.060
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am going to continue to stand with the</v>

2612
01:59:43.061 --> 01:59:45.040
<v Speaker 3>people that are being oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capper,</v>

2613
01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:46.300
<v Speaker 3>nick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's his name.</v>

2614
01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something that has to change</v>

2615
01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:52.360
<v Speaker 3>when there's significant change and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like that flag represents what it's</v>

2616
01:59:52.361 --> 01:59:54.490
<v Speaker 3>supposed to represent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This country is representing people the</v>

2617
01:59:54.491 --> 01:59:57.010
<v Speaker 3>way it's supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll stand her.</v>

2618
02:00:00.250 --> 02:00:01.540
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I did,</v>

2619
02:00:01.541 --> 02:00:04.120
<v Speaker 3>was write A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said he hasn't heard from the NFL.</v>

2620
02:00:04.121 --> 02:00:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Anybody else about his actions won't</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter if he does.</v>

2621
02:00:06.461 --> 02:00:07.960
<v Speaker 3>No one's tried to quiet me and to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>

2622
02:00:07.961 --> 02:00:09.520
<v Speaker 3>it's not something I'm going to be quiet</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2623
02:00:09.521 --> 02:00:11.560
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to speak the truth when I'm</v>

2624
02:00:11.561 --> 02:00:13.750
<v Speaker 3>asked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't for look,</v>

2625
02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:15.880
<v Speaker 3>this isn't for publicity or anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2626
02:00:15.881 --> 02:00:19.240
<v Speaker 3>This is for people don't have the voice</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where people that are being</v>

2627
02:00:19.241 --> 02:00:21.310
<v Speaker 3>oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that need to have equal opportunities to</v>

2628
02:00:21.311 --> 02:00:23.740
<v Speaker 3>be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to provide for their families and not</v>

2629
02:00:23.741 --> 02:00:25.090
<v Speaker 3>live in poor circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2630
02:00:25.091 --> 02:00:28.090
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's added a bunch of shit there too.</v>

2631
02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:28.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got.</v>

2632
02:00:28.961 --> 02:00:30.760
<v Speaker 3>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get your message out in just a</v>

2633
02:00:30.761 --> 02:00:31.960
<v Speaker 3>phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2634
02:00:31.961 --> 02:00:33.180
<v Speaker 3>Well we'll also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

2635
02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.220
<v Speaker 3>This is where it gets people being</v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressed that don't have the equal</v>

2636
02:00:36.221 --> 02:00:40.990
<v Speaker 3>opportunities to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to provide for families and not live in</v>

2637
02:00:40.991 --> 02:00:42.280
<v Speaker 3>poor circumstances.</v>

2638
02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:45.790
<v Speaker 3>That's one sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The word to provide for families and not</v>

2639
02:00:45.791 --> 02:00:47.860
<v Speaker 3>live in poor circumstances is one</v>
<v Speaker 3>sentence.</v>

2640
02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's idealistically.</v>

2641
02:00:49.631 --> 02:00:52.360
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but America is supposed to represent</v>

2642
02:00:52.410 --> 02:00:56.620
<v Speaker 3>like the entire group experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This experiment in self government</v>

2643
02:00:56.621 --> 02:00:59.050
<v Speaker 3>that's still ongoing and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not perfect.</v>

2644
02:00:59.051 --> 02:01:01.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not done and it's definitely got</v>
<v Speaker 3>some dark aspects to it,</v>

2645
02:01:01.481 --> 02:01:03.190
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't think it's the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing going,</v>

2646
02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:07.060
<v Speaker 3>he should go look around this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some dark parts of America.</v>

2647
02:01:07.061 --> 02:01:10.060
<v Speaker 3>There's some dark parts about how what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about today.</v>

2648
02:01:10.061 --> 02:01:13.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean how we were founded and how this</v>
<v Speaker 3>land was acquired in the first place.</v>

2649
02:01:13.781 --> 02:01:17.610
<v Speaker 3>It's acquired by fucking murder mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever think that that's when we</v>

2650
02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:19.320
<v Speaker 3>have problems that maybe it's Karma?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2651
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:21.010
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think it's us.</v>

2652
02:01:21.011 --> 02:01:24.550
<v Speaker 3>It's not Uri,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is something incredibly fucked</v>

2653
02:01:24.551 --> 02:01:29.551
<v Speaker 3>up about a country that is so willing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at some aspects of our society that</v>

2654
02:01:32.201 --> 02:01:36.580
<v Speaker 3>are discriminating or discriminatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the article that I pointed out</v>

2655
02:01:36.581 --> 02:01:40.460
<v Speaker 3>today where this woman was writing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how women are drinking</v>

2656
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:42.980
<v Speaker 1>because of the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of sexism is forcing them to</v>

2657
02:01:42.981 --> 02:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>drink and the suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The American Indians were slaughtered,</v>

2658
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>the native Americans were fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughtered and they never come up</v>

2659
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:55.880
<v Speaker 1>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost never comes up when you talk</v>

2660
02:01:55.881 --> 02:02:00.881
<v Speaker 1>about equal opportunity in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very few conversations begin with</v>

2661
02:02:01.730 --> 02:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>we've got to do something about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty and extreme alcoholism on these</v>

2662
02:02:06.651 --> 02:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>native American reservations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why it doesn't come up because</v>

2663
02:02:09.411 --> 02:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>we wiped out so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just not that many left.</v>

2664
02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's enough left that they have a</v>

2665
02:02:14.151 --> 02:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>voice and they talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not something that people are</v>

2666
02:02:16.881 --> 02:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>concerned with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean slavery.</v>

2667
02:02:18.710 --> 02:02:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking awful and is something</v>

2668
02:02:21.411 --> 02:02:24.950
<v Speaker 1>that we absolutely should pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to and we should absolutely look at the</v>

2669
02:02:24.951 --> 02:02:29.951
<v Speaker 1>impact of slavery over a long period</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where these people lived as slaves</v>

2670
02:02:30.230 --> 02:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>for hundreds of years and then they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally freed into this area where</v>

2671
02:02:33.681 --> 02:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>there's massive amounts of racism.</v>

2672
02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Not just racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2673
02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2674
02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.130
<v Speaker 1>I like to stick to my own car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but racism,</v>

2675
02:02:40.131 --> 02:02:43.550
<v Speaker 1>like where people are denigrated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their thought to be like a lesser human</v>

2676
02:02:43.551 --> 02:02:44.450
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Systemic.</v>

2677
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>It's systemic and it's deep and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's going to take hundreds of</v>

2678
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like many generations to get past that.</v>

2679
02:02:51.441 --> 02:02:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we still definitely haven't gotten</v>

2680
02:02:53.031 --> 02:02:55.280
<v Speaker 1>past that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those places and we concentrate</v>

2681
02:02:55.281 --> 02:02:59.300
<v Speaker 1>on that and it's a big part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our national discussion conversation and</v>

2682
02:02:59.301 --> 02:03:01.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it ain't shit compared to what the</v>

2683
02:03:01.551 --> 02:03:03.800
<v Speaker 1>native Americans went through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughtered,</v>

2684
02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:05.960
<v Speaker 1>slaughtered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their land just taken.</v>

2685
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Just taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2686
02:03:07.671 --> 02:03:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read this article that I read</v>

2687
02:03:09.921 --> 02:03:11.840
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure first of all,</v>

2688
02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:14.600
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not taking anything away from the</v>

2689
02:03:14.601 --> 02:03:18.320
<v Speaker 1>people that suffered from slavery or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide that was committed on black</v>

2690
02:03:18.321 --> 02:03:19.154
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2691
02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Exactly to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people gone.</v>

2692
02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:26.990
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I want less attention</v>

2693
02:03:26.991 --> 02:03:29.450
<v Speaker 1>being paid on what happened to African</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

2694
02:03:29.451 --> 02:03:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough,</v>

2695
02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:34.640
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but w we should have way more than we</v>

2696
02:03:34.641 --> 02:03:36.710
<v Speaker 1>have right now on native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2697
02:03:36.930 --> 02:03:37.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2698
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:38.751
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2699
02:03:38.751 --> 02:03:40.100
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2700
02:03:40.101 --> 02:03:41.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a real violation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2701
02:03:41.650 --> 02:03:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it felt really dirty when I saw it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my,</v>

2702
02:03:45.201 --> 02:03:48.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my motorcycle and went through the</v>

2703
02:03:48.561 --> 02:03:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Dakotas and saw the mount rushmore and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're going,</v>

2704
02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:55.910
<v Speaker 1>when you're driving through these areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're stopping and you're reading</v>

2705
02:03:55.911 --> 02:03:59.300
<v Speaker 1>about the native Americans that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and what they were doing and how</v>

2706
02:03:59.301 --> 02:04:03.290
<v Speaker 1>many there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to know that that all that land</v>

2707
02:04:03.291 --> 02:04:06.770
<v Speaker 1>was taken and all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the civilization was killed and then we</v>

2708
02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:11.120
<v Speaker 1>carved in the side of the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These heads.</v>

2709
02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:14.090
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like dudes,</v>

2710
02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:16.100
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't find a single black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

2711
02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am pretty patriotic to the,</v>

2712
02:04:19.370 --> 02:04:21.410
<v Speaker 1>to a fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a naive level,</v>

2713
02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:24.890
<v Speaker 1>but seeing that Mount Rushmore of just</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt me too bad.</v>

2714
02:04:25.190 --> 02:04:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Look at my phone cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that patriotic.</v>

2715
02:04:27.141 --> 02:04:29.910
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But seeing Mount Rushmore was just</v>

2716
02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:31.040
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a guy,</v>

2717
02:04:31.041 --> 02:04:35.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a native American carving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carving a crazy horse in the side of the</v>

2718
02:04:35.481 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 1>mountain to counter it inside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>richest</v>

2719
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.390
<v Speaker 3>native American tribe in the U.</v>
<v Speaker 3>S work Asino CNL profits pay $1,000,000</v>

2720
02:04:42.391 --> 02:04:44.490
<v Speaker 3>a year to every member.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2721
02:04:44.491 --> 02:04:47.670
<v Speaker 3>How many members says between the mystic</v>
<v Speaker 3>lake and the six casinos,</v>

2722
02:04:47.671 --> 02:04:50.790
<v Speaker 3>travel revenues are thought to be nearly</v>
<v Speaker 3>one point 4 billion,</v>

2723
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:54.450
<v Speaker 3>so that would mean that there's at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thousand.</v>

2724
02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:59.280
<v Speaker 3>There's 460 people in the tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got about $84,000 a month each</v>

2725
02:04:59.281 --> 02:05:02.040
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's only 460 of them,</v>

2726
02:05:02.590 --> 02:05:05.220
<v Speaker 3>one in this particular one right outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Minnesota,</v>

2727
02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:08.100
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the reparations.</v>

2728
02:05:08.101 --> 02:05:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ghosts of their ancestors were in</v>

2729
02:05:10.351 --> 02:05:11.850
<v Speaker 3>the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time they go outside to take a</v>

2730
02:05:11.851 --> 02:05:15.270
<v Speaker 3>leak at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just hear screams and see people with</v>

2731
02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.260
<v Speaker 3>by them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no heads.</v>

2732
02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:19.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2733
02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:22.590
<v Speaker 3>it's disproportionate for the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that lived there for sure.</v>

2734
02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Has there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has there been any culture in the world</v>

2735
02:05:26.490 --> 02:05:31.410
<v Speaker 3>that didn't go in at some level and wipe</v>
<v Speaker 3>out the other people to take the land?</v>

2736
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:34.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's pretty.</v>

2737
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:36.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2738
02:05:36.001 --> 02:05:37.010
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2739
02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:40.620
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what people do and it's also super</v>

2740
02:05:40.621 --> 02:05:42.630
<v Speaker 3>convenient when you don't know what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck they're saying.</v>

2741
02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:44.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you pretend that they're not even</v>

2742
02:05:44.701 --> 02:05:46.130
<v Speaker 3>one of us there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this tournament,</v>

2743
02:05:46.230 --> 02:05:47.300
<v Speaker 3>gobbly Gook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna.</v>

2744
02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:49.670
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna fucking kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sitting on their house,</v>

2745
02:05:49.690 --> 02:05:52.350
<v Speaker 3>made a gold jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2746
02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:53.970
<v Speaker 3>it happens everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2747
02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2748
02:05:56.970 --> 02:06:01.740
<v Speaker 3>over the last several hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the last 200 years since</v>

2749
02:06:01.741 --> 02:06:03.720
<v Speaker 3>slavery has been abolished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less than 200 years,</v>

2750
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:05.400
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2751
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:06.480
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>65.</v>

2752
02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:08.210
<v Speaker 3>You think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so recent.</v>

2753
02:06:08.250 --> 02:06:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these last few hundred years of the</v>

2754
02:06:11.251 --> 02:06:15.150
<v Speaker 3>printed word being distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading,</v>

2755
02:06:15.151 --> 02:06:19.680
<v Speaker 3>becoming more and more common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really a very important point.</v>

2756
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:24.390
<v Speaker 3>He had up until the 100 or so years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not that common to be able to</v>

2757
02:06:24.391 --> 02:06:25.770
<v Speaker 3>read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2758
02:06:25.771 --> 02:06:28.470
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are</v>

2759
02:06:28.530 --> 02:06:30.990
<v Speaker 3>illiterate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they know information to 100 years</v>

2760
02:06:30.991 --> 02:06:32.970
<v Speaker 3>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super common to be illiterate.</v>

2761
02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:35.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember David used.</v>

2762
02:06:35.151 --> 02:06:36.600
<v Speaker 3>I'll always have that in those cowboy</v>
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>

2763
02:06:36.601 --> 02:06:38.310
<v Speaker 3>We used to have to write your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mark.</v>

2764
02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Make your mark on this contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2765
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:41.900
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2766
02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Sir.</v>

2767
02:06:43.650 --> 02:06:46.560
<v Speaker 3>We'll make your mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would make a mark member that</v>

2768
02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:50.090
<v Speaker 3>little X.</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody taught me how to write my name.</v>

2769
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:57.370
<v Speaker 3>So what we have in comparison is now you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a phone in your pocket and you</v>

2770
02:06:57.571 --> 02:06:59.700
<v Speaker 3>could talk to him and he'll answer</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions for you.</v>

2771
02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:02.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Seattle this past weekend and I</v>

2772
02:07:02.911 --> 02:07:04.800
<v Speaker 3>just pressed the button on my phone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2773
02:07:04.801 --> 02:07:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 3>navigate to the SEATAC airport,</v>

2774
02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:09.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes,</v>

2775
02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:12.300
<v Speaker 3>here's the directions to the Seatac</v>
<v Speaker 3>airport and just starts going.</v>

2776
02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:14.000
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within seconds,</v>

2777
02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:18.300
<v Speaker 3>I know the amount of access to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>information that,</v>

2778
02:07:18.301 --> 02:07:20.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you need to sort of form your view</v>

2779
02:07:20.461 --> 02:07:23.190
<v Speaker 3>of the world accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so much different now than</v>

2780
02:07:23.191 --> 02:07:25.770
<v Speaker 3>it's ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I think we're looking at like</v>

2781
02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:29.400
<v Speaker 3>what happened to the native Americans</v>
<v Speaker 3>are looking at what happened to the</v>

2782
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:33.030
<v Speaker 3>slaves are looking what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this whole Columbus Day thing.</v>

2783
02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:36.580
<v Speaker 3>They're just now starting to decide that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to call it Columbus</v>

2784
02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Day anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to call it native American</v>

2785
02:07:38.081 --> 02:07:39.670
<v Speaker 3>appreciation day or something like that.</v>

2786
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:44.170
<v Speaker 3>G about time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have to say as an Italian that</v>

2787
02:07:44.171 --> 02:07:46.450
<v Speaker 3>grew up in New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to see that one go.</v>

2788
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:47.770
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust him.</v>

2789
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:49.630
<v Speaker 3>He's he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a real Italian.</v>

2790
02:07:49.631 --> 02:07:52.120
<v Speaker 3>He's like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have a vowel.</v>

2791
02:07:52.121 --> 02:07:53.740
<v Speaker 3>Is the last name Papa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it.</v>

2792
02:07:53.770 --> 02:07:56.920
<v Speaker 3>How come it's Columbus?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's with the ass bitch?</v>

2793
02:07:57.620 --> 02:07:59.770

<v Speaker 3>They've watched enough youtube videos.</v>

2803
02:08:23.291 --> 02:08:26.500
<v Speaker 3>They gathered the information like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good institute of learning and they go,</v>

2804
02:08:26.530 --> 02:08:28.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data's in and you guys are retarded.</v>

2805
02:08:28.481 --> 02:08:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys are closing down free thought</v>

2806
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:35.770
<v Speaker 3>and discussion in the sense where it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to foster.</v>

2807
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:36.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>

2808
02:08:36.571 --> 02:08:40.600
<v Speaker 3>You're not just stopping racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will be a wonderful thing to do</v>

2809
02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:43.270
<v Speaker 3>while you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is you're controlling</v>

2810
02:08:43.271 --> 02:08:47.260
<v Speaker 3>the way people address ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they behave and think and you're</v>

2811
02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:50.530
<v Speaker 3>creating words that are dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2812
02:08:50.531 --> 02:08:52.870
<v Speaker 3>that were normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like words that used to be able to use</v>

2813
02:08:52.871 --> 02:08:55.390
<v Speaker 3>with no problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're demanding things like,</v>

2814
02:08:55.391 --> 02:08:57.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't call someone a spokesman,</v>

2815
02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:00.190
<v Speaker 3>call them spokeswomen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no more fresh man as first year</v>

2816
02:09:00.191 --> 02:09:02.620
<v Speaker 3>students.</v>

2817
02:09:02.621 --> 02:09:04.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what university put it out,</v>

2818
02:09:04.811 --> 02:09:08.450
<v Speaker 3>but Dave Rubin put it up the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this law,</v>

2819
02:09:08.590 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 3>some university that made this new list</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all the things that would not be</v>

2820
02:09:13.331 --> 02:09:14.910
<v Speaker 3>tolerated anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2821
02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:16.570
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the nomenclature.</v>

2822
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:19.740
<v Speaker 3>All man's speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called speak.</v>

2823
02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:21.160

<v Speaker 3>Mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come it's okay?</v>

2825

<v Speaker 3>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come you can't be?</v>

2826
02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:28.270
<v Speaker 3>How come a human could be a man or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

2827
02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:32.380
<v Speaker 3>but mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we assumed that means male or it's a</v>

2828
02:09:32.381 --> 02:09:37.120
<v Speaker 3>masculine side of what a woman is in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to mankind.</v>

2832
02:09:43.571 --> 02:09:45.400
<v Speaker 3>these creatures that came out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tanzania.</v>

2833
02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Why are we so Goddamn fucking sensitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wonder if I would think that way</v>

2834
02:09:48.511 --> 02:09:49.990
<v Speaker 3>if I was a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was a woman,</v>

2835
02:09:49.991 --> 02:09:52.140
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm fucking tired of being a</v>

2857
02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:05.180
<v Speaker 3>They banned two of his articles and</v>
<v Speaker 3>suspended as account.</v>

2858
02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he wrote articles questioning</v>

2859
02:11:07.371 --> 02:11:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton's health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also.</v>

2860
02:11:09.621 --> 02:11:10.610
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2861
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Which is also the same reason what Dr</v>
<v Speaker 3>drew show got canceled.</v>

2862
02:11:13.881 --> 02:11:18.530
<v Speaker 3>That's what they say because Dr Drew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was questioning Hillary Clinton's</v>

2863
02:11:18.531 --> 02:11:18.740
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>

2864
02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Now what I've heard about Dr drew from</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual doctors in regards to what he</v>

2865
02:11:24.411 --> 02:11:27.260
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like they didn't agree with some of</v>

2866
02:11:27.261 --> 02:11:28.820
<v Speaker 3>the things you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that he said about</v>

2867
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:29.990
<v Speaker 3>armor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thyroid,</v>

2868
02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.960
<v Speaker 3>armour thyroid hasn't been prescribed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't heard about it being</v>

2869
02:11:35.961 --> 02:11:40.640
<v Speaker 3>prescribed since 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on armour thyroid and I've been on</v>

2870
02:11:40.641 --> 02:11:45.641
<v Speaker 3>armour thyroid for about 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out of his fucking mind that it is</v>

2871
02:11:46.191 --> 02:11:49.010
<v Speaker 3>for hypothyroidism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have something called Hashimoto's.</v>

2872
02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:50.870
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2873
02:11:50.871 --> 02:11:53.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thyroid disease.</v>

2874
02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:54.561
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

2875
02:11:54.561 --> 02:11:59.330
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like it's a thyroid disease</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is an autoimmune disease that's</v>

2876
02:11:59.331 --> 02:12:01.250
<v Speaker 3>hereditary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom has it.</v>

2877
02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:04.190
<v Speaker 3>My sister has it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have it too,</v>

2878
02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.300
<v Speaker 3>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2879
02:12:05.301 --> 02:12:08.240
<v Speaker 3>your thyroid doesn't work so well and</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it manifested itself in like</v>

2880
02:12:08.241 --> 02:12:11.240
<v Speaker 3>headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was taking this thing called synthroid</v>

2881
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:13.040
<v Speaker 3>and it didn't work as good.</v>

2882
02:12:13.070 --> 02:12:14.870
<v Speaker 3>It worked okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was definitely better than nothing.</v>

2883
02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:18.830
<v Speaker 3>But then when I got on this armor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thyroid armour thyroid is thyroid</v>

2884
02:12:18.831 --> 02:12:23.570
<v Speaker 3>medication that has been made from pigs</v>
<v Speaker 3>glands and uh,</v>

2885
02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:28.600
<v Speaker 3>it's very bio similar or are a bio</v>
<v Speaker 3>identical to your actual hormone.</v>

2886
02:12:29.341 --> 02:12:32.840
<v Speaker 3>So it's very clean and easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My body has zero problems with it.</v>

2887
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Like it really is a phase of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2888
02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:40.240
<v Speaker 3>So I've been on this for 10 years and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor is one of the best hormone</v>

2889
02:12:41.481 --> 02:12:43.910
<v Speaker 3>doctors in all of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2890
02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:47.510
<v Speaker 3>you should meet my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he'll just shoot her,</v>

2891
02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:50.880
<v Speaker 3>say we can't fix this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2892
02:12:51.390 --> 02:12:54.500
<v Speaker 3>my point is this guy's a state of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>art doctor and he.</v>

2893
02:12:54.610 --> 02:12:58.100
<v Speaker 3>And also I've told people about it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a problem with synthroid and they</v>

2894
02:12:58.101 --> 02:13:02.630
<v Speaker 3>got on it and then thanked me so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the armour thyroid works so much</v>

2895
02:13:02.631 --> 02:13:03.464
<v Speaker 3>better for them.</v>

2896
02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:06.620
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't know why Dr Drew said that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you said that Hillary Clinton</v>

2897
02:13:06.621 --> 02:13:08.420
<v Speaker 3>had a thyroid problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he thought it was weird.</v>

2898
02:13:08.421 --> 02:13:10.790
<v Speaker 3>They were prescribing armour thyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very common.</v>

2899
02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:14.540
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why they still make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it and he should know more than</v>

2900
02:13:14.541 --> 02:13:18.720
<v Speaker 3>anyone being a fucking doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he a real diaper or not bioidentical,</v>

2901
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:21.890
<v Speaker 3>whereas you have one person is allergic</v>
<v Speaker 3>to peanuts.</v>

2902
02:13:21.891 --> 02:13:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Another person can't be around cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2903
02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:26.960
<v Speaker 3>One person responds very well to certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>

2904
02:13:26.961 --> 02:13:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Other people like Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie can eat pot and nothing happens to</v>

2905
02:13:29.841 --> 02:13:32.970
<v Speaker 3>them so we're fucking Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point being,</v>

2906
02:13:32.971 --> 02:13:36.120
<v Speaker 3>if I ate with Jamie eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be curled up in the fetal position.</v>

2907
02:13:36.250 --> 02:13:38.150
<v Speaker 3>Call and girls I dated in high school</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

2908
02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:40.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the folks that spend</v>

2909
02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:41.460
<v Speaker 3>so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still feel bad.</v>

2910
02:13:42.210 --> 02:13:43.043
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2911
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:46.330
<v Speaker 3>We're all very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think he doesn't say,</v>

2912
02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:47.970
<v Speaker 3>well hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me keep going.</v>

2913
02:13:47.971 --> 02:13:50.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is people that I know that</v>

2914
02:13:50.191 --> 02:13:52.770
<v Speaker 3>her doctor said that what he did was</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially malpractice.</v>

2915
02:13:52.771 --> 02:13:55.410
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to diagnose someone</v>

2916
02:13:55.411 --> 02:13:58.140
<v Speaker 3>without any personal understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their case.</v>

2917
02:13:58.141 --> 02:14:00.920
<v Speaker 3>You haven't talked to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't studied their their blood</v>

2918
02:14:00.921 --> 02:14:02.520
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not privy to their insight</v>

2919
02:14:02.521 --> 02:14:04.560
<v Speaker 3>information about their health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they feel.</v>

2920
02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:09.210
<v Speaker 3>You're taking this guess based on what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>been what's been released and on top of</v>

2921
02:14:09.211 --> 02:14:12.240
<v Speaker 3>that you're doing it kind of to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>publicity and attention,</v>

2922
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:14.140
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2923
02:14:14.230 --> 02:14:15.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's essentially what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

2924
02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:20.040
<v Speaker 3>If he did it in a respectful way where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was speculating where he said,</v>

2925
02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:23.010
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about the specifics of this</v>

2926
02:14:23.011 --> 02:14:25.080
<v Speaker 3>is how I would handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me being a doctor,</v>

2927
02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>

2928
02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:29.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about the specific</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifics of Hillary Clinton's case,</v>

2929
02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:34.700
<v Speaker 3>but I do know here's what can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic about brain injuries similar</v>

2930
02:14:34.951 --> 02:14:37.350
<v Speaker 3>to the one that she apparently suffered</v>
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>

2931
02:14:37.351 --> 02:14:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Could hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be some issues and this is what</v>

2932
02:14:39.241 --> 02:14:40.830
<v Speaker 3>some people experience from brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

2933
02:14:41.190 --> 02:14:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Like if you say something like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>information that is a doctor talking</v>

2934
02:14:44.881 --> 02:14:47.760
<v Speaker 3>about a nonspecific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not talking about a specific</v>

2935
02:14:47.761 --> 02:14:49.500
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about like safe.</v>

2936
02:14:49.501 --> 02:14:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Papa breaks his leg and Dr drew reads</v>

2937
02:14:51.781 --> 02:14:54.250
<v Speaker 3>about a Tom Papa was riding a motorcycle</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Africa.</v>

2938
02:14:54.251 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 3>I broke his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2939
02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:58.860
<v Speaker 3>here's what happens when your leg breaks</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when people break their legs,</v>

2940
02:14:59.070 --> 02:15:01.560
<v Speaker 3>your body has to heal it and here's some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the complications that come along</v>

2941
02:15:01.561 --> 02:15:02.131
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2942
02:15:02.131 --> 02:15:04.920
<v Speaker 3>if he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a doctor on television</v>

2943
02:15:04.921 --> 02:15:09.921
<v Speaker 3>informing us about some real issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he thought as a voter and as an</v>

2944
02:15:11.341 --> 02:15:14.220
<v Speaker 3>American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as someone who's genuinely concerned,</v>

2945
02:15:14.221 --> 02:15:18.060
<v Speaker 3>knowing what he does know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he felt like he had to speak out</v>

2946
02:15:18.061 --> 02:15:21.510
<v Speaker 3>about the dangers of someone who's had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injury.</v>

2947
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:25.080
<v Speaker 3>Having a position like being the</v>
<v Speaker 3>president and what could be a problem,</v>

2948
02:15:25.081 --> 02:15:27.840
<v Speaker 3>and then he looked at her medication</v>
<v Speaker 3>list and he disagreed with it.</v>

2949
02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:30.990
<v Speaker 3>Doctors will disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to some doctors will say</v>

2950
02:15:31.170 --> 02:15:33.060
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about the bulging</v>
<v Speaker 3>disc issue.</v>

2951
02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:35.160
<v Speaker 3>I talked to one doctor wanted me to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>an operation.</v>

2952
02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to have to get that cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>

2953
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:39.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to get any better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's convinced clearly he was wrong</v>

2954
02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:41.190
<v Speaker 3>because it got better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he really.</v>

2955
02:15:41.370 --> 02:15:43.770
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know shit about Regena King.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had never heard of it.</v>

2956
02:15:43.771 --> 02:15:44.700
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2957
02:15:44.701 --> 02:15:46.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't put any my eggs in that</v>

2958
02:15:46.201 --> 02:15:46.801
<v Speaker 3>basket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2959
02:15:46.801 --> 02:15:48.690
<v Speaker 3>it's just a no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no research and there's a reason</v>

2960
02:15:48.691 --> 02:15:50.790
<v Speaker 3>why it hasn't been approved yet by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>FDA.</v>

2961
02:15:50.850 --> 02:15:51.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2962
02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:51.721
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2963
02:15:51.721 --> 02:15:53.020
<v Speaker 3>There isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking done.</v>

2964
02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:56.430
<v Speaker 3>And it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are wrong all the time.</v>

2965
02:15:56.431 --> 02:15:59.040
<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So according to my friend who's a doctor</v>

2966
02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:01.620
<v Speaker 3>who he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never supposed to do that.</v>

2967
02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:04.620
<v Speaker 3>And then what he did by diagnosing her</v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly like that,</v>

2968
02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:05.633
<v Speaker 3>you just don't do.</v>

2969
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:06.950
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's true,</v>

2970
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:10.350
<v Speaker 4>then they're probably justified in</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking these canning and.</v>

2971
02:16:10.351 --> 02:16:10.610
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2972
02:16:10.610 --> 02:16:14.480
<v Speaker 4>So then would you say that that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>eliminates the idea that it's a</v>

2973
02:16:14.481 --> 02:16:15.590
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when</v>

2974
02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:18.270
<v Speaker 3>I'd say he's lucky he's alive because</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just kills bitches.</v>

2975
02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary's is out there,</v>

2976
02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:24.630
<v Speaker 3>whack it fools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you pay attention to the same</v>

2977
02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:27.900
<v Speaker 3>websites that tell you about chem trails</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the flat earth,</v>

2978
02:16:27.930 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 3>which are the ones that are truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hashtag truth,</v>

2979
02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:33.130
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you she's whacked like 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2980
02:16:33.430 --> 02:16:34.420
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

2981
02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:36.000
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like Seagal,</v>

2982
02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:38.110
<v Speaker 3>like a lighter Seagal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do not know this.</v>

2983
02:16:38.350 --> 02:16:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Do you not know about this for real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>

2984
02:16:40.110 --> 02:16:40.943
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2985
02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:46.000
<v Speaker 3>There is at least 48 or 49 people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have had dealings with the Clintons</v>

2986
02:16:46.001 --> 02:16:50.260
<v Speaker 3>who've been mysteriously murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the guy who released all those</v>

2987
02:16:50.261 --> 02:16:53.710
<v Speaker 3>emails about the DNC favoring hillary</v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

2988
02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:57.310
<v Speaker 3>He released him to wikileaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>favoring hillary over Bernie.</v>

2989
02:16:57.340 --> 02:16:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2990
02:16:58.691 --> 02:17:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy got shot at 4:00 in the morning</v>

2991
02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.560
<v Speaker 3>in front of his house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the back.</v>

2992
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:05.280
<v Speaker 3>Murdered when?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody recently.</v>

2993
02:17:05.370 --> 02:17:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really recently,</v>

2994
02:17:06.970 --> 02:17:11.970
<v Speaker 3>and he's one of several people who had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been murdered that had ties to the</v>

2995
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Clintons Clinton body count or left wing</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy three with ties to the DNC</v>

2996
02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:17.920
<v Speaker 3>mysteriously die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2997
02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2998
02:17:18.970 --> 02:17:21.700
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not die all the time.</v>

2999
02:17:21.730 --> 02:17:24.100
<v Speaker 3>They do die all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the thing.</v>

3000
02:17:24.130 --> 02:17:26.560
<v Speaker 3>You're not saying that she killed him</v>
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>

3001
02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:29.410
<v Speaker 3>but here's what you do need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

3002
02:17:29.470 --> 02:17:31.030
<v Speaker 3>this is what's really important to</v>
<v Speaker 3>consider.</v>

3003
02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:34.420
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about when you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about someone like the Clintons,</v>

3004
02:17:34.421 --> 02:17:36.130
<v Speaker 3>especially if you talk about for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>

3005
02:17:36.131 --> 02:17:38.920
<v Speaker 3>you've confused the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're talking about just keeps</v>

3006
02:17:38.921 --> 02:17:42.260
<v Speaker 3>clicking on links.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start doing that.</v>

3007
02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:45.510
<v Speaker 3>What's going on over here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about our click this when when</v>

3008
02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:49.150
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about someone like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clintons who run the Clinton Foundation,</v>

3009
02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:51.340
<v Speaker 3>not I don't know if you've paid</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to the Clinton Foundation,</v>

3010
02:17:51.570 --> 02:17:56.380
<v Speaker 3>but I have been slowly but surely going</v>
<v Speaker 3>down a rabbit hole with the Clinton</v>

3011
02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Foundation over the last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>months and it is crazy what they got</v>

3012
02:17:59.891 --> 02:18:00.680
<v Speaker 3>away with.</v>

3013
02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:03.040
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy and there's some pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>direct evidence.</v>

3014
02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:07.330
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that were involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they donated to the Clinton</v>

3015
02:18:07.330 --> 02:18:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Foundation and they got arms deals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now whether or not they got arms deals</v>

3016
02:18:10.391 --> 02:18:14.950
<v Speaker 3>because they donated or whether they did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that as a thank you for the arms deal</v>

3017
02:18:14.951 --> 02:18:17.260
<v Speaker 3>that they would have had anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck knows?</v>

3018
02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:20.650
<v Speaker 3>But that's just one aspect of what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic about this.</v>

3019
02:18:20.651 --> 02:18:23.500
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm no expert and I don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck I'm talking about.</v>

3020
02:18:23.810 --> 02:18:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just state that for a fact,</v>

3021
02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:30.550
<v Speaker 3>but what I've been reading about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what people find problematic about the,</v>

3022
02:18:30.770 --> 02:18:35.620
<v Speaker 3>the about of profit that's been made off</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this and the amount of influence that</v>

3023
02:18:35.621 --> 02:18:38.980
<v Speaker 3>is being sold with this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of these people that they're</v>

3024
02:18:38.981 --> 02:18:43.900
<v Speaker 3>involved with these dealings are</v>
<v Speaker 3>donating to their foundation and then in</v>

3025
02:18:43.901 --> 02:18:48.901
<v Speaker 3>return they're getting these deals past</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like is shady as fuck.</v>

3026
02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the people that you're dealing with,</v>

3027
02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:54.070
<v Speaker 3>in some instances you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons.</v>

3028
02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Talking about arms dealers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about countries that kill</v>

3029
02:18:57.731 --> 02:19:00.700
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries with poor civil rights records</v>

3030
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:04.450
<v Speaker 3>like Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about decisions that you</v>

3031
02:19:04.451 --> 02:19:07.360
<v Speaker 3>make you fucking know for sure people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to die.</v>

3032
02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know that about her.</v>

3033
02:19:09.790 --> 02:19:14.790
<v Speaker 3>That's just what looked at video of her</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing about the death of Omar Kadafi</v>

3034
02:19:15.490 --> 02:19:16.340
<v Speaker 3>received that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3035
02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:19.720
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed just like we came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw he died.</v>

3036
02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the bar for being a</v>

3037
02:19:25.361 --> 02:19:28.880
<v Speaker 3>president is so low that you could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a video like that out there and it</v>

3038
02:19:28.881 --> 02:19:31.430
<v Speaker 3>doesn't freak people the fuck out</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody back off.</v>

3039
02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:35.480
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all the evidence of all this weird</v>

3040
02:19:35.481 --> 02:19:37.970
<v Speaker 3>shit that it's probably just standard</v>
<v Speaker 3>operational procedure.</v>

3041
02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.970
<v Speaker 3>So here's my point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're involved with this,</v>

3042
02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:46.300
<v Speaker 3>this interconnected web of death of</v>
<v Speaker 3>killers,</v>

3043
02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:50.540
<v Speaker 3>of war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of tough questions that demand tufts</v>

3044
02:19:50.541 --> 02:19:53.210
<v Speaker 3>solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're involved with all these</v>

3045
02:19:53.211 --> 02:19:55.910
<v Speaker 3>people that are used to killing people</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

3046
02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.800
<v Speaker 3>If something like this dnc leak comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and it's possible that this could</v>

3047
02:20:00.801 --> 02:20:04.790
<v Speaker 3>bring down a ship and this ship is huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's thousands of people involved</v>

3048
02:20:04.791 --> 02:20:07.400
<v Speaker 3>in this ship and you might be one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people involved in this ship.</v>

3049
02:20:07.950 --> 02:20:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't think I know how to take</v>

3050
02:20:09.351 --> 02:20:11.540
<v Speaker 3>care of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you step in and,</v>

3051
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:14.990
<v Speaker 3>and someone dies and everybody else</v>
<v Speaker 3>shuts the fuck up.</v>

3052
02:20:14.991 --> 02:20:16.880
<v Speaker 3>And everybody panics and nobody gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>caught.</v>

3053
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:20.330
<v Speaker 3>And there's no ties to hillary because</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary didn't ask for it to be done.</v>

3054
02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:23.600
<v Speaker 3>But it's a part of a fucking giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

3055
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it might not even be that she's out</v>

3056
02:20:26.061 --> 02:20:28.040
<v Speaker 3>there doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might be the fact that</v>

3057
02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:32.360
<v Speaker 3>her influence political power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about,</v>

3058
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:35.360
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the presidency of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States of America,</v>

3059
02:20:35.370 --> 02:20:40.370
<v Speaker 3>you talking about a gigantic amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world that that controls and she's</v>

3060
02:20:42.021 --> 02:20:43.350
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3061
02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Hasn't every president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely hasn't.</v>

3062
02:20:47.290 --> 02:20:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Every leader of whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3063
02:20:49.761 --> 02:20:51.560
<v Speaker 3>That's it's the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a job.</v>

3064
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:53.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that I keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's us?</v>

3065
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:56.330
<v Speaker 3>What are you showing us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the three guys that</v>

3066
02:20:56.331 --> 02:20:57.950
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about that just recently</v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

3067
02:20:58.190 --> 02:21:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Former president of the United Nations</v>

3068
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:02.330
<v Speaker 3>General Assembly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Ash mysteriously passed away on</v>

3069
02:21:02.331 --> 02:21:04.310
<v Speaker 3>June 22nd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few days before he was scheduled to</v>

3070
02:21:04.311 --> 02:21:08.360
<v Speaker 3>begin pretrial meetings involving shady</v>
<v Speaker 3>financial dealings regarding a former</v>

3071
02:21:08.361 --> 02:21:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Clinton crony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Local police officer said he died from</v>

3072
02:21:11.481 --> 02:21:14.210

<v Speaker 3>working out,</v>

3073
02:21:15.410 --> 02:21:18.560
<v Speaker 3>but the UN oddly first claim he died of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a heart attack.</v>

3074
02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:23.120
<v Speaker 3>The 61 year old was supposed to testify</v>
<v Speaker 3>against Chinese real estate developer.</v>

3075
02:21:23.121 --> 02:21:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dead as fuck.</v>

3076
02:21:24.570 --> 02:21:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Nick lap saying who was implicated in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the China Gate scandal for funneling</v>

3077
02:21:30.171 --> 02:21:34.070
<v Speaker 3>money to the DNC for Bill Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 3>through Arkansas restaurant owner</v>

3078
02:21:34.071 --> 02:21:37.460
<v Speaker 3>trolley try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ash was arrested last year for allegedly</v>

3079
02:21:37.461 --> 02:21:40.760
<v Speaker 3>taking over $3,000,000 in bribes from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Chinese businessmen,</v>

<v Speaker 3>nick see in exchange for building United</v>

3081
02:21:47.810 --> 02:21:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Nations Conference Center in Macau.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot in there,</v>

3082
02:21:51.290 --> 02:21:54.680
<v Speaker 3>and he was arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was arrested for taking 3 million</v>

3083
02:21:54.681 --> 02:21:58.340
<v Speaker 3>bucks in bribes and then he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>testify he was going to spill the beans</v>

3084
02:21:58.341 --> 02:22:03.140
<v Speaker 3>and they killed him like a fucking like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a movie.</v>

3085
02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:04.190
<v Speaker 3>What's that source?</v>

3086
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Website websites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Townhall.com.</v>

3087
02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:13.040
<v Speaker 3>What's townhall.com?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the information I'm sure is not</v>

3088
02:22:13.041 --> 02:22:16.130
<v Speaker 3>made up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should just go just google his death</v>

3089
02:22:16.131 --> 02:22:21.020
<v Speaker 3>and find out Clinton body count or left</v>
<v Speaker 3>wing conspiracy three with ties.</v>

3090
02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:26.920
<v Speaker 3>That's just one article in one website</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the of these people dying is</v>

3091
02:22:27.061 --> 02:22:29.250
<v Speaker 3>undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've definitely died whether or not</v>

3092
02:22:29.251 --> 02:22:32.580
<v Speaker 3>they were murdered or whether it's on</v>
<v Speaker 3>some crazy coincidence that all of these</v>

3093
02:22:32.581 --> 02:22:37.140
<v Speaker 3>people were about to testify or had</v>
<v Speaker 3>secret information or leaked information</v>

3094
02:22:37.141 --> 02:22:39.390
<v Speaker 3>to wikileaks and then were murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3095
02:22:39.610 --> 02:22:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3096
02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:42.660
<v Speaker 3>And there was a woman too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did,</v>

3097
02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:45.030
<v Speaker 3>what did she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some woman involved in DNC was also</v>

3098
02:22:45.031 --> 02:22:45.864
<v Speaker 3>murdered recently.</v>

3099
02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:52.420
<v Speaker 2>The staffer who dropped off the lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe is who it was.</v>

3100
02:22:52.851 --> 02:22:57.260
<v Speaker 2>They're like filed the lawsuit in August</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe in July.</v>

3101
02:22:57.530 --> 02:23:00.080
<v Speaker 2>He was dead in August.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was found dead in his bathroom step.</v>

3102
02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:02.750
<v Speaker 2>What lawsuit against?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the DNC?</v>

3103
02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:04.610
<v Speaker 2>For Bernie Sanders or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3104
02:23:04.611 --> 02:23:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was killed too,</v>

3105
02:23:07.310 --> 02:23:09.680
<v Speaker 2>along with the kid who released the</v>
<v Speaker 2>documents.</v>

3106
02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:11.630
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably did it.</v>

3107
02:23:11.631 --> 02:23:15.770
<v Speaker 2>They don't know if he for sure did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an analyst that had access to that</v>

3108
02:23:15.771 --> 02:23:17.240
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was him and he was</v>

3109
02:23:17.241 --> 02:23:18.074
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3110
02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:20.300
<v Speaker 2>they're killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's killing people,</v>

3111
02:23:20.301 --> 02:23:21.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not are.</v>

3112
02:23:21.450 --> 02:23:24.740
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we on?</v>

3113
02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the selten,</v>

3114
02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:30.150

<v Speaker 2>just occasionally to make dirty Mus.</v>

3115
02:23:30.260 --> 02:23:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Think about what people do for just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>small amount of money,</v>

3116
02:23:34.220 --> 02:23:36.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The horrible things people do to other</v>

3117
02:23:36.681 --> 02:23:40.400
<v Speaker 2>people for small amounts of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get up to that level of</v>

3118
02:23:40.430 --> 02:23:45.430
<v Speaker 2>billions of government size money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

3119
02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:49.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see all the accusations against a</v>

3120
02:23:50.250 --> 02:23:53.360
<v Speaker 2>poot and over the weekend I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's scary up there.</v>

3128
02:24:04.310 --> 02:24:07.400
<v Speaker 3>It's really scary up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that video of that.</v>

3129
02:24:07.401 --> 02:24:12.320
<v Speaker 3>A guy took a surveillance camera at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>millionaire who's having some or</v>

3130
02:24:12.321 --> 02:24:13.990
<v Speaker 3>billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's happened.</v>

3131
02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Some big dispute with his girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He broke up with her and so she led.</v>

3132
02:24:18.021 --> 02:24:21.350
<v Speaker 3>She beat him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants money and he has surveillance</v>

3133
02:24:21.351 --> 02:24:24.110
<v Speaker 3>video of her lying on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Punching herself in the face.</v>

3134
02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:25.393
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3135
02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:29.960
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted it today.</v>

<v Speaker 3>wonderful listen folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an us or them thing.</v>

3137
02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:36.980
<v Speaker 3>We have to stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a thing that women do whenever a</v>

3138
02:24:36.981 --> 02:24:40.340
<v Speaker 3>woman is involved in any sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>domestic violence,</v>

3139
02:24:40.341 --> 02:24:42.200
<v Speaker 3>abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rape type situation,</v>

3140
02:24:42.470 --> 02:24:46.160
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that women automatically</v>
<v Speaker 3>do where they think that that woman is</v>

3141
02:24:46.161 --> 02:24:50.450
<v Speaker 3>not guilty and that woman has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>abused and that women is definitely not</v>

3142
02:24:50.451 --> 02:24:55.451
<v Speaker 3>lying and most of the time you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are a lot of fucking liars out</v>

3143
02:24:55.461 --> 02:24:59.930
<v Speaker 3>there and some of them have penises and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them have vaginas and that this</v>

3144
02:24:59.931 --> 02:25:03.710
<v Speaker 3>is something as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to stop being on these fucking</v>

3145
02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:05.420
<v Speaker 3>gender based teams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3146
02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:10.040
<v Speaker 3>it's stupid because there are nutty</v>
<v Speaker 3>pitches out there and some of them are</v>

3147
02:25:10.041 --> 02:25:14.690
<v Speaker 3>men and some of them are women and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman is just sitting there as a video</v>

3148
02:25:14.691 --> 02:25:18.260
<v Speaker 3>of her hitting her side in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting herself in the face,</v>

3149
02:25:18.410 --> 02:25:22.730
<v Speaker 3>screaming and yelling and wailing</v>
<v Speaker 3>herself in the face.</v>

3150
02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:25.150
<v Speaker 3>Look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's fucking bananas,</v>

3151
02:25:25.151 --> 02:25:26.620
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3152
02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:30.790
<v Speaker 3>So she gives herself marks all over her</v>
<v Speaker 3>face and then she calls the cops and</v>

3153
02:25:30.791 --> 02:25:33.910
<v Speaker 3>she's having a temper tantrum and</v>
<v Speaker 3>storming around and she doesn't realize</v>

3154
02:25:33.911 --> 02:25:35.980
<v Speaker 3>that she's being filmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3155
02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:37.960
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how much of this is</v>

3156
02:25:37.961 --> 02:25:41.020
<v Speaker 3>admissible because she's fucking hitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>herself in the face so hard.</v>

3157
02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much of this is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>admissible in court in divorce court?</v>

3158
02:25:45.310 --> 02:25:46.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or in.</v>

3159
02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well not even divorced court,</v>

3160
02:25:49.001 --> 02:25:52.200
<v Speaker 3>but if he's being prosecuted for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3161
02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:54.720
<v Speaker 3>it was his fiance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3162
02:25:54.860 --> 02:25:58.810
<v Speaker 3>this is what everybody said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this has been a lot of these</v>

3163
02:25:58.811 --> 02:26:03.430
<v Speaker 3>cases and this is the what Johnny Depp</v>
<v Speaker 3>is claiming happened where his ex</v>

3164
02:26:03.431 --> 02:26:05.620
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend was saying that he beat her</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and he said I.</v>

3165
02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:08.860
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do it and she just did it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>herself or faked it or something like</v>

3166
02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:09.250
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3167
02:26:09.250 --> 02:26:10.360
<v Speaker 3>End Up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

3168
02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:12.520
<v Speaker 3>There's still disputing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's suing Doug.</v>

3169
02:26:12.521 --> 02:26:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope she it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug's Dan,</v>

3170
02:26:14.770 --> 02:26:17.500
<v Speaker 3>because he was defended them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's Doug Stanhope wrote an article</v>

3171
02:26:17.530 --> 02:26:21.350
<v Speaker 3>saying that he knows that she's a liar</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that she was blackmailing him and</v>

3172
02:26:21.370 --> 02:26:23.890
<v Speaker 3>that Johnny Depp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It told him about it before any of this</v>

3173
02:26:23.891 --> 02:26:25.660
<v Speaker 3>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she had some demands.</v>

3174
02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:28.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who's telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if Doug really knows.</v>

3175
02:26:28.631 --> 02:26:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who the fuck knows I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3176
02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:32.740
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3177
02:26:32.770 --> 02:26:35.890
<v Speaker 3>there are people like that nutty bitch</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you just saw in that video hitting</v>

3178
02:26:35.891 --> 02:26:37.660
<v Speaker 3>herself in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people like that.</v>

3179
02:26:37.661 --> 02:26:39.130
<v Speaker 3>They're real people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3180
02:26:39.180 --> 02:26:41.530
<v Speaker 3>They have vaginas and some of them have</v>
<v Speaker 3>penises.</v>

3181
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:45.250
<v Speaker 3>They're not be men or women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's infallible.</v>

3182
02:26:45.251 --> 02:26:48.610
<v Speaker 3>We got to get off these teams is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a real problem.</v>

3183
02:26:48.611 --> 02:26:49.720
<v Speaker 3>This is very divisive.</v>

3184
02:26:49.770 --> 02:26:53.980
<v Speaker 3>It really separates people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this idea that anytime a woman</v>

3185
02:26:53.981 --> 02:26:55.810
<v Speaker 3>accuses a man of something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be true.</v>

3186
02:26:56.290 --> 02:26:58.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not right.</v>

3187
02:26:58.241 --> 02:27:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Like we have to be sure we have to and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know how to do that,</v>

3188
02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:04.930
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think the way to do that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to automatically assume that even like</v>

3189
02:27:04.931 --> 02:27:07.870
<v Speaker 3>shady pitches are all telling the truth</v>
<v Speaker 3>always,</v>

3190
02:27:07.930 --> 02:27:10.720
<v Speaker 3>and then every woman who's accusing</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of something without a doubt</v>

3191
02:27:10.721 --> 02:27:12.430
<v Speaker 3>can't be lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3192
02:27:12.490 --> 02:27:15.430
<v Speaker 3>It's case by case by case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lately different,</v>

3193
02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:16.510
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to.</v>

3194
02:27:16.511 --> 02:27:20.650
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to blame the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone is a victim and you go around</v>

3195
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:21.820
<v Speaker 3>and you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

3196
02:27:21.821 --> 02:27:23.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe a fucking word you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

3197
02:27:23.231 --> 02:27:24.640
<v Speaker 3>and meanwhile that actually did happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>

3198
02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:26.200
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutal,</v>

3199
02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:28.240
<v Speaker 3>but we have to be able to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is what.</v>

3200
02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to cut to not come up with a</v>

3201
02:27:31.061 --> 02:27:33.860
<v Speaker 3>general generalization because those</v>
<v Speaker 3>cases,</v>

3202
02:27:33.870 --> 02:27:36.820
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's if there's some way that you can</v>

3203
02:27:36.821 --> 02:27:40.360
<v Speaker 3>get the people that are dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>these situations to break through that</v>

3204
02:27:40.361 --> 02:27:43.140
<v Speaker 3>barrier and look at everything as a case</v>
<v Speaker 3>by case basis.</v>

3205
02:27:43.141 --> 02:27:46.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have enough knowledge of</v>

3206
02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:49.450
<v Speaker 3>whether or not a person who's being</v>
<v Speaker 3>truthful and then there's also an issue</v>

3207
02:27:49.451 --> 02:27:52.720
<v Speaker 3>where people in their own minds changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

3208
02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Like you could have an argument with</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone and they can decide in their own</v>

3209
02:27:56.111 --> 02:28:00.220
<v Speaker 3>mind over the course of whatever weeks</v>
<v Speaker 3>have passed that that argument was a</v>

3210
02:28:00.221 --> 02:28:03.670
<v Speaker 3>completely different beast than what was</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening while I was going down.</v>

3211
02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Your ego lies to you start telling the</v>
<v Speaker 3>story to other people with distortions.</v>

3212
02:28:07.961 --> 02:28:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Those distortions become a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

3213
02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:13.960
<v Speaker 3>It becomes the narrative you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets more and more exaggerated.</v>

3214
02:28:13.961 --> 02:28:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Every time you talk about it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

3215
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:17.170
<v Speaker 3>It becomes real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3216
02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard for them to accurately</v>

3217
02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:22.310
<v Speaker 3>and objectively</v>

3218
02:28:22.730 --> 02:28:25.130
<v Speaker 1>talk about like a very traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

3219
02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if you did get in a fight with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and you're a woman and you're</v>

3220
02:28:28.890 --> 02:28:30.560
<v Speaker 1>engaged this guy and he really did beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>you up.</v>

3221
02:28:30.561 --> 02:28:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

3222
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just trying to relay that</v>

3223
02:28:33.651 --> 02:28:36.350
<v Speaker 1>accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be terrifying and bizarre.</v>

3224
02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:37.820
<v Speaker 1>And fleetingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3225
02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got to parse these tiny</v>

3226
02:28:40.881 --> 02:28:44.150
<v Speaker 1>little details about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is this dude laughing?</v>

3227
02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:45.830
<v Speaker 1>The studio has this video right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3228
02:28:46.730 --> 02:28:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Like when he saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he knew he had his like,</v>

3229
02:28:49.191 --> 02:28:53.780
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing.</v>

3230
02:28:53.781 --> 02:28:55.670
<v Speaker 1>She'll come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll realize that.</v>

3231
02:28:56.110 --> 02:28:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that show.</v>

3232
02:28:57.290 --> 02:28:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Rationalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll be like,</v>

3233
02:28:58.461 --> 02:28:58.701
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3234
02:28:58.701 --> 02:29:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just never caught him in the act.</v>

3235
02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what she'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's crazy enough where she will</v>

3236
02:29:03.981 --> 02:29:08.000
<v Speaker 1>have a working system in her head of why</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

3237
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also what you get when women</v>

3238
02:29:10.911 --> 02:29:13.580
<v Speaker 1>fuck us for their money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get people who are mad,</v>

3239
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:15.800
<v Speaker 1>like if you want to fucking a guy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>his money,</v>

3240
02:29:15.890 --> 02:29:18.380
<v Speaker 1>say if you're an attractive woman like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl is and the guys,</v>

3241
02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:23.510
<v Speaker 1>but she could probably do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's beautiful that you get mad at</v>

3242
02:29:23.511 --> 02:29:24.380
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3243
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Powerless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never fuck over your head,</v>

3244
02:29:26.970 --> 02:29:29.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stay within your means.</v>

3245
02:29:30.470 --> 02:29:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3246
02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are not really attracted to you,</v>

3247
02:29:35.541 --> 02:29:36.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It gets ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ugly.</v>

3249
02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:40.250
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

3250
02:29:40.370 --> 02:29:42.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has this idea that got to get</v>

3251
02:29:42.111 --> 02:29:44.800
<v Speaker 1>a supermodel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dumbest move to it.</v>

3252
02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you not do it.</v>

3253
02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fuck over your head because you'll</v>

3254
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:49.160
<v Speaker 1>have to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a deficit.</v>

3255
02:29:49.161 --> 02:29:51.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like buying a corvette when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>still in college,</v>

3256
02:29:51.861 --> 02:29:53.960
<v Speaker 1>but you got the student loan or I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to spend it on the car.</v>

3257
02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob bought a corvette.</v>

3258
02:29:55.731 --> 02:29:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of here and you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

3259
02:29:57.640 --> 02:30:02.230
<v Speaker 1>This fucking guy's like jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start delivering it dominoes and I'm</v>

3260
02:30:02.250 --> 02:30:04.670
<v Speaker 1>going to pay this car off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brawler drove in a car.</v>

3261
02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:05.533
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3262
02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:08.810
<v Speaker 1>that's what the guys dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a super hot wife if he's a</v>

3263
02:30:08.811 --> 02:30:09.830
<v Speaker 1>fucking fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>

3264
02:30:09.831 --> 02:30:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Rich Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

3265
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:13.100
<v Speaker 1>You have to know if that's what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting.</v>

3266
02:30:13.101 --> 02:30:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you're competing with everyone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to sleep with that and that is a</v>

3267
02:30:16.581 --> 02:30:17.960
<v Speaker 1>supermodel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just genetically,</v>

3268
02:30:17.961 --> 02:30:21.800
<v Speaker 1>you've now increased the number of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha males coming for this person.</v>

3269
02:30:22.010 --> 02:30:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a good move is to always go</v>

3270
02:30:24.381 --> 02:30:27.140
<v Speaker 1>foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's how I feel about sports</v>

3271
02:30:27.141 --> 02:30:29.870
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel about trophy bribed</v>

3272
02:30:30.220 --> 02:30:30.890
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna,</v>

3273
02:30:30.890 --> 02:30:34.040
<v Speaker 1>get a trophy bride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get one from some war torn regions of</v>

3274
02:30:34.041 --> 02:30:35.680
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She don't know no better.</v>

3275
02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got food.</v>

3276
02:30:37.731 --> 02:30:39.920
<v Speaker 1>She genuinely loves you for taking care</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her.</v>

3277
02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:44.630
<v Speaker 1>She's so psyched and if you move her</v>
<v Speaker 1>family out of the ramshackle village,</v>

3278
02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the ramp that the Jews are about to plow</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

3279
02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you can move her whole family are your</v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

3280
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:52.430
<v Speaker 1>You guys will have a wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship based on actual</v>

3281
02:30:52.431 --> 02:30:54.500
<v Speaker 1>appreciation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just like running water,</v>

3282
02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but if you date some blonde and Florida</v>
<v Speaker 1>with big tits and she does coke,</v>

3283
02:30:58.910 --> 02:31:02.150
<v Speaker 1>who's come up through the minors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she know she doesn't want to fuck you,</v>

3284

<v Speaker 1>done her whole life.</v>

3286
02:31:08.391 --> 02:31:11.270

<v Speaker 1>she can close this deal and make the big</v>

3287
02:31:11.271 --> 02:31:14.390
<v Speaker 1>money and right when she was at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish line,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you cut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

3296
02:31:30.781 --> 02:31:32.100

<v Speaker 3>Of that there's.</v>

02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:34.800
<v Speaker 3>It's a business for do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

3298
02:31:34.801 --> 02:31:37.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a business for women to come after</v>
<v Speaker 3>these young,</v>

3299
02:31:37.081 --> 02:31:38.940
<v Speaker 3>get pregnant and get pregnant and all</v>

<v Speaker 3>Then this is one of the threats to your</v>

3301
02:31:42.091 --> 02:31:42.924
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it makes sense because it's.</v>

3305
02:31:51.661 --> 02:31:52.910
<v Speaker 3>There's an imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3306
02:31:52.920 --> 02:31:53.731
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>

<v Speaker 3>wall and those salmon are all swimming,</v>

3409
02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:24.580

<v Speaker 3>That's how they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even get to fuck right.</v>

3421
02:36:58.961 --> 02:37:01.180
<v Speaker 3>throw out your lure and they would just</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack anything.</v>

3422
02:37:01.181 --> 02:37:03.760
<v Speaker 3>They were super aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when you would pick them up,</v>

3423
02:37:04.090 --> 02:37:07.560
<v Speaker 3>they would be jizzing like you had</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled them out of the water and they</v>

3424
02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:10.420
<v Speaker 3>took a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's x near me because they</v>

3425
02:37:10.421 --> 02:37:13.780
<v Speaker 3>know it's over arches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't taste it.</v>

3426
02:37:14.610 --> 02:37:16.460
<v Speaker 3>Tasted arches either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trick question.</v>

3427
02:37:18.430 --> 02:37:20.120
<v Speaker 3>You almost got me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You motherfucker.</v>

3428
02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:23.930
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>

3429
02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:27.260
<v Speaker 3>you pick them up and they literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be orgasming as you're pulling</v>

3430
02:37:27.261 --> 02:37:29.690
<v Speaker 3>them out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just been all over the place.</v>

3431
02:37:30.190 --> 02:37:30.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's apparent.</v>

3432
02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Was pretty common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember a lot from when I was a</v>

3433
02:37:33.351 --> 02:37:35.330
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had it happen in any sense,</v>

3434
02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:37.970
<v Speaker 3>but I do remember it a lot when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>

3435
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:41.330
<v Speaker 3>but I don't do nearly as much fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So wait.</v>

3436
02:37:41.331 --> 02:37:44.350
<v Speaker 3>So Paul Allen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy suits and has um,</v>

3437
02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:47.570
<v Speaker 3>this guy at the locks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a circular sort of a thing.</v>

3438
02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:51.110
<v Speaker 3>The guy at the locks who I was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to it as asking them some questions</v>

3439
02:37:51.111 --> 02:37:55.730
<v Speaker 3>about some of the fish he was pointing</v>
<v Speaker 3>out the bays and how they change this</v>

3440
02:37:55.731 --> 02:37:58.880
<v Speaker 3>lake because there was a lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lake there and they didn't</v>

3441
02:37:58.881 --> 02:38:02.690
<v Speaker 3>realize that when they cut this channel</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it lowered the level of the lake</v>

3442
02:38:02.691 --> 02:38:05.330
<v Speaker 3>and then that made it so the fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't get back to the lake.</v>

3443
02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:08.630
<v Speaker 3>And it was a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had said they were stacks of dead</v>

3444
02:38:08.631 --> 02:38:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the like 20,</v>

3445
02:38:09.810 --> 02:38:13.820
<v Speaker 3>30 feet high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's crazy that they would just go to</v>

3446
02:38:13.821 --> 02:38:16.250
<v Speaker 3>the area where they had always gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now the river didn't go all the way</v>

3447
02:38:16.251 --> 02:38:18.350
<v Speaker 3>to the end where the lake was and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would just wind up dying.</v>

3448
02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:23.420
<v Speaker 3>She's but he was saying that Paul Allen</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Bill Gates both have these insane</v>

3449
02:38:23.930 --> 02:38:28.040
<v Speaker 3>$150,000,000 houses on this leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3450
02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Imagine them what a hundred and</v>
<v Speaker 3>$50,000,000 house looks like.</v>

3451
02:38:32.390 --> 02:38:35.750
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are we even talking about</v>

3452
02:38:35.751 --> 02:38:39.140
<v Speaker 3>it and it's great Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet the Wifi is dog shit.</v>

3453
02:38:40.100 --> 02:38:44.000
<v Speaker 3>I better get viruses every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of malware and every time he opens</v>

3454
02:38:44.001 --> 02:38:45.920
<v Speaker 3>up a room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new virus,</v>

3455
02:38:45.921 --> 02:38:49.790
<v Speaker 3>because everything's on computers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wear a tie clip at least this is the</v>

3456
02:38:49.791 --> 02:38:50.624
<v Speaker 3>way it used to work.</v>

3457
02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:54.860
<v Speaker 3>You would wear a pin and you put that</v>
<v Speaker 3>pin on the pin and this is like many,</v>

3458
02:38:54.861 --> 02:38:56.870
<v Speaker 3>many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sure the technology is far more</v>

3459
02:38:56.871 --> 02:38:59.510
<v Speaker 3>advanced now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way Bill Gates had it set up,</v>

3460
02:38:59.511 --> 02:39:02.260
<v Speaker 3>every time you'd walk into a room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pin would recognize the user,</v>

3461
02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:05.780
<v Speaker 3>set the temperature to your preferences</v>
<v Speaker 3>and play the kind of music that you like</v>

3462
02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:09.110
<v Speaker 3>and put certain type of lighting on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3463
02:39:09.111 --> 02:39:10.400
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3464
02:39:10.401 --> 02:39:12.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's probably all outdated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of funny.</v>

3465
02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:14.750
<v Speaker 3>Unless he's updated it constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dates,</v>

3466
02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:19.020
<v Speaker 3>it gets a new lighting system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates,</v>

3467
02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:20.840
<v Speaker 3>did they ever do a tour of Bill Gates</v>
<v Speaker 3>House?</v>

3468
02:39:22.450 --> 02:39:24.770
<v Speaker 3>I heard that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it was mostly because of the</v>

3469
02:39:24.771 --> 02:39:27.440
<v Speaker 3>technology that it's not that massive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3470
02:39:27.530 --> 02:39:29.030
<v Speaker 3>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3471
02:39:29.390 --> 02:39:31.940
<v Speaker 3>that probably be a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not stand out too much.</v>

3472
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I already asked like a summary that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>could escape in.</v>

3473
02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:38.510
<v Speaker 3>We'd drop it a pod and dropped below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look in the basement because in case</v>

3474
02:39:38.511 --> 02:39:41.180
<v Speaker 3>somebody breaks into the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just shoot out out of a tube and a</v>

3475
02:39:41.181 --> 02:39:43.250
<v Speaker 3>submarine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six thousand square feet,</v>

3476
02:39:43.430 --> 02:39:44.960
<v Speaker 3>and that's kind of big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty six.</v>

3477
02:39:44.961 --> 02:39:49.310
<v Speaker 3>That's a little bigger than normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty $3 million to build Jesus Christ.</v>

3478
02:39:49.311 --> 02:39:51.020
<v Speaker 3>It's worth at least 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty 3 million.</v>

3479
02:39:51.021 --> 02:39:53.420
<v Speaker 3>According to the King County public</v>
<v Speaker 3>assessors office,</v>

3480
02:39:53.860 --> 02:39:57.680
<v Speaker 3>the property is worth 123 point five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>4 million.</v>

3481
02:39:57.681 --> 02:40:00.590
<v Speaker 3>As of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gates purchased the lot for 2 million</v>

3482
02:40:00.591 --> 02:40:05.591
<v Speaker 3>bucks in 1988 before windows 95</v>
<v Speaker 3>reportedly pays around a million dollars</v>

3483
02:40:05.691 --> 02:40:08.270
<v Speaker 3>in property taxes each year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3484
02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:13.680
<v Speaker 3>Half a million board feet of lumber was</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to complete the project.</v>

3485
02:40:13.970 --> 02:40:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the house is built with.</v>

3486
02:40:16.410 --> 02:40:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Scroll down a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The house is built with 500 year old</v>

3487
02:40:19.711 --> 02:40:23.310
<v Speaker 3>Douglas Fir trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 construction workers labored on the</v>

3488
02:40:23.311 --> 02:40:25.290
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 of whom were electricians.</v>

3489
02:40:25.470 --> 02:40:28.970
<v Speaker 3>50 died mysteriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That part,</v>

3490
02:40:29.470 --> 02:40:30.180
<v Speaker 3>that part.</v>

3491
02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:33.990
<v Speaker 3>What does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The House has uses natural surroundings</v>

3492
02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:36.300
<v Speaker 3>to reduce heat loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it looks like?</v>

3493
02:40:36.301 --> 02:40:39.540
<v Speaker 3>It's covered in woods stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the side of the thing and there's</v>

3494
02:40:39.541 --> 02:40:40.770
<v Speaker 3>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad added all around.</v>

3495
02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:42.360
<v Speaker 3>What's above it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are those?</v>

3496
02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:45.210
<v Speaker 3>That wall above it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a wall of China?</v>

3497
02:40:45.390 --> 02:40:47.220
<v Speaker 3>It looks like an apartment building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably other houses.</v>

3498
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:51.030
<v Speaker 3>The house can't be that close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates lives that close to his</v>

3499
02:40:51.031 --> 02:40:53.130
<v Speaker 3>fucking neighbors on the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

3500
02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

3501
02:40:54.391 --> 02:40:56.670
<v Speaker 3>That's a house right above him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably owns it to.</v>

3502
02:40:56.671 --> 02:40:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I would bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would bet he would own everything.</v>

3503
02:40:58.750 --> 02:41:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Anyone fill it up with mercenaries?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's worth too much money.</v>

3504
02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:06.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it keeps the music system.</v>

3505
02:41:06.721 --> 02:41:08.360
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did give a lot of money away.</v>

3506
02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:11.220
<v Speaker 3>There's a trampoline room with 20 foot</v>
<v Speaker 3>ceilings,</v>

3507
02:41:12.130 --> 02:41:13.710
<v Speaker 5>24 bathrooms.</v>

3508
02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:18.060
<v Speaker 3>He has a reception hall that can</v>
<v Speaker 3>accommodate 200 guests,</v>

3509
02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:20.680
<v Speaker 3>kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

3510
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:22.780
<v Speaker 3>enormous library.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's the manuscripts?</v>

3511
02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Gates paid more than $30,000,000 for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the manuscript?</v>

3512
02:41:27.971 --> 02:41:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Great Gatsby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3513
02:41:32.170 --> 02:41:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's it.</v>

3514
02:41:33.310 --> 02:41:35.290
<v Speaker 3>And so you'll find a quote from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

3515
02:41:35.350 --> 02:41:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the manuscript Codex license?</v>

3516
02:41:38.380 --> 02:41:40.420
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3517
02:41:40.421 --> 02:41:42.820
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 16th century?</v>

3518
02:41:43.130 --> 02:41:45.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a Davinci.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

3519
02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:48.410
<v Speaker 3>you paid $30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million Bucks for a leaner Davinci</v>

3520
02:41:48.430 --> 02:41:50.080
<v Speaker 3>sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go get that.</v>

3521
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Let's go find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3522
02:41:53.531 --> 02:41:55.600
<v Speaker 3>apparently that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was talking to this real estate</v>

3523
02:41:55.601 --> 02:41:59.290
<v Speaker 3>agent who told me that that is a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue with houses that are,</v>

3524
02:41:59.291 --> 02:42:00.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are listed,</v>

3525
02:42:00.850 --> 02:42:04.600
<v Speaker 3>that are expensive houses and they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>framed up meaning,</v>

3526
02:42:04.601 --> 02:42:05.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like inside you go in there,</v>

3527
02:42:05.890 --> 02:42:10.600
<v Speaker 3>everything's already like there's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice sheets and artwork on the walls and</v>

3528
02:42:10.630 --> 02:42:11.710
<v Speaker 3>staged is the right word.</v>

3529
02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:12.621
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>

3530
02:42:12.621 --> 02:42:14.770
<v Speaker 3>they have this artwork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of these houses,</v>

3531
02:42:14.771 --> 02:42:17.690
<v Speaker 3>like if it's expensive house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have expensive artwork and so</v>

3532
02:42:17.691 --> 02:42:20.290
<v Speaker 3>people break into these houses while</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that they're selling the house</v>

<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes,</v>

3574
02:44:02.071 --> 02:44:03.790
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be possible.</v>

3575
02:44:03.791 --> 02:44:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Or 28 days later zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might happen to.</v>

3576
02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had another.</v>

3577
02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:13.010
<v Speaker 3>The mosquitoes become even fiercer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just come and kill us all.</v>

3578
02:44:13.350 --> 02:44:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Where mercy came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Murcia Mrs. Say</v>

3579
02:44:20.490 --> 02:44:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Medical Medication resistant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Staph,</v>

3580
02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:28.600
<v Speaker 3>old cockup office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's essentially medication resistant,</v>

3581
02:44:28.811 --> 02:44:33.340
<v Speaker 3>staph infections that are ruthless that</v>
<v Speaker 3>tear through people and kill a ton of</v>

3582
02:44:33.341 --> 02:44:33.760
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3583
02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:37.520
<v Speaker 4>That's the campaign I was going to bring</v>
<v Speaker 4>this up when you're talking about the</v>

3584
02:44:37.570 --> 02:44:40.630
<v Speaker 4>mosquitoes earlier in China and like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>19 fifties,</v>

3585
02:44:40.930 --> 02:44:43.300
<v Speaker 4>they were having problems with a couple</v>
<v Speaker 4>of different paths,</v>

3586
02:44:43.301 --> 02:44:46.660
<v Speaker 4>mostly sparrows that said in this case</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were hundreds of millions of</v>

3587
02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:49.030
<v Speaker 4>sparrows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's a government mandate to try</v>

3588
02:44:49.031 --> 02:44:51.220
<v Speaker 4>to get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people were literally going outside</v>

3589
02:44:51.221 --> 02:44:54.700
<v Speaker 4>and banging on pans for hours at a time</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that they couldn't land and they</v>

3590
02:44:54.701 --> 02:44:58.990
<v Speaker 4>would die from exhaustion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exhaustion a 10 years later.</v>

3591
02:44:58.991 --> 02:45:01.710
<v Speaker 4>So there was a giant famine because</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3592
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:04.450
<v Speaker 4>all the pes were stopping eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3593
02:45:04.451 --> 02:45:06.640
<v Speaker 4>all the bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bugs start eating all their bamboo</v>

3594
02:45:06.641 --> 02:45:11.440
<v Speaker 4>and rice and $30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million people died in China from 19</v>

3595
02:45:11.441 --> 02:45:12.140
<v Speaker 4>six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

3596
02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:13.000
<v Speaker 4>God will not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did</v>

3597
02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:17.230
<v Speaker 3>have a butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can become the beginning of</v>

3598
02:45:19.460 --> 02:45:20.740
<v Speaker 3>really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3599
02:45:20.741 --> 02:45:21.940
<v Speaker 3>you can't mess with nature.</v>

3600
02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:22.381
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3601
02:45:22.381 --> 02:45:26.120
<v Speaker 4>on this mosquito thing that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>emergency they're doing in Florida,</v>

3602
02:45:26.121 --> 02:45:29.270
<v Speaker 4>they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the officials are asking to skip a field</v>

3603
02:45:29.271 --> 02:45:32.720
<v Speaker 4>trial and they want to just go right</v>
<v Speaker 4>into it and not not test these</v>

3604
02:45:32.721 --> 02:45:35.240
<v Speaker 4>mosquitoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but whatsoever besides like that could</v>

3605
02:45:35.241 --> 02:45:37.850
<v Speaker 4>be a bigger problem where if Congress</v>
<v Speaker 4>had funded,</v>

3606
02:45:38.210 --> 02:45:40.610
<v Speaker 4>had funded this a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would have</v>

3607
02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:43.050
<v Speaker 3>all those tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot of fucking people</v>

3608
02:45:43.051 --> 02:45:45.270
<v Speaker 3>getting the Zika virus and on top of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3609
02:45:45.271 --> 02:45:48.990
<v Speaker 3>the latest thing is that now they find</v>
<v Speaker 3>out that men who don't show any symptoms</v>

3610
02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:53.100
<v Speaker 3>can dismiss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can transmit the Zika virus</v>

3611
02:45:53.101 --> 02:45:54.180
<v Speaker 3>sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3612
02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:59.300
<v Speaker 3>So you could have no symptoms and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just drop a load on walls in some</v>

3613
02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:04.140
<v Speaker 3>portraits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A trial who we found no people.</v>

3614
02:46:04.490 --> 02:46:08.250
<v Speaker 3>The people I'm with a girl not yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>affect girls and Florida.</v>

3615
02:46:08.340 --> 02:46:11.300
<v Speaker 3>And apparently was another thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was an unlikely ally.</v>

3616
02:46:11.301 --> 02:46:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An unlikely ally of the Zika virus is</v>

3617
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:17.750
<v Speaker 3>high rise luxury condominiums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For some reason,</v>

3618
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:22.800
<v Speaker 3>high rise luxury condominiums make</v>
<v Speaker 3>excellent grounds for Zika viruses to</v>

3619
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:25.250
<v Speaker 3>start breeding live in the vents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3620
02:46:25.310 --> 02:46:27.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

3621
02:46:27.310 --> 02:46:30.500
<v Speaker 3>there's areas where the CDC is thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about roping them off and going,</v>

3622
02:46:30.501 --> 02:46:33.380
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to fucking property really well</v>

3623
02:46:33.381 --> 02:46:35.380
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the repercussions are the</v>

3624
02:46:35.460 --> 02:46:37.300
<v Speaker 3>repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the big ones?</v>

3625
02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:40.110
<v Speaker 3>Reproductive for women when they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

3626
02:46:40.111 --> 02:46:43.790
<v Speaker 3>The kids develop this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A horrible disorder with their heads.</v>

3627
02:46:43.850 --> 02:46:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3628
02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:50.720
<v Speaker 2>what if you could just like get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>balloon there and pull it up place?</v>

3629
02:46:51.690 --> 02:46:54.340
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zika is accidental ally.</v>

3630
02:46:54.341 --> 02:46:57.820
<v Speaker 3>Miami's luxury high rises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low flying planes,</v>

3631
02:46:57.850 --> 02:47:02.350
<v Speaker 3>urban wind tunnels and imprecise</v>
<v Speaker 3>applications raise the risk of</v>

3632
02:47:02.351 --> 02:47:04.750
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Developing Resistance to insects</v>

3633
02:47:04.780 --> 02:47:06.820
<v Speaker 2>decides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3634
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>

3635
02:47:09.311 --> 02:47:11.710
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just gives your baby's little heads.</v>

3636
02:47:12.610 --> 02:47:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Low flying planes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a wind issue.</v>

3637
02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Aerial spraying with ultra low volume</v>
<v Speaker 2>can only</v>

3638
02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:23.930
<v Speaker 3>come down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can only be done when there's not much</v>

3639
02:47:23.931 --> 02:47:28.931
<v Speaker 3>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the wind and then the probably the</v>

3640
02:47:29.451 --> 02:47:34.250
<v Speaker 3>high rises are in the way and so around</v>
<v Speaker 3>the high rises they can't spray</v>

3641
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:38.270
<v Speaker 2>and they can't get low enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoo.</v>

3642
02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:42.030
<v Speaker 2>You got to get in there with like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bubbles one.</v>

3643
02:47:42.090 --> 02:47:42.923
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3644
02:47:42.940 --> 02:47:45.760
<v Speaker 3>This is scary shit though because this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just one.</v>

3645
02:47:45.940 --> 02:47:47.400
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3646
02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:49.600
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to the CDC,</v>

3647
02:47:49.601 --> 02:47:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Duncan and I did for this episode of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scifi show.</v>

3648
02:47:52.130 --> 02:47:56.470
<v Speaker 3>We talked about um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weaponized diseases and they were pretty</v>

3649
02:47:56.471 --> 02:47:57.281
<v Speaker 3>frank about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

3650
02:47:57.281 --> 02:48:00.370
<v Speaker 3>we are not worried about someone coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>up with a disease.</v>

3651
02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:02.210
<v Speaker 3>We're worried about nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3652
02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Like no one has ever been able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>successfully come up with a disease.</v>

3653
02:48:05.141 --> 02:48:07.930
<v Speaker 3>And there's all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these fears and all these conspiracy</v>

3654
02:48:07.931 --> 02:48:10.420
<v Speaker 3>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you should really be terrified of</v>

3655
02:48:10.750 --> 02:48:14.200
<v Speaker 3>is just regular old nature taking a</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible disease.</v>

3656
02:48:14.201 --> 02:48:16.540
<v Speaker 3>And it becomes airborne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It mutates or changes.</v>

3657
02:48:16.750 --> 02:48:19.960
<v Speaker 3>And they do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they had Ebola.</v>

3658
02:48:20.110 --> 02:48:24.060
<v Speaker 3>They had all these crazy diseases locked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in this lab where they had like these</v>

3659
02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:28.510
<v Speaker 3>four foot cars and giant glass windows</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looked through and everyone,</v>

3660
02:48:28.511 --> 02:48:32.530
<v Speaker 3>they spacesuits on their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attached over these exhaust vents,</v>

3661
02:48:32.930 --> 02:48:34.870
<v Speaker 3>walking around with vacuum tubes hanging</v>
<v Speaker 3>off of him.</v>

3662
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:36.790
<v Speaker 3>It was really creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3663
02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Inside anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3664
02:48:38.081 --> 02:48:39.760
<v Speaker 3>just one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one little sample of anything.</v>

3665
02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:43.000
<v Speaker 3>And these are hurricane proof buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the buildings designed because it's</v>

3666
02:48:43.001 --> 02:48:45.180
<v Speaker 3>right in Galveston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's near the gun.</v>

3667
02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:48.490
<v Speaker 3>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these buildings are designed to impact,</v>

3668
02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:52.180
<v Speaker 3>get impacted by gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 foot waves and shit and survive and</v>

3669
02:48:52.181 --> 02:48:55.350
<v Speaker 3>keep all the bacteria and tack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are they saving this stuff where</v>

3670
02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:56.680
<v Speaker 3>they want to study it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to trigger,</v>

3671
02:48:56.750 --> 02:49:00.890
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to solve it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they figure if they keep studying,</v>

3672
02:49:00.910 --> 02:49:04.210
<v Speaker 3>it might be able to find different ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep it from killing all of us.</v>

3673
02:49:04.750 --> 02:49:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Papa.</v>

3674
02:49:06.700 --> 02:49:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Just take malaria medications.</v>

3675
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:10.730
<v Speaker 1>The dreams are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3676
02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:11.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3677
02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:13.350
<v Speaker 1>So clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not just that malaria</v>

3678
02:49:13.351 --> 02:49:14.850
<v Speaker 1>medication doesn't work against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zika.</v>

3679
02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:16.650
<v Speaker 1>They don't have Zika medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Fuck?</v>

3680
02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Well those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad Advice.</v>

3681
02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:20.790
<v Speaker 1>What about Ebola?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again?</v>

3682
02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Malaria medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can dream that you have,</v>

3683
02:49:25.050 --> 02:49:27.960
<v Speaker 1>you taken the dreams are so vivid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe you're actually don't have</v>

3684
02:49:27.961 --> 02:49:29.040
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the placebo effect.</v>

3685
02:49:30.490 --> 02:49:34.400
<v Speaker 4>When I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was in the Africa with my,</v>

3686
02:49:34.401 --> 02:49:37.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't say like that when I was in my</v>

3687
02:49:37.970 --> 02:49:39.450
<v Speaker 4>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Africa,</v>

3688
02:49:40.250 --> 02:49:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Africa in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

3689
02:49:44.301 --> 02:49:45.830
<v Speaker 4>the malaria medication gives you a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little,</v>

3690
02:49:45.831 --> 02:49:48.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upset sometimes or you shit yourself.</v>

3691
02:49:48.890 --> 02:49:51.140
<v Speaker 4>So when we were stopping through one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those little towns where I said I was</v>

3692
02:49:51.141 --> 02:49:54.770
<v Speaker 4>all paranoid and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to go use a restroom.</v>

3693
02:49:55.070 --> 02:50:00.070
<v Speaker 4>Was it a hole in the ground now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost a pretty much you kind of like a</v>

3694
02:50:00.561 --> 02:50:04.700
<v Speaker 4>Porta potty kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as you go running in this a little</v>

<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white tea man should be the cover.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How much time did you spend there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten days.</v>

3736
02:51:49.230 --> 02:51:51.300
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a right number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was perfect</v>

3737
02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:53.890
<v Speaker 4>because your,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's far.</v>

3739
02:51:56.660 --> 02:51:58.540
<v Speaker 4>Twenty four hours of travel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

<v Speaker 1>York</v>

3744
02:52:06.250 --> 02:52:11.250
<v Speaker 3>from here it's like a 11 hour flight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you switch and then it's another</v>

3745
02:52:12.220 --> 02:52:16.720
<v Speaker 3>eight to nine hours to Kilimanjaro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got to get a puddle jumper</v>

3746
02:52:16.721 --> 02:52:19.420
<v Speaker 3>and get into the Serengeti,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We were thinking about just staying in</v>

3758
02:52:43.151 --> 02:52:45.250
<v Speaker 3>one place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we fucking mix it up.</v>

02:52:45.340 --> 02:52:48.040
<v Speaker 3>It was the right move was a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

3761
02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>can't even believe it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3763
02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:56.470
<v Speaker 3>so pretty and so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even seem real or just and</v>

3764
02:52:56.471 --> 02:53:00.670
<v Speaker 3>then Rome is just the artwork and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vatican alone is worth the trip.</v>

3765
02:53:00.910 --> 02:53:04.000
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I love about Rome too is that it's</v>

3766
02:53:04.001 --> 02:53:08.440
<v Speaker 3>still have a vibrant city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so old and so much change in</v>

3767
02:53:08.441 --> 02:53:11.230
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a young hip city.</v>

3768
02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:14.890
<v Speaker 3>People are working hard and doing stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>where like you go to Florence and places</v>

3769
02:53:14.891 --> 02:53:16.330
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's beautiful,</v>

3770
02:53:16.331 --> 02:53:19.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's kind of like a museum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young people aren't going to make it</v>

3771
02:53:19.960 --> 02:53:21.030
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3772
02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:24.760
<v Speaker 3>they are in room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another thing that I felt was crazy was</v>

3773
02:53:24.761 --> 02:53:28.240
<v Speaker 3>that the Vatican is its own country with</v>
<v Speaker 3>its own rules.</v>

3774
02:53:28.241 --> 02:53:31.780
<v Speaker 3>That's why the pope's all stay there</v>
<v Speaker 3>after they leave because otherwise they</v>

3775
02:53:31.781 --> 02:53:33.220
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Pope Benedict,</v>

3776
02:53:33.250 --> 02:53:37.000
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to try him for crimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>against humanity and he's being shielded</v>

3777
02:53:37.001 --> 02:53:37.870
<v Speaker 3>by the Vatican.</v>

3778
02:53:38.110 --> 02:53:40.210
<v Speaker 3>This company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's countries rather that are</v>

3779
02:53:40.570 --> 02:53:45.430
<v Speaker 3>actively trying to extract him like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying with legal action to get</v>

3780
02:53:45.431 --> 02:53:47.890
<v Speaker 3>him out of the Vatican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try Him.</v>

3781
02:53:48.210 --> 02:53:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Because the last pope was a really bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

3782
02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I know you know the whole shielding</v>
<v Speaker 3>child molesters.</v>

3783
02:53:55.711 --> 02:53:58.810
<v Speaker 3>I went onto rape deaf kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a big part of all that.</v>

3784
02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:03.190
<v Speaker 3>He was one of those cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just allegedly one of the key guys</v>

3785
02:54:03.550 --> 02:54:06.790
<v Speaker 3>when it came to relocating child</v>
<v Speaker 3>molesters where they would.</v>

3786
02:54:07.150 --> 02:54:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the new kid and a lot of the</v>

3787
02:54:08.921 --> 02:54:09.760
<v Speaker 3>people around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3788
02:54:09.970 --> 02:54:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there ever been an organization</v>

3789
02:54:12.221 --> 02:54:15.550
<v Speaker 3>that's fucked as many kids as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic Church didn't?</v>

3790
02:54:15.610 --> 02:54:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't there a party that kind of felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the Vatican like this is obscene?</v>

3791
02:54:19.810 --> 02:54:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3792
02:54:20.890 --> 02:54:21.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3793
02:54:21.441 --> 02:54:22.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3794
02:54:22.270 --> 02:54:27.010
<v Speaker 3>it's human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's human creativity and human ambition</v>

3795
02:54:27.370 --> 02:54:31.750
<v Speaker 3>and human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This overwhelming desire to create</v>

3796
02:54:31.751 --> 02:54:35.890
<v Speaker 3>someone something magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some these massive fucking temples,</v>

3797
02:54:36.340 --> 02:54:38.770
<v Speaker 3>these enormous cathedrals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3798
02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:41.380
<v Speaker 3>like St Peter's Basilica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wander around,</v>

3799
02:54:41.381 --> 02:54:45.340
<v Speaker 3>they like this took how long have years</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make hundreds.</v>

3800
02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:47.200
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

3801
02:54:47.201 --> 02:54:52.201
<v Speaker 3>But it's also that same psychotic</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior that make someone create</v>

3802
02:54:52.331 --> 02:54:57.331
<v Speaker 3>something like that is also responsible</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all these bizarre behavior traits</v>

3803
02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:01.810
<v Speaker 3>that suppressive people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>those sort of situations.</v>

3804
02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Press people and what's the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between</v>

3805
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:06.690
<v Speaker 4>the people that are creating it and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are paying for it to be</v>

3806
02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:11.090
<v Speaker 4>those people that were just went in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>took countries over and slaughtered</v>

3807
02:55:11.091 --> 02:55:12.860
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very similar to what we were</v>

3808
02:55:12.861 --> 02:55:15.650
<v Speaker 4>talking about with the native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so weird there time</v>

3809
02:55:15.750 --> 02:55:17.850
<v Speaker 3>that no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit's even in the Bible that you</v>

3810
02:55:17.851 --> 02:55:20.700
<v Speaker 3>have to have a pope right this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll make that up.</v>

3811
02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:23.520
<v Speaker 3>That's a completely made up thing by</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

3812
02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:26.840
<v Speaker 4>That's the hardest part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you go to Rome and you start trade,</v>

3813
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:30.170
<v Speaker 4>there was a place is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget the name of it,</v>

3814
02:55:30.171 --> 02:55:34.100
<v Speaker 4>but it has a church and active church</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you can site so you can go</v>

3815
02:55:34.101 --> 02:55:37.640
<v Speaker 4>below.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a really old church that you</v>

3816
02:55:37.641 --> 02:55:38.900
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just things you know in Rome,</v>

3817
02:55:38.930 --> 02:55:40.760
<v Speaker 4>things just set on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just build on top,</v>

3818
02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:45.770
<v Speaker 4>so it's this active church than</v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath a really old church and below</v>

3819
02:55:45.771 --> 02:55:50.771
<v Speaker 4>that way in the way underground is this</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pagan Temple and they weren't worshiping</v>

3820
02:55:52.761 --> 02:55:55.610
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were worshiping these strange pagan</v>

3821
02:55:55.611 --> 02:56:00.611
<v Speaker 4>gods and you just see this was just man</v>
<v Speaker 4>interpreting this feeling and using it</v>

3822
02:56:01.641 --> 02:56:05.030
<v Speaker 4>for their advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever at a pagan level to this level</v>

3823
02:56:05.031 --> 02:56:08.480
<v Speaker 4>to today it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about Rome is like if you</v>

3824
02:56:08.481 --> 02:56:13.190
<v Speaker 4>go in there wanting to hold onto your</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian beliefs or any of that stuff</v>

3825
02:56:13.191 --> 02:56:16.430
<v Speaker 4>and you look at the history like</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally right there in the landscape</v>

3826
02:56:16.431 --> 02:56:20.750
<v Speaker 4>that this has just come from us trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure stuff out as there's no one</v>

3827
02:56:20.751 --> 02:56:21.600
<v Speaker 4>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3828
02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:24.980
<v Speaker 4>It breaks all that down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you can withstand it</v>

3829
02:56:24.981 --> 02:56:26.540
<v Speaker 4>without just pure faith.</v>

3830
02:56:26.690 --> 02:56:28.400
<v Speaker 3>They just put blinders on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3831
02:56:28.590 --> 02:56:32.600
<v Speaker 3>That mean it's the enemy that faith is</v>
<v Speaker 3>without a doubt the enemy of objective</v>

3832
02:56:32.601 --> 02:56:35.270
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really have to have faith in order to</v>

3833
02:56:35.271 --> 02:56:38.180
<v Speaker 3>buy into a lot of these stories and once</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have faith,</v>

3834
02:56:38.181 --> 02:56:39.950
<v Speaker 3>you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the team no matter what.</v>

3835
02:56:40.610 --> 02:56:43.490
<v Speaker 3>No matter what Hillary did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am on the team.</v>

3836
02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:46.220
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You being a loyal Democrat,</v>

3837
02:56:46.221 --> 02:56:49.400
<v Speaker 3>being a loyal Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a fucking loyal Mac user,</v>

3838
02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:52.550
<v Speaker 3>being a religious nut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of it is the same thing.</v>

3839
02:56:52.551 --> 02:56:57.551
<v Speaker 3>It's like this desire to just settled on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3840
02:56:57.861 --> 02:56:59.750
<v Speaker 3>I identify with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm locked in.</v>

3841
02:56:59.940 --> 02:57:01.860
<v Speaker 4>It's comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel like you belong.</v>

3842
02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:04.500
<v Speaker 4>If this is a right way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to think about this stuff.</v>

3843
02:57:04.501 --> 02:57:06.330
<v Speaker 4>They're going to do that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

3844
02:57:06.650 --> 02:57:09.680
<v Speaker 3>That's why that pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the football player should have just</v>

3845
02:57:09.681 --> 02:57:12.860
<v Speaker 3>stood up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put your hand over your heart,</v>

3846
02:57:12.861 --> 02:57:16.100
<v Speaker 3>Pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hear all this black</v>

3847
02:57:16.101 --> 02:57:20.840
<v Speaker 3>lives matter bullshit about equality and</v>
<v Speaker 3>put your hand over your hair,</v>

3848
02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:21.950
<v Speaker 3>your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

3849
02:57:21.951 --> 02:57:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be a quarterback.</v>

3850
02:57:25.011 --> 02:57:26.990
<v Speaker 3>You act like quarterback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to this American.</v>

3851
02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:29.480
<v Speaker 3>You want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to play soccer?</v>

3852
02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:31.340
<v Speaker 3>We won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to play cricket?</v>

3853
02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Like how about you go play cricket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get yourself some freedom,</v>

3854
02:57:36.201 --> 02:57:38.270
<v Speaker 3>fries and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

3855
02:57:38.540 --> 02:57:40.310
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get in this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta to get out of here.</v>

3856
02:57:40.490 --> 02:57:41.323
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Papa.</v>

3857
02:57:41.450 --> 02:57:43.220
<v Speaker 3>I always enjoy talking with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend.</v>

3858
02:57:43.300 --> 02:57:46.300
<v Speaker 4>I love coming by man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to say when I was out there on</v>

3859
02:57:46.301 --> 02:57:47.460
<v Speaker 4>Safari,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3860
02:57:47.530 --> 02:57:51.130
<v Speaker 4>cruising around for all this time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought about you often.</v>

3861
02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:53.980
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would love to see.</v>

3862
02:57:54.010 --> 02:57:56.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean just animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating animals anytime.</v>

3863
02:57:56.440 --> 02:57:59.800
<v Speaker 4>Something like extreme it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's controlled and your family</v>

3864
02:57:59.801 --> 02:58:01.500
<v Speaker 4>would be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't recommend enough.</v>

3865
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:04.890
<v Speaker 3>They're too young right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a couple of taking medication,</v>

3866
02:58:04.891 --> 02:58:06.810
<v Speaker 3>but I think the older I think I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to definitely do it.</v>

3867
02:58:06.980 --> 02:58:09.510
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it seems like something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that should be done,</v>

3868
02:58:09.870 --> 02:58:11.880
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Vatican was something that after</v>

3869
02:58:11.881 --> 02:58:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took a long time to get there and all</v>

3870
02:58:13.711 --> 02:58:14.520
<v Speaker 3>that jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

3871
02:58:14.520 --> 02:58:16.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I needed to see that.</v>

3872
02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:18.090
<v Speaker 3>When you get home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you bring your family?</v>

3873
02:58:18.450 --> 02:58:20.340
<v Speaker 3>When you get home?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you feel like,</v>

3874
02:58:20.700 --> 02:58:22.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>

3875
