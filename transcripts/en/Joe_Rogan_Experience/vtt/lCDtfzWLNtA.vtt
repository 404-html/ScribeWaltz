<v Speaker 1>Drive by day,</v>

2
00:00:01.091 --> 00:00:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It's that and then the next paper view is Holly Holm versus Germane Jermaine</v>

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.383
<v Speaker 1>Durand Domain,</v>

5
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.223
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

6
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.403
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough sell,</v>

7
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.403
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good site.</v>

9
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I would buy it as a hardcore Farron,</v>

10
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy it for sure.</v>

11
00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

12
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And we'll probably,</v>

13
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.710
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line,</v>

14
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>a hundred a hundred thousand people.</v>

15
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:23.344
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

16
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.180

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

18
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>It ain't gon be Connor Mcgregor numbers.</v>

19
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

20
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Bottom line.</v>

21
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Connor when she lost it and I'm sure he likes Rhonda by,</v>

22
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>but business wise he's like excellent.</v>

23
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

24
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

25
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:40.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky situation now with the marketing campaign,</v>

28
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>the dumb yet WME WME put together for this.</v>

29
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:49.291
<v Speaker 1>That was so Rhonda heavy and then Rhonda gets smashed and now what are you going</v>

30
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 1>to do for what you're going to like the girl who smashed Rhonda,</v>

31
00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>is that what Amanda gets for her next title fight?</v>

32
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 1>You do a press tour.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Piggy back on Ronda again.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>she sort of retired two legends in the sport.</v>

43
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why she's my fighter of the year.</v>

44
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.410
<v Speaker 1>She retired and then she retired.</v>

45
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda if Rhonda retires,</v>

46
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.921
<v Speaker 1>that's huge.</v>

47
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.441
<v Speaker 1>She retired.</v>

48
00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Both of them.</v>

49
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden Amanda is Nate Diaz.</v>

50
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Did you see cat Zingano posted on Instagram that Amanda blocked her cause cats</v>

51
00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:26.800

52
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>stopped Amanda and Amanda was a hurting cats and gone old bad in the first</v>

53
00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:32.381
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

54
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:32.941
<v Speaker 1>Real bad.</v>

55
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:34.570
<v Speaker 1>A cat was in big fucking trouble,</v>

56
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>but she survived and went on to stop.</v>

57
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Amanda and I love cat but I'll,</v>

58
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll uh,</v>

60
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking Amanda could do is like,</v>

61
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>you lost the chick I just beat and 17 seconds with will,</v>

62
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but she got caught in an arm bar.</v>

63
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

64
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>how did Amanda lose the fight?</v>

65
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

66
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.371
<v Speaker 1>She beat her down.</v>

67
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:49.600
<v Speaker 1>She beat her down in the third round.</v>

68
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Cat got on top and started blasting her and she kind of gas.</v>

69
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

70
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Well she kinda gas but it was,</v>

71
00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:55.390
<v Speaker 1>pat is ferocious.</v>

72
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Castlemont's Amanda,</v>

73
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you don't that fucking scream.</v>

74
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>This is a recording of Cat Zingano screaming after she won that fight and it's</v>

75
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>so primal,</v>

76
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:07.991
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

77
00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like an animal screen.</v>

78
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I think you played it before on the podcast because it was,</v>

79
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.041
<v Speaker 1>it was like punch.</v>

80
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:13.421
<v Speaker 1>You did it.</v>

81
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

82
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.583

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.450

88
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>But that's after all that darkness.</v>

89
00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>She dealt with it.</v>

90
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Her husband committed suicide and just all this diabetes was that.</v>

91
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.350
<v Speaker 1>That was after that is.</v>

92
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 1>That was the virus afterwards.</v>

93
00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It was the play that again,</v>

94
00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>but to answer your question from before,</v>

100
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>not to interrupt you.</v>

101
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>This sitting on a fucking gold,</v>

102
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>William Morris.</v>

103
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Now with this fuck of the man that Nunez.</v>

105
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>she's probably the LBGT community.</v>

106
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Jack [inaudible] fucking pockets.</v>

107
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.040

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

109
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Pocket Ltg.</v>

110
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's Lbgtq a.</v>

111
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Now listen,</v>

112
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.063
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

113
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>What does that got to keep up lesbians,</v>

114
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.360
<v Speaker 1>gays,</v>

115
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>while the old picture of music,</v>

116
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to change a lottery ticket.</v>

117
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>They just hit the fucking lottery thing.</v>

118
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>ASEXUALS are in there today and Liz Carmouche before that,</v>

119
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.123
<v Speaker 1>but it looks,</v>

120
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>she was still fit outs,</v>

121
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>but Liz Carmouche wasn't the champion work.</v>

122
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:33.801
<v Speaker 1>Once you're the chair,</v>

123
00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>she's the champion.</v>

124
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:35.471
<v Speaker 1>Press everything.</v>

125
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>And when Liz Carmouche fought Ronda,</v>

126
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>she fought her at the first fight when no one knew who Ronda was.</v>

127
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>So Rhonda has all this hype behind her.</v>

128
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>She wins that fight and then goes on.</v>

129
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.221
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

130
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Liz has done well in the UFC,</v>

131
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:48.380
<v Speaker 1>but having that it does,</v>

132
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same.</v>

133
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.420
<v Speaker 1>My manager,</v>

134
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>she has her victor,</v>

135
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.441
<v Speaker 1>she's awesome.</v>

136
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.274
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen her fight?</v>

137
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Tony?</v>

138
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Ebinger very tough.</v>

139
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she is bad ass.</v>

140
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>He's an eviction.</v>

141
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Super tough.</v>

142
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.004
<v Speaker 1>She's really good.</v>

143
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>And she's opened the gay too.</v>

144
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And what way does she,</v>

145
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>she's hilarious man.</v>

146
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.124
<v Speaker 1>I love that chick.</v>

147
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

148
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>she's like one 35,</v>

149
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>one 35 one 45.</v>

150
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>She's good man.</v>

151
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be more,</v>

152
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

153
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing we were talking about like when Anderson was in his prime,</v>

154
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>when he was just a light and people on fire,</v>

155
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>the division was like,</v>

156
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.241
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't,</v>

157
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:19.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.901
<v Speaker 1>you had to like a,</v>

159
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Patrick Otay had a couple of fights for the title Talus latest.</v>

160
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

161
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.873
<v Speaker 1>there's no one,</v>

162
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

163
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>well rich Franklin was the champ,</v>

164
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but there's no overwhelming need to see that fight.</v>

165
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.171
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

166
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to see the fight,</v>

167
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:33.881
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm interested in,</v>

168
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>see Patrick's got a great chin,</v>

169
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>he's got power.</v>

170
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what happens.</v>

171
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>But it's not like,</v>

172
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.891
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

173
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>here's the next one.</v>

174
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like Cody Garbrandt fight and Dominick Cruz,</v>

175
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>

176
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.881
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

177
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:44.130
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happens here.</v>

178
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>There was no one like that for Anderson for a long ass time.</v>

179
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think in the women's Bantam Weight Division,</v>

180
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you've got to kind of similar situation.</v>

181
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like,</v>

182
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>now you have Amanda Nunez who beats the shit out of me.</v>

183
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Hsa me is going a step back.</v>

184
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>She's gone now.</v>

185
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 1>She beats the shit out of,</v>

186
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda.</v>

188
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda steps back.</v>

189
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Holly goes up to one 45 change remainder random man,</v>

190
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 1>you got to change that shit.</v>

191
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

192
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Why not have a man to fight for both belts</v>

193
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>to save that card?</v>

194
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

195
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean it make some moves cause,</v>

196
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Speaker 1>cause if you've seen the car window,</v>

197
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.770
<v Speaker 1>the cop or man Holly's are prominent card.</v>

198
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>How is the headliner?</v>

199
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.681
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

200
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Holly's fighting Germane to random me for the one 45 pounds.</v>

201
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I thought they should give Jermaine Demand Jamais thousand dollars that she does</v>

202
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.320
<v Speaker 1>already beat her by the way they need it.</v>

203
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 1>None of beat.</v>

204
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Who I thought Nunez Nunez already beat Jorin Jemaine Duran.</v>

205
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

206
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>she beat her in the UFC.</v>

207
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Jermaine is a wicked kid.</v>

209
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Kickboxer her.</v>

210
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>She's a world world class.</v>

211
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Multiple time world champion.</v>

212
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Kickboxer I think she's,</v>

213
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I think she won the Moitai world.</v>

214
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] title several occasions.</v>

215
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:51.860
<v Speaker 1>She's like really elite as a more time for fun.</v>

216
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>But they'd gloves stand up,</v>

217
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.683
<v Speaker 1>always stand up.</v>

218
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>There's no ground.</v>

219
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>As soon as she got in the UFC,</v>

220
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:03.551
<v Speaker 1>you could see like that transition between learning the striking with a,</v>

221
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:04.191
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

222
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>with take downs versus just fighting to kickbox about.</v>

223
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a big transition.</v>

224
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Takes time.</v>

225
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

226
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.883
<v Speaker 1>But you're also going,</v>

227
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>people aren't going to give you the time.</v>

228
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.931
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

229
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:14.970
<v Speaker 1>They're just fucking shooting in our beating her up and taking her down and it's</v>

230
00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

231
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.650
<v Speaker 1>it's just a different sport.</v>

232
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>I thought the card was pretty good.</v>

233
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:19.221
<v Speaker 1>It's in Brooklyn.</v>

234
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

235
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Travis Browne is fight.</v>

236
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Derrick Lewis.</v>

237
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.450
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting fight.</v>

238
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.601
<v Speaker 1>But what's,</v>

239
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:23.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:24.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

241
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:24.730
<v Speaker 1>what is true,</v>

242
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>where's Travis Travis's head out right now?</v>

243
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>He's trained the same camp,</v>

244
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 1>isn't he?</v>

245
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

246
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

247
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Travis.</v>

248
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

249
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holm versus Amanda Nunez.</v>

250
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the fight right there.</v>

251
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

252
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

253
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I think at one 35 nights a fucking should do that at this.</v>

254
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

255
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>for this card.</v>

256
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.301
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

257
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:38.631
<v Speaker 1>Make it,</v>

258
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 1>make a man of the two belt champion.</v>

259
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to remember the Valentina Shevchenko just beat Holly and has</v>

260
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>come off 10 losses.</v>

261
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

262
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>And Valentino beat her up.</v>

263
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:49.424
<v Speaker 1>Stand up.</v>

264
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.543
<v Speaker 1>Right Hook.</v>

265
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.463
<v Speaker 1>Fold</v>

266
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.450
<v Speaker 1>those two together.</v>

267
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

268
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 1>They need help with this car.</v>

269
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 1>The problem is most people,</v>

270
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>even though Valentino one,</v>

271
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>they don't know who she is yet,</v>

272
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>even though she won,</v>

273
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean she needs a few more victories inside the UFC in order to get people</v>

274
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:04.480
<v Speaker 1>excited.</v>

275
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Paper view this paper.</v>

276
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

277
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>

278
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.360
<v Speaker 1>The only reason people know Holly too is they don't know the her past losses</v>

279
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

280
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.590
<v Speaker 1>They granted her flight was on Fox,</v>

281
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 1>but all they knows she's the girl that knocked out Rhonda.</v>

282
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:15.194
<v Speaker 1>That's what selling is.</v>

283
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Heady,</v>

284
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

285
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>You trying to say that this isn't going to get you last 60 bucks.</v>

286
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that I will illegally stream it.</v>

287
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Last one,</v>

288
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez just fought for 45 seconds.</v>

289
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.484
<v Speaker 1>She's fresh.</v>

290
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Have her headline that car.</v>

291
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.591
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>

292
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:28.560
<v Speaker 1>let's build her up with,</v>

293
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.053
<v Speaker 1>where's the fire?</v>

294
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Where's the fire?</v>

295
00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that the Superbowl card?</v>

296
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

297
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.730

<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

299
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.311
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

300
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

301
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.523
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

302
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.210
<v Speaker 1>that's February saying no,</v>

303
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.401
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

304
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Super Bowl weekend is in Houston.</v>

305
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.883
<v Speaker 1>All different card.</v>

306
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:43.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

307
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 1>it is?</v>

308
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

309
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 1>totally change in one.</v>

310
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have that card locked up either,</v>

311
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

312
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I think there's still moving fights around for that Brooklyn Card because I</v>

313
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:53.680
<v Speaker 1>think they recognize that that did need a little bit more juice on that</v>

314
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>card and Vegas this year.</v>

315
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.381
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

316
00:07:57.381 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not finished.</v>

317
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It's in Houston this year.</v>

318
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And the soup bowls and Hughes.</v>

319
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.461
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

320
00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

321
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Or is it new bronc Houston or Dallas?</v>

322
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was Dallas is a Houston,</v>

323
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.403
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>

324
