00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>The general experience,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the crazy eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember Crazy Eddie?</v>

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>When he was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His prices are insane.</v>

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie did tell anybody who crazy.</v>

5
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy that had stores in all five</v>

6
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>boroughs of New York wholesale outlets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tvs,</v>

7
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>stereos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tvs and everything like that.</v>

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching them.</v>

9
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker 1>SNBC greed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a series called grace given</v>

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me hear this motherfucker.</v>

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Anything and everything and hold letter</v>
<v Speaker 2>came in.</v>

12
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Remember we are not under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will not be undersold and we made it</v>

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.850
<v Speaker 2>pretty frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now</v>

14
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>he's wearing a Santa Claus outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going fucking crazy with fake snow</v>

15
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

16
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he like hit it out of the park.</v>

17
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he go to Israel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to high,</v>

18
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>but the most brilliant thing he did was</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took it either.</v>

19
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking check fact me on this.</v>

20
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>He took it either his nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son in law,</v>

21
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>somebody that he was related to blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them through college so he could get</v>

22
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:23.701
<v Speaker 1>a job at the irs so they could figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to rob from the irs.</v>

23
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>This is how fucking insane this guy was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching this diet and how they got</v>

24
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>crazy crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie fled after he started just buying</v>

25
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how you met me years ago,</v>

26
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>you would be driving in New York and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some guy selling stereo</v>

27
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd take them home and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>two bricks.</v>

29
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he did the same thing to investors.</v>

30
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.490
<v Speaker 1>He took boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled them up with bricks and just</v>

31
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>stuck them in a warehouse and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>went public.</v>

32
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 1>So he got everybody to come down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all his inventory and all these</v>

33
00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>fact checkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're checking boxes as a bricks and</v>

34
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had five fucking warehouses all</v>

35
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.230
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will all fake and he got all this</v>

36
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:11.310
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fled to Israel and he fled for a</v>

37
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:13.090
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they knew he was a pussy hound.</v>

38
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they got them like Escobar style,</v>

39
00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:18.091
<v Speaker 1>they got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

40
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the phone like I'm going to a store</v>

41
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they did was they put a blonde</v>

42
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:28.501
<v Speaker 1>on the side of the road with a miniskirt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they knew eventually he would drive</v>

43
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:33.571
<v Speaker 1>by and stopped and he stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they nailed them.</v>

44
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.530
<v Speaker 1>What is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you google the with the richest</v>

45
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 1>woman in the world where they got their</v>
<v Speaker 1>money from?</v>

46
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.440
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paramus syosset,</v>

47
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Long Island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had commercials.</v>

48
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.510
<v Speaker 1>He was the first one that pushed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial barrier.</v>

49
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would like to look at how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left</v>

50
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 3>will attack others for not being</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive enough,</v>

51
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 3>not being left enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's a panic,</v>

52
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said this is the kind of behavior</v>

53
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 3>you see in a panic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a moral panic for example.</v>

54
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 3>And so helen and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the third person who worked on the</v>

55
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 3>project with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Helen and I wrote an essay about a year</v>

56
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 3>and a half ago and talking about how the</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremism on both sides is really the</v>

57
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 3>problem and most people reject it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And should fight it.</v>

58
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Most of us are sensible people in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle who hate this.</v>

59
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>data just came out showing that it's 80</v>

60
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 3>percent of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fringes,</v>

61
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 3>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

62
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 3>and only eight percent are on the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>and 12 percent are on the right of the</v>

63
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 3>fringe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However that works out.</v>

64
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 3>And so we wrote this thing and we said</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what's going on?</v>

65
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 3>Actually we called it an existential</v>
<v Speaker 3>polarization.</v>

66
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.850
<v Speaker 3>So you have this idea that everything's</v>
<v Speaker 3>an existential crisis.</v>

67
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 3>So the far right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll start with them,</v>

68
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 3>sees that if the Democrats get power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

69
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 3>it's open borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The terrorists are coming in.</v>

70
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Our entire way of life is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed.</v>

71
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe,</v>

72
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Ono,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judith Butler's,</v>

73
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 3>you mean 95 genders?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quick Stop the Democrats no matter what.</v>

74
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 3>And then you have the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

75
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 3>if they get power that everything's</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna,</v>

76
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 3>be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be beating gays in the</v>

77
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 3>snow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to just be the worst thing.</v>

78
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.510
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually kind of a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

79
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for real though,</v>

80
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 3>that they think that the world is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fall apart.</v>

81
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 3>If the other side gets power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when you have that kind of a</v>

82
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a panic and you see the</v>

83
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 3>slightest bit of advantage happening on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side is just something to</v>

84
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 3>completely freak out about.</v>

85
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 3>And then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

86
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 3>oh well the only possible recipe to</v>
<v Speaker 3>balance the scales to turn further our</v>

87
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we go toward the middle,</v>

88
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 3>that puts the balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say if the right goes really far right,</v>

89
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 3>and we on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved toward the middle.</v>

90
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Now the whole balance is moved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

91
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 3>So the only way to keep the balance</v>
<v Speaker 3>close to the middle is if they go right,</v>

92
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:49.760
<v Speaker 3>we go left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

93
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then that's going to keep the</v>

94
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 3>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what that actually does is it.</v>

95
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 3>This is going to get nerdy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hang on.</v>

96
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 3>That actually puts all of the weight on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outsides and you think about a</v>

97
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 3>spinning thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

98
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 3>It's got centrifical forces happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that trying to do is going to rip</v>

99
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 3>the spinning thing apart?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

100
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Speaker 3>if you have all the weight crammed in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle,</v>

101
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 3>it's like wheel.</v>

102
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't come apart right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you had like two billiard</v>

103
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 3>balls and you have like this big long</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick and there's two holes for the</v>

104
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 3>builder bars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't go in it like locked in</v>

105
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:18.634
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sitting there.</v>

106
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 3>You spend that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going to happen there?</v>

107
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Fly Right off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

108
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 3>So if you have all the weight on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside and you start spinning a thing.</v>

109
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:25.400
<v Speaker 3>So that's like the political</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>

110
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 3>That dynamic is going to rip the thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>apart.</v>

111
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 3>The more weight gets to the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one side go into the fringe doesn't</v>

112
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 3>mean the other side should go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fringe.</v>

113
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 3>That's how you a nation apart.</v>

114
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.883
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

115
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.250
<v Speaker 4>I pass out to 30 hits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2:30 in the morning hits and I'm just,</v>

116
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wake up because I hear the alarm,</v>

117
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of pop off at the,</v>

118
00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 4>at the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm hearing these alarms starting</v>

119
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 4>to go off and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.680
<v Speaker 4>I checked out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I checked out on front,</v>

121
00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:54.440
<v Speaker 4>I checked out through the window and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>check the lobby.</v>

122
00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:55.460
<v Speaker 4>Nobody was moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

123
00:05:55.461 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 4>it's a false alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I got the pillow put over my head and</v>

124
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 4>every can slept through the alarm and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happened about 2:30.</v>

125
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Now 4:30 comes about on this time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't wake up,</v>

126
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't wake up because of the alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wake up because of the smoke.</v>

127
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm like coughing on my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like coughing on the smug.</v>

128
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 4>And at first I thought I was dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I wake up and I,</v>

129
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 4>at that time I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had uh,</v>

130
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 4>I slept in my town.</v>

131
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 4>I taught tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was and I got up and then we'll go to</v>

132
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:23.520
<v Speaker 4>turn the lights and the lights turning</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and then I go through the window and</v>

133
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.600
<v Speaker 4>check the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And next,</v>

134
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see the car right in front of me on</v>

135
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:28.020
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

136
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 4>three fourths of the hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was probably about five rooms</v>

137
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 4>away from getting hit hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm talking about like,</v>

138
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 4>like fire coming out the window like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

139
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 4>And I'm waking up to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like thinking I'm dreaming,</v>

140
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a towel.</v>

141
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 4>And then the lights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything was dark,</v>

142
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 4>but I could see everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the room started getting hot and I</v>

143
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't hold my breath.</v>

144
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.560
<v Speaker 4>The more I started looking for my shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't find my shoes and I,</v>

145
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 4>I bumped into my slacks that I let them</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the ironing board that the night</v>

146
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 4>before and I put them on and I grabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grabbed the,</v>

147
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 4>I grabbed my phone and I jumped out the</v>
<v Speaker 4>window.</v>

148
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.160
<v Speaker 4>I just thought the one that jumped out</v>
<v Speaker 4>the window,</v>

149
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 4>my right foot catches on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My right foot catches on fire fast and</v>

150
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:07.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

151
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

152
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

153
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 4>trying to put it out and it's crazy how</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can see how people could catch on fire</v>

154
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 4>real quick because my right leg was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

155
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 4>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

156
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 4>So I jumped out and I started walking as</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm walking them,</v>

157
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 4>seeing like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hotel in front of us was all in</v>

158
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 4>sticks to like the whole thing was just</v>
<v Speaker 4>in sticks,</v>

159
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 4>like the fire had just ate that thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

160
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 4>There's a building in front of me on</v>
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>

161
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm just walking through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>streets going up the hill and just</v>

162
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:36.460
<v Speaker 4>thinking like God can be a horrible way</v>
<v Speaker 4>to die,</v>

163
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 4>horrible way to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got to,</v>

164
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 4>I got a bird's eye view windows on top</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

165
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was on top of the hill and then I</v>

166
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:49.420
<v Speaker 4>saw there's a cop down there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a cop down in the middle of the</v>

167
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 4>freeway just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

168
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where I got to go.</v>

169
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.190
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm running fast and I've seen as</v>
<v Speaker 4>this brush fire kind of come along and</v>

170
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:57.980

<v Speaker 4>Like through my eyes had jumped over the</v>

172
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 4>fence to get to the freeway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

173

<v Speaker 4>I'll jump over the second fence.</v>

174
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 4>And then the third fence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>

175
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 4>it was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a flimsy,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like out in the cold in California.</v>

<v Speaker 4>as I jumped out that last fence at like</v>

182
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.350

<v Speaker 4>of the freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I see the cop car and I go up to the</v>
