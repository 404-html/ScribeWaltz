14

19
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:23.701

<v Speaker 1>out how to rob from the irs.</v>

20
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>This is how fucking and saying this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

22
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.581
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

23
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Eddie fled after he started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just by boxes.</v>

24
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>You know how you let me use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go you,</v>

25
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>you would be driving in New York and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some guy selling stereo</v>

26
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:43.360
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>

27
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd take them home and it was</v>

28
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>two bricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

29
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Well he did the same thing to investors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took boxes,</v>

30
00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:52.930
<v Speaker 1>filled them up with bricks and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck them in a warehouse.</v>

31
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>And then he went public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he got everybody to come down and</v>

32
00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 1>look at all his inventory and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact checkers that checking boxes or</v>

33
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>bricks and them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

34
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>And he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean five fucking warehouses all</v>

35
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will all fake.</v>

36
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And he got all this money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fled to Israel and he fled for a</v>

37
00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they knew he was a pussy hound.</v>

38
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they got him like Escobar style.</v>

39
00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:18.191
<v Speaker 1>They've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

40
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the phone,</v>

41
00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>like I'm going to the store or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

42
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 1>And what they did was they put a blonde</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side of the road with a mini</v>

43
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:30.211
<v Speaker 1>skirt and they knew eventually he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive by and stopped and he stopped.</v>

44
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.090
<v Speaker 1>That's how they nailed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

45
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Did you google the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest women in the world where</v>

46
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:44.761
<v Speaker 1>they got their money from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker,</v>

47
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.850
<v Speaker 1>paramus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>syosset long island</v>

48
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.370
<v Speaker 1>and he had commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the first one that pushed to</v>

49
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:56.020
<v Speaker 1>commercial barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:56.021 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I would like to look at how many on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left</v>

51
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 3>we'll attack others for not being</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive enough,</v>

52
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 3>not being left enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's a panic,</v>

53
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see this is the kind of behavior you</v>

54
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 3>see in a panic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a moral panic for example.</v>

55
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 3>And so helen and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the third person who worked on the</v>

56
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 3>project with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Helen and I wrote an essay about a year</v>

57
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 3>and a half ago and talking about how the</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremism on both sides is really the</v>

58
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most people reject it and should</v>

59
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 3>fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of us are sensible people in the</v>

60
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 3>middle who hate this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

61
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 3>data just came out showing that it's 80%</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the population date hate the fringes,</v>

62
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.940
<v Speaker 3>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

63
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 3>and only 8% are on the left and 12% are</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the right of the fringe.</v>

64
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that works out.</v>

65
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.220
<v Speaker 3>And so we wrote this thing and we said</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what's going on actually we called</v>

66
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 3>an existential polarization.</v>

67
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.820
<v Speaker 3>So you have this idea that everything's</v>
<v Speaker 3>an existential crisis.</v>

68
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 3>So the the far right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll start with them,</v>

69
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 3>sees that if the Democrats get power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

70
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 3>it's open borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The terrorists are coming in our entire</v>

71
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 3>way of life is going to be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catastrophe,</v>

72
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:02.150
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ono.</v>

73
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Judith Butler is going to be 95 genders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quick Stop the Democrats no matter what.</v>

74
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 3>And then you have the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

75
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 3>If they get power that everything's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be racist,</v>

76
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 3>we are going to be beating gays in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>snow.</v>

77
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Speaker 3>It's going to just be the worst thing in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

78
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.370
<v Speaker 3>that's actually kind of a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

79
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for real though,</v>

80
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 3>that they think that the world is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fall apart if the other side gets</v>

81
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you have that kind of a</v>

82
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a panic and you see the</v>

83
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 3>slightest bit of advantage happening on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side is just something to</v>

84
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 3>completely freak out about.</v>

85
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 3>And then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

86
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the only possible recipe to balance</v>

87
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 3>the scale is to turn further our way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we go toward the middle,</v>

88
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 3>that puts the balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say if the right goes really far right,</v>

89
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 3>and we on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved toward the middle,</v>

90
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 3>now the whole balance has moved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

91
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 3>So the only way to keep the balance</v>
<v Speaker 3>close to the middle as if they go right,</v>

92
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:49.710
<v Speaker 3>we go left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

93
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then that's going to keep the</v>

94
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 3>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what that actually does is it,</v>

95
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 3>this is going to get nerdy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hang on.</v>

96
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 3>That actually puts all of the weight on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outsides and you think about a</v>

97
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 3>spinning thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

98
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 3>It's got centrifugal forces happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that trying to do is going to rip</v>

99
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 3>the spinning thing apart?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

100
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Speaker 3>if you have all the weight crammed in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle,</v>

101
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 3>like a wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't come apart right?</v>

102
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Now imagine if you had like two billiard</v>
<v Speaker 3>balls and you have like this big long</v>

103
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.410
<v Speaker 3>stick and there's two holes for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>builder bars.</v>

104
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 3>They don't go in at like locked in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

105
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:19.910
<v Speaker 3>just sitting there and you spend that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going to happen there?</v>

106
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Fly Right off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

107
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 3>So if you have all the way down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside and you start spinning a thing,</v>

108
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 3>so that's like the political</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations,</v>

109
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 3>that dynamic is going to rip the thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>apart.</v>

110
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 3>The more weight gets to the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one side go into the fringe doesn't</v>

111
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 3>mean the other side should go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fringe.</v>

112
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 3>That's how you tear a nation apart.</v>

113
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.883
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

114
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.950
<v Speaker 4>I pass out to 30 hits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two 30 in the morning heads and I'm</v>

115
00:05:39.951 --> 00:05:40.784
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

116
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

117
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 4>I wake up because I hear the alarm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

118
