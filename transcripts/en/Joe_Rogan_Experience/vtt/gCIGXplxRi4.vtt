00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:17.680

<v Speaker 3>out about it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>More old stories to say about how your </v>

78
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 3>begin with skin fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't be married each other.</v>

79
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to legalzoom.com.</v>

81
00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 3>can get divorced from your boyfriend or </v>
<v Speaker 3>your husband?</v>

82
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad,</v>

83
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 3>whenever a gay dude says my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just go.</v>

84
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

85
00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 3>It takes a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

86
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not judging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you said husband,</v>

87
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your guy.</v>

88
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

89
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:01.550
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

90
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 3>well don't you believe it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not homophobic at all,</v>

91
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 3>but if I see and I live in New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>where if you see two guys making out,</v>

92
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:11.870
<v Speaker 3>you're still like weird word a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

93
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Well it's always going to be if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual because for the most part </v>

94
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.461
<v Speaker 3>you don't see it until you reach an </v>
<v Speaker 3>adult age and then you're out in the </v>

95
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 3>wild with the wild homosexuals that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>frequent these uh,</v>

96
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.010
<v Speaker 3>thoroughfares and there's avenues and </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

97
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go down Santa Monica </v>
<v Speaker 3>Boulevard and probably we should </v>

98
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 3>probably just start the podcast right </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

99
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.270
<v Speaker 3>Is there different levels of that where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at c,</v>

100
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 3>two people kissing and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

101
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little hungry for that.</v>

102
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 3>Or like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

103
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 3>that's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it at all?</v>

104
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Like on and off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think like some people look go to </v>

105
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.940
<v Speaker 3>who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you saying?</v>

106
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're walking down the street </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see anybody walking on the street,</v>

107
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 3>two guys kissing each other I ever say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

108
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 3>is it completely hilarious and weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is it like mildly?</v>

109
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

110
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.060
<v Speaker 3>I see what they're doing there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or is it like,</v>

111
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 3>because that seems to be talking to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>question now way,</v>

112
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:05.160
<v Speaker 3>way before you tried to express yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>in such a complex manner.</v>

113
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 3>It seems very like I wonder if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>different levels because I'm,</v>

114
00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

115
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:13.891
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious and creepy and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends on what the guys look like </v>

116
00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 3>because there's a broad spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 3>masculine to feminine homosexuals just </v>

117
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 3>like there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

118
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 3>like women look different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

119
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:26.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you run into to have a certain type </v>

120
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 3>of women making out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not fun,</v>

121
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 3>but if know it's uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you run into women that are just </v>

122
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.130
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason they flow together </v>

123
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.171
<v Speaker 3>well visually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if to Brad Pitt's we're kissing or </v>

124
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Brad Pitt and George Clooney never be </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot to me because I'm a straight male,</v>

125
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 3>what I would sympathize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

126
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:48.511
<v Speaker 3>you know what's weird that I would judge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I would hope that they don't </v>

127
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:48.511
<v Speaker 3>run into anybody.</v>

128
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 3>That's mean I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you take a photo?</v>

129
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's rude to have you stolen.</v>

130
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Just make like against a telephone pole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends if someone,</v>

131
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>they started taking</v>

132
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 4>their pants off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably start filming,</v>

133
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 4>started going after it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you get caught with gay porn on</v>

134
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 4>your phone and then illegally acquired </v>
<v Speaker 4>gay porn.</v>

135
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.810
<v Speaker 4>You're a bad person and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

136
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to be just fill in </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

137
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you're supposed to just </v>
<v Speaker 4>film people,</v>

138
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.990
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the rules are like </v>

139
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess if you do something publicly </v>

140
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 4>should be assumed that you're filming </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

141
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 4>but if you just took film of some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it out and put it on Youtube.</v>

142
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 4>If you make a website called Joe News,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just say you just hang one of </v>

143
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 4>those signs around your neck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when they do for TV shows,</v>

144
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:30.490
<v Speaker 4>like filming in progress to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you will be shown.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We have the Zombie Bells of course,</v>

164
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 4>which I think we're out of.</v>

165
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The website here,</v>

166
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's armed rebels were out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them.</v>

167
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 4>Still have the great apes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We still have some of those and we will.</v>

168
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure we'll have the Zombie bills </v>
<v Speaker 4>back because they were fucking awesome.</v>

169
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 4>We've got some other ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out too.</v>

170
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 4>We've got some new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

171
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 4>that's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

172
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wearables dope,</v>

173
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 4>it's heavy as fuck to the Werewolf is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>big one.</v>

174
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 4>It's 65 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>28 kilograms,</v>

175
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:52.721
<v Speaker 4>60 to 62 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a good one to work out with </v>

176
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:56.920
<v Speaker 4>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They hurt if you do any kind of like a </v>

177
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.380
<v Speaker 4>foot to flip it over and your risks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I used to do one with a skull and </v>

178
00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.380
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just cracked my wrist.</v>

179
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Well you got to do is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to make sure that the face is </v>

180
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 4>outside facing the opposite direction.</v>

181
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.070
<v Speaker 4>That's a simple solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's what you do,</v>

182
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:12.071
<v Speaker 4>but that's hard to do when you're tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the other thing is you got to learn </v>

183
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 4>the technique of like punching through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when do you swing a kettle bell?</v>

184
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:19.841
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain amount of control that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you develop with it where it doesn't </v>

185
00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:22.631
<v Speaker 4>ever hurt your arm because then like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of times people when they're </v>

186
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:26.051
<v Speaker 4>starting out especially they'll put like</v>
<v Speaker 4>risk things on like they're trying to </v>

187
00:08:26.051 --> 00:08:29.440
<v Speaker 4>get an eagle to land on their arms </v>
<v Speaker 4>cushion things so that when the </v>

188
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 4>Kettlebell flips and hits it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't hurt.</v>

189
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.720
<v Speaker 4>But you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to know what,</v>

190
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.870
<v Speaker 4>what's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to like twist it sorta </v>

191
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 4>twisted towards you first and then as </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going up you sort of punched </v>

192
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 4>through it and then it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do it in a smooth motion,</v>

193
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 4>never really slams in your arm.</v>

194
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is if you're doing them </v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

195
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get tired,</v>

196
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 4>that's when your techniques suffers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you can.</v>

197
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 4>You could fuck yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

198
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 4>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suffering is.</v>

199
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.850
<v Speaker 4>I've done some doing crossfit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did so much damage because I just </v>

200
00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 4>never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've worked hard on good form.</v>

201
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 4>It's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

202
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:04.461
<v Speaker 4>Welcome to the club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many people that have hurt </v>

203
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 4>themselves doing that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those a power lifting exercises,</v>

204
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially I'm Steve,</v>

205
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm a maxwell who's a real expert in </v>
<v Speaker 4>fitness and the guy who's,</v>

206
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 4>he's in incredible shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's 62 years old.</v>

207
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 4>You guys are just an animal and just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wealth of knowledge.</v>

208
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 4>He's not a fan of those type of workouts</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he said that those power lifting</v>

209
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:26.811
<v Speaker 4>workouts should all be done with very </v>
<v Speaker 4>strict form and very heavy weights and </v>

210
00:09:26.811 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 4>very low reps and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're essentially taking these,</v>

211
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.740
<v Speaker 4>these workouts that are all about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>one big explosion and the most you can </v>

212
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 4>get up and they're doing them over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over and over and over and over</v>

213
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 4>and some people can get away with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some people get really fucked up.</v>

214
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they also have the element of like </v>

215
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.040
<v Speaker 4>competition to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I never really bought into because</v>

216
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 4>I was just doing it like trying a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight and get in shape.</v>

217
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.940
<v Speaker 4>So I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked at it as like whatever was on </v>

218
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.501
<v Speaker 4>that board was my workout,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was a competition element so </v>

219
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Speaker 4>it is funny that they spend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the first 15 minutes of any crossfit</v>

220
00:09:55.591 --> 00:10:00.591
<v Speaker 4>class I've done is showing you the form </v>
<v Speaker 4>of today's workout is the proper dead </v>

221
00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 4>lift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a proper clean power clean,</v>

222
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 4>and then they do that for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they go,</v>

223
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.930
<v Speaker 4>all right as fast as you can now for </v>
<v Speaker 4>seven minutes,</v>

224
00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 4>and it's like crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

225
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.900
<v Speaker 4>and these people are competitive people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they want to win,</v>

226
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:17.901
<v Speaker 4>so gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like you just see how they're bent </v>

227
00:10:17.901 --> 00:10:20.541
<v Speaker 4>over the wrong way and just like putting</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much on your back for anybody that's </v>

228
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:25.251
<v Speaker 4>thinking about doing any kind of workout</v>
<v Speaker 4>with either kettlebells or even just </v>

229
00:10:25.251 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 4>regular weights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just dumbbells or barbells,</v>

230
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.600
<v Speaker 4>please start off slow.</v>

231
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.470
<v Speaker 4>If you've never done any workout before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>working out is all about.</v>

232
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 4>It's tearing down your muscle fiber and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then heels and when it heals,</v>

233
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:40.011
<v Speaker 4>it gets stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to tear it down and then you </v>

234
00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:42.861
<v Speaker 4>have to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The recovery is one of the most </v>

235
00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:43.020
<v Speaker 4>important parts and that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that fucks up a lot of athletes.</v>

236
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the number one issues when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes to wrestlers,</v>

237
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of wrestlers because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>so mentally tough.</v>

238
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:52.521
<v Speaker 4>They overtrain they fuck their whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>body up because your body's never </v>

239
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:52.521
<v Speaker 4>getting the proper rest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

240
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 4>If you're not a competitive athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in some sort of a program.</v>

241
00:10:55.411 --> 00:11:00.411
<v Speaker 4>We can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't decide how much workout you </v>

242
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:00.411
<v Speaker 4>you have to do because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>follow a team.</v>

243
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:04.670
<v Speaker 4>If you're not in that kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletic program and you can do it </v>

244
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be fucking smart about it.</v>

245
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.720
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do because everybody wants </v>
<v Speaker 4>to just.</v>

246
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.310
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been a fat ass.</v>

247
00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:10.260
<v Speaker 4>I've been eating donuts and drinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>cokes.</v>

248
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.560
<v Speaker 4>I need it just I'm going to clean up my </v>
<v Speaker 4>diet and I'm gonna work out like an </v>

249
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.560
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do it too hard,</v>

250
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.260
<v Speaker 4>too quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you rip things apart,</v>

251
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.070
<v Speaker 4>you will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're.</v>

252
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:20.670
<v Speaker 4>Your body's not developed for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to build up to those kinds of</v>

253
00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:22.040
<v Speaker 4>workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why.</v>

254
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.260
<v Speaker 4>That's why like steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they do is they help you </v>

255
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:27.260
<v Speaker 4>heal fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could work out harder.</v>

256
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
<v Speaker 4>I think it's such a funny misconception </v>
<v Speaker 4>always,</v>

257
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:31.950
<v Speaker 4>but steroids were even in movies that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would make it like,</v>

258
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:36.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they stick steroids and </v>

259
00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:36.951
<v Speaker 4>druggos arm and he could just win </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>

260
00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:40.680
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People always treated with Barry bonds </v>

261
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:40.680
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

262
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.251
<v Speaker 4>he takes steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he injected into his arm so we can </v>

263
00:11:43.251 --> 00:11:44.640
<v Speaker 4>crack home runs they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still requires a ton of extra workout.</v>

264
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.950
<v Speaker 4>It was gonna work harder still than </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else.</v>

265
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:51.951
<v Speaker 4>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you definitely have an advantage </v>

266
00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:51.951
<v Speaker 4>over everybody else who works on it </v>
<v Speaker 4>without an argument.</v>

267
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean none of these guys are taking it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then</v>

268
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 1>just being world leaders are taken and </v>
<v Speaker 1>working out like demons and then being </v>

269
00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 1>world beers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

270
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot a lot going on with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

271
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem with it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashes,</v>

00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:05.300
<v Speaker 1>their endocrine systems fucks up their </v>

<v Speaker 1>series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so brutal.</v>

309
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 1>It's all you need folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a gym membership.</v>

310
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.860
<v Speaker 1>DVD cost 30 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take one Kettlebell,</v>

311
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 1>a 35 pound Kettlebell in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will fuck you up.</v>

312
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally you don't need any more</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment and that Kettlebell will be </v>

313
00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.730
<v Speaker 1>around to the end of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's solid metal.</v>

314
00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so fucking durable.</v>

315
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:01.480
<v Speaker 1>You never have to worry about them </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking.</v>

316
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean you buy one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have that for life.</v>

317
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:06.160
<v Speaker 1>You can pass those things including the </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic ones,</v>

318
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 1>the Werewolf and the chimpanzee.</v>

319
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Those are solid cast steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are iron kettle bells.</v>

320
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.920
<v Speaker 1>These are like the old Russian metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's.</v>

321
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's iron,</v>

322
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.930
<v Speaker 1>but the Russians were the ones who </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop these things.</v>

323
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.340
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this design.</v>

324
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some of them,</v>

325
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 1>they make some of them that are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>aluminum on the outside of their,</v>

326
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:26.590
<v Speaker 1>kind of waited on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are not those,</v>

327
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>these are solid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid metal and they're awesome.</v>

328
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.330
<v Speaker 1>You can't get like any better quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells.</v>

329
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.530
<v Speaker 1>We found the best ones you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>online and they're a little more awkward</v>

330
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.560
<v Speaker 1>in some ways to lift with then some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the what they call competition </v>

331
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells that are larger kettlebells </v>
<v Speaker 1>but lighter.</v>

332
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.800
<v Speaker 1>But that awkwardness I think is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

333
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.910
<v Speaker 1>everybody's trying to do fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with these God damn things </v>

334
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>they're difficult to use and I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I do</v>

335
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:57.010
<v Speaker 3>my squats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I've put a 70 in each hand and do </v>

336
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:57.010
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>

337
00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.960
<v Speaker 3>Go all the way down to your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>touches your calves and just think </v>

338
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.021
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking fighting for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think that Werewolf's are chasing you </v>

339
00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:05.430
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you holding onto it?</v>

340
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're like my life's in </v>

341
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:11.140
<v Speaker 3>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm like,</v>

342
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.261
<v Speaker 3>I'm on a hunting trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm trying to get up a tree and a </v>

343
00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:14.261
<v Speaker 3>bear's chasing me or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

344
00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:15.030
<v Speaker 3>Were Werewolf ones like or like right </v>
<v Speaker 3>here going.</v>

345
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 3>It's probably so we're referred to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of trading.</v>

346
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:23.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like a like apocalypse trading </v>
<v Speaker 3>because all functional movement.</v>

347
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could you do?</v>

348
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Functional movement is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's huge doing pull ups and stuff like </v>

349
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:34.061
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even just those basic movements like </v>

350
00:15:34.061 --> 00:15:34.061
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how I can't do a pull up </v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

351
00:15:34.061 --> 00:15:37.391
<v Speaker 3>Like if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember always feeling that </v>

352
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:37.391
<v Speaker 3>feeling.</v>

353
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:37.391
<v Speaker 3>If you were like falling from a building</v>
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>

354
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.790
<v Speaker 3>they'll catch themselves in the legend </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

355
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Like going to delay me dying for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple more seconds.</v>

356
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Like I could not possibly pull my bot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

357
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 3>Maybe with an adrenaline shot I shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

358
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 3>but something tells me if I had to pull </v>
<v Speaker 3>my own body weight up a building,</v>

359
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I'd be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you got to catch yourself by hand,</v>

360
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.770
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to be like one of those park </v>
<v Speaker 3>core dudes shirt,</v>

361
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.840
<v Speaker 3>super gymnast dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of us would just spazz off the </v>

362
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 3>building and fucking crashed to our </v>
<v Speaker 3>death and we're gonna be at coke nails.</v>

363
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:08.350
<v Speaker 3>They would promise Werewolf evoke nails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen those Russian guys </v>

<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

411
00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:12.591
<v Speaker 3>Like a zero tobacco thing that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fills the habit because it's just a </v>

412
00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:12.730
<v Speaker 3>habit,</v>

418
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:28.730
<v Speaker 2>They just a New York just said that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>a e-cigarettes are allowed to have paid </v>

419
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.540
<v Speaker 2>commercials during movies now and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not,</v>

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.320
<v Speaker 2>they haven't had that for 16 years since</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular cigarettes were.</v>

421
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

422
00:18:36.161 --> 00:18:38.110

<v Speaker 2>Like paid product placements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

424
00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.250
<v Speaker 2>but wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a product placement.</v>

425
00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Is that before the movie or in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie?</v>

426
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>product placements in films has been off</v>

427
00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.730
<v Speaker 2>limits for tobacco companies for 16 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

428
00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 2>so now they're allowed to have paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in movies there's,</v>

429
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 2>they're allowed to be paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying is like if you </v>

430
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.120
<v Speaker 2>watched the incredibles or whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll pull it out.</v>

431
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting paid for that.</v>

432
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.350
<v Speaker 3>It's white story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

433
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:05.540
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

434
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.880
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the November man with the new </v>

435
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.210
<v Speaker 3>one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the peers fellow.</v>

436
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.120
<v Speaker 3>So if he's smoking a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things,</v>

437
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

438
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.370
<v Speaker 2>If he gets paid to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so weird.</v>

439
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.150
<v Speaker 3>That's that they do that on television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

440
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:26.151
<v Speaker 3>like you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll only be able to use like Mac </v>

441
00:19:26.151 --> 00:19:26.151
<v Speaker 3>computers on some shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly obvious to.</v>

442
00:19:26.151 --> 00:19:30.021
<v Speaker 3>I was using number American idol and </v>
<v Speaker 3>every judge happened to be drinking a </v>

443
00:19:30.021 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 3>coke turned out to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's that too.</v>

444
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.230
<v Speaker 3>And there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also like on certain shows,</v>

445
00:19:34.231 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 3>like you'll see everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even movies you'll see,</v>

446
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:41.541
<v Speaker 3>like every product is a Sony and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>say they'll close up on the Sony phone </v>

447
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 3>when someone gets a phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you see the Sony logo and it'll be on</v>

448
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 3>a vial laptop and you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

449
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Sony has a deal in this movie</v>

450
00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:53.850
<v Speaker 2>actually when it's not so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it's always like they </v>

451
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.881
<v Speaker 2>always use apple computers and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>always have the sticker over the apple </v>

452
00:19:56.881 --> 00:19:59.881
<v Speaker 2>logo or iphones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have the apple logo covered up </v>

453
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:00.270
<v Speaker 2>for some reason and like every single TV</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

454
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like apples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

455
00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:02.670
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously hold on,</v>

456
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.200
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay us to show the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

457
00:20:05.201 --> 00:20:05.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

458
00:20:05.891 --> 00:20:08.230
<v Speaker 2>You've got it totally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally opposite.</v>

459
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.050
<v Speaker 2>They don't get paid by apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they cover it up.</v>

460
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If apple paid them than they would have.</v>

461
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to advertise your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it weird that it seems like </v>

462
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.210
<v Speaker 2>every show does use apple products and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all their shows.</v>

463
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.510
<v Speaker 3>They want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

464
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:23.060
<v Speaker 3>there's like a cult of apple in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood for sure.</v>

465
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sucking my Dick,</v>

466
00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:28.100
<v Speaker 3>but I did a show called P diddy's bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>boys or comedy on Hbo.</v>

467
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.700
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that was just an entire </v>

468
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.090
<v Speaker 3>season of a TV show to promote Sean John</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clothing.</v>

469
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they made you,</v>

470
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.360
<v Speaker 3>you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were showing John Closing.</v>

471
00:20:38.361 --> 00:20:43.361
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You when you did sleep dress and </v>

472
00:20:43.361 --> 00:20:43.361
<v Speaker 3>definitely hip hop clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

473
00:20:43.361 --> 00:20:46.490
<v Speaker 3>It's really meant you had to wear their </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes to do standup and all they could</v>

474
00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 3>find in my was a short</v>

475
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.000
<v Speaker 5>sleeve like zip up sweater that said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>show you how across the front room.</v>

476
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was about 70 pounds heavier than I </v>

477
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 5>am now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did,</v>

478
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 5>you did stand up with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sean John Shirt on because they made you</v>

479
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 5>wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

480
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but coming,</v>

481
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 5>if he was at my pant leg rolled up in my</v>
<v Speaker 5>first year of commodity,</v>

482
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:07.450
<v Speaker 5>I think one pant leg rolled up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like ll cool J.</v>

483
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 5>I bought it in full wigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went hard on it.</v>

484
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 5>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for how long?</v>

485
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.270
<v Speaker 5>Just you know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I figured out.</v>

486
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:17.320
<v Speaker 5>I started out in a black comedy room and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just found out I could fucking destroy</v>

487
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.350
<v Speaker 5>if I just went right to them on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>

488
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:24.430
<v Speaker 5>Now I actually load that kind of comedy </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's fun to expose that.</v>

489
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 5>Like the white guy who goes into a black</v>
<v Speaker 5>room just like,</v>

490
00:21:26.771 --> 00:21:31.771
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>y'all know when you buy a bitch or </v>

491
00:21:31.771 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 5>drank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that bitch won't go away.</v>

492
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go dancing with dead drunk </v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch.</v>

493
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:35.660
<v Speaker 5>I bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

494
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.080
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

495
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:41.250
<v Speaker 5>Because you know every job you up in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>club where there's a few white guys who </v>

496
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:46.141
<v Speaker 5>take on that role was zealous intention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a few of those white guys.</v>

497
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:51.421
<v Speaker 5>There's always like one or two of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>out there to like get known as a white </v>

498
00:21:51.421 --> 00:21:52.730
<v Speaker 5>guy who does black rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How man?</v>

499
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.330
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

500
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.230
<v Speaker 5>Gary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

501
00:21:54.231 --> 00:21:56.500
<v Speaker 5>and I've watched him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It blows my goddamn.</v>

502
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.000
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

503
00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 5>let's say it's like listening to what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's funny is that when you,</v>

504
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 5>if they turn the microphones off on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>audience,</v>

505
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:10.650
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you said there was all black people </v>

506
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:10.650
<v Speaker 5>in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like,</v>

507
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:10.650
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're probably furious right at what's</v>

508
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the basically being called clowns,</v>

509
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:16.240
<v Speaker 5>like they won't understand a white guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless he does this and then you turn on</v>

510
00:22:16.241 --> 00:22:21.241
<v Speaker 5>the volume of the audience and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just roaring high five and just losing </v>

511
00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:21.241
<v Speaker 5>their shit and he'll see like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

512
00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:23.710
<v Speaker 5>It's such like a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's such a grand scheme.</v>

513
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:25.570
<v Speaker 5>Pander.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's blows my mind.</v>

514
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.650
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to do that panda though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as it's positive,</v>

515
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.020
<v Speaker 5>you're allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pander.</v>

516
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.210
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems phony.</v>

517
00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:39.211
<v Speaker 5>It seems so phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems really funny because there's </v>

518
00:22:39.211 --> 00:22:41.910
<v Speaker 5>guys I worked with in the black circuit </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I started that like fantastic </v>

519
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.781
<v Speaker 5>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>black like bill burr used to do some of </v>

520
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:45.781
<v Speaker 5>those rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

521
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:49.170
<v Speaker 5>but isn't it weird that like no one has </v>
<v Speaker 5>any issue whatsoever with a black guy </v>

522
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.910
<v Speaker 5>who does like alternative comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that really dead Pan,</v>

523
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.610
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's going to white,</v>

524
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.160
<v Speaker 5>nerdy comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

525
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 5>No one would say he's taking on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>affectation of the white nerds.</v>

526
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'll tell you what,</v>

527
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.100
<v Speaker 5>that guy eats shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a real black comedy room.</v>

528
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 5>He the black right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The black.</v>

529
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:14.550
<v Speaker 5>The black nerd is not accepted by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>white guy who acts like a black guy eat </v>

530
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.930
<v Speaker 5>shit and a lot of white comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

531

<v Speaker 5>to New York and I would say,</v>

532
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.900

<v Speaker 5>the deal.</v>

<v Speaker 4>talented person on a show that rewards </v>

562
00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.541
<v Speaker 4>them and gives them ratings,</v>

00:25:11.651 --> 00:25:12.500
<v Speaker 4>because I know actors let anybody do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

575
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get on a Sitcom and they say,</v>

576
00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:19.540
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we own all your book sales and you </v>

577
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:19.540
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

578
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:19.930
<v Speaker 4>anything you do in the movies or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything from here on.</v>

579
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.970
<v Speaker 4>But the reality stars though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you totally against it because </v>

580
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.851
<v Speaker 4>there's some issue of the reality stars </v>
<v Speaker 4>though are completely made by the </v>

581
00:25:27.851 --> 00:25:29.290
<v Speaker 4>network they are though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

582
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how is it any different than actors?</v>

583
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.400
<v Speaker 4>Because actors are better at it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

584
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.650
<v Speaker 4>there is a skill there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

585
00:25:36.651 --> 00:25:37.520
<v Speaker 4>there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

586
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.020
<v Speaker 4>what about the ones that suck?</v>

587
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 4>But I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think like a Snooki should always</v>

588
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:48.100
<v Speaker 4>give some kickback to Ltv to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree?</v>

589
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:48.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

590
00:25:48.801 --> 00:25:50.900
<v Speaker 4>I just recording Ramsey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

591
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:52.700
<v Speaker 4>hit singles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think those are his shows.</v>

592
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.410
<v Speaker 4>Know he's on like four different shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

593
00:25:55.411 --> 00:25:56.780
<v Speaker 4>But I think those are his show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

594
00:25:56.781 --> 00:25:57.980
<v Speaker 4>He creates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

595
00:25:57.981 --> 00:25:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a pretty famous dude.</v>

596
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:02.030
<v Speaker 4>That's not a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he also has a skill.</v>

597
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like he's a world renowned chef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like Snooki,</v>

598
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:11.020
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're talking about the guy was </v>

599
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:11.020
<v Speaker 4>already famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it depends on what you do though,</v>

600
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.981
<v Speaker 4>if you're like the guy who was on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bachelor and he owns like a horse </v>

601
00:26:14.981 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 4>stable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If after that show,</v>

602
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:17.540
<v Speaker 4>the horse stables business picks up </v>
<v Speaker 4>huge.</v>

603
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there should be any </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickback for some like that.</v>

604
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 4>But if he does something moving on like </v>
<v Speaker 4>another reality,</v>

605
00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 4>just like the bachelor all stars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever thing.</v>

606
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.110
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think to some degree too,</v>

607
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:32.230
<v Speaker 4>I think that's crazy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a person who working for you </v>

608
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.921
<v Speaker 4>when they're doing something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a producer of a television </v>

609
00:26:35.921 --> 00:26:36.650
<v Speaker 4>show or a executive in a network or what</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you,</v>

610
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 4>who I don't know who's getting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

611
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.280
<v Speaker 4>then you hire someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're hiring someone because you think </v>

612
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.270
<v Speaker 4>that they're going to be the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>performer in this production that you're</v>

613
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:46.070
<v Speaker 4>putting on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

614
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.710
<v Speaker 4>let's stop pretending the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reality show is fucking cops.</v>

615
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

616
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.840
<v Speaker 4>it's a reality show because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys got shot and killed the other day </v>

617
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:55.840
<v Speaker 4>because it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

618
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 4>really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

619
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 4>One of the sound guys and they filmed </v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing like regular cops style.</v>

620
00:26:59.520 --> 00:26:59.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

621
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 4>The guy got shot and killed the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>sound guy.</v>

622
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 4>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

623
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.470
<v Speaker 4>that's the only real reality videos out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

624
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.150
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't been released yet.</v>

625
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:08.000
<v Speaker 4>It's really recent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

626
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 4>but when you're watching a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows,</v>

627
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:12.780
<v Speaker 4>whether it's about selling cars or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

628
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:17.781
<v Speaker 4>whether it's about being in a pawn shop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all rigged is everybody knows what </v>

629
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 4>the subject's going to be beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know what the scenario is,</v>

630
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:24.270
<v Speaker 4>the painting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're basically an actor,</v>

631
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.430
<v Speaker 4>you're in some quads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actor.</v>

632
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't,</v>

633
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 4>they put you on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say if we do fucking big,</v>

634
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.040
<v Speaker 4>big Jay's grill house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

635
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.420
<v Speaker 4>I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

636
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm going whole hog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you see like a hog spinning </v>

637
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:41.640
<v Speaker 4>around thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Chad do stand up comedy.</v>

638
00:27:41.641 --> 00:27:44.720
<v Speaker 4>But I also love cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I decided to open up and then they,</v>

639
00:27:44.721 --> 00:27:45.300
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

640
00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 4>They own you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they own you,</v>

641
00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:48.210
<v Speaker 4>they own a piece of you forever.</v>

642
00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason why they want you on the show</v>

643
00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:55.671
<v Speaker 4>in the first place with some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>housewives that fucking gets pilled up </v>

644
00:27:55.671 --> 00:27:57.810
<v Speaker 4>and start screaming at people or whether</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're charlie sheen,</v>

645
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.780
<v Speaker 4>if he ever does a reality show the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why they want you because because</v>

646
00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:05.781
<v Speaker 4>they think people are going to tune into</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and they're going to benefit from </v>

647
00:28:05.781 --> 00:28:05.781
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they can't.</v>

648
00:28:05.781 --> 00:28:07.330
<v Speaker 4>They can't own you because they made you</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck off.</v>

649
00:28:07.331 --> 00:28:07.880
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

650
00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.900
<v Speaker 4>And I guess it is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>originally,</v>

651
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.130
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember who you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

652
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Not talking about anybody in specific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about these reality shows,</v>

653
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:17.400
<v Speaker 4>reality shows where they take people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

654
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.500
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about him being forced to </v>
<v Speaker 4>wear those shirts and I'm saying that </v>

655
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:22.630
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these shows that like,</v>

656
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 4>like him saying that he was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>managing him for three years afterwards.</v>

657
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.730
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they connect people in these weird ways </v>

658
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:33.000
<v Speaker 4>where they'll own you for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 4>after your thing.</v>

659
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 4>They'll get a kickback.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I guess you're right.</v>

660
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:39.831
<v Speaker 4>Even in the example that I use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess like Snooki really like she was </v>

661
00:28:39.831 --> 00:28:41.910
<v Speaker 4>cast to do so in essence he is an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When that camera's on you,</v>

662
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:43.320
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's be real.</v>

663
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.140
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult for people to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

664
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.980
<v Speaker 4>It's just very difficult when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>camera's on you and say ready,</v>

665
00:28:49.981 --> 00:28:54.981
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're performing whether you're </v>

666
00:28:54.981 --> 00:28:54.981
<v Speaker 4>performing in some weird sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

667
00:28:54.981 --> 00:28:55.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

668
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitcomish reality show.</v>

669
00:28:58.921 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 4>That's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not based on real.</v>

670
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:05.930
<v Speaker 4>I know what the fuck is really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you see Alan Thicke show what data </v>

671
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Alan thicke had this reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would watch him and go,</v>

672
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:11.300
<v Speaker 4>why don't you just do a sitcom?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just so set up.</v>

673
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.520
<v Speaker 4>So set up everything is Gene Simmons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that too,</v>

674
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:14.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

675
00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.550
<v Speaker 4>It's sad and I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Simmons.</v>

676
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.380
<v Speaker 4>I Love Gene Simmons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a kiss shirt on.</v>

677
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I love kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found a letter the other day that Paul</v>

678
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:27.711
<v Speaker 4>Stanley's coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found a letter the other day that I </v>

679
00:29:27.711 --> 00:29:30.800
<v Speaker 4>read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote rather to some magazine when I </v>

680
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.290
<v Speaker 4>was 11 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a kiss letter.</v>

681
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mom saved it,</v>

682
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.650
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to bring it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Read it to Paul Stanley.</v>

683
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.060
<v Speaker 4>What's it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's this new shit?</v>

684
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:41.180
<v Speaker 4>Don't they have a new set of Gene </v>
<v Speaker 4>Simmons show him and Paul Stanley up </v>

685
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.000
<v Speaker 4>some arena football show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he was</v>

686
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.250
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reality show that reality show,</v>

687
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:52.470
<v Speaker 3>those are hard to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with ones like why is Mark </v>

688
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Walberg doing a reality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like killing it in life,</v>

689
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:59.610
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's getting exposed as being a </v>

690
00:29:59.610 --> 00:29:59.610
<v Speaker 3>doofus by his reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>

691
00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.150
<v Speaker 3>It makes them look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just looks like it looks good.</v>

692
00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Desperate move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's not.</v>

693
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Well he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a narcissistic move.</v>

694
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably wants to help all </v>

695
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 3>those other people out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's helped his brothers.</v>

696
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:10.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's helping his brothers and his family</v>

697
00:30:10.511 --> 00:30:15.511
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's helping them like actually help </v>

698
00:30:15.511 --> 00:30:15.511
<v Speaker 3>feel like giving them money so it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>come around a little bit.</v>

699
00:30:15.511 --> 00:30:18.310
<v Speaker 3>I guess having him a part of it without </v>
<v Speaker 3>a doubt.</v>

700
00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:23.311
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a mega movie star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having him a part of it ensures it's </v>

701
00:30:23.311 --> 00:30:27.090
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want to see mark Walberg hanging </v>

702
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:27.090
<v Speaker 3>around with his family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

703
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:27.790
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch a show,</v>

704
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.970
<v Speaker 3>a reality show that I find interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to some degree at least give it a couple</v>

705
00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:32.420
<v Speaker 3>of chances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't and I.</v>

706
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.620
<v Speaker 3>I've very much enjoyed mark Walberg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

707
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.080
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't even drum up a reason to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give it a shot to watch that other than </v>

708
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.760
<v Speaker 3>other than other than to watch it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong reasons and if he's welcoming </v>

709
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:44.760
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of weird.</v>

710
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were saying earlier I think is really</v>

711
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:49.480
<v Speaker 3>true about these reality shows being </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely scripted,</v>

712
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:54.510
<v Speaker 3>but the reason why is because these </v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of shows can happen where they're </v>

713
00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.000
<v Speaker 3>just boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's happening.</v>

714
00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the Kardashians are fighting with </v>

715
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:00.200
<v Speaker 3>their mom or fighting with her boyfriend</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this guy's out of rehab,</v>

716
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.750
<v Speaker 3>that girl's pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always like something you're tuning</v>

717
00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:06.751
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always some chaos so they know </v>

718
00:31:06.751 --> 00:31:08.761
<v Speaker 3>how to hook you up with the best one is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best show by far and I recommend </v>

719
00:31:08.761 --> 00:31:10.270
<v Speaker 3>that actually like watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

720
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Even if you skim through it on Dvr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bad girls club,</v>

721
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I could watch that over and over pieces </v>
<v Speaker 3>of shit.</v>

722
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean these chicks are garbage and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight online.</v>

723
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:28.990
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fight over immediately out of the </v>

724
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:28.990
<v Speaker 3>gates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

725
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.460
<v Speaker 3>this bitch thinks she's cute and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

726
00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:31.360
<v Speaker 3>what'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitch?</v>

727
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.090
<v Speaker 3>And then they ended the hospital fights </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights again to the hospital will,</v>

728
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.600
<v Speaker 3>that's how they stay on television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

729
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Then the producers come out and they say</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

730
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:41.170
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we let you guys fight.</v>

731
00:31:41.171 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens.</v>

732
00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:43.610
<v Speaker 3>But you did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit her in the,</v>

733
00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.700
<v Speaker 3>in the eyeball with a high heel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're gonna we're gonna have to ask </v>

734
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:48.700
<v Speaker 3>you to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a good teary.</v>

735
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

736
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to miss my girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

737
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Bought with Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

738
00:31:54.941 --> 00:31:59.941
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people will take things to the next </v>

739
00:31:59.941 --> 00:31:59.941
<v Speaker 3>level because that's how you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>noticed.</v>

740
00:31:59.941 --> 00:32:00.520
<v Speaker 3>If you don't take things to the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>next level,</v>

741
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 3>you don't get noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

742
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why I mean the UFC such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great example that buried boxing,</v>

743
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:08.440
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sort of has.</v>

744
00:32:08.441 --> 00:32:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Well the problem with boxing is there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>only like a few big stars that is like a</v>

745
00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:17.881
<v Speaker 3>few fights that you want to see and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just going to punch it like the flood </v>

746
00:32:17.881 --> 00:32:19.780
<v Speaker 3>wave of whether my Donna fight this past</v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend,</v>

747
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.300
<v Speaker 3>maybe whether there's a master,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a master boxer.</v>

748
00:32:22.301 --> 00:32:23.710
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

749
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:28.711
<v Speaker 3>he really knows how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's just one of the rare real </v>

750
00:32:28.711 --> 00:32:30.190
<v Speaker 3>like him and Bernard Hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>James Tony is a good example.</v>

751
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Just a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

752
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Andre Ward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just boxing masters.</v>

753
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Like if you understand how difficult it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

754
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.130
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

755
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 3>But you're watching a guy paint a really</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful</v>

756
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.980
<v Speaker 5>picture where in mma you get that too </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you get to satisfy that gladiator.</v>

757
00:32:45.511 --> 00:32:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Hers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to see two guys fight.</v>

758
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:52.290
<v Speaker 5>I get my ears perk up on any time I see </v>
<v Speaker 5>people fighting on the street or </v>

759
00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:52.290
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

760
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.250
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

761
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:54.850
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

762
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:55.420
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

763
00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.460
<v Speaker 5>the added elements of takedowns and </v>
<v Speaker 5>chokes and slams and it makes them more </v>

764
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.460
<v Speaker 5>crazy kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you're a guy who was a fighter,</v>

765
00:33:01.461 --> 00:33:04.970
<v Speaker 5>if you're a young man who can box the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason why there's no stars,</v>

766
00:33:04.971 --> 00:33:06.190
<v Speaker 5>I think you're almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

767
00:33:06.191 --> 00:33:08.120
<v Speaker 5>I could probably learn some spin kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And really,</v>

768
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.960
<v Speaker 5>that's such a much more glorious way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>win this.</v>

769
00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:11.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cage,</v>

770
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.430
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

771
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 5>Anthony Pettis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cage kicks,</v>

772
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.730
<v Speaker 5>wins are like the prettiest thing you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever better than any,</v>

773
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

774
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 5>or at least tied with any great Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 5>knockout it.</v>

775
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.840
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that fight that we were talking </v>

776
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.330
<v Speaker 4>about earlier where a student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a black girl attacks,</v>

777
00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a teacher and start slapping.</v>

778
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't say what it is and show it.</v>

779
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get in trouble for this.</v>

780
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Now there's this world star hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

781
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:43.070
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the news was on the news as</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone film it with their iphone.</v>

782
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.880
<v Speaker 4>So it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

783
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:48.370
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

784
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's attacking the teacher.</v>

785
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.410
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>

786
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.720
<v Speaker 4>This chicken just swinging at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>teacher.</v>

787
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.000
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>judo,</v>

788
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:07.100
<v Speaker 6>hip toss her and held her down.</v>

789
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

790
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.300
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Needs crazy.</v>

791
00:34:15.301 --> 00:34:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Joe Clark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy.</v>

792
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:18.750
<v Speaker 4>They need to lean on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Principal.</v>

793
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.960
<v Speaker 4>I think I would have went more crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He handled it way better than if that </v>

794
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:23.960
<v Speaker 4>chick started slapping me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

795
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.250
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This gets into the subject of what we're</v>

796
00:34:26.251 --> 00:34:29.940
<v Speaker 4>talking about the other day with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Kumiai getting hit on the street</v>

797
00:34:29.941 --> 00:34:32.790
<v Speaker 4>while he's taking photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't react well.</v>

798
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.710
<v Speaker 4>Deck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I reacted very well to getting hit.</v>

799
00:34:34.711 --> 00:34:37.830
<v Speaker 4>He didn't hit back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people just hit back when they,</v>

800
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 4>when they get hit and if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're a man and you're </v>

801
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.710
<v Speaker 4>hitting a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anytime people are hitting people.</v>

802
00:34:43.711 --> 00:34:46.170
<v Speaker 4>If a woman hits you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking dangerous,</v>

803
00:34:46.171 --> 00:34:51.171
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Getting punched in the face is like </v>

804
00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:53.720
<v Speaker 4>everybody thinks that a woman could </v>
<v Speaker 4>punch you in the face and you're going </v>

805
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:53.720
<v Speaker 4>to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

806
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.230
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of women that are knock </v>

807
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.230
<v Speaker 4>you the fuck out man.</v>

808
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.330
<v Speaker 4>If they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if they connect on your jaw,</v>

809
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.150
<v Speaker 4>you can't be hitting people and if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't,</v>

810
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do hit people,</v>

811
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be really careful who you're </v>

812
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 4>hitting because if they hit you back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if that guy just decided to tee off</v>

813
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.961
<v Speaker 4>on that check,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you see through her to the </v>

814
00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:14.481
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a guy who knows martial arts for </v>

815
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:16.581
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was avoiding all of her hitting </v>

816
00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:16.581
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he wasn't hitting her back.</v>

817
00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:16.581
<v Speaker 4>But if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

818
00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:20.190
<v Speaker 4>you're running in flailing your arms and</v>
<v Speaker 4>some guy uncorked one on your face.</v>

819
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.960
<v Speaker 4>You fall back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're unconscious,</v>

820
00:35:21.961 --> 00:35:26.961
<v Speaker 4>you're going to bounce your head off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground and sometimes people die from </v>

821
00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:27.990
<v Speaker 4>that shit and that's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When people get knocked out,</v>

822
00:35:27.991 --> 00:35:31.200
<v Speaker 4>they fall down and they hit their head </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the ground and die.</v>

823
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're pretty much maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>having a really bad car accident with </v>

824
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 4>your face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which yeah,</v>

825
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 4>it's just like that.</v>

826
00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground is completely like,</v>

827
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.170
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

828
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.990
<v Speaker 4>it resists 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no give to it.</v>

829
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Like if you fall in dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be probably okay.</v>

830
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you fall in a grassy area,</v>

831
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.920
<v Speaker 4>you'll get a concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you might crack your head wide open </v>

832
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 4>if you fall on concrete block.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him like a bowling ball.</v>

833
00:35:58.561 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 4>You ever talked a bowling ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sound?</v>

834
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that your head and the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>distance that your head travels of,</v>

835
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 4>you're a six foot tall man and someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>knocks you out.</v>

836
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.020
<v Speaker 4>You're probably going to travel a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>five and a half,</v>

837
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.130
<v Speaker 4>six feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

838
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.830
<v Speaker 4>depending on how you're standing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go unconscious.</v>

839
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:18.870
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot of probably more than six </v>

840
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.870
<v Speaker 4>feet because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

841
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 4>you're going to fall back first to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's probably going to be a </v>

842
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.290
<v Speaker 4>lot of momentum connected to your head </v>
<v Speaker 4>bouncing off that concrete.</v>

843
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.030
<v Speaker 4>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's awful.</v>

844
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 4>Those fucking videos freak me out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

845
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.730
<v Speaker 4>It was a five videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>face kicks and stuff.</v>

846
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:37.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'm almost like so </v>
<v Speaker 4>shocked at the mentality of someone that</v>

847
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:42.381
<v Speaker 4>can do inflict harm on somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always think that there's a lot of </v>

848
00:36:42.721 --> 00:36:44.550
<v Speaker 4>them out there that people aren't aware </v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

849
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.950
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not shocked when I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always like,</v>

850
00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:52.120
<v Speaker 4>I fucking knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's people like that out </v>

851
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.771
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's people that have </v>

852
00:36:54.771 --> 00:36:54.771
<v Speaker 4>experienced this awful shit from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time they were born.</v>

853
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:59.870
<v Speaker 4>If you grow up in a household where </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's beating the fuck out of </v>

854
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.661
<v Speaker 4>everybody and you go to school and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people beat the fuck out of everybody </v>

855
00:37:02.661 --> 00:37:05.481
<v Speaker 4>and you see abuse and you see people </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to jail left and right and life </v>

856
00:37:05.481 --> 00:37:08.430
<v Speaker 4>has no value and you've seen people die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're seeing when you watch</v>

857
00:37:08.431 --> 00:37:13.431
<v Speaker 4>those Worldstar hip hop tapes were a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes out cold and guys are running by </v>

858
00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:13.710
<v Speaker 4>just punting them in the head.</v>

859
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a bunch of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

860
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:16.230
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was always like,</v>

861
00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:19.320
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's shocking that someone can</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it to somebody else.</v>

862
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.470
<v Speaker 4>That's a wake up call for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're in.</v>

863
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:26.540
<v Speaker 4>If your life was directly threatened and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were in that kind of a rage maybe,</v>

864
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 4>but I mean once somebody down like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know.</v>

865
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:29.490
<v Speaker 4>I've been in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been in,</v>

866
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Speaker 4>let's say for a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a guy my age,</v>

867
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.650
<v Speaker 4>a decent amount of street fights in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

868
00:37:34.651 --> 00:37:38.040
<v Speaker 4>but I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never had like a kill urge ever,</v>

869
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've lost,</v>

870
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:40.180
<v Speaker 4>I've won,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even when I,</v>

871
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.420
<v Speaker 4>when like when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of over,</v>

872
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:47.421
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never like tried to put somebody </v>

873
00:37:47.421 --> 00:37:47.421
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

874
00:37:47.421 --> 00:37:48.290
<v Speaker 4>It will depend on why you're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

875
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.960
<v Speaker 4>But even if like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was a guy beating the</v>

876
00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:53.900
<v Speaker 4>shit out of your girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

877
00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.020
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

878
00:37:55.021 --> 00:38:00.021
<v Speaker 4>Like what if you pulled up somewhere and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just got there right when a guy was </v>

879
00:38:00.021 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 4>beating the shit out of your garage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying not to knock them out,</v>

880
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 4>but I mean like to punch somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

881
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:08.991
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know if that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't know where my killer rage </v>

882
00:38:08.991 --> 00:38:08.991
<v Speaker 4>kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like actual murderous rage.</v>

883
00:38:08.991 --> 00:38:10.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where that level is in me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

884
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.690
<v Speaker 4>I think it's pretty deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty mellow dude.</v>

885
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.050
<v Speaker 4>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

886
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.180
<v Speaker 4>but I think if you were confronted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you might be,</v>

887
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know you,</v>

888
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:21.500
<v Speaker 4>but if you were confronted by someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you were trying to protect someone </v>

889
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:21.870
<v Speaker 4>that you cared about very much in trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to protect them,</v>

890
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:27.080
<v Speaker 4>that some people get murdered us when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel like someone is being like </v>

891
00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.080
<v Speaker 4>someone's trying to murder someone you </v>
<v Speaker 4>love.</v>

892
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.660
<v Speaker 4>That's when people get murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

893
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:34.670
<v Speaker 4>That's a common one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying my point is being like a </v>

894
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.180
<v Speaker 4>street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I promise the situations</v>

895
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:39.520
<v Speaker 3>where on the world star hip hop videos </v>
<v Speaker 3>where guys are getting face punted,</v>

896
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I promise they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't calling for that.</v>

897
00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You most likely punting a guy who was </v>

898
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:49.141
<v Speaker 3>already unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen a few of them where it's people </v>

899
00:38:49.141 --> 00:38:49.141
<v Speaker 3>just being drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Idiots laughing,</v>

900
00:38:49.141 --> 00:38:52.910
<v Speaker 3>laughing or talking shit or starting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight when they were too drunk and they </v>

901
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:56.401
<v Speaker 3>got knocked out and then once they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>out everybody just started taking free </v>

902
00:38:56.401 --> 00:38:56.401
<v Speaker 3>shots at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you oversee that?</v>

903
00:38:56.401 --> 00:39:00.780
<v Speaker 3>It's literally the worst people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world quite possibly.</v>

904
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:06.390
<v Speaker 3>And I think you would agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially someone who's trained in </v>

905
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.881
<v Speaker 3>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so use what you have and have you ever </v>

906
00:39:08.881 --> 00:39:10.360
<v Speaker 3>seen that video of the God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weird homeless black guy who's crazy</v>

907
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:12.420
<v Speaker 3>and he goes into the karate studio?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

908
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.100
<v Speaker 3>And they kill them and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's dead,</v>

909
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:17.680
<v Speaker 3>but that was supposedly what happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>was he died,</v>

910
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.370
<v Speaker 3>mean the noise he's making after that </v>
<v Speaker 3>access and what's,</v>

911
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 3>what's ridiculous about it.</v>

912
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:28.110
<v Speaker 3>It was such a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cock wagging because the reason that </v>

913
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.860
<v Speaker 3>guy went so far is because when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to like do a show off,</v>

914
00:39:29.861 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Speaker 3>like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me stand up and fight this guy.</v>

915
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.350
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

916
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.410
<v Speaker 3>shut him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't doing very good.</v>

917
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 3>The karate guy was beating his ass in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this fight.</v>

918
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:44.041
<v Speaker 3>Like that is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was actually like giving them a hard </v>

919
00:39:44.041 --> 00:39:44.230
<v Speaker 3>time to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy Knew how to fight a little bit,</v>

920
00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:45.790
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other guy knew how to fight a little</v>

921
00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:46.570
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy got killed.</v>

922
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he definitely thinks,</v>

923
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:48.540
<v Speaker 3>oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

924
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.380
<v Speaker 3>enough that he had been in fights </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

925
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't totally helpless.</v>

926
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.600
<v Speaker 3>The guy beat the shit out of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you were right in the beginning.</v>

927
00:39:55.601 --> 00:39:57.230
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't getting the best out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

928
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I think the guy had probably mean he </v>
<v Speaker 3>must have had some street fighting.</v>

929
00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.400
<v Speaker 3>It was also crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's crazy.</v>

930
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:09.570
<v Speaker 3>But the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy thought he was going to go kind </v>

931
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:09.570
<v Speaker 3>of like knock them around a bit and make</v>
<v Speaker 3>them look stupid,</v>

932
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:13.981
<v Speaker 3>but it was taking them long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should snope stack because I don't </v>

933
00:40:13.981 --> 00:40:13.981
<v Speaker 3>even know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

934
00:40:13.981 --> 00:40:17.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man kills man and Kerr.</v>

935
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Homeless man in Karate Academy now feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist for assuming he's homeless.</v>

936
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that was the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always was guys black and crazy.</v>

937
00:40:26.951 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 3>It's probably homeless in Karate </v>
<v Speaker 3>Academy.</v>

938
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Snopes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

942
00:40:46.451 --> 00:40:51.451
<v Speaker 3>like what kind of human being does that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda gotten the kind of guy who gets a </v>

943
00:40:51.451 --> 00:40:54.230
<v Speaker 3>buzz cut and grows a mustache and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>works in a karate school.</v>

944
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy seems like,</v>

945
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.760
<v Speaker 3>not that you can't be crazy and be all </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things but doesn't seem like it </v>

946
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:01.760
<v Speaker 3>goes a little put together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

947
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.390
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was the main guy was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>marine.</v>

948
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.860
<v Speaker 3>He's a karate instructor and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he let his,</v>

949
00:41:08.861 --> 00:41:13.861
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his student who fought this guy and the </v>

950
00:41:13.861 --> 00:41:17.740
<v Speaker 3>student allegedly actually killed this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy is the real,</v>

951
00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 3>the real life Cobra Pies for federal </v>
<v Speaker 3>real evil karate teacher.</v>

952
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a thing,</v>

953
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:24.310
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people do.</v>

954
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a video,</v>

955
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to pull it up.</v>

956
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Well actually we probably shouldn't see </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone getting killed right up.</v>

957
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's</v>

958
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

959
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.620
<v Speaker 4>it's a tough one to watch even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a,</v>

960
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.150
<v Speaker 4>he was up for assault in the 18th of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>month on an unregulated charge.</v>

961
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:49.210
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know what the fuck I'm </v>

962
00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:49.670
<v Speaker 4>thinking if it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think with that kind of evidence,</v>

963
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:52.490
<v Speaker 4>should that guy die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

964
00:41:52.491 --> 00:41:57.491
<v Speaker 4>This is stupid man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what the fuck they're </v>

965
00:41:57.491 --> 00:41:57.491
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second.</v>

966
00:41:57.491 --> 00:42:00.940
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the things it says </v>
<v Speaker 4>sources in the medical and law </v>

967
00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.521
<v Speaker 4>enforcement community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tech community tell us that indeed </v>

968
00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:04.940
<v Speaker 4>the victim must have died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The snoring at the end,</v>

969
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:09.980
<v Speaker 4>a so called agonal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agonal breathing and assign have massive</v>

970
00:42:09.981 --> 00:42:12.320
<v Speaker 4>brain damage and impending death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just not true.</v>

971
00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 4>It isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get knocked out,</v>

972
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:19.001
<v Speaker 4>you snore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's whoever said that has never seen </v>

973
00:42:19.001 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 4>someone get knocked the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When people get knocked out,</v>

974
00:42:19.041 --> 00:42:20.300
<v Speaker 4>they have that horrible snoring.</v>

975
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.610
<v Speaker 4>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really scary.</v>

976
00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.220
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scary Shit.</v>

977
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:27.600
<v Speaker 4>First Time I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 16.</v>

978
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.620
<v Speaker 4>I saw so many laid out just it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean they're going to die.</v>

979
00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.120
<v Speaker 4>That's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whoever wrote the store,</v>

980
00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:40.121
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy should come out and do a show </v>

981
00:42:40.121 --> 00:42:44.410
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just comes to you as like a diagonal </v>

982
00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:44.410
<v Speaker 4>face to face or just get the foot </v>
<v Speaker 4>footprint.</v>

983
00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:45.380
<v Speaker 4>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all.</v>

984
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:50.381
<v Speaker 4>I'm a VIP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a video of it and there's all </v>

985
00:42:50.381 --> 00:42:53.441
<v Speaker 4>these stories of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but none of them substantiate any like </v>

986
00:42:53.441 --> 00:42:56.291
<v Speaker 4>legal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you'd have to look into it deep </v>

987
00:42:56.291 --> 00:42:56.570
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but apparently this shit was a long time</v>

988
00:42:56.571 --> 00:43:01.571
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like it was a long time based </v>

989
00:43:01.571 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 4>on the theory that if he did die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think that guy deserves to die?</v>

990
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.640
<v Speaker 4>The guy who did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who died deserves to die early,</v>

991
00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 4>go killed the guy killed them.</v>

992
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that kind of evidence,</v>

993
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:12.680
<v Speaker 4>like it's clearly from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's clear that they were fighting.</v>

994
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:17.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the conversation was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that lead that guy to be fighting that </v>

995
00:43:17.991 --> 00:43:19.850
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he said,</v>

996
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:21.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to come in and fight to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>

997
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

998
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:29.470
<v Speaker 4>It didn't seem like that kind of a dark </v>
<v Speaker 4>underground like cooma taste situations </v>

999
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:30.080
<v Speaker 4>place in Des Moines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iowa.</v>

1000
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.630
<v Speaker 4>It was a think it was in somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Georgia,</v>

1001
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.850
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy was a schizophrenic,</v>

1002
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 4>so it really doesn't matter what he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said.</v>

1003
00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.770
<v Speaker 4>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what happened in Virginia.</v>

1004
00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:42.800
<v Speaker 4>December 13th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1984 and he's obviously crazy.</v>

1005
00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:44.200
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He walks in,</v>

1006
00:43:44.201 --> 00:43:44.860
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a.</v>

1007
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:49.970
<v Speaker 4>and you could have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that guy literally also could </v>

1008
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.290
<v Speaker 4>have hugged him and that would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>ended the situation.</v>

1009
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:56.360
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the thing that happens in </v>

1010
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.971
<v Speaker 4>martial arts schools though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where if you're running a martial arts </v>

1011
00:43:57.971 --> 00:44:01.271
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy people will show up and they'll </v>

1012
00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:01.271
<v Speaker 4>start like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll start shit.</v>

1013
00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it firsthand.</v>

1014
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:05.060
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it at my taekwondo school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would mind,</v>

1015
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:10.120
<v Speaker 4>my instructor would take guys like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would come into schools and he </v>

1016
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.750
<v Speaker 4>would make them spar with black belts </v>
<v Speaker 4>and put them just like,</v>

1017
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:12.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he go,</v>

1018
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:17.561
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to fight you a pretty good </v>

1019
00:44:17.561 --> 00:44:17.561
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1020
00:44:17.561 --> 00:44:17.561
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1021
00:44:17.561 --> 00:44:17.650
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>we have gift for you.</v>

1023
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:24.551

<v Speaker 4>And he would like lower these guys in </v>

1024
00:44:24.551 --> 00:44:24.980
<v Speaker 4>because they would come to school and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would go,</v>

1025
00:44:24.981 --> 00:44:27.590
<v Speaker 4>you all false master,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you all false master.</v>

1026
00:44:27.591 --> 00:44:30.110
<v Speaker 4>You don't truly know martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1027
00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:31.290
<v Speaker 4>they try to reason them.</v>

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 4>Listen sir,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but you can't yell things out like </v>

1031
00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:42.141
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people that will come in that </v>

1032
00:44:42.141 --> 00:44:42.750
<v Speaker 4>have real mental issues and they can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

1033
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:47.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they also could be martial arts trained </v>

1034
00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.671
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that just </v>

1035
00:44:49.671 --> 00:44:49.671
<v Speaker 4>learned how to throw kicks and punches </v>
<v Speaker 4>from friends.</v>

1036
00:44:49.671 --> 00:44:54.080
<v Speaker 4>Like like if you teach an athletic </v>
<v Speaker 4>person how to deliver a good straight </v>

1037
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.410
<v Speaker 4>punch and just show them the mechanics </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it and they practice on a heavy bag,</v>

1038
00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:00.680
<v Speaker 4>they'll can fuck you up if they hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't really have to be really well </v>

1039
00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:05.271
<v Speaker 4>trained and disciplined and so there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that have martial arts </v>

1040
00:45:05.271 --> 00:45:06.870
<v Speaker 4>abilities like the ability to punch you </v>
<v Speaker 4>really hard in the face,</v>

1041
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.780
<v Speaker 4>but they don't really know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>

1042
00:45:09.781 --> 00:45:14.781
<v Speaker 4>They've never been formally trained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they might charge you and punch you </v>

1043
00:45:14.781 --> 00:45:14.781
<v Speaker 4>in the face and they can be really </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

1044
00:45:14.781 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 4>So if you're in a sort of a scenario </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

1045
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.860
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times these martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 4>instructors are forced to defend </v>

1046
00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.921
<v Speaker 4>themselves against these crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That didn't seem like that didn't seem </v>

1047
00:45:24.921 --> 00:45:26.490
<v Speaker 4>like that in this video and this video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seemed like they lured the guy in,</v>

1048
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.020
<v Speaker 4>set them up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beat the shit out of him to.</v>

1049
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.620
<v Speaker 4>The saddest part is at one point during </v>
<v Speaker 4>like when they're just kind of like,</v>

1050
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.170
<v Speaker 4>it almost seems like slap boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The homeless guy stops me.</v>

1051
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.260
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your good,</v>

1052
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:40.680
<v Speaker 4>your good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1053
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:42.390
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a fucked up video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any.</v>

1054
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.340
<v Speaker 4>And he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He starts saying don't stop.</v>

1055
00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:48.480
<v Speaker 4>At one point he does tell him to stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it just stopped and spit on him</v>

1056
00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:50.850
<v Speaker 4>while he's down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gross.</v>

1057
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the guy died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if the guy did die.</v>

1058
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:56.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's basically murder.</v>

1059
00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:01.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we said is where would that </v>

1060
00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:05.511
<v Speaker 4>murderous rage come out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would it come out if someone was trying </v>

1061
00:46:05.511 --> 00:46:08.721
<v Speaker 4>to kill your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably would probably would come </v>

1062
00:46:08.721 --> 00:46:08.721
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this guy wasn't in that scenario.</v>

1063
00:46:08.721 --> 00:46:13.521
<v Speaker 4>This guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy was saying don't like he was </v>

1064
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:16.791
<v Speaker 4>saying stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd given up like a healthy person </v>

1065
00:46:16.791 --> 00:46:17.910
<v Speaker 4>backs away at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's merciless.</v>

1066
00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:22.290
<v Speaker 4>It's just complete like drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I was so offended somehow,</v>

1067
00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.250
<v Speaker 4>but I wonder if they just got away with </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit like that and this was the only one</v>

1068
00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:31.251
<v Speaker 4>that people saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a wonder if this had happened more </v>

1069
00:46:31.251 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 4>than once because like if a guy's </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to be the guy to death like that</v>

1070
00:46:33.001 --> 00:46:38.001
<v Speaker 4>and then dispose of a body and this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the only piece of evidence that some </v>

1071
00:46:38.001 --> 00:46:38.400
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia guy was murdered like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1072
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.610
<v Speaker 4>Motherfuckers probably killed a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people before and he's a marine.</v>

1073
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.880
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what kind of action he </v>

1074
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:46.880
<v Speaker 4>saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1075
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:46.880
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have,</v>

1076
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:51.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're serving your country and you're </v>

1077
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:51.360
<v Speaker 4>used to killing people on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis,</v>

1078
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:55.460
<v Speaker 4>then you come back home and some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy skitzo guy wants to come into </v>

1079
00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:55.460
<v Speaker 4>karate school and talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1080
00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.970
<v Speaker 4>you'll get a guy killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why not?</v>

1081
00:46:56.971 --> 00:46:59.700
<v Speaker 4>You've been telling people for years in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the eighties.</v>

1082
00:46:59.701 --> 00:47:02.370
<v Speaker 4>That was like how they yell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Previewed like karate schools.</v>

1083
00:47:02.371 --> 00:47:07.350
<v Speaker 4>Like how many homeless guys if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed three homeless guys and counting.</v>

1084
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.520
<v Speaker 4>I was a part of many challenge matches </v>
<v Speaker 4>where people showed up at the school and</v>

1085
00:47:11.521 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 4>then I got to watch them fight friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1086
00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.530
<v Speaker 4>I fought dudes that just showed up at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the school.</v>

1087
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.950
<v Speaker 4>That was a super common thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can more or less with that.</v>

1088
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:21.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we took them to deliver a couple.</v>

1089
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:23.010
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1090
00:47:23.011 --> 00:47:24.810
<v Speaker 4>We took a lot of those guys to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hospital.</v>

1091
00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:29.811
<v Speaker 4>After we beat them up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd bring them to the hospital after </v>

1092
00:47:29.811 --> 00:47:29.811
<v Speaker 4>they spark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but easily could have happened</v>

1093
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.480
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was good,</v>

1094
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of good guys that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

1095
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.030
<v Speaker 1>There were guys that had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had talent.</v>

1096
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.340
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of fight where you put on </v>
<v Speaker 5>gloves.</v>

1097
00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what they said.</v>

1098
00:47:42.871 --> 00:47:44.580
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it was bare knuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1099
00:47:44.581 --> 00:47:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never know like what they wanted to </v>

1101
00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:50.570
<v Speaker 1>prove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what is.</v>

1102
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.500
<v Speaker 5>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've never been good at it.</v>

1103
00:47:52.501 --> 00:47:55.650
<v Speaker 5>Even back in school when it was the meet</v>
<v Speaker 5>me at the library,</v>

1104
00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.940
<v Speaker 5>I'd throw a punch then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See I say that because I was like,</v>

1105
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.350
<v Speaker 5>let's say if I got to think about till </v>
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>

1106
00:48:01.351 --> 00:48:06.351
<v Speaker 5>I probably won't show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'll probably chicken out like </v>

1107
00:48:06.351 --> 00:48:06.351
<v Speaker 5>later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm angry now.</v>

1108
00:48:06.351 --> 00:48:06.990
<v Speaker 5>Let's just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's get into it.</v>

1109
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.940
<v Speaker 5>That's probably the</v>

1110
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:12.970
<v Speaker 1>best way to get everything broken up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it from being like something that </v>

1111
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.130
<v Speaker 1>no teachers or adults know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if you go on a field,</v>

1112
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.970
<v Speaker 1>meet me in the field and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

1113
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:19.520
<v Speaker 5>someone can get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:22.280
<v Speaker 5>The Lord of the flies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to do that a few times.</v>

1115
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.850
<v Speaker 5>It's with bullies and it always sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but always it turned out me beating them</v>

1116
00:48:25.851 --> 00:48:26.660
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was great.</v>

1117
00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.310
<v Speaker 5>What kind of bullies did you beat up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>High.</v>

1118
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:34.360
<v Speaker 5>One was all girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One is now a one is now a cop and the </v>

1119
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.120
<v Speaker 5>other guy thinks is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of them,</v>

1120
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:38.060
<v Speaker 5>most of the guys who talk the most shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

1121
00:48:38.061 --> 00:48:41.450
<v Speaker 5>just never had to really be with </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody like stepping up to it.</v>

1122
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're a kid,</v>

1123
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.150
<v Speaker 5>everyone's Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I bought into it too.</v>

1124
00:48:44.151 --> 00:48:49.151
<v Speaker 5>That's why I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but whatever it was instilled in me by </v>

1125
00:48:49.151 --> 00:48:50.900
<v Speaker 5>my dad and step up was like very much </v>
<v Speaker 5>like get it going while you're angry.</v>

1126
00:48:50.901 --> 00:48:51.710
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like don't,</v>

1127
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:53.170
<v Speaker 5>don't wait for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's why,</v>

1128
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I was going to ask when they'd come</v>

1129
00:48:55.041 --> 00:48:55.730
<v Speaker 5>in and they'd say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1130
00:48:55.731 --> 00:48:58.420
<v Speaker 5>Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go teach this punk or lesson,</v>

1131
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.720
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what was going on,</v>

1132
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:01.950
<v Speaker 5>he'd</v>

1133
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.180
<v Speaker 1>get nervous as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea behind it was my instructor</v>

1134
00:49:05.181 --> 00:49:07.940
<v Speaker 1>was training a bunch of people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>National Tournament's.</v>

1135
00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.150
<v Speaker 1>So the idea was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys can hang with you,</v>

1136
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:16.210
<v Speaker 1>you're a national level competitor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good thing to experience </v>

1137
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:16.580
<v Speaker 1>because it's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to be able to,</v>

1138
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.070
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to perform under </v>
<v Speaker 1>some very real pressure,</v>

1139
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.860
<v Speaker 1>like people just swinging at your face </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1140
00:49:21.861 --> 00:49:23.900
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dancing around inside this closed</v>

1141
00:49:23.901 --> 00:49:26.900
<v Speaker 1>area looking to knock each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it happened a lot.</v>

1142
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:27.710
<v Speaker 1>It happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1143
00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.930
<v Speaker 1>not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happened every three,</v>

1144
00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:33.500
<v Speaker 1>four months over the course of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years that I was there,</v>

1145
00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 1>every three or four months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy from another school would come </v>

1146
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 1>into town and would want to show people </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1147
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.241
<v Speaker 1>We'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to show everybody how much </v>

1148
00:49:43.241 --> 00:49:43.241
<v Speaker 1>better his style was and people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>duke it out.</v>

1149
00:49:43.241 --> 00:49:43.850
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>

1150
00:49:43.851 --> 00:49:48.851
<v Speaker 1>When you stop and think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all pre UFC and there was a lot </v>

1151
00:49:48.851 --> 00:49:52.661
<v Speaker 1>of delusional people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of people that thought </v>

1152
00:49:52.661 --> 00:49:52.661
<v Speaker 1>their martial art literally could not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>beaten,</v>

1153
00:49:52.661 --> 00:49:57.520
<v Speaker 1>but they did a certain type of wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chung and if they could go to a </v>

1154
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:57.520
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo school and spa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just run through people.</v>

1155
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.850
<v Speaker 1>That would be no way they could stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1156
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Did you get half off your monthly dues </v>
<v Speaker 1>if he won the fight?</v>

1157
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:06.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't pay after a certain amount of </v>

1158
00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.750
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I taught so three homeless people.</v>

1159
00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Even when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started out when I was really young.</v>

1160
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:14.690
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 15 I was completely dedicated</v>

1161
00:50:14.691 --> 00:50:18.200
<v Speaker 1>and I was there every day so they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>give me things to do.</v>

1162
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:21.410
<v Speaker 1>They would give me like a clean things </v>
<v Speaker 1>or teach classes.</v>

1163
00:50:21.411 --> 00:50:26.411
<v Speaker 1>I taught a lot of private lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the people that are first starting </v>

1164
00:50:26.411 --> 00:50:28.931
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn in a private lesson </v>

1165
00:50:28.931 --> 00:50:28.931
<v Speaker 1>for them and since I advanced</v>

1166
00:50:28.931 --> 00:50:30.230
<v Speaker 5>really quickly and I'd spent so much </v>
<v Speaker 5>time there,</v>

1167
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:33.650
<v Speaker 5>I was pretty good at breaking down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>technical aspects of like certain moves.</v>

1168
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny and pardon the,</v>

1169
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:39.830
<v Speaker 5>the hand job here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think you're a fantastic comedian.</v>

1170
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:45.010
<v Speaker 5>Super funny and you have such the origin</v>
<v Speaker 5>story of a guy who would not be good,</v>

1171
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:51.670
<v Speaker 5>but yet I know a few people like that to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have people that are very like strict </v>

1172
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:55.361
<v Speaker 5>and life about certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mike Vecchione hilarious comedian </v>

1173
00:50:55.361 --> 00:50:55.620
<v Speaker 5>standing is like a very like regimented </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

1174
00:50:55.621 --> 00:50:58.040
<v Speaker 5>Grew up football.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was good at it.</v>

1175
00:50:58.041 --> 00:51:01.520
<v Speaker 5>He excelled wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Went to Penn state wrestling there,</v>

1176
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:03.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then but hilarious comedian,</v>

1177
00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.750
<v Speaker 5>but it usually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't breed the funny guy.</v>

1178
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the introvert or the or the,</v>

1179
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:14.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the weird kind of like social awkward </v>

1180
00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:14.020
<v Speaker 5>guy or the class clown type goes onto </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1181
00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:14.840
<v Speaker 5>But it's usually someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's like a strict,</v>

1182
00:51:14.841 --> 00:51:15.210
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1183
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 5>usually that story becomes like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1184
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:23.020
<v Speaker 5>I have four kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they all wear dockers and fucking </v>

1185
00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:23.020
<v Speaker 5>sweaters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one says fucking,</v>

1186
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not strict.</v>

1187
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:28.070
<v Speaker 5>I just get into things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just very motivated.</v>

1188
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.280
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm a more like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say I'm disciplined as much </v>

1189
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.030
<v Speaker 5>as I get more obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1190
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:36.950
<v Speaker 5>discipline and things that I'm obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

1191
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.830
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not like a strict person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the other way,</v>

1192
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:44.860
<v Speaker 5>like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying usually the comics who </v>

1193
00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:48.200
<v Speaker 5>like a guy who's in shape and doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy and like cares about that and </v>

1194
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Speaker 5>cares about his health just tends to not</v>
<v Speaker 5>always be.</v>

1195
00:51:49.881 --> 00:51:50.830
<v Speaker 5>It's usually a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1196
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:52.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some fucking,</v>

1197
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:54.350
<v Speaker 5>some pig the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1198
00:51:54.351 --> 00:51:58.400
<v Speaker 5>this fat broad because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at 165 pounds you slob,</v>

1199
00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just being like that.</v>

1200
00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's relating to this?</v>

1201
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.580
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you definitely transcend that.</v>

1202
00:52:04.581 --> 00:52:07.030
<v Speaker 5>But I mean that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird that a,</v>

1203
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.830
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that always happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more of an odd thing.</v>

1204
00:52:09.831 --> 00:52:11.510
<v Speaker 5>I think for the God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1205
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.170
<v Speaker 5>so I was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's when all,</v>

1206
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:18.190
<v Speaker 5>all of your um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like flaws kind of become your virtues </v>

1207
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.220
<v Speaker 5>and comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1208
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:23.230
<v Speaker 5>so the narrowed who got beat up and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's telling us stories about getting </v>

1209
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:23.840
<v Speaker 5>beaten up and now girls will fuck them </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he knows how to tell a funny.</v>

1210
00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.500
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's usually the origin story.</v>

1211
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it doesn't have to be.</v>

1212
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.720
<v Speaker 5>So that's the cool thing about comedy is</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many versions,</v>

1213
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:34.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like black guys have always had that </v>

1214
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:37.541
<v Speaker 5>thing where they're allowed to dress up </v>
<v Speaker 5>really cool on stage where gold chains </v>

1215
00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:40.150
<v Speaker 5>and crazy leather outfits like remember </v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Murphy and yet lyricists and.</v>

1216
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:45.750
<v Speaker 5>But it's the entire difference of black </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy and white comedy if you're gonna </v>

1217
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:50.080
<v Speaker 5>take by those circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said there's definitely comics that </v>

1218
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.601
<v Speaker 5>bridge both worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the difference in is like white </v>

1219
00:52:52.601 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 5>mainstream comedy is very self </v>
<v Speaker 5>deprecating.</v>

1220
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:57.080
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like my little Dick fat guy,</v>

1221
00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.310
<v Speaker 5>bald,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is.</v>

1222
00:52:58.850 --> 00:52:59.750
<v Speaker 5>And black is rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1223
00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.460
<v Speaker 5>so I'm slinging the Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1224
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:06.230
<v Speaker 5>And it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean fucking a stool at a black comedy</v>

1225
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:11.231
<v Speaker 5>club is probably owed a lot of money in </v>
<v Speaker 5>civil court to just like been fucked </v>

1226
00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.350
<v Speaker 5>here just off the side stages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of like broken up stools</v>

1227
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:17.300
<v Speaker 5>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from gang rapings.</v>

1228
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's so like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when I would watch,</v>

1229
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:25.840
<v Speaker 5>I grew up like a big fan of comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching like one that in the eighties </v>

1230
00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 5>and I would watch two</v>

1231
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.140
<v Speaker 3>to getting to where def jam became the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1232
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:30.990
<v Speaker 3>I loved all that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't even know.</v>

1233
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I almost didn't even notice the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference that comedy taken a turn.</v>

1234
00:53:33.751 --> 00:53:38.751
<v Speaker 3>So like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how good yard [inaudible] and how big </v>

1235
00:53:38.751 --> 00:53:41.010
<v Speaker 3>your Dick is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's comedy can be anything,</v>

1236
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just got to be funny.</v>

1237
00:53:42.661 --> 00:53:45.990
<v Speaker 3>That's what people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if anybody wants to say that.</v>

1238
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I've heard people say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like a social justice warrior </v>

1239
00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:51.540
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say that real comedy always punches</v>

1240
00:53:51.541 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 3>up meaning like get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get at the bad person that's above you,</v>

1241
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:57.120
<v Speaker 3>dominating you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The boss,</v>

1242
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:02.330
<v Speaker 3>the president pushes up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't pick on any people that are </v>

1243
00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:07.311
<v Speaker 3>below you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is sometimes punching </v>

1244
00:54:07.311 --> 00:54:07.390
<v Speaker 3>down it's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1245
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not always,</v>

1246
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's about what is the subject </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter,</v>

1247
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:12.840
<v Speaker 3>like what it like.</v>

1248
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:18.020
<v Speaker 3>You could like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember Louis Ck doing a bit about </v>

1249
00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:18.020
<v Speaker 3>how his kid is a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1250
00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.460
<v Speaker 3>And it was really fucking funny because </v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1251
00:54:20.461 --> 00:54:22.830
<v Speaker 3>you knew he wasn't serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1252
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was talking about his kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in a frustrated way about a kid.</v>

1253
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:28.740
<v Speaker 3>Just being a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he loves his kid.</v>

1254
00:54:28.741 --> 00:54:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Like he loves life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because he's,</v>

1255
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.420
<v Speaker 3>he's punching down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's making.</v>

1256
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.240
<v Speaker 3>He's like shitting on his kid for being </v>
<v Speaker 3>an asshole.</v>

1257
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1258
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.630
<v Speaker 3>And it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's no rules,</v>

1259
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:42.300
<v Speaker 3>there's no rules like a guy has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>self deprecating.</v>

1260
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.850
<v Speaker 3>The guy saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm slinging that Dick,</v>

1261
00:54:44.851 --> 00:54:46.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm given that deck.</v>

1262
00:54:46.621 --> 00:54:51.621
<v Speaker 3>You know when you give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving that good tick and you feel that </v>

1263
00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:54.150
<v Speaker 3>as whole reverberating off your ball </v>
<v Speaker 3>sack every time you come down home with </v>

1264
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.130
<v Speaker 3>little loop the loop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be crying,</v>

1265
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:57.390
<v Speaker 3>laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to that,</v>

1266
00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.730
<v Speaker 3>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing or you could be crying,</v>

1267
00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:01.720
<v Speaker 3>laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to a guy who talks about it.</v>

1268
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:06.450
<v Speaker 3>We can never get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The variable in those things is just,</v>

1269
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.420
<v Speaker 3>is it funny or is it not funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the important variable.</v>

1270
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:14.480
<v Speaker 3>We.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and my buddy washed nick Nikennon </v>

1274
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:23.130

<v Speaker 3>It's my favorite thing in the world.</v>

1275
00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Good and just watching the Canon by an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour of television so he can slowly but </v>

1276
00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:34.011
<v Speaker 3>surely peel down from a Tuxedo to a tank</v>
<v Speaker 3>top is one of the first week as a </v>

1277
00:55:34.561 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 3>backdrop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just a million light bulbs,</v>

1278
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.930
<v Speaker 3>so when he moves it's going to give you </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking seizure.</v>

1279
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.970
<v Speaker 3>And his jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all like,</v>

1280
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:47.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you meet a girl up in a club and you're </v>

1281
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.831
<v Speaker 3>all like splatoon just noises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then apparently Brian,</v>

1282
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.960
<v Speaker 3>Gary was texting that night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like live tweeting or whatever,</v>

1283
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.780

<v Speaker 3>I told you my baby was funny.</v>

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

1285
00:55:57.751 --> 00:56:01.170
<v Speaker 3>If you want to watch a show that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring joy to your life.</v>

1286
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.450
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of Bill Bellamy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>who got jokes?</v>

1287
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1288
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:10.130
<v Speaker 3>just take a weekend and really dig into </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because it's A.</v>

1289
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I have it in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a comedy.</v>

1290
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't like watching bad comedy?</v>

1291
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:15.150
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

1292
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:19.830
<v Speaker 3>It's on tv one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a black TV network.</v>

1293
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:22.000
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1294
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.880
<v Speaker 3>it's called TV One and Bill Bellamy </v>
<v Speaker 3>hosted a isn't on top.</v>

1295
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:31.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's done now I think to Tommy from </v>

1296
00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it airs on marathons,</v>

1297
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 3>on this network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy from Martin is the column,</v>

1298
00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:40.590
<v Speaker 3>the Pope of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sits on the throne and judges as </v>

1299
00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:43.480
<v Speaker 3>three comics come out and they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first round is just,</v>

1300
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:48.481
<v Speaker 3>they're set in front of an audience and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's three people from the audience </v>

1301
00:56:48.481 --> 00:56:50.350
<v Speaker 3>picked at random to be the judges where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they give a score from one to five,</v>

1302
00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:52.600
<v Speaker 3>five being the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one being the worst.</v>

1303
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Everyone gets a five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you give someone a for the </v>

1304
00:56:58.350 --> 00:56:59.410
<v Speaker 3>audience loses their shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get very mad at you.</v>

1305
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 3>That's around one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The comedy is always got awful.</v>

1306
00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:04.470
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1307
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:06.770
<v Speaker 3>it unprepared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually it looks like the,</v>

1308
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another we're going to do a TV show that</v>

1309
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 3>day and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then round two,</v>

1310
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:16.711
<v Speaker 3>they come out and they do some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge that you don't under which </v>

1311
00:57:16.711 --> 00:57:19.490
<v Speaker 3>they have a heckler in the audience or </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody comes out like actually </v>

1312
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.670
<v Speaker 3>actually a producer and hit you in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face with a pie and you got to keep </v>

1313
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:25.201
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they judge you score from one </v>

1314
00:57:25.201 --> 00:57:27.670
<v Speaker 3>to five and it's just horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible comedy.</v>

1315
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.580
<v Speaker 3>But it makes me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1316
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.280
<v Speaker 3>why does that make you laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because it works.</v>

1317
00:57:33.281 --> 00:57:38.281
<v Speaker 3>I'm amazed by I'm very interested and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's actually a science to </v>

1318
00:57:39.491 --> 00:57:40.000
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

1319
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Don't you find that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like actual science,</v>

1320
00:57:41.961 --> 00:57:46.961
<v Speaker 3>so you could just say the right words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen a comedy hypnotist </v>

1321
00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:48.520
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never seen one of those guys.</v>

1322
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to see a comedy hypnotist.</v>

1323
00:57:51.161 --> 00:57:52.600
<v Speaker 3>If you get a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real ones,</v>

1324
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:55.350
<v Speaker 3>I just assume it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1325
00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:00.480
<v Speaker 3>not fake at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something that really stupid </v>

1326
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.330
<v Speaker 3>people are susceptible to that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not susceptible to.</v>

1327
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:04.960
<v Speaker 3>There's someone can like say some things</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you onstage,</v>

1328
00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.440
<v Speaker 3>snap their finger and some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally go into a trance.</v>

1329
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:13.500
<v Speaker 3>Sure they can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people will laugh at anything to </v>

1330
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:17.160
<v Speaker 3>they're dumb as fuck to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what the reality of this world </v>

1331
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.731
<v Speaker 3>is that there's people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their brains don't work so good,</v>

1332
00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:26.220
<v Speaker 3>they just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's not a goddamn thing you can </v>

1333
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:26.220
<v Speaker 3>do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about education.</v>

1334
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not about how much information you </v>
<v Speaker 3>give them.</v>

1335
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the environment they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1336
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:32.250
<v Speaker 3>They have nine volt brains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1337
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like the funniest to give the </v>

1338
00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.301
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The audience has never communally stood </v>

1339
00:58:39.301 --> 00:58:39.350
<v Speaker 3>up to someone who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hacky.</v>

1340
00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Like the audience never says that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always being judged by other </v>

1341
00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:44.540
<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say this is in general,</v>

1342
00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:45.180
<v Speaker 3>like when there's a hacky comic on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage,</v>

1343
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:48.220
<v Speaker 3>usually he's destroying it depends on </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're at,</v>

1344
00:58:48.221 --> 00:58:49.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're in la or New York,</v>

1345
00:58:49.921 --> 00:58:52.570
<v Speaker 3>those guys could he beat and shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly.</v>

1346
00:58:52.571 --> 00:58:57.571
<v Speaker 3>But forums like this where comics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people get to talk and like there's so </v>

1347
00:58:57.571 --> 00:59:02.131
<v Speaker 3>much insight information out now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it kind of weeds through that </v>

1348
00:59:02.131 --> 00:59:03.220
<v Speaker 3>happened and now I think the audiences </v>
<v Speaker 3>are a little smarter in some circles,</v>

1349
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:04.940
<v Speaker 3>but they have to be fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you.</v>

1350
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember going to see comedy when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you first started to like go to open mic</v>

1351
00:59:09.581 --> 00:59:14.581
<v Speaker 3>nights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See guys that you thought were really </v>

1352
00:59:14.581 --> 00:59:14.640
<v Speaker 3>funny and then like a year later you </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking couldn't even be in the room and</v>

1353
00:59:14.641 --> 00:59:15.640
<v Speaker 3>they're on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1354
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean the people I worshiped when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>

1355
00:59:19.301 --> 00:59:20.800
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the way he kills,</v>

1356
00:59:20.801 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I got</v>

1357
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.980
<v Speaker 5>to do a joke where I open up and say dj </v>
<v Speaker 5>put that shit on one more time because </v>

1358
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:31.390
<v Speaker 5>everyone had to have one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to get down to the underwear on </v>

1359
00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:33.881
<v Speaker 5>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>used to get down to my underwear posing </v>

1360
00:59:33.881 --> 00:59:34.850
<v Speaker 5>to the 2001 theme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

1361
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.510
<v Speaker 5>And then one day no one left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do ever again.</v>

1362
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.030
<v Speaker 5>I went to see this guy when I was in a.</v>

1363
00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.460
<v Speaker 1>When I was in Boston before I did stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1364
00:59:43.461 --> 00:59:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I went to see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedy at a play it again,</v>

1365
00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:50.891
<v Speaker 1>Sam's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like this movie house that had </v>

1366
00:59:50.891 --> 00:59:53.260
<v Speaker 1>stand up in the basement and this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>did these like fake adlibs and I knew </v>

1367
00:59:53.961 --> 00:59:58.961
<v Speaker 1>they were fake while it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand comedy be but he </v>

1368
00:59:58.961 --> 00:59:59.720
<v Speaker 1>pointed to me and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy is over here saying this,</v>

1369
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:01.940
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was,</v>

1370
01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 1>but I remember like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1371
01:00:03.441 --> 01:00:08.441
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe that he was </v>

1372
01:00:08.441 --> 01:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>pretending that there was some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird interaction.</v>

1373
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>We asked for the rest of the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I realized that this guy was just</v>

1374
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:17.060
<v Speaker 1>bullshitting and this is kind of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake dance.</v>

1375
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And then as I got to know him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept seeing them over and over and </v>

1376
01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:22.240
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing the same thing.</v>

1377
01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Every time he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would set this bit up,</v>

1378
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>he would point to a guy in the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like this.</v>

1379
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.490
<v Speaker 1>He would say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he never,</v>

1380
01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:32.600
<v Speaker 1>he had his fake adlibs with the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no variation.</v>

1381
01:00:32.601 --> 01:00:35.260
<v Speaker 1>So if you saw him more than once the act</v>
<v Speaker 1>was done like the,</v>

1382
01:00:35.261 --> 01:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1383
01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>the veil had been lifted.</v>

1384
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.040
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't bring any joy to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that level of shitty comedy like </v>

1385
01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:42.040
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1386
01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.680
<v Speaker 5>it makes me sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes me laugh.</v>

1387
01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:45.840
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to any show when it comes,</v>

1388
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:50.900
<v Speaker 5>I just can't believe nothing when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>watch somebody either on television and </v>

1389
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.210
<v Speaker 5>their first joke is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I know what you guys are thinking.</v>

1390
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.280
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a guy open for me one time on the </v>

1391
01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:58.280
<v Speaker 5>road where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1392
01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.210
<v Speaker 5>he had a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it even was it about,</v>

1393
01:01:00.211 --> 01:01:03.090
<v Speaker 5>but whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crowd never laughed in the middle of</v>

1394
01:01:03.091 --> 01:01:04.500
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

1395
01:01:04.501 --> 01:01:07.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so my family used to run a funeral home.</v>

1396
01:01:07.321 --> 01:01:09.180
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you guys laugh.</v>

1397
01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:11.550
<v Speaker 5>But he goes into his job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no one,</v>

1398
01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:14.850
<v Speaker 5>no one laughed at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But every time he goes,</v>

1399
01:01:14.851 --> 01:01:16.860
<v Speaker 5>now you guys laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I had never.</v>

1400
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.760
<v Speaker 5>That's always funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The now,</v>

1401
01:01:18.761 --> 01:01:20.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what you're thinking,</v>

1402
01:01:20.101 --> 01:01:23.040
<v Speaker 5>you see me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happens a lot.</v>

1403
01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:26.100
<v Speaker 5>People like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel you should never,</v>

1404
01:01:26.101 --> 01:01:31.101
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of us do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you should never get on television </v>

1405
01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:31.101
<v Speaker 5>with your first ever set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1406
01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:32.630
<v Speaker 5>when you go on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you go on the road and me,</v>

1407
01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a,</v>

1408
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I,</v>

1409
01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.510
<v Speaker 5>when I go on the road and someone opens </v>
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

1410
01:01:36.511 --> 01:01:38.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm generally getting somebody doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>their first set.</v>

1411
01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:43.761
<v Speaker 5>You remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when every time he got on stage it </v>

1412
01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:44.340
<v Speaker 5>was the introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my name is Jay and I blah,</v>

1413
01:01:44.341 --> 01:01:44.970
<v Speaker 5>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1414
01:01:44.971 --> 01:01:49.971
<v Speaker 5>it's like first day girl comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm so and so and I'm a total slot </v>

1415
01:01:49.971 --> 01:01:53.310
<v Speaker 5>and I sex with my friends and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

1416
01:01:53.311 --> 01:01:55.400
<v Speaker 5>But that first set makes it on tv a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now [inaudible],</v>

1417
01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:56.940
<v Speaker 5>there's so many forums.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1418
01:01:56.941 --> 01:01:59.370
<v Speaker 5>but that's just life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just kind of move on,</v>

1419
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:04.450
<v Speaker 1>just deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not good to have your </v>

1420
01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:06.761
<v Speaker 1>first set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you've been doing standup for 10 </v>

1421
01:02:06.761 --> 01:02:06.761
<v Speaker 1>years or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get your first set on tv,</v>

1422
01:02:06.761 --> 01:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>six years just fuckin accepted sucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>except that it sucks and move on,</v>

1423
01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you won't know.</v>

1424
01:02:11.631 --> 01:02:16.631
<v Speaker 1>It sucks until you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta watch it on TV like later in </v>

1425
01:02:16.631 --> 01:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>your career when you're better and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1426
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:18.690
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1427
01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:20.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying I'm surprised that the behind</v>

1428
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:24.900
<v Speaker 4>the scenes don't catch up to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to see like there's no like,</v>

1429
01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:27.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't take any cues from the actual</v>

1430
01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:29.910
<v Speaker 4>community of comedy itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1431
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's been doing comedy for five </v>

1432
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.101
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like of course he should be on </v>

1433
01:02:37.101 --> 01:02:37.101
<v Speaker 4>letterman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1434
01:02:37.101 --> 01:02:39.880
<v Speaker 4>The behind the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people know they're always looking for </v>

1435
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 4>someone to come along to prodigy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That figures it out after four months.</v>

1436
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:45.170
<v Speaker 4>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know if they do that person </v>

1437
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.170
<v Speaker 4>any favors though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They definitely don't.</v>

1438
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:48.831
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All they care about is what can they </v>

1439
01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:48.831
<v Speaker 4>sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like the reality show,</v>

1440
01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 4>as I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've noticed,</v>

1441
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:51.360
<v Speaker 4>if you've watched the video of moved </v>
<v Speaker 4>into a new chair,</v>

1442
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:54.030
<v Speaker 4>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if this one's going to make</v>

1443
01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:59.031
<v Speaker 4>it and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the other thing is better than no </v>

1444
01:02:59.031 --> 01:02:59.031
<v Speaker 4>back things better.</v>

1445
01:02:59.031 --> 01:02:59.031
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

1446
01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:00.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just sell you,</v>

1447
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:01.700
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1448
01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.710
<v Speaker 4>If they can sell the hook is you </v>
<v Speaker 4>Olympians in Stanford,</v>

1449
01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 4>five months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to protect you.</v>

1450
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.570
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to go up that big Jay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got potential for the future.</v>

1451
01:03:09.571 --> 01:03:12.750
<v Speaker 4>Let's not put it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five month old comedy set.</v>

1452
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:17.810
<v Speaker 4>No the fuck you get on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a shit sink or swim as many </v>

1453
01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:18.090
<v Speaker 4>more people they have to pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1454
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.200
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll look.</v>

1455
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's it?</v>

1456
01:03:21.901 --> 01:03:26.901
<v Speaker 4>The hunger games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People were pretty thrilled that j dot </v>

1457
01:03:26.901 --> 01:03:26.901
<v Speaker 4>snatches out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's huge for them.</v>

1458
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.120
<v Speaker 4>Just drew a whole new audience to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>show because I don't know how those two </v>

1459
01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.181
<v Speaker 4>are connected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're talking about someone being </v>

1460
01:03:35.181 --> 01:03:35.220
<v Speaker 4>hacked now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone who was talking about.</v>

1461
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.520
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were saying about selling </v>
<v Speaker 4>things like the company.</v>

1462
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.030
<v Speaker 4>I was saying that companies that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>care,</v>

1463
01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:42.630
<v Speaker 4>like the movie companies don't care that</v>
<v Speaker 4>she gets like exposed.</v>

1464
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:44.400
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it does give them a good job.</v>

1465
01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:46.580
<v Speaker 4>They don't protect her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying they don't.</v>

1466
01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.630
<v Speaker 4>They don't come out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would have protected her.</v>

1467
01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they probably wouldn't have let</v>
<v Speaker 4>it be released but it.</v>

1468
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:53.700
<v Speaker 4>But it's to their benefit now that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

1469
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.180
<v Speaker 4>I kind of guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1470
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 4>But it's a different thing than I had in</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mind.</v>

1471
01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:00.360
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it have nothing to do with it?</v>

1472
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1473
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:04.290
<v Speaker 4>There was a connection in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was something there I guess.</v>

1474
01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:09.560
<v Speaker 4>I guess I've only seen the first one now</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to watch more after seeing her </v>

1475
01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.350
<v Speaker 4>naked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1476
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Which is good for the company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the movie company,</v>

1477
01:04:12.661 --> 01:04:14.280
<v Speaker 4>even though it's like they pay her and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>

1478
01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she has a relationship with them.</v>

1479
01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:19.260
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck if something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>her detriment builds up their movie.</v>

1480
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see that probably.</v>

1481
01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably after it's over there,</v>

1482
01:04:22.801 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 4>like they probably would have protected </v>
<v Speaker 4>her from getting out.</v>

1483
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:28.500
<v Speaker 4>But once it's out like hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the long run we're going to do bro.</v>

1484
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:32.550
<v Speaker 4>She looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sat around the office and yeah,</v>

1485
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:37.820
<v Speaker 4>it's true being the only way you're ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get protected as a comic </v>

1486
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:40.620
<v Speaker 4>because if you have a manager and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>manager will say,</v>

1487
01:04:40.621 --> 01:04:41.370
<v Speaker 4>listen Jane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1488
01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.110
<v Speaker 4>let's keep hitting the clubs and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1489
01:04:43.111 --> 01:04:44.550
<v Speaker 4>wait a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

1490
01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 4>wait a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll just work.</v>

1491
01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Where's that manager?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeff Salzman.</v>

1492
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:50.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my guy.</v>

1493
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>

1494
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:57.490
<v Speaker 4>You've got to develop comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you got to treat them as like a </v>

1495
01:04:57.490 --> 01:05:01.671
<v Speaker 4>longterm project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't like move people into a house </v>

1496
01:05:01.671 --> 01:05:01.671
<v Speaker 4>before you can put a roof on it and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't pretend it's done.</v>

1497
01:05:01.671 --> 01:05:06.561
<v Speaker 4>What's not done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you see a young guy that's got </v>

1498
01:05:06.561 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 4>potential,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody that we've ever met,</v>

1499
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:10.500
<v Speaker 4>they go through periods like you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about your black comedy period.</v>

1500
01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:11.340
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1501
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.700
<v Speaker 4>people go through these weird phases </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're trying to find themselves </v>

1502
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:16.700
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate to use the word,</v>

1503
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 4>but artists find myself as an artist</v>

1504
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.640
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1505
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:25.440
<v Speaker 5>but the thing is if there's a video of </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have five months in and then it's </v>

1506
01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.980
<v Speaker 5>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a way better video two years</v>

1507
01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:27.700
<v Speaker 5>later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1508
01:05:27.701 --> 01:05:29.590
<v Speaker 5>if someone watches both,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go out.</v>

1509
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.760
<v Speaker 5>Jay got better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1510
01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:31.950
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing wrong.</v>

1511
01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did bet.</v>

1512
01:05:34.161 --> 01:05:37.070
<v Speaker 5>Comicview thrice three times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1513
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>

1514
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:43.021
<v Speaker 5>like who was hosting the first one ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>was lester barry who was a black circuit</v>

1515
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 5>comic for the very religious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>

1516
01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:51.130
<v Speaker 5>The second time I did it was Arnez J in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Miami.</v>

1517
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:54.730
<v Speaker 5>And the third time third time was funny </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I said by this point I go,</v>

1518
01:05:54.731 --> 01:05:57.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing comic view ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I just,</v>

1519
01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:58.960
<v Speaker 5>I've written that one off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing it.</v>

1520
01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.090
<v Speaker 5>It's always an awkward situation when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>go there too.</v>

1521
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:03.520
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm the only white guy,</v>

1522
01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:08.610
<v Speaker 5>the production is white and they put </v>
<v Speaker 5>some weird responsibility on me to be </v>

1523
01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:12.541
<v Speaker 5>like the den mother of the comics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I've like smoked cigarettes and I'd </v>

1524
01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:17.461
<v Speaker 5>go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go outside and smoke a </v>

1525
01:06:17.461 --> 01:06:17.461
<v Speaker 5>cigarette.</v>

1526
01:06:17.461 --> 01:06:17.461
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1527
01:06:17.461 --> 01:06:19.381
<v Speaker 5>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was everyone Jay's going to smoke if </v>

1528
01:06:19.381 --> 01:06:21.781
<v Speaker 5>you want to smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go out now with him and everyone's got </v>

1529
01:06:21.781 --> 01:06:24.851
<v Speaker 5>to be back in here in 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then she tried to get me all of </v>

1530
01:06:24.851 --> 01:06:25.990
<v Speaker 5>their food tickets so I'd be responsible</v>
<v Speaker 5>for them.</v>

1531
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:27.820
<v Speaker 5>It was very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just because you're white.</v>

1532
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:29.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I assume so.</v>

1533
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.020
<v Speaker 5>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the black comics will do things</v>

1534
01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.550
<v Speaker 5>like I'm going to go out and smoke and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then go like,</v>

1535
01:06:33.551 --> 01:06:38.551
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck a chick for five hours trying to </v>

1536
01:06:38.551 --> 01:06:38.551
<v Speaker 5>cut back 15 minutes before the show </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts.</v>

1537
01:06:38.551 --> 01:06:39.510
<v Speaker 5>So that did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1538
01:06:39.511 --> 01:06:44.511
<v Speaker 5>what they want you to do is just hang </v>
<v Speaker 5>out all day waiting for the show to </v>

1539
01:06:44.511 --> 01:06:44.511
<v Speaker 5>start.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1540
01:06:44.511 --> 01:06:45.120
<v Speaker 5>they put you there at nine in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>morning until night.</v>

1541
01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:46.690
<v Speaker 5>I went on at midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

1542
01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:51.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they just don't want this </v>

1543
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:51.930
<v Speaker 5>wrangle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody acts.</v>

1544
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:51.930
<v Speaker 5>They don't believe anyone.</v>

1545
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:54.820
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no belief.</v>

1546
01:06:54.821 --> 01:06:59.821
<v Speaker 5>They're going to stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've done entire shows about how </v>

1547
01:06:59.821 --> 01:07:02.641
<v Speaker 5>happy they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they'll do a show where the same </v>

1548
01:07:02.641 --> 01:07:02.641
<v Speaker 5>joke gets repeated by different </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedians.</v>

1549
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.560
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so I went and did it.</v>

1550
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.130
<v Speaker 5>Kevin Hart ended up hosting I think one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the last ever seasons,</v>

1551
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:14.460
<v Speaker 5>but it was called one mic stand and </v>
<v Speaker 5>where something like that I think is </v>

1552
01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:14.460
<v Speaker 5>what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one mic stand,</v>

1553
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.400
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't called comic view and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kevin called me and asked me if I wanted</v>

1554
01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:20.710
<v Speaker 5>to do it or if I would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

1555
01:07:20.711 --> 01:07:25.711
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to do comic view </v>

1556
01:07:25.711 --> 01:07:25.711
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1557
01:07:25.711 --> 01:07:25.711
<v Speaker 5>it's not comic view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's different.</v>

1558
01:07:25.711 --> 01:07:26.410
<v Speaker 5>They're flying people out now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're doing it all right.</v>

1559
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.300
<v Speaker 5>And set it up good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was a.</v>

1560
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:30.400
<v Speaker 5>When I signed the contract,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets comic presents,</v>

1561
01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:35.460
<v Speaker 5>one mic stand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They gave us a big speech before we </v>

1562
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.050
<v Speaker 5>taped anything and the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're changing comic fuel.</v>

1563
01:07:37.050 --> 01:07:42.050
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the guys specifically said no more </v>

1564
01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:45.571
<v Speaker 5>stool humping and dj hit it and pulling </v>
<v Speaker 5>out fake teeth.</v>

1565
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.140
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we weren't three comics in before</v>

1566
01:07:50.141 --> 01:07:52.300
<v Speaker 5>the guy was wearing fake teeth and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking a stool.</v>

1567
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean not even by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he's giving this speech to it,</v>

1568
01:07:57.850 --> 01:08:01.480
<v Speaker 5>these same guys who were getting ready </v>
<v Speaker 5>to fuck stools and put in fake teeth are</v>

1569
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 5>doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1570
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:07.141
<v Speaker 5>like staring at him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give the speech and like nodding their </v>

1571
01:08:07.141 --> 01:08:07.141
<v Speaker 5>heads like a Pachino speech in any given</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sunday.</v>

1572
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:09.280
<v Speaker 5>It's like an emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful speech.</v>

1573
01:08:09.281 --> 01:08:12.640
<v Speaker 5>How we're changing comic view now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they went and they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>this is true story.</v>

1580
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.950
<v Speaker 5>Kevin used to host a club in Atlantic </v>
<v Speaker 5>city,</v>

1581
01:08:33.951 --> 01:08:36.650
<v Speaker 5>Kevin Hart called sweet cheeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweet,</v>

1582
01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:39.080
<v Speaker 5>violent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a pimps and players ball.</v>

1583
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:44.380
<v Speaker 5>No bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like everyone was wearing zoot </v>

<v Speaker 5>but they interrupt dancing to do a </v>

1586
01:08:48.821 --> 01:08:52.550
<v Speaker 5>comedy show in the middle of the fucking</v>

<v Speaker 5>was getting down to my underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck wants them to do comedy at </v>

1623
01:10:14.021 --> 01:10:18.011
<v Speaker 5>2:00</v>

<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>

1625
01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:20.981
<v Speaker 5>I used to do these ski trips shows that </v>
<v Speaker 5>were like black ski trips and black </v>

1626
01:10:20.981 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 5>people don't even ski at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>

1627
01:10:22.911 --> 01:10:27.911
<v Speaker 5>They go and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they took a bus thing to go to this </v>

1628
01:10:27.911 --> 01:10:29.300
<v Speaker 5>hotel and they'd all just like,</v>

1634
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.000
<v Speaker 5>Wanted no parts of the comedy show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never understand why they force comedy</v>

1635
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:55.160
<v Speaker 5>into places where it doesn't need to be </v>

<v Speaker 1>out here and it was like the line was </v>

1744
01:14:59.130 --> 01:14:59.130
<v Speaker 1>like wrapped around the building.</v>

1745
01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 1>That's Jamie doesn't let people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants that line to be wrapped around </v>

1746
01:15:02.650 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 1>the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't just like let people in.</v>

1747
01:15:02.650 --> 01:15:05.610
<v Speaker 1>He makes you stay outside so it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a line out there.</v>

1748
01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:10.650
<v Speaker 1>We're signing up for tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those a lot of them was like the open </v>

1749
01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 1>mic nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have to open mic nights.</v>

1750
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:14.890
<v Speaker 1>They make people sit out there from 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

1751
01:15:14.891 --> 01:15:18.580
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck the sign up time is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have to wait in line until they</v>

1752
01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:20.680
<v Speaker 1>get picked and then they go on next </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

1753
01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:25.770
<v Speaker 1>They don't even go on that week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wait in line all day and they go on </v>

1754
01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:27.370
<v Speaker 1>the next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why exactly.</v>

1755
01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:32.900
<v Speaker 1>We've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been rallying against this next </v>

1756
01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:32.900
<v Speaker 1>time I a control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1757
01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:37.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a ridiculous idea that he has that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in doing so he makes the club more </v>

1758
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:38.500
<v Speaker 1>special because it was always a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

1759
01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:39.340
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to get in,</v>

1760
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:42.400
<v Speaker 5>put your thumb on people that could </v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually like,</v>

1761
01:15:42.401 --> 01:15:43.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like say like,</v>

1762
01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:48.181
<v Speaker 5>this is my home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the club that showed me the </v>

1763
01:15:48.181 --> 01:15:48.181
<v Speaker 5>love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why?</v>

1764
01:15:48.181 --> 01:15:48.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1765
01:15:48.181 --> 01:15:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I never got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That same evil shit that makes producers</v>

1766
01:15:49.981 --> 01:15:53.520
<v Speaker 1>put someone on a reality show and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to own everything about them for the</v>

1767
01:15:53.521 --> 01:15:55.470
<v Speaker 1>next 10 years or whatever the fuck it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1768
01:15:55.471 --> 01:16:00.471
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like greedy thing that people do </v>

1769
01:16:00.471 --> 01:16:00.471
<v Speaker 1>out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird,</v>

1770
01:16:00.471 --> 01:16:03.180
<v Speaker 1>creepy fucking behavior where the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are coming up,</v>

1771
01:16:03.181 --> 01:16:08.181
<v Speaker 1>I'm not respected as potential equals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they do somehow another make it </v>

1772
01:16:08.181 --> 01:16:09.630
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never through their own merit.</v>

1773
01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It's because of the good nature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1774
01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your generosity.</v>

1775
01:16:14.881 --> 01:16:19.860
<v Speaker 1>That's led them to this position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a good a showbiz person.</v>

1776
01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I find it weird with any comedy club </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't have comics hanging out at </v>

1777
01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.171
<v Speaker 2>it and like they want people to hang out</v>
<v Speaker 2>like comp comedians to hang out like </v>

1778
01:16:29.171 --> 01:16:30.320
<v Speaker 2>that place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The laugh factory.</v>

1779
01:16:30.321 --> 01:16:32.180
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing that I've always </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard is like,</v>

1780
01:16:32.181 --> 01:16:33.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't let you hang out there.</v>

1781
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:36.530
<v Speaker 2>There's one getting to hang out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>

1782
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's only to a certain </v>

1783
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.590
<v Speaker 2>group of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1784
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:45.410
<v Speaker 2>the big guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the average comic is what that </v>

1785
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.410
<v Speaker 2>always tells me that</v>

1786
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:48.890
<v Speaker 5>I did a club on the road one time where </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a young comics hanging out.</v>

1787
01:16:48.891 --> 01:16:49.860
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1788
01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.890
<v Speaker 5>I talked to them for a little while and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1789
01:16:51.891 --> 01:16:53.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you guys want to go on like,</v>

1790
01:16:53.671 --> 01:16:55.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can put you guys on each one do like</v>

1791
01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:57.410
<v Speaker 5>seven minutes or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go for it.</v>

1792
01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.950
<v Speaker 5>And they told me and I confirmed with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the club that they go,</v>

1793
01:17:00.951 --> 01:17:05.951
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now the club doesn't do guest spots at </v>

1794
01:17:05.951 --> 01:17:05.951
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like at all.</v>

1795
01:17:05.951 --> 01:17:09.851
<v Speaker 5>I got thought it's kind of up to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't up to like the headliner if he </v>

1796
01:17:09.851 --> 01:17:09.851
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't care,</v>

1797
01:17:09.851 --> 01:17:10.090
<v Speaker 5>like it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go now that's</v>

1798
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.800
<v Speaker 3>just like our policy don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go and I told him when I talked to the</v>

1799
01:17:12.801 --> 01:17:13.640
<v Speaker 3>manager guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1800
01:17:13.641 --> 01:17:16.880
<v Speaker 3>why would you discourage comics from </v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out?</v>

1801
01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:17.780
<v Speaker 3>It's very like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1802
01:17:17.781 --> 01:17:19.670
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a friendly environment.</v>

1803
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Well Wendy Curtis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>shitty open mic show.</v>

1805

<v Speaker 3>shot at like hosting a weekend or you </v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1810
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.450

<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

1811
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:40.660
<v Speaker 3>why would you sell widgets and not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a widget development team?</v>

1814
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:49.280

01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Like she's developed a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians out of that club and she has </v>

1822
01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:08.480
<v Speaker 3>like a whole system of taking people </v>
<v Speaker 3>from MCS to relax to headliners.</v>

1823
01:18:08.490 --> 01:18:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really well thought out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like conscientious system of </v>

1824
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.060
<v Speaker 3>helping these artists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1825
01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:23.090
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they have their babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when people come to New York yet </v>

1826
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.090
<v Speaker 3>it's always a two coin flip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone's like what city?</v>

1827
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:24.500
<v Speaker 3>You're from Miami.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Should I say babies?</v>

1834
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:39.710
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you were saying that people </v>

1835

1837
01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 3>where they started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a coin flip.</v>

1838
01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Whether they're going to say it was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great experience.</v>

1839
01:18:47.501 --> 01:18:48.860
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very supportive of them.</v>

1840
01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:53.861
<v Speaker 3>They get behind some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the local clubs and then some they just </v>

<v Speaker 3>She was in wrestling.</v>

1872
01:19:57.711 --> 01:20:02.711
<v Speaker 3>She did some pro wrestling and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along the line she just </v>

1873
01:20:02.711 --> 01:20:02.711
<v Speaker 3>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>

1874
01:20:02.711 --> 01:20:04.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she started doing standup.</v>

1875
01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean now she's a pro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like what's funny and what's not funny.</v>

<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

1880
01:20:14.131 --> 01:20:15.630
<v Speaker 1>So she didn't fall in any pitfalls.</v>

1881
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I feel the ego stroke because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like when it's done,</v>

1882
01:20:18.301 --> 01:20:20.230
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean I hung out with a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>on it growing up.</v>

1936
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:43.460
<v Speaker 5>No one comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one gives a shit.</v>

1937
01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:45.880
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of them give a shit at all.</v>

1938
01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:50.890
<v Speaker 5>Come to your shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You mean once in a while one of them </v>

1939
01:22:50.890 --> 01:22:53.561
<v Speaker 5>will pop up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of times they'll say they're </v>

1940
01:22:53.561 --> 01:22:53.561
<v Speaker 5>coming and they don't show up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1941
01:22:53.561 --> 01:22:56.051
<v Speaker 5>I stopped giving a shit years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I realized that all at one time because </v>

1942
01:22:56.051 --> 01:22:57.530
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of them did come at once and </v>
<v Speaker 5>afterwards they were like,</v>

1943
01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.510
<v Speaker 5>good job man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're all going over.</v>

1944
01:22:59.511 --> 01:23:01.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like dollar beer night at the so </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so.</v>

1945
01:23:01.161 --> 01:23:02.090
<v Speaker 5>He went ahead and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1946
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:04.100
<v Speaker 5>hang here for a few minutes to catch up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and whatever.</v>

1947
01:23:04.101 --> 01:23:06.030
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the place kind of closes</v>

1948
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:07.780
<v Speaker 3>in like an hour and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

1949
01:23:07.781 --> 01:23:08.740
<v Speaker 3>bye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck faces.</v>

1950
01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:13.741
<v Speaker 3>I guess like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what did you want them to spend more </v>

1951
01:23:13.741 --> 01:23:16.591
<v Speaker 3>time having the Dodo vary by having seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people in a while and I was </v>

1952
01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:19.950
<v Speaker 3>genuinely curious about what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them but you didn't want to go to </v>

1953
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.950
<v Speaker 3>their spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just also,</v>

1954
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 3>they were very dismissive of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1955
01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.290
<v Speaker 3>like thanks dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good job.</v>

1956
01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 3>It's just seemed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't seem very.</v>

1957
01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Like if they would've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow dude,</v>

1958
01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.640
<v Speaker 3>this is a pretty extraordinary thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing at any point.</v>

1959
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying they had to say those </v>
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>

1960
01:23:32.231 --> 01:23:35.110
<v Speaker 3>but they showed that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes them have to face the fact that</v>

1961
01:23:35.111 --> 01:23:36.220
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1962
01:23:36.221 --> 01:23:39.070
<v Speaker 3>he said he was going to be a pilot but </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's working at a fucking gas station.</v>

1963
01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Do you attribute it to jealousy or </v>
<v Speaker 3>disinterest or what do you attribute it </v>

1964
01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:44.100
<v Speaker 3>to?</v>

1965
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:46.570
<v Speaker 3>It might be a little bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

1966
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:48.550
<v Speaker 3>but I know when I first started doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1967
01:23:48.551 --> 01:23:51.310
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you did taekwondo,</v>

1968
01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.550
<v Speaker 3>it's a heavy commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially because I started going after</v>

1969
01:23:54.551 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 3>the first year of just doing it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Philly,</v>

1970
01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Keith Robinson grabbed me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kurt Metzger and Kevin Hart and started </v>

1971
01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.501
<v Speaker 3>taking us up to New York and I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started not being able to do all the </v>

1972
01:24:04.501 --> 01:24:05.230
<v Speaker 3>bullshit with my friends that we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1973
01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't part of like dollar beer night </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

1974
01:24:07.121 --> 01:24:09.160
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or any of that shit.</v>

1975
01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.730
<v Speaker 3>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I would come back and be like,</v>

1976
01:24:12.731 --> 01:24:14.170
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this cool thing,</v>

1977
01:24:14.171 --> 01:24:15.250
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come check this out.</v>

1978
01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:16.390
<v Speaker 3>They were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1979
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1980
01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go do this,</v>

1981
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.630
<v Speaker 3>this neat show in Atlantic city or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the case always went live.</v>

1982
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:28.630
<v Speaker 3>When you're growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain people that you grow up </v>

1983
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:30.781
<v Speaker 3>with because they went to school with </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and then with your friends and some </v>

1984
01:24:30.781 --> 01:24:33.451
<v Speaker 3>folks evolve and develop and change and </v>
<v Speaker 3>grow and some people stagnate and </v>

1985
01:24:33.521 --> 01:24:36.190
<v Speaker 3>actually develop problems for themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>to distract themselves.</v>

1986
01:24:36.191 --> 01:24:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Like I grew up at some kids that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good friends and then they became</v>

1987
01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:42.400
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them became a pill head.</v>

1988
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:44.770
<v Speaker 3>Like he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't talk to me more.</v>

1989
01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.810
<v Speaker 3>If he called me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't call them back.</v>

1990
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:47.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could probably get ahold of me,</v>

1991
01:24:47.981 --> 01:24:50.950
<v Speaker 3>but he's too fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too fucked up.</v>

1992
01:24:50.951 --> 01:24:55.951
<v Speaker 3>I know his family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know all the disasters he's been </v>

1993
01:24:55.951 --> 01:24:58.651
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just said I'm not interested in </v>

1994
01:24:58.651 --> 01:25:00.211
<v Speaker 3>communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's going to be people like that </v>

1995
01:25:00.211 --> 01:25:01.981
<v Speaker 3>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you had to circumstantial </v>

1996
01:25:01.981 --> 01:25:01.981
<v Speaker 3>friendships in comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1997
01:25:01.981 --> 01:25:01.981
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like for you,</v>

1998
01:25:01.981 --> 01:25:03.450
<v Speaker 3>like you hung with someone for a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>while and then like,</v>

1999
01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.160
<v Speaker 3>I guess it really like the Rosa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he live with me for awhile?</v>

2000
01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:09.820
<v Speaker 3>When he first moved to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he moved out and we were tight,</v>

2001
01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:14.821
<v Speaker 3>we were together every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We drove in together to the city and </v>

2002
01:25:14.821 --> 01:25:18.150
<v Speaker 3>from Queens and hung out all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just don't describe being Joseph </v>

2003
01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:18.160
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's my buddy for sure,</v>

2004
01:25:18.161 --> 01:25:23.161
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I'm probably the 30th person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would call him if he had good news </v>

2005
01:25:23.161 --> 01:25:23.410
<v Speaker 3>and his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2006
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably hear it third hand first </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have no beef at all.</v>

2007
01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:32.650
<v Speaker 3>When I see him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd love to catch up and bullshit and </v>

2008
01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:32.650
<v Speaker 3>have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

2009
01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Like it turns out the issue just you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need more from him.</v>

2010
01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying I need more from him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even call me too.</v>

2011
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's angry at my racism is also.</v>

2012
01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Anthony Kumi a thing of the day was</v>

2013
01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:46.060
<v Speaker 3>just so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did our show and uh,</v>

2014
01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:51.061
<v Speaker 3>I heard you on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went on this long thing that was very </v>

2015
01:25:51.061 --> 01:25:53.200
<v Speaker 3>jilted lover ish in a lot of ways about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kumi not calling.</v>

2016
01:25:53.210 --> 01:25:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

2017
01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.920
<v Speaker 3>it's just call him because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also recognized that the guy's busy.</v>

2018
01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:02.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he defended all these other people but </v>

2019
01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:02.100
<v Speaker 3>he didn't defend me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2020
01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:02.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man,</v>

2021
01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 3>cause he didn't like talk about you </v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

2022
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're upset at them.</v>

2023
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:10.910
<v Speaker 1>And then there was this accusations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism that they also didn't discuss.</v>

2024
01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:11.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2025
01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:13.070
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2026
01:26:13.071 --> 01:26:16.250
<v Speaker 1>So all of it could have been handled </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2027
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Watch them go on the Anthony Show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2028
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look how that end.</v>

2029
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.780
<v Speaker 1>It should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should have never.</v>

2030
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:28.340
<v Speaker 1>You should never just written them off </v>
<v Speaker 1>if a guy's your friend and he's involved</v>

2031
01:26:28.341 --> 01:26:31.430
<v Speaker 1>in some sort of a public crisis like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony was,</v>

2032
01:26:31.930 --> 01:26:36.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all you have to recognize </v>

2033
01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous amount of stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in any sort of physical </v>

2034
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:41.651
<v Speaker 1>altercation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't expect people to behave </v>

2035
01:26:41.651 --> 01:26:41.651
<v Speaker 1>rationally after someone punched him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

2036
01:26:41.651 --> 01:26:43.880
<v Speaker 1>And then two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't expect people to behave rationally</v>

2037
01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:48.881
<v Speaker 1>after like gigantic groups of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>start calling you a racist and saying,</v>

2038
01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:55.211
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're doing by writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the is like essentially a hate </v>

2039
01:26:55.211 --> 01:26:55.211
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>

2040
01:26:55.211 --> 01:26:59.500
<v Speaker 1>He got fired from your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People Rally for you to get fired from </v>

2041

<v Speaker 1>your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people rally for you to get </v>

2042
01:27:02.261 --> 01:27:03.761

<v Speaker 1>They want other people to boycott the </v>

2043
01:27:03.761 --> 01:27:04.020
<v Speaker 1>show and cancel Sirius xm because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2044
01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:09.020
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot stress going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that he's ignoring Jojo tweets.</v>

2045
01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What version of the thing did you see?</v>

2047
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:15.740
<v Speaker 1>That job is a little bit selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2048
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I love Joe.</v>

2049
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:21.940
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes joe a really funny </v>

2050
01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:22.850
<v Speaker 1>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he obsesses on things.</v>

2051
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
<v Speaker 1>He thinks about things until he finds </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what's really funny about them and </v>

2052
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.461
<v Speaker 1>then he figures out a way to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage and figures out a way to cut it </v>

2053
01:27:30.461 --> 01:27:30.620
<v Speaker 1>down to like a really funny joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great comic.</v>

2054
01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't that same sort of curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensibility,</v>

2055
01:27:34.701 --> 01:27:35.690
<v Speaker 1>obsession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those.</v>

2056
01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.060
<v Speaker 1>The combination of things mixed together</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a stew.</v>

2057
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:43.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I could fuck with your </v>

2058
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.390
<v Speaker 1>personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2059
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2060
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if,</v>

2061
01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.850
<v Speaker 1>if it was a more rational circumstance </v>
<v Speaker 1>for anthony,</v>

2062
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.120
<v Speaker 1>more rational response by Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they could have had a </v>

2063
01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:52.820
<v Speaker 1>conversation about it and work through </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think they did kind of,</v>

2064
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:55.310
<v Speaker 5>I just don't understand how joe in any </v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

2065
01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:58.460
<v Speaker 5>shape or form had a feeling where it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this effect to him in some way.</v>

2066
01:27:58.670 --> 01:27:59.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I had,</v>

2067
01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:02.320
<v Speaker 5>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got tweets that were like a,</v>

2068
01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cancel Sirius xm standby.</v>

2069
01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:07.080
<v Speaker 5>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just didn't.</v>

2070
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Not that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2071
01:28:09.261 --> 01:28:09.920
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2072
01:28:09.921 --> 01:28:10.670
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2073
01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:12.970
<v Speaker 5>Anthony [inaudible] podcast after that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and talk to I,</v>

2074
01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am,</v>

2075
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:17.420
<v Speaker 5>I understand why he did what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he should've done the way he did</v>

2076
01:28:17.421 --> 01:28:22.421
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a better way to handle </v>

2077
01:28:22.421 --> 01:28:22.421
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he does too.</v>

2078
01:28:22.421 --> 01:28:22.421
<v Speaker 5>Of course he does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm saying,</v>

2079
01:28:22.421 --> 01:28:23.330
<v Speaker 5>but I just think like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2080
01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:26.000
<v Speaker 5>but it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree that serious fired him.</v>

2081
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:29.360
<v Speaker 5>I wish he didn't get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have done it myself,</v>

2082
01:28:29.361 --> 01:28:31.640
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not blown up when they said he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>fired,</v>

2083
01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:32.570
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

2084
01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:37.600
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I completely understand that the </v>

2085
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:37.600
<v Speaker 5>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the shit though will rain down on them.</v>

2086
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.900
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't worth it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they fired him.</v>

2087
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:39.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand.</v>

2088
01:28:39.741 --> 01:28:40.660
<v Speaker 5>It's a business call,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

2089
01:28:40.770 --> 01:28:45.770
<v Speaker 1>it is kind of a business call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a business call to not do </v>

2090
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:45.780
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to decide like what,</v>

2091
01:28:45.781 --> 01:28:48.140
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what helps your business giving that guy</v>

2092
01:28:48.141 --> 01:28:53.141
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity to express himself on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show would have generated a tremendous </v>

2093
01:28:53.141 --> 01:28:53.141
<v Speaker 1>amount of ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2094
01:28:53.141 --> 01:28:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if he'd done it eloquently,</v>

2095
01:28:55.701 --> 01:29:00.701
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure he would've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would've been a tremendous amount </v>

2096
01:29:00.701 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 1>of support for keeping them on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his,</v>

2097
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.520
<v Speaker 1>his argument in his assertion about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>black community has always been there's </v>

2098
01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.580
<v Speaker 1>a violence problem in the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

2099
01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not that he's racist against all </v>
<v Speaker 1>black people.</v>

2100
01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:16.040
<v Speaker 1>What his point has always been is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of folks that are not </v>

2101
01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.210
<v Speaker 1>willing to concede that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence issue and he thinks there is an</v>

2102
01:29:18.211 --> 01:29:19.170
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2103
01:29:19.171 --> 01:29:24.171
<v Speaker 1>where he and I don't know what his take </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the social ramifications or the </v>

2104
01:29:24.171 --> 01:29:28.410
<v Speaker 1>reasons for this racial issue or there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence issue in the black community.</v>

2105
01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:30.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an economic thing.</v>

2106
01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:32.040
<v Speaker 1>And what I've always pointed to is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gypsies,</v>

2107
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Gypsies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in England and Ireland and who are </v>

2108
01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:40.341
<v Speaker 1>constantly getting involved in crime and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and the bare knuckle </v>

2109
01:29:40.341 --> 01:29:41.420
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers and they're white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2110
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:43.950
<v Speaker 1>those type of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2111
01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the people that live in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically challenging situations </v>

2112
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:50.430
<v Speaker 1>where there's a lot of bad people around</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a lot of crime and violence.</v>

2113
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the atmosphere you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in.</v>

2114
01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:55.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the soup you fucking were born </v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

2115
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:57.150
<v Speaker 1>And the shit's hard to deal with for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2116
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:03.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what he did is also a </v>
<v Speaker 1>function of that form of media.</v>

2117
01:30:05.671 --> 01:30:10.671
<v Speaker 1>Like doing things in 140 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can express yourself very good in </v>

2118
01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:10.860
<v Speaker 1>140 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you take,</v>

2119
01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:16.190
<v Speaker 1>even if you take something from </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you said in this podcast and </v>

2120
01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:17.160
<v Speaker 1>put it in 140 characters in quotes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on a tweet,</v>

2121
01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:18.750
<v Speaker 1>it could make it look like a real piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Shit,</v>

2122
01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:19.380
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2123
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:21.350
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what it really was like,</v>

2124
01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.260
<v Speaker 5>he just tweeted out what he should just </v>
<v Speaker 5>said.</v>

2125
01:30:24.261 --> 01:30:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Well he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2126
01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.620
<v Speaker 5>exact part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a piece of plywood or no,</v>

2127
01:30:27.621 --> 01:30:32.621
<v Speaker 5>he should have set it on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But by then he could have gotten a way </v>

2128
01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:38.261
<v Speaker 5>to say it so eloquently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about in that moment of </v>

2129
01:30:38.261 --> 01:30:39.530
<v Speaker 5>fury,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to call a friend who's going to</v>

2130
01:30:39.531 --> 01:30:40.100
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

2131
01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:40.760
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2132
01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:45.850
<v Speaker 5>I know you're so right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then 15 minutes later when you calm </v>

2133
01:30:45.850 --> 01:30:45.850
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>

2134
01:30:45.850 --> 01:30:45.930
<v Speaker 5>of course I don't hit every black </v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

2135
01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.650
<v Speaker 5>It's like he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he vented and I said,</v>

2136
01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:53.700
<v Speaker 5>and he's such a guy who's used to </v>
<v Speaker 5>preaching to the choir and he forgot </v>

2137
01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.850
<v Speaker 5>that there's like regular people behind </v>
<v Speaker 5>that choir that I'm going to be like,</v>

2138
01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:58.110
<v Speaker 5>we're waiting to hear catch that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Catch them like it's way easier.</v>

2139
01:30:58.111 --> 01:30:58.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2140
01:30:58.270 --> 01:31:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Take your tweet and retweet it than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to say,</v>

2141
01:31:00.611 --> 01:31:01.240
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>

2142
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:06.270
<v Speaker 1>listen to Anthony on Sirius xm this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning when he was going off about how </v>

2143
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:08.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a violence problem in the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>community and all the crazy shit that he</v>

2144
01:31:08.591 --> 01:31:10.600
<v Speaker 1>screamed and yelled about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing,</v>

2145
01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:14.140
<v Speaker 1>but to someone to just take those tweets</v>
<v Speaker 1>and retweet them or take them to cut and</v>

2146
01:31:14.141 --> 01:31:17.560
<v Speaker 1>paste them and put them in a blog </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely outside of the context of who</v>

2147
01:31:17.561 --> 01:31:22.561
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your style of communicating with </v>

2148
01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:26.340
<v Speaker 1>has always been on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The style of communicating on the show </v>

2149
01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:26.530
<v Speaker 1>has always been him screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's always done that,</v>

2150
01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:30.310
<v Speaker 1>so when he does that in a twitter form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's par for the course.</v>

2151
01:31:30.311 --> 01:31:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just when he does it on the radio,</v>

2152
01:31:33.850 --> 01:31:36.010
<v Speaker 1>the people that are going to be upset at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2153
01:31:36.130 --> 01:31:38.770
<v Speaker 1>they would have to listen to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to get to that.</v>

2154
01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:41.950
<v Speaker 1>They would have to listen to that chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone would have to alert them to it.</v>

2155
01:31:41.951 --> 01:31:44.230
<v Speaker 1>They'd have to like listen to it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>play out.</v>

2156
01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.090
<v Speaker 1>All they have to do is just hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

2157
01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:47.350
<v Speaker 1>retweet it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

2158
01:31:47.351 --> 01:31:52.351
<v Speaker 1>retweet it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it on a blog and then a bunch of </v>

2159
01:31:52.351 --> 01:31:52.540
<v Speaker 1>fucking outrage attached to it and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these accusations,</v>

2160
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:53.130
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2161
01:31:53.130 --> 01:31:54.720
<v Speaker 5>what do you do at that point?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean on.</v>

2162
01:31:54.721 --> 01:31:59.721
<v Speaker 5>In your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you come out in high defense of </v>

2163
01:31:59.721 --> 01:32:01.900
<v Speaker 5>yourself or do you just go sit back and </v>
<v Speaker 5>go?</v>

2164
01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.600
<v Speaker 5>My.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His resume kind of speaks for itself.</v>

2165
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:09.601
<v Speaker 5>Like you could just look at his body of </v>
<v Speaker 5>work and notes that he's clearly not a </v>

2166
01:32:09.601 --> 01:32:10.400
<v Speaker 5>outwardly racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like that.</v>

2167
01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:15.450
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people who want to kill those </v>

2168
01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:15.450
<v Speaker 5>people to his world or like</v>

2169
01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:16.110
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people disagree with you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people disagree with you.</v>

2170
01:32:16.111 --> 01:32:18.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people take a lot of the things</v>

2171
01:32:18.721 --> 01:32:23.721
<v Speaker 1>that he said on the radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut them out of context and put it up </v>

2172
01:32:23.721 --> 01:32:26.940
<v Speaker 1>and say that these are more pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that he's racist.</v>

2173
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's frustrated.</v>

2174
01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that he liked a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been involved in these types </v>

2175
01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.621
<v Speaker 1>of scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only see the person's attacking you </v>

2176
01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:41.991
<v Speaker 1>and you only see the group that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attached to and if I lived in </v>

2177
01:32:41.991 --> 01:32:43.380
<v Speaker 1>New York and I had to deal with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit on a regular basis,</v>

2178
01:32:43.381 --> 01:32:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much bullshit he deals </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2179
01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:49.820
<v Speaker 1>but whether it was bullshit coming from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish people or it's bullshit coming </v>

2180
01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:49.820
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2181
01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Asian people that are fuck with me all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2182
01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you were living in a group </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's a certain number of people</v>

2183
01:32:56.041 --> 01:32:58.710
<v Speaker 1>from x community that are causing a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of crimes,</v>

2184
01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you're always gonna have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration.</v>

2185
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:02.190
<v Speaker 1>You're going always going to be upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

2186
01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where his head's at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2187
01:33:04.861 --> 01:33:09.861
<v Speaker 1>I've never had like long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like uncensored conversations with him </v>

2188
01:33:09.861 --> 01:33:13.431
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to him on the radio and I </v>

2189
01:33:13.431 --> 01:33:13.431
<v Speaker 1>love talking to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I.</v>

2190
01:33:13.431 --> 01:33:13.470
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say no,</v>

2191
01:33:13.471 --> 01:33:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just not scared of speaking</v>

2192
01:33:17.821 --> 01:33:22.800
<v Speaker 1>his mind about very controversial issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could very easily come across cross</v>

2193
01:33:22.801 --> 01:33:27.801
<v Speaker 1>as racism when he's describing things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like very real statistics like crime </v>

2194
01:33:28.531 --> 01:33:30.990
<v Speaker 1>statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're undeniable mean if you look</v>

2195
01:33:30.991 --> 01:33:35.991
<v Speaker 1>at crime statistics and the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>young African American men that are in </v>

2196
01:33:35.991 --> 01:33:36.690
<v Speaker 1>jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking bananas.</v>

2197
01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's bananas representative of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population as a whole.</v>

2198
01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Like this small amount of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are black and then the large amount of </v>

2199
01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:45.690
<v Speaker 1>black guys that are in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would go,</v>

2200
01:33:45.691 --> 01:33:47.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well is that evidence of racism?</v>

2201
01:33:48.230 --> 01:33:53.230
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're being prosecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it evidence that they're </v>

2202
01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:54.390
<v Speaker 1>committing far more crimes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a combination of both?</v>

2203
01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Is it a lack of social awareness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has allowed these inner cities to get </v>

2204
01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:01.110
<v Speaker 1>completely out of hand and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>impoverished neighborhoods the.</v>

2205
01:34:01.111 --> 01:34:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

2206
01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.510
<v Speaker 5>but all the fury is just going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2207
01:34:03.511 --> 01:34:04.240
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2208
01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:05.770
<v Speaker 5>some black bitch basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2209
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:10.830
<v Speaker 5>just to just be so dismissive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This no one's carrying about the </v>

2210
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.830
<v Speaker 5>statistics he's throwing out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're only focusing,</v>

2211
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:13.740
<v Speaker 5>but my point is you can get those facts </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2212
01:34:14.490 --> 01:34:16.710
<v Speaker 5>If it had been a bunch of Irish people </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was like,</v>

2213
01:34:16.711 --> 01:34:17.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2214
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:23.030
<v Speaker 5>this mic ginger fuck just punched me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>punched me in the face because he's </v>

2215
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040
<v Speaker 5>white.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could do it,</v>

2216
01:34:23.041 --> 01:34:27.090
<v Speaker 5>but he could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then his tweets would resonate more.</v>

2217
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:32.120
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't make any kind of news,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at least it would resonate more if </v>

2218
01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:32.120
<v Speaker 5>he had some kind of facts and figures to</v>
<v Speaker 5>support,</v>

2219
01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the violence problem.</v>

2220
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I find it interesting though that after </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this recent shit about him being </v>

2221
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:45.191
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he doesn't just kinda back off and </v>

2222
01:34:45.191 --> 01:34:45.710
<v Speaker 2>just for like a year talk about cupcakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

2223
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:49.720
<v Speaker 2>He's actually pushing it almost to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of like,</v>

2224
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.190
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

2225
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:53.510
<v Speaker 5>you're like is really proven</v>

2226
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:55.070
<v Speaker 2>my speech and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2227
01:34:55.071 --> 01:34:56.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything like that.</v>

2228
01:34:56.541 --> 01:34:59.390
<v Speaker 2>He's almost to make a point about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2229
01:34:59.470 --> 01:35:00.070
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

2230
01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:01.570
<v Speaker 3>what are the examples you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about?</v>

2231
01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2232
01:35:02.231 --> 01:35:05.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after all this thing of him being racist</v>

2233
01:35:05.681 --> 01:35:10.681
<v Speaker 2>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he started going off on Ferguson </v>

2234
01:35:10.681 --> 01:35:10.681
<v Speaker 2>Ferguson stuff and then.</v>

2235
01:35:10.681 --> 01:35:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you see when you talk about </v>

2236
01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:17.371
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do you know specifically what he </v>

2237
01:35:17.371 --> 01:35:17.371
<v Speaker 3>said about Ferguson?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I can pull it up at that memory.</v>

2238
01:35:17.371 --> 01:35:19.810
<v Speaker 3>What we know is about what Joe Derosa </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about the other day,</v>

2239
01:35:19.811 --> 01:35:24.811
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't cite any specifics either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what Anthony said about </v>

2240
01:35:24.811 --> 01:35:28.621
<v Speaker 3>Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I knew that I can comment on it </v>

2241
01:35:28.621 --> 01:35:28.621
<v Speaker 3>specifically.</v>

2242
01:35:28.621 --> 01:35:28.621
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2243
01:35:28.621 --> 01:35:32.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean I follow them on twitter and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still doing silly things that you </v>

2244
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:33.220
<v Speaker 2>think about Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:35:33.221 --> 01:35:38.221
<v Speaker 2>You gotta keep blowing stuff up to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>that deep into that point.</v>

2246
01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.730
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is you can go on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and see what I'm saying,</v>

2247
01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:43.630
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't back off.</v>

2248
01:35:43.631 --> 01:35:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have.</v>

2249
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:46.210
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't back off for a reason.</v>

2250
01:35:46.211 --> 01:35:47.650
<v Speaker 2>It seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people,</v>

2251
01:35:47.651 --> 01:35:49.780
<v Speaker 2>if you got that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you lost your job,</v>

2252
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:52.750
<v Speaker 2>you got in trouble on twitter about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain subject.</v>

2253
01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm like alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to talk about Pi for </v>

2254
01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:57.840
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely</v>

2255
01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:57.840
<v Speaker 3>because he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he immediately show,</v>

2256
01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he immediately made like a chunk of </v>

2257
01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:02.290
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2258
01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:02.290
<v Speaker 3>it's like a netflix subscription type </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2259
01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:06.890
<v Speaker 3>So he immediately made like a gang of </v>
<v Speaker 3>money off that I assume so.</v>

2260
01:36:06.891 --> 01:36:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how well he's doing,</v>

2261
01:36:08.961 --> 01:36:10.490
<v Speaker 3>but I hope he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

2262
01:36:10.670 --> 01:36:15.670
<v Speaker 3>I thought that it'd be probably smarter </v>
<v Speaker 3>if he did it through subscription that </v>

2263
01:36:15.670 --> 01:36:15.670
<v Speaker 3>way more or through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2264
01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:21.170
<v Speaker 3>through advertisers because advertisers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>

2265
01:36:21.171 --> 01:36:26.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to get a large number of </v>

2266
01:36:26.171 --> 01:36:26.171
<v Speaker 3>people that are gonna listen to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if it's free,</v>

2267
01:36:26.171 --> 01:36:26.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2268
01:36:26.171 --> 01:36:27.980
<v Speaker 3>but he's Kinda like hamstringing himself</v>
<v Speaker 3>by making a subscription service.</v>

2269
01:36:27.981 --> 01:36:30.000
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's tough to make it costs </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2270
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Like you're definitely cutting people </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of it,</v>

2271
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.710
<v Speaker 3>but I think there'll be an initial </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2272
01:36:33.711 --> 01:36:36.380
<v Speaker 3>but you have to like get people to catch</v>
<v Speaker 3>latch on board.</v>

2273
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:41.030
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to get people to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>for Shit on the Internet in this day and</v>

2274
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:46.030
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Howard Stern Howard stern gives you </v>

2275
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.030
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2276
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean you basically are paying for </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious for like that or,</v>

2277
01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:51.580
<v Speaker 3>and a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't argue that like starring </v>

2278
01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:51.580
<v Speaker 3>channel that gives you tons of energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>for what you're paying.</v>

2279
01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Like he gives you a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2280
01:36:53.061 --> 01:36:58.061
<v Speaker 3>It's like him all day and other shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's old content and just like </v>

2281
01:36:58.061 --> 01:36:59.660
<v Speaker 3>fun productions and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not online.</v>

2282
01:36:59.661 --> 01:37:02.150
<v Speaker 3>That's on serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you subscribed to series,</v>

2283
01:37:02.151 --> 01:37:03.410
<v Speaker 3>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get that online took.</v>

2284
01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2285
01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:05.690
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying but I told her for making</v>
<v Speaker 3>people pay for something.</v>

2286
01:37:05.691 --> 01:37:08.510
<v Speaker 3>But he had but he did 20 some years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving it for free.</v>

2287
01:37:08.511 --> 01:37:13.511
<v Speaker 3>So now you can get or you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about two different </v>

2288
01:37:13.511 --> 01:37:16.391
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about satellite radio or </v>

2289
01:37:16.391 --> 01:37:16.391
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about Internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>subscription.</v>

2290
01:37:16.391 --> 01:37:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Does he have an internet subscription?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was same thing.</v>

2291
01:37:16.551 --> 01:37:19.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is like you could watch it </v>
<v Speaker 3>online sterns thing.</v>

2292
01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:21.500
<v Speaker 3>Well Sorta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's satellite radio.</v>

2293
01:37:21.501 --> 01:37:26.501
<v Speaker 3>You're working for a company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not like what Anthony's </v>

2294
01:37:26.501 --> 01:37:29.081
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony's doing completely independent </v>

2295
01:37:29.081 --> 01:37:29.081
<v Speaker 3>Internet subscription thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was confused,</v>

2296
01:37:29.081 --> 01:37:33.460
<v Speaker 3>but now Howard went from being for free </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ask for basically it costs money to </v>

2297
01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.370
<v Speaker 3>listen to them if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying,</v>

2298
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.450
<v Speaker 3>oop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going from like,</v>

2299
01:37:35.451 --> 01:37:40.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't live as a free and then years </v>

2300
01:37:40.451 --> 01:37:40.451
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2301
01:37:40.451 --> 01:37:43.070
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't a specific charge for Sirius </v>
<v Speaker 3>xm even though he was like,</v>

2302
01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:43.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't.</v>

2303
01:37:43.611 --> 01:37:48.611
<v Speaker 3>But now he's asking for a netflix amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of money for one show.</v>

2304
01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:50.660
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no variety.</v>

2305
01:37:50.690 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 3>There's no like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2306
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.030
<v Speaker 3>he's not really giving you anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>besides.</v>

2307
01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very true to our show.</v>

2308
01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 3>It's very different because first of</v>

2309
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.500
<v Speaker 1>all serious is in so many cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you buy it,</v>

2310
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:03.860
<v Speaker 1>you buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a 90 day subscription and it </v>

2311
01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:05.400
<v Speaker 1>plays and you get to listen to stern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get addicted to it and listen to all</v>

2312
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:06.900
<v Speaker 1>the different music channels to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to it.</v>

2313
01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:10.470
<v Speaker 1>But you're paying for satellite radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not paying for a specific show on</v>

2314
01:38:10.471 --> 01:38:15.471
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a complete total difference in </v>

2315
01:38:15.471 --> 01:38:17.571
<v Speaker 1>what you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the get something on the Internet </v>

2316
01:38:17.571 --> 01:38:18.270
<v Speaker 1>is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to pay for.</v>

2317
01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Get people to pay for something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet.</v>

2318
01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:23.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not difficult to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribe to satellite radio,</v>

2319
01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 1>especially the satellite radios in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

2320
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Bazillions of people like Netflix and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all Internet based.</v>

2321
01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix gives you thousands of options.</v>

2322
01:38:31.471 --> 01:38:36.471
<v Speaker 1>That's the point I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard to be able to pay for </v>

2323
01:38:36.471 --> 01:38:36.471
<v Speaker 1>like one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hour show a day,</v>

2324
01:38:36.471 --> 01:38:40.551
<v Speaker 1>four days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flicks his movies and television shows </v>

2325
01:38:40.551 --> 01:38:40.551
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2326
01:38:40.551 --> 01:38:41.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're paying for Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're paying for something that you can</v>

2327
01:38:41.701 --> 01:38:43.980
<v Speaker 1>watch on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it gives you a good watch,</v>

2328
01:38:43.981 --> 01:38:48.981
<v Speaker 1>anthony show on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not how most people are </v>

2329
01:38:48.981 --> 01:38:51.591
<v Speaker 1>probably watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet the majority of the people that </v>

2330
01:38:51.591 --> 01:38:53.730
<v Speaker 1>listened to a show or getting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting it on like as a,</v>

2331
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.760
<v Speaker 1>as an audio thing that they listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the subway or something or in the </v>

2332
01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.521
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what most people do with these </v>

2333
01:39:01.521 --> 01:39:01.521
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just it's hard to get people to pay</v>

2334
01:39:01.521 --> 01:39:02.300
<v Speaker 1>for Shit online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2335
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:07.310
<v Speaker 1>People are trying to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like drive plus is a drive is a youtube </v>

2336
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:08.450
<v Speaker 1>channel that I really love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

2337
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:13.570
<v Speaker 1>it's all about very sports cars and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inner workings of them and they do all </v>

2338
01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:18.381
<v Speaker 1>these really cool in depth pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just changed their format and then </v>

2339
01:39:18.381 --> 01:39:22.090
<v Speaker 1>it became drive plus and they made </v>
<v Speaker 1>people subscribed to it and the video </v>

2340
01:39:22.681 --> 01:39:23.310
<v Speaker 1>they did it to.</v>

2341
01:39:23.310 --> 01:39:25.350
<v Speaker 1>The first one was one that I was a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

2342
01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:30.620
<v Speaker 1>This shark works company that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>these cars and the comments were just </v>

2343
01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:34.290
<v Speaker 1>filled with pissed off people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so fucking mad.</v>

2344
01:39:34.710 --> 01:39:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were so mad that all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden they were going to be forced to </v>

2345
01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:40.770
<v Speaker 1>have to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the amount of month is.</v>

2346
01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was a lot like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks or something.</v>

2347
01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>

2348
01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:50.930
<v Speaker 1>the entire comments for the video was </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about people being angry that they </v>

2349
01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:52.710
<v Speaker 1>had to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The to Hulu thing was with their or fall</v>

2350
01:39:52.711 --> 01:39:54.420
<v Speaker 1>off or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they went from,</v>

2351
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:59.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have it all for free to like now we </v>

2352
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.510
<v Speaker 1>charge you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet they lost a lot of people.</v>

2354
01:39:59.510 --> 01:40:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't want to pay for shit,</v>

2355
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but Netflix is so good.</v>

2356
01:40:03.810 --> 01:40:08.810
<v Speaker 1>There's so much stuff and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own independent programming like </v>

2357
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:12.800
<v Speaker 1>that house of cards show or they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a Chelsea handler's going to do a </v>

2358
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:12.800
<v Speaker 1>show on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're.</v>

2359
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:15.780
<v Speaker 1>They're actually becoming like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>

2360
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:20.870
<v Speaker 1>so if you pay x amount a month for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of content that they have </v>

2361
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:25.040
<v Speaker 1>access to is fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that plan to or they just </v>

2362
01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.010
<v Speaker 1>released the season as a whole right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2363
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:31.430
<v Speaker 1>That really does make for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's also some weird shit that </v>

2364
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:34.731
<v Speaker 1>goes on with them with like cable </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet providers and did different </v>

2365
01:40:34.731 --> 01:40:39.141
<v Speaker 1>internet providers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now they're going to have to pay </v>

2366
01:40:39.141 --> 01:40:39.690
<v Speaker 1>more because they use up more like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to cut deals.</v>

2367
01:40:39.691 --> 01:40:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they throttled back netflix </v>
<v Speaker 1>users.</v>

2368
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like weird shady shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to like bandwidth and how </v>

2369
01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:52.131
<v Speaker 1>much bandwidth is worth and how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth gets soaked up by different </v>

2370
01:40:52.131 --> 01:40:53.190
<v Speaker 1>applications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which shitty Ben Affleck,</v>

2371
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Justin timberlake movie</v>

2372
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:56.910
<v Speaker 5>or you're going to make about that guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting for bandwidth.</v>

2373
01:40:56.911 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 5>The behind the scenes war</v>

2374
01:40:59.370 --> 01:41:01.590
<v Speaker 4>with wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:02.550
<v Speaker 4>It's tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2376
01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:06.180
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to sell shit online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're a Netflix,</v>

2377
01:41:06.181 --> 01:41:11.181
<v Speaker 4>like if hbo became an online thing only </v>
<v Speaker 4>even with all their awesome shows that </v>

2378
01:41:11.181 --> 01:41:13.050
<v Speaker 4>they have there will be tough.</v>

2379
01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:18.300
<v Speaker 5>Although that said the hipsters have </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominated that world and a lot of them </v>

2380
01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:22.561
<v Speaker 5>don't do cable at all and just get like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a subscription to hbo go and Showtime </v>

2381
01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:25.720
<v Speaker 5>Dot Com and all that stuff and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>watch all their shit like that.</v>

2382
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.700
<v Speaker 5>Well there's a lot of people that do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>through itunes.</v>

2383
01:41:27.701 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do like apple,</v>

2384
01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd get an apple tv thing and you kind</v>

2385
01:41:31.261 --> 01:41:35.290
<v Speaker 5>of get a switch and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably cost you somewhere like 50</v>

2386
01:41:35.291 --> 01:41:40.291
<v Speaker 5>bucks a month and you could be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>much have access to everything like the </v>

2387
01:41:40.291 --> 01:41:40.291
<v Speaker 5>next day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty close.</v>

2388

<v Speaker 4>I mean I use a itunes for a.</v>

2389
01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:49.960
<v Speaker 4>I use the apple TV to watch that show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the strain and I tried to watch it on </v>

2390
01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.170
<v Speaker 4>regular TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2391
01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:53.630
<v Speaker 4>The fucking commercials make you </v>
<v Speaker 4>hemorrhage.</v>

2392
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:58.870
<v Speaker 4>You can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How often the fucking commercials come </v>

2393
01:41:58.870 --> 01:42:01.661
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a couple minutes in Bam as </v>

2394
01:42:01.661 --> 01:42:01.661
<v Speaker 4>another commercial and then a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes after that,</v>

2395
01:42:01.661 --> 01:42:02.570
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's another commercial like,</v>

2396
01:42:02.571 --> 01:42:03.470
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

2397
01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:05.790
<v Speaker 5>like they just assault you with </v>
<v Speaker 5>commercials.</v>

2398
01:42:05.970 --> 01:42:10.230
<v Speaker 5>I keep cable direct TV for a few.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the football package is huge,</v>

2399
01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:15.290
<v Speaker 5>but two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's also something that makes me </v>

2400
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:15.470
<v Speaker 5>feel like an adult having,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having,</v>

2401
01:42:15.610 --> 01:42:17.040
<v Speaker 5>having a cable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2402
01:42:17.041 --> 01:42:19.110
<v Speaker 5>Like you're supposed to have cable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why,</v>

2403
01:42:19.770 --> 01:42:21.240
<v Speaker 5>but it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It mean just like a.</v>

2404
01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:23.970
<v Speaker 5>either I stopped now but for a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2405
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:24.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beyond needing one.</v>

2406
01:42:24.991 --> 01:42:27.850
<v Speaker 5>I always had a house phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a land logs.</v>

2407
01:42:27.851 --> 01:42:32.851
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to have a landline just </v>

2408
01:42:32.851 --> 01:42:35.241
<v Speaker 5>in case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just gone off the cell phone </v>

2409
01:42:35.241 --> 01:42:35.241
<v Speaker 5>now</v>

2410
01:42:35.241 --> 01:42:38.410
<v Speaker 4>after a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's also like you don't ever want </v>

2411
01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:38.410
<v Speaker 4>to have something that you can't just </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn off.</v>

2412
01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:42.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The beautiful thing about cell phones </v>

2413
01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:42.640
<v Speaker 4>just shut that bitch off and nobody can </v>
<v Speaker 4>put.</v>

2414
01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:43.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2415
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:45.770
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like those,</v>

2416
01:42:45.771 --> 01:42:48.610
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people do that Netflix thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>now where they don't have cable.</v>

2417
01:42:48.611 --> 01:42:52.070
<v Speaker 4>I just have netflix and use the computer</v>
<v Speaker 4>for shit.</v>

2418
01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:54.620
<v Speaker 4>And then hook up one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do it right now.</v>

2419
01:42:54.621 --> 01:42:59.621
<v Speaker 4>I just went and it's great because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could just target what you want instead </v>

2420
01:42:59.621 --> 01:43:00.020
<v Speaker 4>of listening to background noise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much.</v>

2421
01:43:00.710 --> 01:43:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably smart.</v>

2422
01:43:01.671 --> 01:43:04.040
<v Speaker 4>Keep you from watching as much stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

2423
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Not just flipping through the channels </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you want,</v>

2424
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:11.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes there's a search process to </v>

2425
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.950
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I want to see here?</v>

2426
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:15.400
<v Speaker 4>And you'd go on and sometimes I'll take </v>
<v Speaker 4>a half an hour just looking for a good </v>

2427
01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:15.710
<v Speaker 4>movie to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just wasted half hour here.</v>

2428
01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:21.260
<v Speaker 5>But like having cable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'll never seek out the movie </v>

2429
01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:23.160
<v Speaker 5>breaking ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'll watch the last 45 minutes of it</v>

2430
01:43:23.161 --> 01:43:25.460
<v Speaker 5>three times a week if it plumps on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2431
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:27.600
<v Speaker 5>If I'm flipping through the channels and</v>
<v Speaker 5>roadhouse comes on,</v>

2432
01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:29.040
<v Speaker 5>it's like 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're not going to stop.</v>

2433
01:43:30.130 --> 01:43:33.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to wash that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a gift of the universe.</v>

2434
01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:38.520
<v Speaker 4>If you're like alone in a hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flipping through the channels and </v>

2435
01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:38.520
<v Speaker 4>Roadhouse,</v>

2436
01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:38.690
<v Speaker 5>you're on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll start laughing.</v>

2437
01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.720
<v Speaker 5>You gotta watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You owe it to the Jeff Healey band to </v>

2438
01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:43.720
<v Speaker 5>deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want you to be nice until it's time to</v>

2439
01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:45.580
<v Speaker 5>not be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How I know that is.</v>

2440
01:43:46.090 --> 01:43:51.090
<v Speaker 5>I will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my mom used to come home from work in </v>

2441
01:43:51.090 --> 01:43:51.090
<v Speaker 5>the middle of the night and feed my </v>
<v Speaker 5>little brother.</v>

2442
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 5>We didn't</v>

2443
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:57.130
<v Speaker 3>have cable and we had a VCR and we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>roadhouse and she'd watch roadhouse </v>

2444
01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:59.000
<v Speaker 3>every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother knows every road roadhouse.</v>

2445
01:43:59.001 --> 01:44:00.500
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2446
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:02.120
<v Speaker 3>it was a vhs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2447
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:04.340
<v Speaker 3>You have vhs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2448
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:10.060
<v Speaker 3>I had that and hard to kill on the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>tape and we watched it constantly.</v>

2449
01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.520
<v Speaker 3>You know what's amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could go back in time to when </v>

2450
01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:15.520
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2451
01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.730
<v Speaker 3>video stores were out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a local video store is like every </v>

2452
01:44:18.730 --> 01:44:18.920
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to like a local video store,</v>

2453
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:20.330
<v Speaker 3>like a mom and pop video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2454
01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:22.580
<v Speaker 3>And then the blockbuster came in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

2455
01:44:22.581 --> 01:44:23.620
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blockbusters.</v>

2456
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Gonna shut down all these mom and pop </v>
<v Speaker 3>video stores.</v>

2457
01:44:25.791 --> 01:44:28.760
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of ways they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except blockbuster didn't have porn.</v>

2458
01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:30.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what kept them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you wanted to get the porn,</v>

2459
01:44:30.981 --> 01:44:35.981
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to go to the mom and pop </v>
<v Speaker 3>video stores came back to that day when </v>

2460
01:44:35.981 --> 01:44:39.611
<v Speaker 3>those things were all like everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you said within a couple of decades </v>

2461
01:44:39.801 --> 01:44:41.420
<v Speaker 3>these won't even exist anymore to go.</v>

2462
01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:46.420
<v Speaker 3>You're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get everything out of </v>

2463
01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:46.420
<v Speaker 3>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will be like,</v>

2464
01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:46.420
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2465
01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:50.531
<v Speaker 3>he just going to press a button on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine and you're going to get it out </v>

2466
01:44:50.531 --> 01:44:53.261
<v Speaker 3>of the air specifically for porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you had to go through to like our </v>

2467
01:44:53.261 --> 01:44:57.281
<v Speaker 3>franchise in Philly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a place called west coast video </v>

2468
01:44:57.281 --> 01:44:58.520
<v Speaker 3>and you had it all and there's red </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxes.</v>

2469
01:44:58.521 --> 01:45:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Everything was going to have red box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>

2470
01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:03.430
<v Speaker 3>like the covers were up on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a red box.</v>

2471
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:08.680
<v Speaker 3>And the beauty of that was I would try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to just like find like my mom and step </v>

2472
01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:11.690
<v Speaker 3>pop would rent porno movies when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger I guess for them,</v>

2473
01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.990
<v Speaker 3>for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would they leave in the VCR.</v>

2474
01:45:14.991 --> 01:45:16.430
<v Speaker 3>We only had one VCR,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>

2475
01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:18.380
<v Speaker 3>I guess they'd watch it when I stayed at</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grandma's and I'd come,</v>

2476
01:45:18.381 --> 01:45:23.381
<v Speaker 3>I'd see the title of it and I will </v>
<v Speaker 3>always find titles that weren't very </v>

2477
01:45:23.381 --> 01:45:27.431
<v Speaker 3>porn sounding and then I would go stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>at my grandma's the next night and I </v>

2478
01:45:27.431 --> 01:45:27.530
<v Speaker 3>would tell her like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2479
01:45:27.531 --> 01:45:30.140
<v Speaker 3>if I reserve movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go pick them up and I would reserve.</v>

2480
01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:31.800
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My little grand mom,</v>

2481
01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:34.210
<v Speaker 3>go pick up porn movies for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's God.</v>

2482
01:45:34.630 --> 01:45:36.500
<v Speaker 3>She'd be wanting to make popcorn and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll watch it together.</v>

2483
01:45:36.501 --> 01:45:37.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2484
01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:41.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to probably watch it later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did she ever call you on it now?</v>

2485
01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:45.290
<v Speaker 3>But one time I never returned one and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they ended up calling and uh,</v>

2486
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:47.060
<v Speaker 3>to keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just tried to keep.</v>

2487
01:45:47.061 --> 01:45:48.530
<v Speaker 3>It was a terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even a point.</v>

2488
01:45:48.531 --> 01:45:50.030
<v Speaker 3>It was when I rented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a,</v>

2489
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.490
<v Speaker 3>like a skit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a maxi type thing.</v>

2490
01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:55.310
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend that if the videos were </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good,</v>

2491
01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:57.350
<v Speaker 3>he would not bring them back because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

2492
01:45:57.351 --> 01:45:59.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll take the penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to keep this one borns.</v>

2493
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a guy take me a court for that,</v>

2494
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:09.370
<v Speaker 3>for not returning and then eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the only reason I got the hook </v>

2495
01:46:09.370 --> 01:46:09.720
<v Speaker 3>eventually is it was a mom and pop place</v>
<v Speaker 3>that went on there.</v>

2496
01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:14.740
<v Speaker 3>It's called wow video.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You would eventually become a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would just get bored of it.</v>

2611
01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2612
01:51:00.671 --> 01:51:02.950
<v Speaker 3>But I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even now I had one point,</v>

2613
01:51:02.951 --> 01:51:05.590
<v Speaker 3>I lived with a guy who worked for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cable company,</v>

2614
01:51:05.591 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 3>so we got unblocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a shitty playboy channel.</v>

2615
01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Like how benign the playboy channel is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I was playing madden on the </v>

2616
01:51:14.261 --> 01:51:17.890
<v Speaker 3>loading screens on playstation two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would constantly flip back,</v>

2617
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:20.860
<v Speaker 3>like back and forth to the playbook to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see whatever it was [inaudible] there'll</v>

2618
01:51:20.861 --> 01:51:23.050
<v Speaker 3>be a girl with her pussy out and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would just for some reason I like,</v>

2619
01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:28.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to watch that for a minute and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then come back to the loading screen </v>

2620
01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:28.080
<v Speaker 3>date.</v>

2621
01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Remember when they had fake porn that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Emmanuelle series on showtime.</v>

2622
01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:34.630
<v Speaker 3>You'd watch these weird movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like kind of,</v>

2623
01:51:34.650 --> 01:51:39.650
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was romance that wasn't designed for </v>

2624
01:51:39.650 --> 01:51:42.481
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like romance that was designed </v>

2625
01:51:42.481 --> 01:51:44.821
<v Speaker 3>for couples or men to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it eventually got two people having </v>

2626
01:51:44.821 --> 01:51:49.261
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But all you really saw was like you saw </v>

2627
01:51:49.261 --> 01:51:51.730
<v Speaker 3>breasts and he saw the man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fake humping the girl.</v>

2628
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:56.910
<v Speaker 3>But he knows he saw no penetration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you could tell like their organs </v>

2629
01:51:56.910 --> 01:52:00.541
<v Speaker 3>were ms.like</v>
<v Speaker 3>their sexual organs were not lined up </v>

2630
01:52:00.541 --> 01:52:00.541
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was blowing them.</v>

2631
01:52:00.541 --> 01:52:01.390
<v Speaker 3>But she's like head butting him in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chest.</v>

2632
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if he was banging her like where's </v>

2633
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.550
<v Speaker 3>her pussy sitting there and belly </v>
<v Speaker 3>buttons.</v>

2634
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:07.630
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some strange place.</v>

2635
01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.230
<v Speaker 3>None of it made any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2636
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:12.060
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were fake Moan,</v>

2637
01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:14.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were always on late at night.</v>

2638
01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:16.470
<v Speaker 3>That crap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2639
01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.820
<v Speaker 3>do they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't jerk off that.</v>

2640
01:52:18.821 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Now if I tried for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I'm too far gone.</v>

2641
01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't go back.</v>

2642
01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:26.770
<v Speaker 3>But you could if you were like trapped </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

2643
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:32.070
<v Speaker 3>like if you were like in the Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 3>jungle for like six months and then all </v>

2644
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:32.560
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden you got to a hotel room </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2645
01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:34.600
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tv and you flip through the channels and</v>

2646
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:38.070
<v Speaker 3>carry on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emmanuelle was on and it was like little</v>

2647
01:52:38.090 --> 01:52:43.090
<v Speaker 3>shitty filter because there are those </v>
<v Speaker 3>cameras they used back then were dog </v>

2648
01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:46.741
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like there was no adhd really </v>

2649
01:52:46.741 --> 01:52:49.771
<v Speaker 3>low and kind of Fuzzy and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to be able to jerk off to like </v>

2650
01:52:49.771 --> 01:52:51.500
<v Speaker 3>the girls gone wild like promo video on </v>
<v Speaker 3>like each channel night.</v>

2651
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:54.380
<v Speaker 3>But I mean it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just such a thing of the past.</v>

2652
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:56.060
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was like,</v>

2653
01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.420
<v Speaker 3>how could you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you couldn't get so excited to the,</v>

2654
01:52:59.421 --> 01:53:00.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fattening thing.</v>

2655
01:53:00.681 --> 01:53:04.730
<v Speaker 3>All the celebrity nudes that came out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because still images.</v>

2656
01:53:04.731 --> 01:53:07.400
<v Speaker 3>I can't check off the still images </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2657
01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the only thing that's hard about it.</v>

2658
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Well they're hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just that they're famous and </v>

2659
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:17.650
<v Speaker 3>you know them from something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's always a big thing about porn </v>

2660
01:53:17.650 --> 01:53:19.370
<v Speaker 3>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people used to have this idea,</v>

2661
01:53:19.371 --> 01:53:22.790
<v Speaker 3>at least that the really beautiful women</v>
<v Speaker 3>were important stars to really beautiful</v>

2662
01:53:22.791 --> 01:53:25.280
<v Speaker 3>women were like Cindy Crawford or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2663
01:53:25.610 --> 01:53:27.710
<v Speaker 3>whoever fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Farrah Fawcett,</v>

2664
01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:30.090
<v Speaker 3>those are the really beautiful ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the porn stars zero.</v>

2665
01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:35.110
<v Speaker 3>A couple of notches behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's porn stars today that are </v>

2666
01:53:35.110 --> 01:53:35.820
<v Speaker 3>fucking tens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2667
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievably beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at and be like,</v>

2668
01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:41.990
<v Speaker 3>that girl could be Lindsay Lohan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She could be a supermodel.</v>

2669
01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:45.870
<v Speaker 3>She could be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's just getting old.</v>

2670
01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good Dick,</v>

2671
01:53:47.661 --> 01:53:48.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about.</v>

2672
01:53:49.190 --> 01:53:54.040
<v Speaker 3>But they've also like removed like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>excitement of exits.</v>

2673
01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:59.050
<v Speaker 3>So out there like there's still </v>
<v Speaker 3>something more exciting if you saw a </v>

2674
01:53:59.050 --> 01:54:01.781
<v Speaker 3>girl that was hot at the gas station and</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow you were able to see her 10 </v>

2675
01:54:01.781 --> 01:54:05.621
<v Speaker 3>minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do something where you opened the </v>

2676
01:54:05.621 --> 01:54:05.621
<v Speaker 3>door by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was naked.</v>

2677
01:54:05.621 --> 01:54:05.840
<v Speaker 3>That's way more exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2678
01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I guess because you're seeing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from a different context.</v>

2679
01:54:10.251 --> 01:54:15.251
<v Speaker 3>Like a porn star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're going to see if that </v>

2680
01:54:15.251 --> 01:54:16.580
<v Speaker 3>same pornstar happened to be the star of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Sitcom and you saw her naked.</v>

2681
01:54:16.581 --> 01:54:18.530
<v Speaker 3>That would make that so much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting.</v>

2682
01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:21.500
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know her from sucking Dick,</v>

2683
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:23.090
<v Speaker 3>like seeing her pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that exciting?</v>

2684
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:25.190
<v Speaker 3>I guess I see what you're saying.</v>

2685
01:54:25.250 --> 01:54:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you weren't being inundated with </v>

2686
01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:30.250
<v Speaker 3>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you.</v>

2687
01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:32.840
<v Speaker 3>If you're being inundated with porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the real issue is you get</v>

2688
01:54:32.841 --> 01:54:36.050
<v Speaker 3>numb to the porn and then with the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>excitement is like,</v>

2689
01:54:36.051 --> 01:54:37.820
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not supposed to be seeing this porn.</v>

2690
01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:39.710
<v Speaker 3>So it makes it exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My favorite comment,</v>

2691
01:54:39.711 --> 01:54:44.711
<v Speaker 3>if you weren't going video shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you weren't getting inundated with </v>

2692
01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:46.280
<v Speaker 3>porn and then you saw some porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some naked sex,</v>

2693
01:54:46.281 --> 01:54:47.900
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is great.</v>

2694
01:54:47.901 --> 01:54:49.770
<v Speaker 3>You get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2695
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Numbness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

2696
01:54:51.591 --> 01:54:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you're also get like A.</v>

2697
01:54:53.810 --> 01:54:57.080

<v Speaker 3>off and fucking three minutes.</v>

2698
01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Now it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole process because you're </v>

2699
01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:02.140
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could find a better video.</v>

2700
01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:04.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like a challenge to yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then the head shake.</v>

2701
01:55:04.011 --> 01:55:09.011
<v Speaker 3>You make it yourself when you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>jerking off to that third one you found </v>

2702

<v Speaker 5>She says she doesn't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gets really,</v>

2752
01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:09.230
<v Speaker 5>first thing he tries to do is hit her </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the baby.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This is a great thing.</v>

2755
01:57:12.081 --> 01:57:17.081
<v Speaker 5>People want to see your beautiful body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He does that for about five minutes and </v>

<v Speaker 5>Can waste my fucking time.</v>

2760
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:28.450
<v Speaker 5>And then she agreed to do it and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary guy step in and they turn </v>

2761
01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:32.141
<v Speaker 5>the camera off and just says like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at this point we thought she wasn't </v>

2762
01:57:32.141 --> 01:57:32.141
<v Speaker 5>responsible for self anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They pulled her out of it.</v>

2763
01:57:32.141 --> 01:57:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a hundred percent confirmed?</v>

2764
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Did you sure that this wasn't in any way</v>
<v Speaker 3>set up?</v>

2765
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:42.990
<v Speaker 3>That's why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of these porn </v>

2766
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:42.990
<v Speaker 3>scenarios where they do a casting </v>
<v Speaker 3>couches.</v>

2767
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:42.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2768
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:45.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a documentary couches.</v>

2769
01:57:45.130 --> 01:57:46.510

<v Speaker 3>I know that there's other ones that they</v>

2770
01:57:46.511 --> 01:57:48.520
<v Speaker 3>do where it's totally rigged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2771
01:57:48.521 --> 01:57:50.430
<v Speaker 3>I think most of them always rig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not a thing.</v>

2772
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:52.720
<v Speaker 3>This is a full length,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like two hour documentary.</v>

2773
01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:54.940
<v Speaker 3>It's about this girl that was just one </v>
<v Speaker 3>scene,</v>

2774
01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:57.820
<v Speaker 3>but they showed him fucking her in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>

2775
01:57:58.300 --> 01:57:59.770
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not opposed.</v>

2776
01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she goes,</v>

2777
01:58:01.090 --> 01:58:01.770
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2778
01:58:01.810 --> 01:58:03.520
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they don't show it as dick going in</v>

2779
01:58:03.521 --> 01:58:05.380
<v Speaker 3>because it's just not the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a documentary guy.</v>

2780
01:58:05.381 --> 01:58:07.270
<v Speaker 3>So it's like if it happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corner over there.</v>

2781
01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:10.390
<v Speaker 3>So they're not showing the actual sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2782
01:58:10.391 --> 01:58:12.070
<v Speaker 3>they show it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just don't show the penetration.</v>

2783
01:58:12.071 --> 01:58:15.370
<v Speaker 3>But you see him put his dinner and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>and her makeup face and get weird.</v>

2784
01:58:15.371 --> 01:58:17.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's a setup.</v>

2785
01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.920
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you know that that's not a set </v>

2786
01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:22.920
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I can't confirm it to 107.</v>

2787
01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:27.130
<v Speaker 5>Do a weird thing in this documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like a real documentary.</v>

2788
01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean if it wasn't a porn documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would show like real porn.</v>

2789
01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2790
01:58:30.970 --> 01:58:32.290
<v Speaker 3>they don't show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no penetration.</v>

2791
01:58:32.291 --> 01:58:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't necessarily mean it's true that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not necessarily true.</v>

2792
01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2793
01:58:36.670 --> 01:58:39.190
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it sounds like it could be real,</v>

2794
01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:41.080
<v Speaker 3>but it also could be something that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>set.</v>

2795
01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:41.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't</v>

2796

<v Speaker 4>That world of the fake auditions that </v>

2799
01:58:51.330 --> 01:58:51.330
<v Speaker 4>turn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this isn't.</v>

<v Speaker 4>anybody with any ethics or morals that </v>

2835
02:00:01.231 --> 02:00:02.560
<v Speaker 4>videos he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to be attached to that.</v>

2836
02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:05.650
<v Speaker 4>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if even if it is fake,</v>

2837
02:00:06.010 --> 02:00:07.090
<v Speaker 4>it's still like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2838
02:00:07.091 --> 02:00:08.680
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why does this get you off?</v>

2839
02:00:08.681 --> 02:00:13.681
<v Speaker 4>Like you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're being fucking horrible to these </v>

2840
02:00:13.681 --> 02:00:13.681
<v Speaker 4>people if that's really what gets you </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

2841
02:00:13.681 --> 02:00:15.800
<v Speaker 4>Like what kind of a human being run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of uh,</v>

2842
02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:21.120
<v Speaker 4>what kind of a product are you selling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the way they got them is there are </v>

2843
02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:25.511
<v Speaker 4>certain places that have like really </v>
<v Speaker 4>strict obscenity laws and so they </v>

2844
02:00:25.511 --> 02:00:29.101
<v Speaker 4>prosecuted him in Florida and it's one </v>
<v Speaker 4>area that had these really brutally </v>

2845
02:00:29.101 --> 02:00:30.790
<v Speaker 4>strict obscenity laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they went after this guy,</v>

2846
02:00:30.791 --> 02:00:35.791
<v Speaker 4>they targeted him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they saw the videos and he </v>

2847
02:00:35.791 --> 02:00:37.060
<v Speaker 4>decided this is a piece of shit and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to put this guy in jail.</v>

2848
02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:39.910
<v Speaker 4>And they in their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the prosecutors eyes.</v>

2849
02:00:39.911 --> 02:00:44.911
<v Speaker 4>I think if I had a guess that they found</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy who had made this sort of a evil </v>

2850
02:00:46.151 --> 02:00:49.300
<v Speaker 4>business off of a loophole and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>loophole was the,</v>

2851
02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:54.320
<v Speaker 4>the freedom of expression that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to have his own artistic </v>

2852
02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:55.540
<v Speaker 4>interpretation of what's porn and what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not porn.</v>

2853
02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:58.180
<v Speaker 4>But anybody like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a normal guy who wants to,</v>

2854
02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.530
<v Speaker 4>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a piece of shit.</v>

2855
02:00:59.550 --> 02:01:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Like he's making movies for fucking evil</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2856
02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To to want to get off to that as a very </v>

2857
02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:07.660
<v Speaker 4>bizarre thing to me it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely very bizarre,</v>

2858
02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:12.331
<v Speaker 4>but it's also like at what point in time</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it censorship at one point in time is</v>

2859
02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:14.800
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's to say that you can't.</v>

2860
02:01:15.130 --> 02:01:16.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you made a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2861
02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:22.020
<v Speaker 4>this is a totally unrelated thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you made a movie about a guy who </v>

2862
02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:23.140
<v Speaker 4>was a horrible serial killer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2863
02:01:23.590 --> 02:01:28.590
<v Speaker 4>And he's very statistic and it's part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entertainment is this guy's very </v>

2864
02:01:28.590 --> 02:01:30.580
<v Speaker 4>sadistic and then as long as someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>catches that guy and kills him,</v>

2865
02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:32.200
<v Speaker 4>most of us are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2866
02:01:32.201 --> 02:01:34.420
<v Speaker 4>that was a fucked up movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they got them in the end.</v>

2867
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:39.870
<v Speaker 4>The problem with this is nobody gets it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the end except the girl girl gets it </v>

2868
02:01:39.870 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 4>in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2869
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Like the girl gets abused and it's about</v>
<v Speaker 3>abuse and that's it.</v>

2870
02:01:42.741 --> 02:01:47.741
<v Speaker 3>There's no narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no like story arch arch where </v>

2871
02:01:47.741 --> 02:01:52.361
<v Speaker 3>someone comes along and they fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>find this guy and they lock them up in </v>

2872
02:01:52.361 --> 02:01:52.940
<v Speaker 3>jail at the end and then everybody feels</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>

2873
02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just awful from the beginning to </v>

2874
02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:58.320
<v Speaker 3>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>

2875
02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:58.320
<v Speaker 3>And then it ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no plot.</v>

2876
02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:01.810
<v Speaker 3>It's just him violating somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and this.</v>

2877
02:02:01.870 --> 02:02:06.870
<v Speaker 3>But it rolls on without him though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's like a thousand Max </v>

2878
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.870
<v Speaker 3>hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

2879
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:07.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys,</v>

2880
02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:10.220
<v Speaker 3>they'll put on a on effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen them do those,</v>

2881
02:02:10.221 --> 02:02:12.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the compilations of like,</v>

2882
02:02:12.681 --> 02:02:15.520
<v Speaker 3>just not even the sex part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the guy's being mean to the chair.</v>

2883
02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:17.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bring in like awful,</v>

2884
02:02:17.271 --> 02:02:20.210
<v Speaker 3>like unattractive women and they shit on</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and then fuck them.</v>

2885
02:02:20.211 --> 02:02:21.350
<v Speaker 3>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:02:21.351 --> 02:02:25.670
<v Speaker 3>And they smack 'em they sign up for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>news is like physical abuse.</v>

2887
02:02:25.670 --> 02:02:29.000
<v Speaker 3>That would be illegal and you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually go to jail for like,</v>

2888
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:32.630
<v Speaker 3>you can't smack a chicken the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't,</v>

2889
02:02:32.670 --> 02:02:34.470
<v Speaker 3>you can't really set a waiver to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>

2890
02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sorta can.</v>

2891
02:02:35.871 --> 02:02:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean like wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2892
02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's different if it's a guy </v>

2893
02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:42.580
<v Speaker 3>smacking a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2894
02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:43.580
<v Speaker 3>let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

2895
02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm morally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a guy saw them,</v>

2896
02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:50.060
<v Speaker 3>if they're doing a wrestling match and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy smacks the guy,</v>

2897
02:02:50.061 --> 02:02:52.250
<v Speaker 3>these guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're agreeing to this.</v>

2898
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:55.100
<v Speaker 3>They're both guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If two girls are doing it,</v>

2899
02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:57.410
<v Speaker 3>they're both girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if a guy does it do a girl.</v>

2900
02:02:57.890 --> 02:03:02.890
<v Speaker 3>But I mean there's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has to have been pro wrestling </v>

2901
02:03:02.890 --> 02:03:03.950
<v Speaker 3>storylines where the guy accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 3>swings and smacks the girl.</v>

2902
02:03:03.970 --> 02:03:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Like that's part of the story lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2903
02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just watched the other day a triple h </v>

2904
02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:15.070
<v Speaker 3>put Stephanie Mcmahon and the pedigree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well in movies for sure there's been </v>

2905
02:03:15.070 --> 02:03:15.890
<v Speaker 3>domestic violence in movies without a </v>
<v Speaker 3>doubt.</v>

2906
02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:17.530
<v Speaker 3>But they're not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2907
02:03:17.531 --> 02:03:17.780
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2908
02:03:17.781 --> 02:03:19.550
<v Speaker 3>But they're not really hitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the actual contact.</v>

2909
02:03:19.570 --> 02:03:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Nowhere in pro wrestling there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious that's the difference.</v>

2910
02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:24.170
<v Speaker 3>And progressing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually hitting.</v>

2911
02:03:24.171 --> 02:03:24.830
<v Speaker 3>So if you've,</v>

2912
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.070
<v Speaker 2>there's absolutely TV shows and movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they hit each other.</v>

2913
02:03:28.230 --> 02:03:30.150
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see a woman hit a man.</v>

2914
02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:32.470
<v Speaker 3>You never see a man actually hit a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a movie that,</v>

2915
02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:33.300
<v Speaker 3>a recent movie.</v>

2916
02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you there is in the last year some</v>

2917
02:03:36.691 --> 02:03:40.560
<v Speaker 2>show that you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man hit a woman and it's a real hit.</v>

2918
02:03:40.650 --> 02:03:43.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can make no jersey shore though.</v>

2919
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:44.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't set up.</v>

2920
02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:47.070
<v Speaker 3>You can make it look like it's a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>fear.</v>

2921
02:03:47.370 --> 02:03:49.680
<v Speaker 3>You could make it look like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've never seen.</v>

2922
02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:53.820
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a woman cough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a man or a man cuff,</v>

2923
02:03:53.821 --> 02:03:56.040
<v Speaker 3>a woman in the face where I thought it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was real.</v>

2924
02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:01.120
<v Speaker 3>That Jersey shore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Snooki got punched in the face by </v>

2925
02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:01.120
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2926
02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:04.401
<v Speaker 3>That was real hundred percent versus 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>or she got blasted and that's the type </v>

2927
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:07.110
<v Speaker 3>of thing you can't fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she just got popped.</v>

2928
02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:09.970
<v Speaker 3>That guy was a fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy was a schoolteacher.</v>

2929
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:12.510
<v Speaker 3>I know an MMA fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was He really?</v>

2930
02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2931
02:04:13.590 --> 02:04:18.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean he just uncorked on her face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess MMA has been around long enough </v>

2932
02:04:18.590 --> 02:04:21.951
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just finally there's some guys </v>

2933
02:04:21.951 --> 02:04:21.951
<v Speaker 3>coming out and disgracing the sport a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

2934
02:04:21.951 --> 02:04:23.280
<v Speaker 3>There's always going to be crazy people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything.</v>

2935
02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:26.750
<v Speaker 3>Sports players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking whatever competition.</v>

2936
02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Aggressive Holo athletes or people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are nuts.</v>

2937
02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:33.870
<v Speaker 3>You're going to run into people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in the most unlikely scenario,</v>

2938
02:04:34.050 --> 02:04:39.050
<v Speaker 3>if it's a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're going to run into not </v>

2939
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.050
<v Speaker 3>even if it's a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's</v>

2940
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:43.070
<v Speaker 5>probably asshole dentists that'll punch </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the face of they're doing shots and </v>

2941
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.070
<v Speaker 5>then sometimes it works out as mma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys,</v>

2942
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:44.000
<v Speaker 5>it works out great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2943
02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:46.230
<v Speaker 5>Remember that was at a world star hip </v>
<v Speaker 5>hop video with the.</v>

2944
02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:50.130
<v Speaker 5>Was it down in DC?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kind of unassuming white dude.</v>

2945
02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:53.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ryan Hall dropped a big black guy.</v>

2946
02:04:53.281 --> 02:04:54.780
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the guy who gave up eventually.</v>

2947
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:56.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it shows white party,</v>

2948
02:04:56.370 --> 02:05:00.060
<v Speaker 5>the black dudes later and mounted them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you need me to kick his ass?</v>

2949
02:05:00.090 --> 02:05:02.640
<v Speaker 5>Just held him down and just our grappled</v>
<v Speaker 5>and let them know.</v>

2950
02:05:02.641 --> 02:05:07.641
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let them know that it's going to get </v>

2951
02:05:07.641 --> 02:05:07.641
<v Speaker 5>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so awesome.</v>

2952
02:05:07.641 --> 02:05:11.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well especially if you haven't grappled </v>

2953
02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:11.210
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get tired so quick like,</v>

2954
02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:11.210
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2955
02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:15.621
<v Speaker 5>get off me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't have enough energy left </v>

2956
02:05:15.621 --> 02:05:15.621
<v Speaker 5>to attack them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's nothing left.</v>

2957
02:05:15.621 --> 02:05:20.150
<v Speaker 5>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love bullies getting knocked out </v>

2958
02:05:20.150 --> 02:05:20.150
<v Speaker 5>video.</v>

2959
02:05:20.150 --> 02:05:20.150
<v Speaker 5>I do love those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those make me happy.</v>

2960
02:05:20.150 --> 02:05:24.080
<v Speaker 5>It's nice when you see that as comics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what you said about the thing </v>

2961
02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:26.931
<v Speaker 5>about punching up earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is like we do seek justice to </v>

2962
02:05:26.931 --> 02:05:26.931
<v Speaker 5>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

2963
02:05:26.931 --> 02:05:29.490
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just have a problem with the statement</v>

2964
02:05:29.491 --> 02:05:32.400
<v Speaker 5>that all good comedy is punching up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just not true.</v>

2965
02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:37.480
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of good comedy that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>punching sideways in a lot of good </v>

2966
02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:38.150
<v Speaker 5>comedy that's punching down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no but,</v>

2967
02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:41.220
<v Speaker 5>but Louis Ck shitting on his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>

2968
02:05:41.221 --> 02:05:44.250
<v Speaker 5>like a lack of justice there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I mean in that regard?</v>

2969
02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:47.010
<v Speaker 5>Because you said you kind of know it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not only as an implied,</v>

2970
02:05:47.011 --> 02:05:48.900
<v Speaker 5>it's very obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's kidding.</v>

2971
02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:51.000
<v Speaker 5>He loves his kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody makes an outward.</v>

2972
02:05:51.001 --> 02:05:52.170
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's funny.</v>

2973
02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:55.710
<v Speaker 5>No one does make it our thing with the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fights people choose to pick.</v>

2974
02:05:55.710 --> 02:05:56.370
<v Speaker 5>When I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2975
02:05:57.150 --> 02:05:58.950
<v Speaker 5>interestingly enough with the daughter </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

2976
02:05:58.951 --> 02:06:01.130
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did fallon a,</v>

2977
02:06:01.150 --> 02:06:04.230
<v Speaker 5>I talk shit about my daughter for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first two minutes of it.</v>

2978
02:06:04.650 --> 02:06:09.650
<v Speaker 5>And then I did Michael Vick jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>thousands of hate mails the next day </v>

2979
02:06:09.991 --> 02:06:13.510
<v Speaker 5>poured in over these Michael Vick jokes </v>
<v Speaker 5>over imaginary dot.</v>

2980
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:14.370
<v Speaker 5>I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2981
02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:17.370
<v Speaker 5>he was on my team,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I have to love him because he's on my</v>

2982
02:06:17.371 --> 02:06:19.320
<v Speaker 5>team at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's on the Eagle still and I say,</v>

2983
02:06:19.321 --> 02:06:20.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2984
02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he's a terrible dude and did some</v>

2985
02:06:22.381 --> 02:06:24.000
<v Speaker 5>terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but while he's on my team,</v>

2986
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:26.520
<v Speaker 5>just when like I'll throw him a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let them tear it apart,</v>

2987
02:06:26.521 --> 02:06:28.440
<v Speaker 5>like a wearable for the end zone if he </v>
<v Speaker 5>scores.</v>

2988
02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:32.130
<v Speaker 5>And I said I'd mail them a box of </v>
<v Speaker 5>puppies with a photograph of me shushing</v>

2989
02:06:32.131 --> 02:06:36.820
<v Speaker 5>if he wins the super bowl and it killed </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the room at the end.</v>

2990
02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:38.260
<v Speaker 5>But then all the hate mail came in for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2991
02:06:38.261 --> 02:06:40.470
<v Speaker 5>And it was such a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like not one person was like,</v>

2992
02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:42.300
<v Speaker 5>how do you shit talk your daughter like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2993
02:06:42.301 --> 02:06:47.301
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're telling a joke about shitting on </v>

2994
02:06:47.301 --> 02:06:47.301
<v Speaker 5>her father's day present or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>she got for you.</v>

2995
02:06:47.301 --> 02:06:48.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like no one cares,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there.</v>

2996
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:53.840
<v Speaker 5>But there was petitions online for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>public apology from me for imaginary </v>

2997
02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:54.840
<v Speaker 5>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dogs that don't exist.</v>

2998
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.830
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once</v>

2999
02:06:56.170 --> 02:06:59.200
<v Speaker 1>things happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get excited and they want action.</v>

3000
02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:04.620
<v Speaker 1>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want you to apologize and if they </v>

3001
02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:05.200
<v Speaker 1>can force you into action that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>won some sort of an online contest,</v>

3002
02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:06.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've decided.</v>

3003
02:07:06.581 --> 02:07:11.581
<v Speaker 1>They've written a blog about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started the Hashtag make Jay </v>

3004
02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Oakerson Hashtag make jay apologize </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically.</v>

3005
02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:17.680
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre to get that wound up </v>
<v Speaker 1>about comedy ever.</v>

3006
02:07:17.681 --> 02:07:22.681
<v Speaker 1>I don't get about everything man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean every fucking youtube video that </v>

3007
02:07:22.681 --> 02:07:26.071
<v Speaker 1>comes out as a thousand comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People at Duke it out in the comment </v>

3008
02:07:26.071 --> 02:07:29.441
<v Speaker 1>section and people get fired up about </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everything and anything and if </v>

3009
02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:31.720
<v Speaker 1>they have the license to be offended if </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have the license to be offended,</v>

3010
02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:33.880
<v Speaker 1>like they could think that what you said</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not funny.</v>

3011
02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:35.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can think that what said is cruel,</v>

3012
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>but this licensed to be offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have her on my show.</v>

3013
02:07:39.881 --> 02:07:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my show.</v>

3014
02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I like to show</v>

3015
02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:44.770
<v Speaker 3>actually blown away though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like offended people get us,</v>

3016
02:07:44.771 --> 02:07:47.770
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like comedy should be void of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3017
02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3018
02:07:48.690 --> 02:07:52.570
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes I feel like we're treated </v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're speaking to fucking congress,</v>

3019
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:58.830
<v Speaker 3>given affidavits in court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a laughing microphone behind me </v>

3020
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.830
<v Speaker 3>on a sign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3021
02:07:58.830 --> 02:08:00.220
<v Speaker 3>like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you see what's going on?</v>

3022
02:08:00.221 --> 02:08:05.221
<v Speaker 3>People are just getting attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talk about it and you engage them </v>

3023
02:08:05.221 --> 02:08:07.810
<v Speaker 3>and they get to be upset about you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>find other folks that are upset about it</v>

3024
02:08:07.811 --> 02:08:12.811
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody gets to be good to have a </v>

3025
02:08:12.811 --> 02:08:12.811
<v Speaker 3>little attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why,</v>

3026
02:08:12.811 --> 02:08:16.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's obviously one of the most famous </v>

3027
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:16.250
<v Speaker 3>moments on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's why I was always.</v>

3028
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very,</v>

3029
02:08:17.111 --> 02:08:22.111
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tight with Kilstein Jamie Kilstein and </v>

3030
02:08:22.111 --> 02:08:25.401
<v Speaker 3>one point I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a comic coming out against comedy </v>

3031
02:08:25.401 --> 02:08:27.691
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that blew my mind so much when that </v>

3032
02:08:27.691 --> 02:08:27.691
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3033
02:08:27.691 --> 02:08:27.691
<v Speaker 3>The thing about still once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3034
02:08:27.691 --> 02:08:31.651
<v Speaker 3>I was still once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back and watch that whole thing </v>

3035
02:08:31.651 --> 02:08:32.350
<v Speaker 3>because I'm trying to get where he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming from with that.</v>

3036
02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Where he's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

3037
02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:38.010
<v Speaker 1>is a very rigid ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a very rigid ideology of,</v>

3038
02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:38.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3039
02:08:38.630 --> 02:08:43.630
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the down the people that are talking </v>

3040
02:08:43.630 --> 02:08:44.190
<v Speaker 1>down on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it the social justice warriors.</v>

3041
02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:47.250
<v Speaker 1>They talk about it in a mocking sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warriors,</v>

3042
02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>but social justice warriors like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea behind like this super male </v>

3043
02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:53.730
<v Speaker 1>feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very liberal,</v>

3044
02:08:53.731 --> 02:08:54.570
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3045
02:08:54.571 --> 02:08:59.571
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them Vegan like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole idea of do the least amount </v>

3046
02:08:59.571 --> 02:09:03.531
<v Speaker 1>of harm possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a very rigid ideology when it </v>

3047
02:09:03.531 --> 02:09:06.261
<v Speaker 1>comes to certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't leave any room for certain </v>

3048
02:09:06.261 --> 02:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>things to be discussed in a mocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

3049
02:09:07.770 --> 02:09:12.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that you get stuck in that </v>

3050
02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>world if you're in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they have very rigid rules.</v>

3051
02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:18.060
<v Speaker 1>They don't think you should ever say a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke about rape was really fucked up.</v>

3052
02:09:18.061 --> 02:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>As Jamie had one about rape.</v>

3053
02:09:19.650 --> 02:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>It was about men getting raped and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was okay.</v>

3054
02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:24.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3055
02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you just can't have any mocking jokes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about any woman getting raped.</v>

3056
02:09:28.141 --> 02:09:33.141
<v Speaker 1>Even if the Daniel tosh situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like such an obvious line that </v>

3057
02:09:33.141 --> 02:09:36.270
<v Speaker 1>she yells out during is if no one knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scenario.</v>

3058
02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Tosh was on stage and he was asking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience what they wanted to talk about </v>

3059
02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:45.770
<v Speaker 1>because like occasionally someone will </v>
<v Speaker 1>yell out a subject and it'd be pretty </v>

3060
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:45.770
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3061
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:46.920
<v Speaker 1>and then you may be able to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit from it.</v>

3062
02:09:46.921 --> 02:09:51.921
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just having a good time with the </v>

3063
02:09:51.921 --> 02:09:51.921
<v Speaker 1>crowd being loose adlibbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy yells,</v>

3064
02:09:51.921 --> 02:09:55.701
<v Speaker 1>talk about rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes and he starts listing off </v>

3065
02:09:55.701 --> 02:09:55.701
<v Speaker 1>all the thing that's not funny about </v>
<v Speaker 1>rape.</v>

3066
02:09:55.701 --> 02:09:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

3067
02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:03.340
<v Speaker 1>The humiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical violence like what part do </v>

3068
02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:06.741
<v Speaker 1>you think is funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this woman like self righteously </v>

3069
02:10:06.741 --> 02:10:09.021
<v Speaker 1>yells out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually there's nothing funny about </v>

3070
02:10:09.021 --> 02:10:11.721
<v Speaker 1>rape as if he didn't know that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he wasn't saying that exact same </v>

3071
02:10:11.721 --> 02:10:12.360
<v Speaker 1>thing and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be funny.</v>

3072
02:10:12.361 --> 02:10:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Five guys raped right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3073
02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:15.990
<v Speaker 1>and then everybody starts howling </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

3074
02:10:15.991 --> 02:10:20.991
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a funny thing to say in </v>

3075
02:10:20.991 --> 02:10:20.991
<v Speaker 1>that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3076
02:10:20.991 --> 02:10:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Into argue against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying like that promotes a culture that</v>

3077
02:10:23.911 --> 02:10:27.510
<v Speaker 1>accepts rape is completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it promotes is,</v>

3078
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>is rallying against people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stating the obvious there,</v>

3079
02:10:31.741 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 1>stating the obvious to take moral high </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

3080
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:35.690
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing funny about rape.</v>

3081
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:41.080
<v Speaker 4>Like he was saying that very thing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>humor that there is nothing funny about </v>

3082
02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:41.510
<v Speaker 4>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When she chimed in,</v>

3083
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:46.990
<v Speaker 4>it's a person that wanted attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the same person that wrote that </v>

3084
02:10:46.990 --> 02:10:46.990
<v Speaker 4>blog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wrote a blog about it.</v>

3085
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:52.000
<v Speaker 4>That very person was like the nightmare </v>
<v Speaker 4>person to say that too because she went </v>

3086
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.580
<v Speaker 4>and she wrote this blog and then he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wound up giving us like fake apology,</v>

3087
02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:56.540
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty hilarious</v>

3088
02:10:56.650 --> 02:10:57.970
<v Speaker 5>to show you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see,</v>

3089
02:10:57.971 --> 02:11:02.971
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what law and order Svu did with that </v>

3090
02:11:02.971 --> 02:11:03.310
<v Speaker 5>story?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They made that into.</v>

3091
02:11:03.370 --> 02:11:05.180
<v Speaker 5>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3092
02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:06.390
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do the polls from the headlines.</v>

3093
02:11:06.391 --> 02:11:07.660
<v Speaker 5>So they had the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

3094
02:11:07.661 --> 02:11:10.220
<v Speaker 5>they refer to them as like the like </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you going,</v>

3095
02:11:10.221 --> 02:11:12.400
<v Speaker 5>like we're going up to the college </v>
<v Speaker 5>campus to watch that.</v>

3096
02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:17.820
<v Speaker 5>That new rape comic is intentional.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They call him a rape comment was </v>

3097
02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:19.170
<v Speaker 5>Jonathan Silverman plays him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>

3098
02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:24.171
<v Speaker 5>The new rape coming in town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he goes up there and his jokes are </v>

3099
02:11:24.171 --> 02:11:24.171
<v Speaker 5>all about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3100
02:11:24.171 --> 02:11:24.750
<v Speaker 5>like fucking chicks against her will to </v>
<v Speaker 5>some degree,</v>

3101
02:11:26.050 --> 02:11:27.340
<v Speaker 5>but everyone loves him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

3102
02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:30.340
<v Speaker 5>he's getting huge applause and cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3103
02:11:30.750 --> 02:11:35.750
<v Speaker 5>The SV into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's funny about that is at one scene </v>

3104
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:36.070
<v Speaker 5>after they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they suspect a,</v>

3105
02:11:37.090 --> 02:11:41.050
<v Speaker 5>he goes on trial because a girl almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>got raped after his show.</v>

3106
02:11:41.650 --> 02:11:46.650
<v Speaker 5>A girl was a fan of his and they tried </v>
<v Speaker 5>to make the argument that these guys </v>

3107
02:11:46.650 --> 02:11:49.891
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't have tried to rape her if they </v>
<v Speaker 5>weren't all goosed up from his comedy </v>

3108
02:11:49.891 --> 02:11:53.521
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that was the actual argument and </v>

3109
02:11:53.521 --> 02:11:54.580
<v Speaker 5>what they ended up doing with the story </v>
<v Speaker 5>was first thing they do,</v>

3110
02:11:54.581 --> 02:11:59.581
<v Speaker 5>it made me laugh was the whole Svu team </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes and sits front row at his comedy </v>

3111
02:11:59.581 --> 02:12:04.081
<v Speaker 5>show is what they do first and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just sitting there staring and shaking </v>

3112
02:12:04.081 --> 02:12:07.141
<v Speaker 5>their heads and you almost want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys are actually being a pretty </v>

3113
02:12:07.141 --> 02:12:07.690
<v Speaker 5>shitty audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like at the end of the day,</v>

3114
02:12:07.691 --> 02:12:10.210
<v Speaker 5>it's like if you're going to sit there </v>
<v Speaker 5>and stare at least sit in the back.</v>

3115
02:12:10.211 --> 02:12:15.211
<v Speaker 5>Like that seems like kind of a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're making the show get weird </v>

3116
02:12:15.211 --> 02:12:15.790
<v Speaker 5>and rapey by staring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>staring at him,</v>

3117
02:12:16.090 --> 02:12:21.090
<v Speaker 5>but then when they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the big payoff is at the end of the </v>

3118
02:12:21.090 --> 02:12:21.090
<v Speaker 5>whole episode.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make that.</v>

3119
02:12:21.090 --> 02:12:22.910
<v Speaker 5>He was also a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

3120
02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:25.810
<v Speaker 5>I actually tweeted out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like pretty fucking irresponsible.</v>

3121
02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:29.050
<v Speaker 5>Like that's a really irresponsible thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that for the first show I got to do.</v>

3122
02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:30.440
<v Speaker 4>You would think that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

3123
02:12:30.441 --> 02:12:32.600
<v Speaker 4>the kind of people that actually would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be rapists,</v>

3124
02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:37.840
<v Speaker 4>they would be talking about how rape is </v>
<v Speaker 4>awful because they would probably be </v>

3125
02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:42.251
<v Speaker 4>trying to throw people off the yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't be like raping all the </v>

3126
02:12:42.251 --> 02:12:44.780
<v Speaker 4>time and then joking about rape and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time like that sounds like the exact</v>

3127
02:12:44.781 --> 02:12:49.781
<v Speaker 4>opposite of what you would do if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were trying not to get busted being a </v>

3128
02:12:49.781 --> 02:12:50.150
<v Speaker 4>fucking rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crack jokes.</v>

3129
02:12:50.210 --> 02:12:52.850
<v Speaker 4>Are you trying to loosen people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>expectations?</v>

3130
02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:55.160
<v Speaker 4>Remember there was a comedian rapists </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember that?</v>

3131
02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:57.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would backtrack of schools.</v>

3132
02:12:57.590 --> 02:13:02.590
<v Speaker 4>He would go to colleges and he would </v>
<v Speaker 4>rape girls at colleges and he would ask </v>

3133
02:13:02.590 --> 02:13:03.380
<v Speaker 4>them to pray for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3134
02:13:03.710 --> 02:13:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Vince champ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3135
02:13:04.791 --> 02:13:05.520
<v Speaker 4>but they need to do a thing,</v>

3136
02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:08.850
<v Speaker 5>but then he'd do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would go like those block bookings,</v>

3137
02:13:08.890 --> 02:13:12.320
<v Speaker 5>like he would go to one school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pick up the check,</v>

3138
02:13:12.321 --> 02:13:13.970
<v Speaker 5>go to the next goal and then double </v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

3139
02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:16.160
<v Speaker 5>So that's how the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he pulled it off for awhile.</v>

3140
02:13:16.630 --> 02:13:18.910
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know he had a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you have a strategy and what?</v>

3141
02:13:18.911 --> 02:13:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I understand I could be wrong with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

3142
02:13:21.041 --> 02:13:26.041
<v Speaker 4>but that's where I've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard that from several sources </v>

3143
02:13:26.041 --> 02:13:28.771
<v Speaker 4>that it was like a doubling back thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He won star search in 1992 and he's </v>

3144
02:13:28.771 --> 02:13:33.241
<v Speaker 4>serving a 55 to 70 year sentence for </v>
<v Speaker 4>committed at college campuses on a </v>

3145
02:13:33.241 --> 02:13:35.100
<v Speaker 4>standup circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many did they say?</v>

3146
02:13:35.101 --> 02:13:36.760
<v Speaker 4>How many rapes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch.</v>

3147
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:41.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The story I'm looking for has been </v>

3148
02:13:41.770 --> 02:13:41.770
<v Speaker 4>removed from the.</v>

3149
02:13:41.770 --> 02:13:43.230
<v Speaker 5>How many rapes were the while there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody rapes</v>

3150
02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:48.750
<v Speaker 4>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I rates it was in the late </v>

3151
02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:48.750
<v Speaker 4>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3152
02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:50.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many girls he raped,</v>

3153
02:13:50.501 --> 02:13:52.750
<v Speaker 4>but he would have asked them to pray for</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

3154
02:13:52.751 --> 02:13:55.290
<v Speaker 4>which is really fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rave.</v>

3155
02:13:55.370 --> 02:13:57.700
<v Speaker 4>The last thing a chick wants to hear </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're raping them.</v>

3156
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:59.710
<v Speaker 4>You feel bad about the rape.</v>

3157
02:13:59.950 --> 02:14:01.600
<v Speaker 5>I think rape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rape,</v>

3158
02:14:01.601 --> 02:14:06.601
<v Speaker 5>there always has to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me like there's gotta be a </v>

3159
02:14:06.601 --> 02:14:08.890
<v Speaker 5>shut up or I'll do this element to it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I feel like you just couldn't.</v>

3160
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:14.000
<v Speaker 5>It's like professional wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how you couldn't suplex somebody </v>

3161
02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.651
<v Speaker 5>like a vertical suplex that doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be suplex that you couldn't possibly </v>

3162
02:14:16.651 --> 02:14:16.651
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone I feel like,</v>

3163
02:14:17.230 --> 02:14:20.560
<v Speaker 5>how could you fuck someone who's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>snapping their legs shut and fighting.</v>

3164
02:14:20.670 --> 02:14:22.810
<v Speaker 5>That almost seems like it's an </v>
<v Speaker 5>impossible task.</v>

3165
02:14:22.930 --> 02:14:26.500
<v Speaker 5>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got physically for real.</v>

3166
02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:28.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's something that,</v>

3167
02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:30.340
<v Speaker 5>it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously you can happen.</v>

3168
02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:31.900
<v Speaker 5>Nobody saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's always an element.</v>

3169
02:14:31.901 --> 02:14:36.901
<v Speaker 5>I think eventually the girl kind of has </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do like some kind of like get this </v>

3170
02:14:36.901 --> 02:14:37.390
<v Speaker 5>fucking over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you fight physically fight the entire</v>

3171
02:14:37.391 --> 02:14:39.130
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you almost couldn't pull it off.</v>

3174
02:14:45.581 --> 02:14:45.581
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they do.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That shit happens all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>strong men and small women.</v>

3183
02:15:01.291 --> 02:15:02.940
<v Speaker 4>It's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hold you down.</v>

3184
02:15:04.110 --> 02:15:06.310
<v Speaker 5>The seems pretty obvious I think though </v>
<v Speaker 5>if needed.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even talking about that.</v>

3188
02:15:10.651 --> 02:15:14.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking to someone like nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like physically flailing around,</v>

3189
02:15:14.610 --> 02:15:19.050
<v Speaker 5>like to completely subdue someone's for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever just like playful?</v>

<v Speaker 5>like with your girlfriend.</v>

3191
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:22.630
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh Oh yeah,</v>

02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:23.450
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my chicken.</v>

3193
02:15:23.451 --> 02:15:28.451
<v Speaker 5>If I tried to hold her arms and a tickle</v>
<v Speaker 5>her and she's flailing like I don't </v>

3194
02:15:28.451 --> 02:15:28.680
<v Speaker 5>think I can control her feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's not a big girl at all.</v>

3195
02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:30.930
<v Speaker 5>I control my growers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can't move.</v>

3196
02:15:31.410 --> 02:15:35.820
<v Speaker 5>Brian Kicks Ass on police.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a fucking savage dude.</v>

3197
02:15:35.821 --> 02:15:37.530
<v Speaker 5>You could stop a rape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't rape.</v>

3198
02:15:37.710 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 5>Don't forget all personal appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put that aside.</v>

3199
02:15:41.730 --> 02:15:44.250
<v Speaker 5>He's a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

3200
02:15:45.330 --> 02:15:46.500
<v Speaker 5>Control my girl.</v>

3201
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:48.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could look man.</v>

3202
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:51.200
<v Speaker 4>If you know how to wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could hold the chick down pretty God</v>

3203
02:15:51.201 --> 02:15:52.420
<v Speaker 4>damn easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not hard.</v>

3204
02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Could hold up dude down,</v>

3205
02:15:54.490 --> 02:15:59.490
<v Speaker 5>but you have to hold her down and </v>
<v Speaker 5>accomplish something that's sort of </v>

3206
02:15:59.490 --> 02:15:59.490
<v Speaker 5>intricate to some degree.</v>

3207
02:15:59.490 --> 02:16:02.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3208
02:16:02.401 --> 02:16:03.800
<v Speaker 4>This is a weird thing to speculate.</v>

3209
02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:08.130
<v Speaker 5>Let's break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How would you take it around the horn?</v>

3210
02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:12.300
<v Speaker 5>Classroom?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Judo,</v>

3211
02:16:12.301 --> 02:16:15.600
<v Speaker 5>throw the Jujitsu and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3212
02:16:16.170 --> 02:16:21.170
<v Speaker 4>it probably be a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like especially there's a lot of </v>

3213
02:16:21.170 --> 02:16:21.580
<v Speaker 4>violence involved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3214
02:16:21.581 --> 02:16:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Like hitting choking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it would be hard.</v>

3215
02:16:25.930 --> 02:16:30.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean it would obviously it wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 4>as easy as like normal sex.</v>

3216
02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:32.060
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's almost making the point.</v>

3217
02:16:32.061 --> 02:16:34.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying by the time actually the sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>part happens.</v>

3218
02:16:34.151 --> 02:16:36.730
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's just like give up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>some degree,</v>

3219
02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:40.390
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3220
02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:45.420
<v Speaker 4>I guess you can see me appearing at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tomahawk University started announcing </v>

3221
02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:50.320
<v Speaker 4>my college tour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called the don't worry.</v>

3222
02:16:50.321 --> 02:16:52.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe I could possibly rape </v>
<v Speaker 4>you tour.</v>

3223
02:16:54.670 --> 02:16:56.590
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody has their own confidence level</v>

3224
02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:58.270
<v Speaker 4>will put up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3225
02:16:58.390 --> 02:17:03.390
<v Speaker 4>you pull off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't pull off in this life if you </v>

3226
02:17:03.390 --> 02:17:06.211
<v Speaker 4>feel like you're limited in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can never dunk a basketball and I </v>

3227
02:17:06.211 --> 02:17:06.610
<v Speaker 4>could never break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in two things.</v>

3228
02:17:06.611 --> 02:17:08.740
<v Speaker 4>I physically can't pull off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucked up thing,</v>

3229
02:17:08.741 --> 02:17:09.130
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3230
02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:13.210
<v Speaker 4>That that's like so common in the animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>community like violence and sex.</v>

3231
02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:18.540
<v Speaker 4>Like if you ever watched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching this documentary or is </v>

3232
02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:19.040
<v Speaker 4>listening to this podcast rather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3233
02:17:19.050 --> 02:17:24.050
<v Speaker 4>about Tasmanian devils and how vicious </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tasmanian devils are with each other and</v>

3234
02:17:24.630 --> 02:17:26.350
<v Speaker 4>that while they're having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they almost,</v>

3235
02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:28.970
<v Speaker 4>they always bite each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're constantly biting each other and</v>

3236
02:17:28.971 --> 02:17:33.971
<v Speaker 4>they fuck each other's faces up like </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they have sex and they fuck each </v>

3237
02:17:33.971 --> 02:17:34.750
<v Speaker 4>other's faces up when they're fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>over a meal.</v>

3238
02:17:34.940 --> 02:17:39.940
<v Speaker 4>They're constantly going at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there was a disease that was </v>

3239
02:17:39.940 --> 02:17:41.500
<v Speaker 4>spreading amongst them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was actually a type of cancer and the</v>

3240
02:17:41.501 --> 02:17:44.320
<v Speaker 4>type of cancer was actually proving to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

3241
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:46.870
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's contagious.</v>

3242
02:17:46.990 --> 02:17:51.990
<v Speaker 4>By some strange manner of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These cancerous cells would burst and </v>

3243
02:17:53.051 --> 02:17:55.750
<v Speaker 4>infect the cells around them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they,</v>

3244
02:17:55.751 --> 02:18:00.751
<v Speaker 4>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Tasmanian Devil started dying off </v>

3245
02:18:00.751 --> 02:18:00.880
<v Speaker 4>because they started developing these </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancerous,</v>

3246
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:04.870
<v Speaker 4>contagious tumors and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly biting each other in the face</v>

3247
02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:10.260
<v Speaker 4>so they would be biting into these </v>
<v Speaker 4>tumors and the tumors would like </v>

3248
02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:12.400
<v Speaker 4>literally make tumors on the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

3249
02:18:12.490 --> 02:18:13.360
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3250
02:18:13.361 --> 02:18:17.500
<v Speaker 4>But just constantly attacking fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>mangling each other.</v>

3251
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:23.070
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just constantly like biting </v>

3252
02:18:23.070 --> 02:18:24.580
<v Speaker 4>when they fucked his back and they make </v>
<v Speaker 4>these crazy noises mad.</v>

3253
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:26.070
<v Speaker 4>This guy who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3254
02:18:26.310 --> 02:18:27.550
<v Speaker 4>if you ever listen to radio lab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3255
02:18:27.551 --> 02:18:30.040
<v Speaker 4>what I'm talking about was amazing </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

3256
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:32.800
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the podcast is all,</v>

3257
02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:38.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all like really interesting things </v>

3258
02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:42.931
<v Speaker 4>that are like one of them they had about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problems with trying to communicate </v>

3259
02:18:42.931 --> 02:18:44.620
<v Speaker 4>with dolphins and just really </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating,</v>

3260
02:18:44.621 --> 02:18:47.170
<v Speaker 4>fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them was on the apocalypse,</v>

3261
02:18:47.350 --> 02:18:52.350
<v Speaker 4>like how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the asteroid impact did and how </v>

3262
02:18:52.350 --> 02:18:55.261
<v Speaker 4>many animals were killed off and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the original humans probably looked </v>

3263
02:18:55.261 --> 02:18:59.731
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that became a human that was </v>

3264
02:18:59.731 --> 02:18:59.731
<v Speaker 4>alive back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking burrowing underground mammo</v>

3265
02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:01.860
<v Speaker 4>rodent type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

3266
02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:06.900
<v Speaker 4>they were doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this radio lab one on these Tasmanian </v>

3267
02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:06.900
<v Speaker 4>devils in this cancer that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>spreading.</v>

3268
02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:08.020
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking madness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3269
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:13.570
<v Speaker 4>Want to dig into stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too much of it gives me a genuine </v>

3270
02:19:13.570 --> 02:19:13.570
<v Speaker 4>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially apocalypse stuff.</v>

3271
02:19:13.570 --> 02:19:14.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3272
02:19:14.441 --> 02:19:14.770
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3273
02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:19.120
<v Speaker 4>it was always just a chance to meteor </v>
<v Speaker 4>size of Texas could destroy the earth,</v>

3274
02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:22.180
<v Speaker 4>which is weird that that became like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing with these animals that they would</v>

3275
02:19:22.210 --> 02:19:26.290
<v Speaker 4>bite and fuck while they're biting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>biting each other in the face.</v>

3276
02:19:26.291 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not a discussion.</v>

3277
02:19:27.981 --> 02:19:29.690
<v Speaker 4>That's just nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the nature of it?</v>

3278
02:19:29.691 --> 02:19:31.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like constantly do it.</v>

3279
02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they just bite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just always fighting over meat and </v>

3280
02:19:37.660 --> 02:19:39.200
<v Speaker 4>fucking biting each other in the face </v>
<v Speaker 4>and flux and kills like immediately.</v>

3281
02:19:39.201 --> 02:19:40.460
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same,</v>

3282
02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:41.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3283
02:19:41.390 --> 02:19:42.140
<v Speaker 4>black widow,</v>

<v Speaker 4>occasionally males and when they find a </v>

3287
02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:56.300
<v Speaker 4>male,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they bite his legs off,</v>

3288
02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:59.990
<v Speaker 4>they bite his legs off and they bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>the males like slightly larger.</v>

3289
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:05.230
<v Speaker 4>They bite his legs off and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>carry them into the hive to breed and </v>

3290
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:06.650
<v Speaker 4>then they wind up killing him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make him write a book.</v>

3291
02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:09.230
<v Speaker 4>They just need to cripple them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has like wings,</v>

3292
02:20:09.231 --> 02:20:14.231
<v Speaker 4>I think to get the story of misery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You make them write a book of your </v>

3293
02:20:14.231 --> 02:20:15.800
<v Speaker 4>favorite character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have it.</v>

3294
02:20:15.801 --> 02:20:17.390
<v Speaker 4>So we are such pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3295
02:20:17.391 --> 02:20:22.391
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a conversation about how </v>

3296
02:20:22.391 --> 02:20:22.391
<v Speaker 4>difficult it would be to rape somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's a dangerous subject to tread.</v>

3297
02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:25.370
<v Speaker 4>You look into the nature world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like sex without rape.</v>

3298
02:20:25.371 --> 02:20:26.570
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

3299
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:28.040
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't even happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted it.</v>

3300
02:20:28.041 --> 02:20:28.820
<v Speaker 4>I take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3301
02:20:28.821 --> 02:20:33.821
<v Speaker 4>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how you make sure that are </v>

3302
02:20:33.821 --> 02:20:33.821
<v Speaker 4>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah.</v>

3303
02:20:33.821 --> 02:20:35.600
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lion has to get through all the male</v>

3304
02:20:35.601 --> 02:20:40.601
<v Speaker 4>lions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has to prove his worth and then </v>

3305
02:20:40.601 --> 02:20:41.180
<v Speaker 4>eventually he's going to get pushed out </v>
<v Speaker 4>by some new young lions,</v>

3306
02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:46.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he wants to keep like a few </v>

3307
02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:46.400
<v Speaker 4>checks around and some new young lines </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

3308
02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:46.610
<v Speaker 4>and then he's going to be out there on </v>
<v Speaker 4>his own.</v>

3309
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.130
<v Speaker 4>They'd say that's like the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem in Africa.</v>

3310
02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:52.310
<v Speaker 4>Took a metaphor for snl for the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>line,</v>

3311
02:20:52.311 --> 02:20:54.200
<v Speaker 4>comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other one gets sent out to pasture,</v>

3312
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:59.230
<v Speaker 4>so meadows ever watch that show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like with a African villages that </v>

3313
02:21:00.091 --> 02:21:05.091
<v Speaker 4>the real problem that they have is when </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lion gets cast out and the females </v>

3314
02:21:05.541 --> 02:21:10.541
<v Speaker 4>don't get the food anymore than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lions have to go get their own food and </v>

3315
02:21:10.541 --> 02:21:13.901
<v Speaker 4>a lot of those old males,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start to get crippled and slow and </v>

3316
02:21:13.901 --> 02:21:15.710
<v Speaker 4>the chip teeth off and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they become super dangerous because</v>

3317
02:21:15.711 --> 02:21:18.590
<v Speaker 4>they can't get the normal game animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>they used to getting.</v>

3318
02:21:18.591 --> 02:21:20.990
<v Speaker 4>So then they start snatching people </v>
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>

3319
02:21:20.991 --> 02:21:22.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just so I keep proving themselves.</v>

3320
02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:23.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a leopard writing.</v>

3321
02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:29.080
<v Speaker 4>There was a story about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was in the news yesterday about a </v>

3322
02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:29.390
<v Speaker 4>leopard in India that they'd taken us </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible.</v>

3323
02:21:29.391 --> 02:21:32.690
<v Speaker 4>One individual leopard responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>15 deaths,</v>

3324
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:37.640
<v Speaker 4>15 different people that had targets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drunk people and that it waits.</v>

3325
02:21:37.780 --> 02:21:38.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucked.</v>

3326
02:21:38.580 --> 02:21:40.170
<v Speaker 4>Is that to grow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3327
02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:42.980
<v Speaker 4>Spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3328
02:21:42.981 --> 02:21:43.640
<v Speaker 4>Well people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3329
02:21:43.641 --> 02:21:48.641
<v Speaker 4>they go out and they start partying and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this leopard is apparently developed </v>

3330
02:21:48.641 --> 02:21:52.091
<v Speaker 4>this taste for drunk people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he knows that when people come out </v>

3331
02:21:52.091 --> 02:21:56.051
<v Speaker 4>of these bars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're slow and they don't know what </v>

3332
02:21:56.051 --> 02:21:56.051
<v Speaker 4>the fuck's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not on there,</v>

3333
02:21:56.051 --> 02:21:56.200
<v Speaker 4>they're not on the ball and they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>jacked.</v>

3334
02:21:58.130 --> 02:22:03.130
<v Speaker 4>It's almost weird to walk out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere in the world of a bar and </v>

3335
02:22:03.130 --> 02:22:04.030
<v Speaker 4>there's a leopard waiting for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even in India.</v>

3336
02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:06.020
<v Speaker 4>India is scary with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

3337
02:22:06.021 --> 02:22:11.021
<v Speaker 4>in India I find it more weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bar than a leopard waiting to </v>

3338
02:22:11.021 --> 02:22:11.021
<v Speaker 4>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the bombing.</v>

3339
02:22:11.021 --> 02:22:11.450
<v Speaker 4>There's bars and India.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3340
02:22:11.451 --> 02:22:12.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting like India,</v>

3341
02:22:12.860 --> 02:22:17.860
<v Speaker 4>everybody always thinks of as being like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this place of peaceful meditation and </v>

3342
02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:17.860
<v Speaker 4>Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3343
02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:19.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people think of desert,</v>

3344
02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:25.420
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hear about all these goddamn gang </v>

3345
02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:27.461
<v Speaker 4>rapes like India.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These stories of people getting like </v>

3346
02:22:27.461 --> 02:22:29.410
<v Speaker 4>gang raped on buses and women dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

3347
02:22:29.411 --> 02:22:31.920
<v Speaker 4>You hear about those quite a bit like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3348
02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:34.410
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't have normally associated that</v>
<v Speaker 4>with India.</v>

3349
02:22:34.530 --> 02:22:35.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't,</v>

3350
02:22:35.541 --> 02:22:40.541
<v Speaker 4>we don't think of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like when you have a billion </v>

3351
02:22:40.541 --> 02:22:40.650
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a lot of crazy shit going on.</v>

3352
02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:43.710
<v Speaker 4>You've got a billion people stuffed on </v>
<v Speaker 4>what continent he imagined.</v>

3353
02:22:43.730 --> 02:22:43.830
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>up on that,</v>

3355
02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:50.950
<v Speaker 5>especially with Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything picking up on like the </v>

3356
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:51.020
<v Speaker 5>culture of all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you go to South Africa,</v>

3357
02:22:51.021 --> 02:22:53.360
<v Speaker 5>there street gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know and they think their bloods and</v>

3358
02:22:53.361 --> 02:22:55.340
<v Speaker 5>crips because that's what they see </v>
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>

3359

3361
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.030
<v Speaker 5>affiliated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's like there's street gangs,</v>

3362
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:05.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that kind of thing in South Africa </v>

3363
02:23:05.441 --> 02:23:05.441
<v Speaker 5>with a weird place like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember</v>

3364
02:23:05.441 --> 02:23:09.070
<v Speaker 4>when there was an ice cube song about </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving the crips and the bloods to the </v>

3365
02:23:09.261 --> 02:23:14.261
<v Speaker 4>Midwest now was a song steady mom and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it was road trip.</v>

3366
02:23:16.130 --> 02:23:17.090
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was something like that where these,</v>

3368
02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:22.490
<v Speaker 4>these gang bangers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It got too hot and La.</v>

3369
02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:25.910
<v Speaker 4>So they set up gang affiliates in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of the country.</v>

3370
02:23:26.210 --> 02:23:28.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are those like southern ones,</v>

3371
02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:31.220

<v Speaker 5>Hbo with the white boy gangs,</v>

3372
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:34.930
<v Speaker 5>like just a bunch of dudes wearing like </v>
<v Speaker 5>bandannas over their face and caring.</v>

3373
02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:38.240
<v Speaker 5>Hey sickles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More terrifying thing coming your way.</v>

3374
02:23:38.241 --> 02:23:40.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like the children of the corn with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Doo rags on.</v>

3375
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:46.150

<v Speaker 4>That scares a lot of people.</v>

3381
02:23:55.771 --> 02:24:00.270
<v Speaker 4>The idea that this gang violence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you see in like Inglewood and Compton on</v>

3382
02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:03.750
<v Speaker 4>the television shows that that's somehow</v>
<v Speaker 4>under that Boyz in the hood.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Shit could somehow to make it.</v>

3384
02:24:06.060 --> 02:24:07.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's terrifying.</v>

3385
02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:09.240
<v Speaker 5>Split when you see in the south.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird cause it looks.</v>

3386
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:13.560
<v Speaker 5>It's already kind of a scary area of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like swampy overgrown hedges and stuff.</v>

3387
02:24:13.561 --> 02:24:18.561
<v Speaker 5>And then there's like there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>dude with an Uzi wearing a red flannel </v>

3388
02:24:18.561 --> 02:24:20.430
<v Speaker 5>and swampy Louisiana whether</v>

3389
02:24:20.770 --> 02:24:21.900
<v Speaker 4>and if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3390
02:24:22.110 --> 02:24:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're scared of it,</v>

3391
02:24:24.181 --> 02:24:28.350
<v Speaker 4>you're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just don't hit back.</v>

3392
02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:29.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell you what,</v>

3393
02:24:29.131 --> 02:24:31.320
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about some shit on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast and gotten,</v>

3394
02:24:31.321 --> 02:24:33.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people's reactions about it.</v>

3395
02:24:33.061 --> 02:24:36.990
<v Speaker 4>But one of the biggest reactions I ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>got about anything I said was that I was</v>

3396
02:24:36.991 --> 02:24:41.991
<v Speaker 4>talking about John Jones and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much of like why is now </v>

3397
02:24:41.991 --> 02:24:42.420
<v Speaker 4>popular is racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if people are racist.</v>

3398
02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:46.830
<v Speaker 4>Even say you wonder that someone might </v>
<v Speaker 4>be racist.</v>

3399
02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:48.840
<v Speaker 4>Like if if someone's reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

3400
02:24:48.841 --> 02:24:53.841
<v Speaker 4>it's probably like flipping of me to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's especially when you're not </v>

3401
02:24:53.841 --> 02:24:55.900
<v Speaker 4>considering it before you're saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just discussing a subject because</v>

3402
02:24:55.901 --> 02:24:56.760
<v Speaker 4>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>

3403
02:24:57.390 --> 02:25:02.390
<v Speaker 4>It's such a charged subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to have a fully formed idea </v>

3404
02:25:02.390 --> 02:25:06.080
<v Speaker 4>before you say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But just the mere possibility that some </v>

3405
02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:08.340
<v Speaker 4>people can be racist was such a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people are so angry,</v>

3406
02:25:08.341 --> 02:25:13.341
<v Speaker 4>like not even saying you're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not saying the only way that you </v>

3407
02:25:13.341 --> 02:25:13.341
<v Speaker 4>couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the guy was because of racism.</v>

3408
02:25:13.341 --> 02:25:14.610
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much of it is racism.</v>

3409
02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:17.700
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if it's a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I always wonder about races.</v>

3410
02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:20.530
<v Speaker 5>I think he gives reasons beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's a fair question.</v>

3411
02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:23.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean he gives reasons to dislike him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he see on race.</v>

3412
02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:23.770
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

3413
02:25:24.530 --> 02:25:25.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the same time,</v>

3414
02:25:25.331 --> 02:25:26.530
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people will just,</v>

3415
02:25:26.930 --> 02:25:31.930
<v Speaker 4>is it ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The notion that people would just </v>

3416
02:25:31.930 --> 02:25:32.110
<v Speaker 4>blindly like thing just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3417
02:25:32.111 --> 02:25:35.380
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know where we'll live in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>world of apologies,</v>

3418
02:25:35.381 --> 02:25:36.620
<v Speaker 4>don't apologize for asking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3419
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:37.150
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3420
02:25:37.740 --> 02:25:42.740
<v Speaker 4>it's just such a highly charged subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fascinating thing that it's so </v>

3421
02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:46.321
<v Speaker 4>highly charged that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even a mere suggestion and if people </v>

3422
02:25:46.451 --> 02:25:51.451
<v Speaker 4>thought in some way that I meant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't like them is because you </v>

3423
02:25:51.451 --> 02:25:54.521
<v Speaker 4>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's my shitty job of </v>

3424
02:25:54.521 --> 02:25:55.540
<v Speaker 4>communicating an idea because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly was never what I was thinking.</v>

3425
02:25:55.810 --> 02:26:00.810
<v Speaker 4>But what I was thinking was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I know for a fact when I was a </v>

3426
02:26:00.810 --> 02:26:01.750
<v Speaker 4>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to root for white guys.</v>

3427
02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:05.920
<v Speaker 4>I just did like when George Gerry Cooney</v>
<v Speaker 4>fought Larry Holmes,</v>

3428
02:26:06.310 --> 02:26:11.310
<v Speaker 4>I remember very clearly being </v>
<v Speaker 4>embarrassed that I rooted for Gerry </v>

3429
02:26:11.310 --> 02:26:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Cooney because he was a white guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I remember Larry Holmes box the </v>

3430
02:26:15.150 --> 02:26:17.200
<v Speaker 4>shit out of him and he just picked them </v>
<v Speaker 4>apart.</v>

3431
02:26:17.470 --> 02:26:20.050
<v Speaker 4>And before that mean Gerry Cooney was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good fighter.</v>

3432
02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:22.360
<v Speaker 4>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he beat Ken Norton.</v>

3433
02:26:22.361 --> 02:26:24.180
<v Speaker 4>He knocked them out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>devastating knockout,</v>

3434
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:24.940
<v Speaker 4>and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

3435
02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:30.480
<v Speaker 4>he was a good fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Larry Holmes was a master at the </v>

3436
02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:33.871
<v Speaker 4>time and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should have been appreciating what </v>

3437
02:26:33.871 --> 02:26:35.800
<v Speaker 4>Larry Holmes was able to do to this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>who'd been able to knock out some really</v>

3438
02:26:35.801 --> 02:26:39.430
<v Speaker 4>good fighters that Larry Holmes was just</v>
<v Speaker 4>using his skill and that it was.</v>

3439
02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:42.490
<v Speaker 4>But I had been rooting for Gerry Cooney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when he lost,</v>

3440
02:26:42.491 --> 02:26:43.360
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

3441
02:26:43.810 --> 02:26:48.810
<v Speaker 4>It was because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might've been because he was the </v>

3442
02:26:48.810 --> 02:26:48.810
<v Speaker 4>underdog too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a kid.</v>

3443
02:26:48.810 --> 02:26:48.810
<v Speaker 4>I was dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3444
02:26:48.810 --> 02:26:49.330
<v Speaker 4>I was rooting for it because he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>white.</v>

3445
02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:51.340
<v Speaker 4>I know it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was probably Blake.</v>

3446
02:26:52.510 --> 02:26:55.600
<v Speaker 4>I was a senior or a junior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe a junior in high school.</v>

3447
02:26:55.601 --> 02:26:58.210
<v Speaker 4>So I guess I was 16 and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3448
02:26:58.211 --> 02:26:58.840
<v Speaker 4>it was just dumb.</v>

3449
02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:02.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't that I was racist because it's</v>

3450
02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:03.390
<v Speaker 4>been going well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we,</v>

3451
02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:06.100
<v Speaker 4>what you attach to the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what you related to the most?</v>

3452
02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:08.710
<v Speaker 4>I could be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3453
02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:10.030
<v Speaker 4>most certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most certainly.</v>

3454
02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

3455
02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:15.160
<v Speaker 4>I did it a little bit when I was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

3456
02:27:15.161 --> 02:27:18.570
<v Speaker 4>but not nearly as enthusiastic with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy Morris screaming,</v>

3457
02:27:18.571 --> 02:27:22.760
<v Speaker 4>I love you white box know with Tommy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mars that I was like,</v>

3458
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.800
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3459
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:26.440
<v Speaker 4>I was keeping an eye on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How'd you feel that?</v>

3460
02:27:26.441 --> 02:27:27.740
<v Speaker 4>The Ray Mercer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

3461
02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:32.780
<v Speaker 4>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the worst thing I've ever seen </v>

3462
02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:32.780
<v Speaker 4>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That knockout was so good that my friend</v>

3463
02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:34.510
<v Speaker 4>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is like a huge fan of Tommy Morrison</v>

3464
02:27:34.750 --> 02:27:35.840
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

3465
02:27:35.890 --> 02:27:37.060
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't even bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

3466
02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:38.530
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that dude's awesome.</v>

3467
02:27:38.770 --> 02:27:39.730
<v Speaker 4>Just saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3468
02:27:39.731 --> 02:27:42.380
<v Speaker 4>ray mercer was so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though he was rooting for Tommy,</v>

3469
02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:44.440
<v Speaker 4>it was such a brutal knockout.</v>

3470
02:27:44.450 --> 02:27:46.090
<v Speaker 4>They just wanted to see rand mercer </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight again.</v>

3471
02:27:46.220 --> 02:27:48.670
<v Speaker 4>So good cuts of Ray Mercer whispering </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the guys a year,</v>

3472
02:27:48.671 --> 02:27:49.510
<v Speaker 4>a few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3473
02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:52.030
<v Speaker 4>please take it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you half the money.</v>

3474
02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Who did he say that to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget,</v>

3475
02:27:53.951 --> 02:27:55.860
<v Speaker 4>but it was like a core TV case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3476
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:57.560
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

3477
02:27:57.561 --> 02:27:58.780
<v Speaker 4>When they were in the clinch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

3478
02:27:59.140 --> 02:28:04.140
<v Speaker 4>take a dive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you half the money once that </v>

3479
02:28:04.140 --> 02:28:04.140
<v Speaker 4>was it Bobby Chez?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3480
02:28:04.140 --> 02:28:08.280
<v Speaker 4>Who was it that he had a fight with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a fight with someone and it was </v>

3481
02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:08.620
<v Speaker 4>an important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you lost the fight,</v>

3482
02:28:09.430 --> 02:28:10.890
<v Speaker 4>he was not going to get a title shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3483
02:28:10.910 --> 02:28:12.370
<v Speaker 4>So he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3484
02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Or allegedly he asked him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's true.</v>

3485
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:17.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you ever been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it ever proven you can look it up?</v>

3486
02:28:17.561 --> 02:28:19.330
<v Speaker 4>I think he may have been found guilty of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3487
02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you ever watch that </v>

3488
02:28:25.380 --> 02:28:25.380
<v Speaker 4>documentary.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3497
02:28:40.090 --> 02:28:42.440
<v Speaker 4>aaron priors a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>don't give me that water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give me the other one.</v>

3499

<v Speaker 4>And then he gives it to aaron pryor and </v>

3500
02:28:49.091 --> 02:28:51.101
<v Speaker 4>aaron pryor goes out there like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking bat out of hell and knocks out </v>

3501
02:28:51.101 --> 02:28:54.431
<v Speaker 4>alexis are way on the next round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they said it was some sort of a </v>

3502
02:28:54.431 --> 02:28:56.721
<v Speaker 4>stimulant and problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aaron pryor rather wind up having a bit </v>

3503
02:28:56.721 --> 02:28:57.090
<v Speaker 4>of a drug problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So rarely been,</v>

3504
02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:58.460
<v Speaker 4>could have been related in that way.</v>

3505
02:28:59.180 --> 02:29:01.650
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just weird how,</v>

3506
02:29:01.740 --> 02:29:02.410
<v Speaker 4>how the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3507
02:29:02.411 --> 02:29:06.320
<v Speaker 4>the ferocity of the reactions when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought up this racism thing,</v>

3508
02:29:06.321 --> 02:29:09.110
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was like irresponsible on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>part,</v>

3509
02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:14.140
<v Speaker 4>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sort of happy that I brought it up </v>

3510
02:29:14.140 --> 02:29:16.151
<v Speaker 4>anyway just because I'm fascinated by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the response and I'm fascinated by no </v>

3511
02:29:16.151 --> 02:29:19.070
<v Speaker 4>black people disagreed with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the weird thing.</v>

3512
02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:20.990
<v Speaker 4>The weird thing is the guys who </v>
<v Speaker 4>disagreement,</v>

3513
02:29:20.991 --> 02:29:22.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't know everybody who disagree with</v>
<v Speaker 4>me on twitter,</v>

3514
02:29:22.701 --> 02:29:24.350
<v Speaker 4>so I'm kind of talking out of my ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

3515
02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:29.680
<v Speaker 4>but the people that I interact with on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>regular basis where their comics or </v>

3516
02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:30.650
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all thought it was.</v>

3517
02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:35.510
<v Speaker 4>The black guYs all thought it was very </v>
<v Speaker 4>valid that there's certain mount of like</v>

3518
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:40.940
<v Speaker 4>extra judgment that you give a cocky </v>
<v Speaker 4>young black athlete and I was like,</v>

3519
02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:42.980
<v Speaker 4>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that's true.</v>

3520
02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:44.810
<v Speaker 4>Even just paying attention to that.</v>

3521
02:29:44.810 --> 02:29:49.370
<v Speaker 4>That's something I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what if a factor it is and it's</v>

3522
02:29:49.371 --> 02:29:54.371
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the only factor that there's </v>

3523
02:29:54.371 --> 02:29:55.100
<v Speaker 4>$350 million People on this planet in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this country rather,</v>

3524
02:29:55.400 --> 02:30:00.400
<v Speaker 4>and if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a million people like you in a </v>

3525
02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:01.400
<v Speaker 4>miLlion people hate you this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>wide variety of reasons,</v>

3526
02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:05.780
<v Speaker 4>but to say that out of all the millions </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people who know who you are,</v>

3527
02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:09.500
<v Speaker 4>that they're on a certain percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them that are racist seems disingenuous.</v>

3528
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:12.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean iT seems like there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of people across the board,</v>

3529
02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:15.860
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have $350 million people.</v>

3530
02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:18.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many people you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get that the racist,</v>

3531
02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:23.260
<v Speaker 4>but there's gotta be a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage that has to be factored in </v>

3532
02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:23.260
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>

3533
02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:24.230
<v Speaker 4>seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wonder how much of it is.</v>

3534
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:27.440
<v Speaker 4>I think the interesting thing is that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think floyd mayweather,</v>

3535
02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:30.830
<v Speaker 4>people that hate him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet there's a lot more racism involved</v>

3536
02:30:30.831 --> 02:30:32.050
<v Speaker 4>in that than jon jones.</v>

3537
02:30:32.050 --> 02:30:33.620
<v Speaker 4>Jon jones gives you a pretty valid </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>

3538
02:30:33.621 --> 02:30:37.160
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like sky sort of a dick just </v>
<v Speaker 4>publicly from what you see,</v>

3539
02:30:37.161 --> 02:30:42.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anything about them other </v>

3540
02:30:42.161 --> 02:30:42.161
<v Speaker 4>than what I see in the press and on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows.</v>

3541
02:30:42.161 --> 02:30:43.940
<v Speaker 4>But I mean like maybe whether it's a guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3542
02:30:43.941 --> 02:30:44.430
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

3543
02:30:44.450 --> 02:30:46.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the press is talking to him.</v>

3544
02:30:46.161 --> 02:30:48.400
<v Speaker 4>He's like throwing $100 bills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3545
02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:51.730
<v Speaker 4>just like a master showman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That regard too though.</v>

3546
02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:56.120
<v Speaker 4>But that personality feeds into someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's got racism in their heart.</v>

3547
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:57.920
<v Speaker 4>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fires them up.</v>

3548
02:30:57.950 --> 02:31:00.440
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read some horrific shit about.</v>

3549
02:31:00.470 --> 02:31:00.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read,</v>

3550
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:02.900
<v Speaker 4>I've read some racist shit about both </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

3551
02:31:02.901 --> 02:31:04.600
<v Speaker 4>about jon jones and about floyd </v>
<v Speaker 4>mayweather,</v>

3552
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:10.030
<v Speaker 4>but this recent barrage of shit about </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like how much hate they have for </v>

3553
02:31:10.761 --> 02:31:12.860
<v Speaker 4>him after he fought my don and last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>YoU know,</v>

3554
02:31:12.861 --> 02:31:14.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they were betting on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>door.</v>

3555
02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:17.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's also how he sells tickets.</v>

3556
02:31:18.050 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean he sells tickets by people </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting</v>

3557
02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:23.070
<v Speaker 1>him to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he so fucking good.</v>

3558
02:31:23.071 --> 02:31:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You could bArely hit him if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he gets tagged once or twice hard and</v>

3559
02:31:27.091 --> 02:31:28.770
<v Speaker 1>a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shocking and rare,</v>

3560
02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:34.040
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of fights where he'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>go like the entire fight to box in </v>

3561
02:31:34.040 --> 02:31:34.830
<v Speaker 1>someone's face off and not get hit at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

3562
02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:37.350
<v Speaker 1>So for every sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shane mosley who connects our.</v>

3563
02:31:37.351 --> 02:31:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Every madonna right righthand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lands.</v>

3564
02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:41.820
<v Speaker 1>This is like a lot of rounds where he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even getting hit.</v>

3565
02:31:41.821 --> 02:31:45.720
<v Speaker 1>He's just slipping out of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move in and doing things to you that you</v>

3566
02:31:45.721 --> 02:31:50.721
<v Speaker 1>didn't expect and moving in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't anticipate and being nowhere </v>

3567
02:31:50.721 --> 02:31:51.690
<v Speaker 1>near you when you're looking to hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3568
02:31:51.691 --> 02:31:54.720
<v Speaker 1>he's a master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a master at manipulation,</v>

3569
02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:59.880
<v Speaker 1>mean he's playing the heel where I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>john is just a young guy figuring it out</v>

3570
02:32:01.020 --> 02:32:05.970
<v Speaker 1>on his own while he's one of the baddest</v>
<v Speaker 1>man on the planet at 25 years of age and</v>

3571
02:32:05.971 --> 02:32:10.971
<v Speaker 1>he's had this ridiculous rise to success</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened in a really short period </v>

3572
02:32:10.971 --> 02:32:11.220
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

3573
02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Like from the time he was like 21 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old to the time that he's 25 starts </v>

3574
02:32:16.591 --> 02:32:18.540
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and becomes the light </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight champion.</v>

3575
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean tHat's fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3576
02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:25.840
<v Speaker 1>He had a martial art background because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a really good wrestler and did </v>

3577
02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:27.630
<v Speaker 1>know some kicking and punching and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he started into mma,</v>

3578
02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:30.470
<v Speaker 1>but he got into mma because he got his </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend pregnant and he,</v>

3579
02:32:30.471 --> 02:32:32.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't go to college.</v>

3580
02:32:32.101 --> 02:32:33.750
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to do the right thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

3581
02:32:33.751 --> 02:32:34.320
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

3582
02:32:34.321 --> 02:32:39.321
<v Speaker 1>I'll start fighting and then got into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a crazy road for anybody to </v>

3583
02:32:39.321 --> 02:32:41.370
<v Speaker 1>take and to be that popular in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous at 25,</v>

3584
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:44.040
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fuck up man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was going to make mistakes.</v>

3585
02:32:44.060 --> 02:32:49.060
<v Speaker 5>You got to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you almost pinpoint what it is when </v>

3586
02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:50.810
<v Speaker 5>the switch flipped on him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember like I saw I went to,</v>

3587
02:32:50.811 --> 02:32:53.580
<v Speaker 5>I went to ufc 101,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3588
02:32:53.730 --> 02:32:58.730
<v Speaker 5>in philly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forrest griffin versus a silver and </v>

3589
02:32:58.730 --> 02:33:02.060
<v Speaker 5>there he was walking around a jon jones </v>
<v Speaker 5>is one brand and I remember,</v>

3590
02:33:02.061 --> 02:33:03.890
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my buddy dave was with me was like,</v>

3591
02:33:03.891 --> 02:33:04.930
<v Speaker 5>there's jon jones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3592
02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:06.820
<v Speaker 5>that Guy is bad ass and he's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next chair.</v>

3593
02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:10.220
<v Speaker 5>Like he was just really pumping up like </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying how great he was and how fun of a</v>

3594
02:33:10.221 --> 02:33:15.221
<v Speaker 5>young boy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I started paying attention to </v>

3595
02:33:15.221 --> 02:33:16.601
<v Speaker 5>more and he was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then just one day just seems like </v>

3596
02:33:16.601 --> 02:33:16.601
<v Speaker 5>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a dick.</v>

3597
02:33:16.601 --> 02:33:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3598
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people want you to be perfect,</v>

3599
02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:23.700
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for flaws too bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker cheating was the first </v>

3600
02:33:23.700 --> 02:33:24.850
<v Speaker 1>thing I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do anything wrong in that.</v>

3601
02:33:24.900 --> 02:33:25.320
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

3602
02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:27.030
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was weird that he dropped </v>
<v Speaker 5>him afterwards.</v>

3603
02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:32.031
<v Speaker 5>I know it's an aggressive situation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think dropping a guy that he said </v>

3604
02:33:32.031 --> 02:33:32.031
<v Speaker 5>he knew it was unconscious was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

3605
02:33:32.031 --> 02:33:33.360
<v Speaker 5>It was kind of shitty for a sport where </v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

3606
02:33:33.390 --> 02:33:35.190
<v Speaker 5>I thought this is all supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>handshakes at the end.</v>

3607
02:33:35.810 --> 02:33:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

3608
02:33:38.810 --> 02:33:39.910
<v Speaker 1>That mode though.</v>

3609
02:33:40.740 --> 02:33:43.410
<v Speaker 5>You could hear a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when he walks over,</v>

3610
02:33:43.411 --> 02:33:44.640
<v Speaker 5>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>greg jackson,</v>

3611
02:33:44.641 --> 02:33:45.660
<v Speaker 5>that you could hear him say to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

3612
02:33:45.661 --> 02:33:50.661
<v Speaker 5>john goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go when these people back and go check </v>

3613
02:33:50.661 --> 02:33:50.661
<v Speaker 5>out if he's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

3614
02:33:50.661 --> 02:33:50.661
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go check if he's okay,</v>

3615
02:33:50.661 --> 02:33:51.320
<v Speaker 1>They'll get some fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3616
02:33:51.330 --> 02:33:52.890
<v Speaker 1>go get some fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3617
02:33:52.891 --> 02:33:53.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

3618
02:33:53.860 --> 02:33:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3619
02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but also I think to be a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker at that high level,</v>

3620
02:33:58.380 --> 02:34:03.380
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of times these guys are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense that they get completely caught </v>

3621
02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:03.600
<v Speaker 1>up in it and they just trapped in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

3622
02:34:03.870 --> 02:34:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I think I know the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know him from backstage.</v>

3623
02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I know him from when he's not fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's really friendly.</v>

3624
02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:13.740
<v Speaker 1>He's really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't want to be fighting them.</v>

3625
02:34:14.010 --> 02:34:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're competing against him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's all those that are at the </v>

3626
02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:19.010
<v Speaker 1>top of the</v>

3627
02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:23.010
<v Speaker 4>heap there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty fucking ferocious and some guys </v>

3628
02:34:23.010 --> 02:34:25.651
<v Speaker 4>are better at keeping it together in </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenarios like that where they don't </v>

3629
02:34:25.651 --> 02:34:25.930
<v Speaker 4>drop the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some guys aren't.</v>

3630
02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:31.020
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan henderson is one of the greatest of </v>

3631
02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:32.611
<v Speaker 4>all times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the most famous moments in his </v>

3632
02:34:32.611 --> 02:34:35.071
<v Speaker 4>career as he knocked out michael bisping</v>
<v Speaker 4>with his vicious right hand and bisping </v>

3633
02:34:35.071 --> 02:34:39.031
<v Speaker 4>went soaring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was out cold and henderson </v>

3634
02:34:39.031 --> 02:34:39.310
<v Speaker 4>dropped one on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He afterwards,</v>

3635
02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:42.400
<v Speaker 4>he talked about it in the post fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>interview.</v>

3636
02:34:42.430 --> 02:34:44.800
<v Speaker 4>How he dropped one on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's common.</v>

3637
02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:46.880
<v Speaker 4>So the last one was really running his </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth kind of thing.</v>

3638
02:34:46.881 --> 02:34:47.570
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3639
02:34:47.770 --> 02:34:52.770
<v Speaker 4>Baba lou,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's another famous mixed martial arts </v>

3640
02:34:52.770 --> 02:34:54.640
<v Speaker 4>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a great fighter who fought in a bunch of</v>

3641
02:34:54.641 --> 02:34:59.641
<v Speaker 4>different organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lost his gig with the ufc pArtially </v>

3642
02:34:59.641 --> 02:35:03.481
<v Speaker 4>because he held onto this guy after he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was done choking them and then talked </v>

3643
02:35:03.481 --> 02:35:04.780
<v Speaker 4>about it in the post fight precedent </v>
<v Speaker 4>interview with me,</v>

3644
02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:06.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm.</v>

3645
02:35:06.910 --> 02:35:11.140
<v Speaker 4>That guy was not doing anything that bj </v>
<v Speaker 4>penn hadn't done.</v>

3646
02:35:11.410 --> 02:35:14.610
<v Speaker 4>Bj penn did the sAme thing that jens </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulver like paula was tapping.</v>

3647
02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:17.080
<v Speaker 4>He's still fucking hung onto it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were angry at each other,</v>

3648
02:35:17.290 --> 02:35:19.210
<v Speaker 4>but Pulver didn't go out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3649
02:35:19.211 --> 02:35:24.211
<v Speaker 4>and for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>him holding thAt choke for an extra </v>

3650
02:35:24.211 --> 02:35:27.180
<v Speaker 4>couple of seconds was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas bob blues guy went out and then </v>

3651
02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:27.180
<v Speaker 4>he talked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody knows why they do live.</v>

3652
02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:31.740
<v Speaker 4>Sure they do it because they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>caught uP in all the trash talking and </v>

3653
02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:35.251
<v Speaker 4>all the bullshit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is important that a fighter let go </v>

3654
02:35:35.251 --> 02:35:39.961
<v Speaker 4>and a referee tell them not to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's understandable how these guys </v>

3655
02:35:39.961 --> 02:35:40.450
<v Speaker 4>get caught up in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's understandable.</v>

3656
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:44.630
<v Speaker 4>It's got to stop doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what john did technically is not.</v>

3657
02:35:44.710 --> 02:35:47.050
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when the referee came over to him,</v>

3658
02:35:47.051 --> 02:35:48.280
<v Speaker 4>he didn't keep hanging onto it.</v>

3659
02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:51.010
<v Speaker 4>That would have been a more agregious </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

3660
02:35:51.011 --> 02:35:52.210
<v Speaker 4>More and more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3661
02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:58.080
<v Speaker 4>but it is one of those things where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciate like nate marquardt fought </v>

3662
02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:02.251
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>damien maia knocked him out with one </v>

3663
02:36:02.251 --> 02:36:02.770
<v Speaker 4>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damien was dazed but still conscious and</v>

3664
02:36:02.771 --> 02:36:05.050
<v Speaker 4>marquardt hovered over him and pulled </v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

3665
02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:07.600
<v Speaker 4>realized he was out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The referee stepped in and stopped it,</v>

3666
02:36:07.601 --> 02:36:10.810
<v Speaker 4>but nate easily could have dropped a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bomb on him and he didn't end.</v>

3667
02:36:10.811 --> 02:36:13.330
<v Speaker 4>It was a really classy move and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>really respected that,</v>

3668
02:36:13.331 --> 02:36:16.240
<v Speaker 4>that he did that and I made sure I </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about it in the commentary.</v>

3669
02:36:16.241 --> 02:36:18.940
<v Speaker 4>That is a very classy move for jones </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to do that.</v>

3670
02:36:19.390 --> 02:36:24.390
<v Speaker 4>Whereas you and she's like homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the ref like stopped and did </v>

3671
02:36:24.390 --> 02:36:24.760
<v Speaker 4>that with vinny pazienza.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looked over at the ref and he's like,</v>

3672
02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:25.920
<v Speaker 4>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop the fight.</v>

3673
02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:26.530
<v Speaker 4>The referee said no.</v>

3674
02:36:26.530 --> 02:36:29.950
<v Speaker 4>He said okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he went and dropped him again.</v>

3675
02:36:30.010 --> 02:36:31.410
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yeah,</v>

3676
02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:35.170
<v Speaker 4>didn't mean there's moments because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think an interesting thing when once you</v>

3677
02:36:35.171 --> 02:36:37.390
<v Speaker 4>lose your mojo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3678
02:36:37.391 --> 02:36:38.010
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

3679
02:36:38.011 --> 02:36:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy jones overnight went from like still</v>

3680
02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:42.100
<v Speaker 4>doing amazing things and then he lost </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3681
02:36:42.101 --> 02:36:44.140
<v Speaker 4>He lost again and he lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can go.</v>

3682
02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:47.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like once you stop believing in </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself as an athlete,</v>

3683
02:36:47.621 --> 02:36:51.250
<v Speaker 4>like you believe it is a lot to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you believing you're indestructible.</v>

3684
02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Once you see that chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your own armor,</v>

3685
02:36:52.871 --> 02:36:53.560
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting that,</v>

3686
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:56.950
<v Speaker 4>getting that energy back up to do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>again must be really,</v>

3687
02:36:56.951 --> 02:36:58.160
<v Speaker 4>really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3688
02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:03.240
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee and there was a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 4>factors involved in roy too because he </v>

3689
02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:07.141
<v Speaker 4>went up to heAvyweight and then really </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to dehydrate himself and we can </v>

3690
02:37:07.141 --> 02:37:11.880
<v Speaker 4>absolve very badly getting back down the</v>
<v Speaker 4>light heavyweight again and then he got </v>

3691
02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:11.880
<v Speaker 4>knocked out.</v>

3692
02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:14.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Alan Johnson right now.</v>

3693
02:37:14.681 --> 02:37:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Glenn knocked him out after god dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe harbor.</v>

3694
02:37:18.410 --> 02:37:20.840
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Antonio tarver tarpon knocked him out.</v>

3695
02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:25.990
<v Speaker 4>Tara was the first guy to stop him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he did it in a fight where it was a </v>

3696
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.720
<v Speaker 4>rematch of a fight that they had that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was very close,</v>

3697
02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:32.000
<v Speaker 4>and then roy went up to heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He box John Ruiz and beat him for the </v>

3698
02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:35.771
<v Speaker 4>title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then came down to light heavyweight and </v>

3699
02:37:35.771 --> 02:37:38.411
<v Speaker 4>in losing that 25 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he really dehydrated the shit out of </v>

3700
02:37:38.411 --> 02:37:38.411
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looked terrible.</v>

3701
02:37:38.510 --> 02:37:41.240
<v Speaker 4>He looked like he had starved is he lost</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of his,</v>

3702
02:37:41.241 --> 02:37:44.450
<v Speaker 4>like his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his like hardness to his muscles.</v>

3703
02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:49.480
<v Speaker 4>He looked terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a really ugly weight cut and he </v>

3704
02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:50.420
<v Speaker 4>might've been done some shit to get up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to heavyweight too.</v>

3705
02:37:50.690 --> 02:37:52.730
<v Speaker 4>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you get off that shit.</v>

3706
02:37:52.731 --> 02:37:54.080
<v Speaker 4>Your hormone levels crash.</v>

3707
02:37:54.110 --> 02:37:59.110
<v Speaker 4>That's a speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the bottom line was tarver knocked </v>

3708
02:37:59.110 --> 02:38:02.501
<v Speaker 4>him out and when tarver connected and </v>
<v Speaker 4>carver was a big puncher and we </v>

3709
02:38:02.501 --> 02:38:02.900
<v Speaker 4>connected and knocked them out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roy was never the same.</v>

3710
02:38:03.550 --> 02:38:06.340
<v Speaker 4>Then the glen johnson fight with scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's never the same.</v>

3711
02:38:06.341 --> 02:38:11.341
<v Speaker 4>It's just one day just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Mike Tyson was never to say lennox </v>

3712
02:38:11.341 --> 02:38:11.341
<v Speaker 4>lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3713
02:38:11.341 --> 02:38:12.600
<v Speaker 4>He was never the same necessarily after </v>
<v Speaker 4>jail,</v>

3714
02:38:12.601 --> 02:38:14.360
<v Speaker 4>but he's still pretty ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to do well.</v>

3715
02:38:14.361 --> 02:38:17.030
<v Speaker 4>He tyson went to jail after he lost the </v>
<v Speaker 4>title.</v>

3716
02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:22.120
<v Speaker 4>Tyson and last and then went to jail and</v>
<v Speaker 4>came back was still fucking for </v>

3717
02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:25.340
<v Speaker 4>ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference in like whAt happened </v>

3718
02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:28.631
<v Speaker 4>with roy's at roy fought again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like within a certain amount of time it </v>

3719
02:38:28.631 --> 02:38:31.610
<v Speaker 4>got knocked out really bad and when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>get knocked out by a guy,</v>

3720
02:38:31.611 --> 02:38:35.290
<v Speaker 4>when you get your brain's scrambled like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a long time for tea.</v>

3721
02:38:35.290 --> 02:38:40.290
<v Speaker 4>It looks like freddy roach is a genius </v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things that he did </v>

3722
02:38:40.290 --> 02:38:41.930
<v Speaker 4>brilliantly with manny pacquiao is after</v>
<v Speaker 4>pack y'all got knocked out.</v>

3723
02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:45.710
<v Speaker 4>He told him like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to fight for a year.</v>

3724
02:38:46.100 --> 02:38:51.100
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take your head out of this like there's </v>

3725
02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:51.100
<v Speaker 4>no more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna.</v>

3726
02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:54.850
<v Speaker 4>That was a bad knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And freddy is a guy who suffers from a </v>

3727
02:38:54.850 --> 02:38:58.210
<v Speaker 4>trauma related parkinson's himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got the shakes from his career in </v>

3728
02:38:58.210 --> 02:38:59.900
<v Speaker 4>boxing and so because of that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>super,</v>

3729
02:38:59.901 --> 02:39:01.850
<v Speaker 4>super aware of damage and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3730
02:39:01.851 --> 02:39:06.851
<v Speaker 4>you could be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to heal up like there's no </v>

3731
02:39:06.851 --> 02:39:08.360
<v Speaker 4>contact for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to not fight for a year.</v>

3732
02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:10.580
<v Speaker 4>And then he came back a year later and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he looked great.</v>

3733
02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:16.300
<v Speaker 4>He looked like manny pacquiao and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that rest time is super </v>

3734
02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:17.630
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That recuperation time.</v>

3735
02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:22.660
<v Speaker 4>It's very important when god gets </v>

<v Speaker 4>that would do that to you.</v>

3744
02:39:46.241 --> 02:39:47.300
<v Speaker 4>punch that would really put you in a </v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3754
02:40:08.810 --> 02:40:10.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was definitely the first thing.</v>

3755
02:40:10.131 --> 02:40:15.131
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to come back because he came back </v>

3756
02:40:15.131 --> 02:40:15.131
<v Speaker 4>and it was pretty great again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by the time he came back from</v>

3757
02:40:15.131 --> 02:40:16.080
<v Speaker 3>the wizards that one time it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

3758
02:40:16.081 --> 02:40:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Even like you never wanted to believe it</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be good anymore.</v>

3759
02:40:18.810 --> 02:40:20.700
<v Speaker 3>I never saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him.</v>

3760
02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:22.470
<v Speaker 3>He come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was tough to watch.</v>

3761
02:40:22.471 --> 02:40:27.471
<v Speaker 3>I that with a being from philly iverson </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he came back for like did like 16 </v>

3762
02:40:27.471 --> 02:40:31.821
<v Speaker 3>games before he left again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to have some weird situation where </v>

3763
02:40:31.821 --> 02:40:36.081
<v Speaker 3>like when he gets to be 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets like some giant chunk of money </v>

3764
02:40:36.081 --> 02:40:36.081
<v Speaker 3>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3765
02:40:36.081 --> 02:40:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Either with a reebok.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3766
02:40:36.411 --> 02:40:40.230
<v Speaker 3>And kind of like the like trust or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something a weird.</v>

3767
02:40:40.470 --> 02:40:42.870
<v Speaker 3>but he's broken out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they say.</v>

3768
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:44.460
<v Speaker 3>At least that he was begging for money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will.</v>

3769
02:40:44.461 --> 02:40:46.050
<v Speaker 3>AS it turned out it was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3770
02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that a bullshit story?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're begging for and they just </v>

3771
02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:51.080
<v Speaker 3>retired his number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks fine,</v>

3772
02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:51.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no,</v>

3775
02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:59.360

<v Speaker 3>like bullshit rumor that someone </v>

02:43:52.020 --> 02:43:52.440
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3850
02:43:52.470 --> 02:43:54.200
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3851
02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:55.360
<v Speaker 1>the lady is a queen.</v>

3852
02:43:55.390 --> 02:44:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I think like he has like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a book out about being a cross </v>

3853
02:44:00.390 --> 02:44:01.740
<v Speaker 1>dresser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's do a whole show where he would like</v>

3854
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:05.230
<v Speaker 1>cross dress this guy and he's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous crossdresser for vegas.</v>

3855
02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Like one of those guys were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really didn't see him or hear about </v>

3856
02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:13.841
<v Speaker 1>them anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But If you're in vegas like frank </v>

3857
02:44:13.841 --> 02:44:13.900
<v Speaker 1>marino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd see his name on these calves,</v>

3858
02:44:13.901 --> 02:44:16.990
<v Speaker 1>like the little triangle that sits on </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the cab.</v>

3859
02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:19.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the little billboard they have that</v>

3860
02:44:19.541 --> 02:44:24.541
<v Speaker 1>they ran out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so dice had that room was like the </v>

3861
02:44:24.541 --> 02:44:26.920
<v Speaker 1>upstairs room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a larger room and we went to see it</v>

3862
02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:31.950
<v Speaker 1>were howling like little school children</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the after it was over we were </v>

3863
02:44:31.950 --> 02:44:32.920
<v Speaker 1>hanging out backstage and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

3864
02:44:32.921 --> 02:44:37.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm backstage with dice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was thinking about like being a </v>

3865
02:44:37.921 --> 02:44:38.470
<v Speaker 1>kid and listening to his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a cassette.</v>

3866
02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My rules was just dice.</v>

3867
02:44:41.831 --> 02:44:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I think the first one was just dice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3868
02:44:44.890 --> 02:44:46.390
<v Speaker 1>and I was listening to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl I was dating,</v>

3869
02:44:46.391 --> 02:44:47.980
<v Speaker 1>we were crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

3870
02:44:47.981 --> 02:44:52.630
<v Speaker 1>We thought it was so funny because back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it was like so shocking what he was</v>

3871
02:44:52.631 --> 02:44:53.200
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3872
02:44:53.370 --> 02:44:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Anytime time someone dismisses dice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always go,</v>

3873
02:44:56.780 --> 02:44:58.430
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's having a hard time making friends.</v>

3874
02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:00.680
<v Speaker 3>So I go to see the psycho therapist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3875
02:45:00.681 --> 02:45:03.710
<v Speaker 3>hey doc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a hard time making friends.</v>

3876
02:45:03.711 --> 02:45:08.710
<v Speaker 3>You fucking cock sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you told me that's not funny,</v>

3877
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:10.400
<v Speaker 3>you just don't know what's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

3878
02:45:11.090 --> 02:45:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3879
02:45:12.260 --> 02:45:17.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know his story that that dice </v>

3880
02:45:17.260 --> 02:45:17.260
<v Speaker 3>part was a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3881
02:45:17.260 --> 02:45:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3882
02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:22.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean just from being a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I heard him on your thing to tell </v>

3883
02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:22.720
<v Speaker 3>the whole story and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's weird.</v>

3884
02:45:22.730 --> 02:45:27.730
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that he acknowledges that </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a character and still in a weird </v>

3885
02:45:27.730 --> 02:45:28.490
<v Speaker 3>way chooses to live as the character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He likes it.</v>

3886
02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:31.120
<v Speaker 3>He likes being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy looks were in wrestling sort of</v>

3887
02:45:31.121 --> 02:45:34.190
<v Speaker 3>a fucking joey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey buttafuoco sweatshirts and shit.</v>

3888
02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:36.200
<v Speaker 3>He was the cut weightlifting gloves.</v>

3889
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're could do flashdance flashdance </v>

3890
02:45:41.230 --> 02:45:43.100
<v Speaker 3>shirts used to wear the gold's gym </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacket everywhere.</v>

3891
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:45.580
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way he came out on that,</v>

3892
02:45:45.581 --> 02:45:47.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one he did in the round.</v>

3893
02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:49.180
<v Speaker 3>The special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3894
02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Was just the headband with the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>feather,</v>

3895
02:45:52.701 --> 02:45:55.190
<v Speaker 3>like staying alive hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you ever hear him talking about how</v>

3896
02:45:55.191 --> 02:45:57.530
<v Speaker 3>he tried to move back to brooklyn to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3897
02:45:57.531 --> 02:45:59.620
<v Speaker 3>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3898
02:45:59.750 --> 02:46:01.580
<v Speaker 3>He just tried to move back with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

3899
02:46:01.610 --> 02:46:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like after he became the dice man,</v>

3900
02:46:04.071 --> 02:46:05.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood,</v>

3901
02:46:06.830 --> 02:46:11.800
<v Speaker 3>get put up a fence and hide behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't.</v>

3902
02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:13.700
<v Speaker 3>It's the same hanging around with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3903
02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:18.730
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be curious to find out if larry the </v>

3904
02:46:18.730 --> 02:46:18.950
<v Speaker 3>cable guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's like,</v>

3905
02:46:18.951 --> 02:46:19.800
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey babe,</v>

3906
02:46:19.801 --> 02:46:21.410
<v Speaker 3>I gotta run to the hardware store or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3907
02:46:21.411 --> 02:46:22.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it doesn't do that,</v>

3908
02:46:22.461 --> 02:46:27.461
<v Speaker 3>but whatever I have to go out for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he has to go throw in like a </v>

3909
02:46:27.461 --> 02:46:27.461
<v Speaker 3>sleeveless flannel shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can go back.</v>

3910
02:46:27.461 --> 02:46:32.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's like a tucked in shirt guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he that is a complete and total dan</v>

3911
02:46:32.781 --> 02:46:34.800
<v Speaker 3>whitney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But does he,</v>

3912
02:46:35.340 --> 02:46:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He almost committed to living his life.</v>

3913
02:46:37.371 --> 02:46:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Now is larry the cable guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sort of passed the test too.</v>

3914
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean if he ever went out as dan </v>
<v Speaker 3>whitney or did an interview on the view,</v>

3915
02:46:43.341 --> 02:46:48.050
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the few real characters in </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup was like if he went on the view.</v>

3916
02:46:48.110 --> 02:46:52.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I keep saying the view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you went on the jimmy fallon show,</v>

3917
02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:55.100
<v Speaker 3>the tonight show and he went on his dan </v>
<v Speaker 3>whitney,</v>

3918
02:46:55.130 --> 02:46:57.020
<v Speaker 3>it would probably blow his whole fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>thIng.</v>

3919
02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't that what happened when you can</v>

3920
02:46:59.091 --> 02:47:04.091
<v Speaker 3>almost pinpoint the change in diocese </v>
<v Speaker 3>career trajectory was when he cried in </v>

3921
02:47:04.101 --> 02:47:06.020
<v Speaker 3>our centennial hall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He humanized himself too much,</v>

3922
02:47:06.021 --> 02:47:08.240
<v Speaker 3>whIch some people probably thought it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a cool thing,</v>

3923
02:47:08.241 --> 02:47:09.550
<v Speaker 3>but when he cried about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3924
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:11.260
<v Speaker 3>dice man supposed to come out and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3925
02:47:11.270 --> 02:47:16.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were taking a movie out of the </v>

3926
02:47:16.270 --> 02:47:16.270
<v Speaker 3>theater that was as beef and he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>teary eyed,</v>

3927
02:47:16.270 --> 02:47:17.330
<v Speaker 3>but if before he sees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3928
02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:20.810
<v Speaker 3>dice is supposed to come out and be like</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you don't see my movie.</v>

3929
02:47:20.810 --> 02:47:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Huge watts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he cried or sydney hall and it was </v>

3930
02:47:25.810 --> 02:47:26.630
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a genuine moment and that's just,</v>

3931
02:47:26.660 --> 02:47:28.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not who he is.</v>

3932
02:47:28.401 --> 02:47:31.160
<v Speaker 3>But I think he was also under some </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane pressure.</v>

3933
02:47:31.161 --> 02:47:33.470
<v Speaker 3>Like if you don't remember what it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like back then,</v>

3934
02:47:33.530 --> 02:47:38.530
<v Speaker 3>like there was so many people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>angry to meet me and he had like some </v>

3935
02:47:38.530 --> 02:47:39.260
<v Speaker 3>hateful comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3936
02:47:39.670 --> 02:47:43.670
<v Speaker 3>lIke the things that he was making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the way he was making fun of it.</v>

3937
02:47:43.671 --> 02:47:47.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you go back and listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like eddie murphy raw,</v>

3938
02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:49.280
<v Speaker 3>if you go back and see some of the gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

3939
02:47:49.490 --> 02:47:52.580
<v Speaker 3>like it was like really aggressively </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti gay,</v>

3940
02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:56.660
<v Speaker 3>like the comic strip in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've told us on so many radio shows,</v>

3941
02:47:56.661 --> 02:48:01.661
<v Speaker 3>but it does make me laugh that how </v>
<v Speaker 3>things have changed and no one comes </v>

3942
02:48:01.661 --> 02:48:01.790
<v Speaker 3>down with eddie murphy ever for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

3943
02:48:01.791 --> 02:48:06.791
<v Speaker 3>but they have to have is gold albums on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wall and the first one track for </v>

3944
02:48:06.791 --> 02:48:11.710
<v Speaker 3>just called faggots and then track one </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the next album is causa says faggots </v>

3945
02:48:13.221 --> 02:48:18.221
<v Speaker 3>and then parentheses says revisited that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't cover it all in the first go </v>

3946
02:48:18.501 --> 02:48:18.950
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

3947
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Well it's in that way like social </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice warriors as it were a kind of </v>

3948
02:48:25.491 --> 02:48:30.491
<v Speaker 3>important because that's the only reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>why a lot of thIs change has taken </v>

3949
02:48:30.491 --> 02:48:32.180
<v Speaker 3>places because of how outraged people </v>
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>

3950
02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Like if people just kept quiet about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>

3951
02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:40.340
<v Speaker 3>So in a way like a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old like taking it too far,</v>

3952
02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:42.980
<v Speaker 3>like sort of bounces back and it has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy middle.</v>

3953
02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:48.280
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in some ways like there's always </v>

3954
02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:50.411
<v Speaker 3>going to be like the far left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a lot of ways the far left </v>

3955
02:48:50.411 --> 02:48:51.200
<v Speaker 3>tempers the far right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3956
02:48:51.201 --> 02:48:53.620
<v Speaker 3>because like the standard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be,</v>

3957
02:48:53.660 --> 02:48:55.040
<v Speaker 3>it changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it moves back and forth,</v>

3958
02:48:55.041 --> 02:48:57.610
<v Speaker 3>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you let people go and,</v>

3959
02:48:57.650 --> 02:49:02.650
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be as racist and homophobic and as </v>

3960
02:49:02.650 --> 02:49:04.460
<v Speaker 3>hateful as they want and don't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about it.</v>

3961
02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:07.040
<v Speaker 3>They kind of never realized that where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it shitty.</v>

3962
02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:08.010
<v Speaker 3>But because of</v>

3963
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:10.470
<v Speaker 4>the blowback,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dice all that crying and everything</v>

3964
02:49:10.471 --> 02:49:15.471
<v Speaker 4>that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's probably a direct result of </v>

3965
02:49:15.471 --> 02:49:15.471
<v Speaker 4>blowback.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's probably like,</v>

3966
02:49:15.471 --> 02:49:16.810
<v Speaker 4>he was constantly experiencing people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that were protesting.</v>

3967
02:49:16.820 --> 02:49:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Remember he got kicked off of mt for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for lIfe.</v>

3968
02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:23.130
<v Speaker 4>And I remember kurt loder saying about </v>
<v Speaker 4>how unfunny it was,</v>

3969
02:49:23.131 --> 02:49:25.500
<v Speaker 4>and this is not like unfunny to who to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3970
02:49:25.650 --> 02:49:30.650
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you if he did that late </v>

3971
02:49:30.650 --> 02:49:30.650
<v Speaker 4>night at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would fucking crush.</v>

3972
02:49:30.650 --> 02:49:34.610
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you recognizing this as a character </v>

3973
02:49:34.610 --> 02:49:37.611
<v Speaker 4>or do you think there's a real person </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's saying these real things and you </v>

3974
02:49:37.611 --> 02:49:39.870
<v Speaker 4>don't think there's any comedy in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this play that he's putting on,</v>

3975
02:49:39.871 --> 02:49:43.860
<v Speaker 4>which is essentially he's pretending to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be this soulful guy.</v>

3976
02:49:43.890 --> 02:49:46.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cock sucker like this.</v>

3977
02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:48.550
<v Speaker 4>He's going to fuck a guy's chicken in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of them.</v>

3978
02:49:49.980 --> 02:49:51.810
<v Speaker 4>It's obvious that he doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean.</v>

3979
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:53.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like five minutes left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's doing.</v>

3980
02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:57.360
<v Speaker 4>There's some craziness to it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a character.</v>

3981
02:49:57.480 --> 02:49:58.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

3982
02:49:58.740 --> 02:50:03.740
<v Speaker 4>is there a difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 4>character in the bad guy character in a </v>

3983
02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:06.831
<v Speaker 4>movie where the guy's going to run </v>
<v Speaker 4>around killing people or raping people </v>

3984
02:50:06.831 --> 02:50:08.670
<v Speaker 4>or is there a difference?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is just fiction.</v>

3985
02:50:08.850 --> 02:50:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Like how come we don't hold the actor </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible because the actor didn't </v>

3986
02:50:13.850 --> 02:50:15.060
<v Speaker 4>write it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he wrote it and he wanted to be,</v>

3987
02:50:15.061 --> 02:50:16.770
<v Speaker 4>the bad guy would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd be upset at them.</v>

3988
02:50:16.771 --> 02:50:19.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like for that kind of comedy,</v>

3989
02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:20.760
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's also,</v>

3990
02:50:20.761 --> 02:50:25.761
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to do a character to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I feel like the entire </v>

3991
02:50:25.761 --> 02:50:28.140
<v Speaker 4>disclaimer of everything goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said earlier,</v>

3992
02:50:28.141 --> 02:50:30.300
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's a laughing microphone </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind you on a wall.</v>

3993
02:50:30.301 --> 02:50:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Like we're not.</v>

3994
02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:32.880
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not addressing,</v>

3995
02:50:33.930 --> 02:50:36.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the state of the state of the union.</v>

3996
02:50:36.031 --> 02:50:37.890
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm up here telling you like,</v>

3997
02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:40.650
<v Speaker 4>it's clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was always my thing about,</v>

3998
02:50:40.651 --> 02:50:41.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the taj,</v>

3999
02:50:41.731 --> 02:50:42.930
<v Speaker 4>the lady getting so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

4000
02:50:42.931 --> 02:50:47.931
<v Speaker 4>do you believe for one split second that</v>
<v Speaker 4>daniel tosh is pro rape and as slipped </v>

4001
02:50:48.151 --> 02:50:50.730
<v Speaker 4>through the cracks to find himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive television success?</v>

4002
02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:52.560
<v Speaker 4>do you believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't happen?</v>

4003
02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:54.870
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would have reared its head before.</v>

4004
02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:59.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they're saying is they found a </v>

4005
02:50:59.900 --> 02:51:02.680
<v Speaker 4>green light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They found a green light to be outraged </v>

4006
02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:02.970
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>also some people way more sensitive than</v>

4007
02:51:02.971 --> 02:51:03.570
<v Speaker 4>others,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4008
02:51:03.590 --> 02:51:05.300
<v Speaker 4>being called out in front of all those </v>
<v Speaker 4>people have.</v>

4009
02:51:05.301 --> 02:51:09.780
<v Speaker 4>And everybody laugh aT what he said to </v>
<v Speaker 4>her probably sucked for her.</v>

4010
02:51:10.230 --> 02:51:13.740
<v Speaker 4>She decided that she was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

4011
02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:19.040
<v Speaker 4>she was justified and proving our point </v>
<v Speaker 4>or making her point or expressing </v>

4012
02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:19.210
<v Speaker 4>herself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>

4013
02:51:19.211 --> 02:51:20.340
<v Speaker 4>you should be allowed to express </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

4014
02:51:20.341 --> 02:51:22.410
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that he's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>apologize for that.</v>

4015
02:51:22.411 --> 02:51:27.411
<v Speaker 4>Like if you look at what it was on paper</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they hear comics agreeing with </v>

4016
02:51:27.411 --> 02:51:27.800
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was just disappointing.</v>

4017
02:51:27.820 --> 02:51:31.050
<v Speaker 4>But your outrageous supposed to come at </v>
<v Speaker 4>like oppression,</v>

4018
02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:36.140
<v Speaker 4>injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever semester you're supposed to </v>

4019
02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:36.140
<v Speaker 4>like rage against the art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

4020
02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:39.951
<v Speaker 4>Like in a clear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the creatives fucking around situation </v>

4021
02:51:39.951 --> 02:51:41.490
<v Speaker 4>where someone's just fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT's clear he's adlibbing.</v>

4022
02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:45.840
<v Speaker 4>This is not a thought out piece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know where he's advocating a woman,</v>

4023
02:51:45.841 --> 02:51:49.290
<v Speaker 4>a random woman getting raped for no </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason other than the klan rallies.</v>

4024
02:51:49.291 --> 02:51:50.000
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's there.</v>

4025
02:51:50.170 --> 02:51:52.290
<v Speaker 4>You're in an environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If this is what it is,</v>

4026
02:51:52.770 --> 02:51:53.590
<v Speaker 4>well you know what man?</v>

4027
02:51:53.650 --> 02:51:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Some people be really happy if everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>was exactly like them.</v>

4028
02:51:56.580 --> 02:51:59.310
<v Speaker 4>If everybody had the same sensibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sensibilities,</v>

4029
02:51:59.340 --> 02:52:04.340
<v Speaker 4>sensitivities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody had the same ideas about </v>

4030
02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:04.340
<v Speaker 4>what's important to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you can't talk about,</v>

4031
02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:06.220
<v Speaker 4>what's taboo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's okay.</v>

4032
02:52:06.970 --> 02:52:11.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty of people out there that </v>

4033
02:52:11.970 --> 02:52:12.790
<v Speaker 4>agree and disagree and they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>going at it back and forth.</v>

4034
02:52:13.060 --> 02:52:18.060
<v Speaker 4>That's what's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating about trying to find </v>

4035
02:52:18.060 --> 02:52:19.060
<v Speaker 4>out where's the middle ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how much of it is me being crazy?</v>

4036
02:52:19.061 --> 02:52:24.061
<v Speaker 4>How much of it is me just tapping into </v>
<v Speaker 4>one mindset with whatever thing you </v>

4037
02:52:24.061 --> 02:52:28.231
<v Speaker 4>support or disagree with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the style of comedy that </v>

4038
02:52:28.231 --> 02:52:30.250
<v Speaker 4>people do or the kind of music that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are into.</v>

4039
02:52:30.550 --> 02:52:35.550
<v Speaker 4>Some fucking kid got arrested because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>took some lyrics to a song and put it </v>

4040
02:52:35.550 --> 02:52:40.531
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put the lyrIcs up as a tweet and they </v>

4041
02:52:40.531 --> 02:52:40.531
<v Speaker 4>arrested him because it was like some </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy.</v>

4042
02:52:40.531 --> 02:52:42.130
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some song about school shootings.</v>

4043
02:52:42.580 --> 02:52:47.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was going to say it wasn't for like </v>

4044
02:52:47.580 --> 02:52:47.580
<v Speaker 4>the actual copyright of the song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying?</v>

4045
02:52:47.580 --> 02:52:47.580
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>

4047
02:52:47.580 --> 02:52:52.070

<v Speaker 4>They arrested him because he tweeted </v>

4048
02:52:52.070 --> 02:52:52.750
<v Speaker 4>some in the band.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the show's almost over.</v>

4049
02:52:52.990 --> 02:52:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the band's name was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>came to his defense,</v>

4050
02:52:55.541 --> 02:52:57.160
<v Speaker 4>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the lyrics to a song.</v>

4051
02:52:57.161 --> 02:52:59.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like an anti school shooting song,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4052
02:52:59.990 --> 02:53:03.580
<v Speaker 4>but it's like talking about like where </v>
<v Speaker 4>this all comes from the rate.</v>

4053
02:53:03.581 --> 02:53:05.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's an anti schools </v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting song,</v>

4054
02:53:05.381 --> 02:53:08.830

<v Speaker 4>from like the rage of like where,</v>
