That makes it seem like it's really starting.</v>

11
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.540
Yeah.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.180
You have a dog Twitter account as well?
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's right.

18
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.310
It's a goddamn Twitter off right here.

19
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.050
Cliffy beef from a x box or from epic Games is here.

20
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.290
If they're doing a e three is there in la this week and all the crazy video game

21
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:25.040
shit.
I'm exhausted already.
You must be mad,
dude.
It's playing the ice tea.

22
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.320
You have to watching the video.
Okay.
So the thing about him is a,

23
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.090
<v 3>apparently somebody ea was slagging me in their press conference.
They're like,</v>

24
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:35.030
we don't bring out random celebrities into to do our press conference.

25
00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:38.350
And then five seconds later Coby comes out.
You're like,
wait,
what?
And uh,

26
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.560
the thing about ice is I grew up listening to all his shit,
right?
Like,
uh Oh gee.

27
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:47.530
All of that.
All of his stuff,
man.
Like huge fan.
I know.
S.
T.
L.
E.
R.
Yeah,

28
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.620
right.
I pulled the trigger long.
Great.
[inaudible] right.
He's great.

29
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.060
It's funny as Shit,
man.
He's so cool.
And so he,
he plays video games all the time.

30
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.770
He's good.
He knows his stuff.

31
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.970
He's in the game as a character and he's great because he's like Marcus Phoenix.

32
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.390
You know what the first rule of business,
isn't it?
The Phoenix me mother fucker.

33
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.180
Right.
Writing.
Great.
Right.
And uh,
and he's just cool.

34
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:10.370
So he came out and I got to demo.
He's one of my heroes.
Right.

35
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.650
But you got damn good iced tea impression about it.
Dude.

36
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.680
I've been listening to him forever,
man.
Like Freddie Lockhart,

37
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.530
you'd have an ice tea off.
She'd should be like a national competition.
Like,
like,

38
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.980
like a Chili Cook off.
Right.
It's a complicated impression.

39
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:23.390
You got a little lisp to it.
Yeah.

40
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.120
A little thumping going on and yet you have a little list and still have to

41
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:29.030
sound like you could jump up and kick your acid anymore.
Right.

42
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.580
This is the attitude behind it all was going on.

43
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:36.260
She got the ass on cogo she got an ass side of Alaska.
Right.
Who?

44
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:38.200
She's a fucking sweetheart too,
by the way.
Is She?

45
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.640
She is like the coolest chick man.
And uh,
yeah,

46
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:43.760
they got the shovel and the blowing up right now.
So good for him,
man.
Yeah.

47
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:47.560
Good for him.
And he always seemed to be an interesting character.
So I read book,

48
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.390
I hadn't read his biopic of course before,
you know,
cause I had,
you know,

49
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.940
I had followed him and I knew most of its history and everything.
And,
uh,

50
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.670
we're sitting there backstage and you get them going on these stories,

51
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:57.380
but he's talking about the smash and grabs they used to do.

52
00:02:57.381 --> 00:02:59.830
They had these little baby sledgehammers and they'd go into the jewelry stores

53
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.490
and they'd be,
they look at each other and be like,
if the coast was clear,

54
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:06.490
he looked at his buddy,
be like,
is it a bet buddy?
Go,
it's a bat.

55
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.340
And they take the sledgehammers and they'd smash the glass cases and just grab

56
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.560
as many Rolexes as they can and book it out of the mall.
Right.

57
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.580
And they had it down to a science.
But I mean,

58
00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:15.850
I'm sitting there and after I read the book,
I'm like,
dude,
like,

59
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.850
did you work gloves?
Like class?
This is fucking class we're talking about.
Right.

60
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:21.910
And he walks up to me and he shows me his hands and there's just fucking scars

61
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:26.770
all over his fingers,
man.
Oh Man.
So he did it that often.

62
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.870
Yeah.
He tries that endearing checkered pasts,
man.
Why is that endearing?

63
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.840
Because he practiced what he preached,
man.
Then he got up the digest.
Is that it?

64
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.380
He was honest about it.
Oh,
he's got this story in the book.

65
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:41.800
He says there's one time where he was going to take steal this part off of a

66
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:43.060
portion of parking lot.
Right.

67
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.330
And he just started blowing up with all the rap and everything and all of a

68
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.480
sudden he's about to like,
you know,

69
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.200
take the car cover off this portion kind of jacked apart.
I'll send,

70
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:53.080
here's all the screaming behind them and it's all these kids who are just coming

71
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:57.670
at him just like,
and he's sitting there like,
alright,
I gotta quit.

72
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.920
Stay on the shit.
Like that was his quote.
What happened to the sound?
Yeah,

73
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.920
I lost my audio man.
We all lost audio for a second.
I turn it up right up there,

74
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.130
right?
Yeah.
But it just stopped.
What happened?
It's this thick socks.

75
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.860
So the kicker is,
sorry,

76
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.180
he's bringing body count back together for performance to know,
oh my God,

77
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:20.650
are they going to go cop killer?
I can't confirm or deny.
He's a cop now.

78
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:24.550
You can't sync cop killer when you've been working as a cop cop actor now,

79
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.690
how long has he been doing cheers,
dude.

80
00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:29.050
He's going to be getting those little green envelopes on a regular basis now.

81
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.180
Is it the ice t became a cop on a TV show right after that cop killer

82
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.780
controversy.
I'm a motherfucking cop killer thing about that song.

83
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:39.250
Those he opens it up and he see,

84
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:43.390
he said specifically for any copies ever abused his authority or inappropriately

85
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.420
beat somebody down.
That's what he wanted to go for him.

86
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:47.620
That's a nice little disclaimer.

87
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.200
Every cop I've,
this is going to sound like a fucking stretch,
so bear with me,

88
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.900
but I've always identified with gangster rap in a certain way.
Look,

89
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.820
stick with this.
Okay.
Not because I'm a fucking white kid from the burbs.
Right.

90
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.560
And the,
and introduced a whole new world to me,

91
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.500
but it was the persecution from the government that I've always identified with

92
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:08.830
because it's like I can't listen to that rap music complaining that violent

93
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:12.100
video games and it's what's responsible for society's problems.
It's like,
no,

94
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:14.830
that's not the problem,
dude.
You're just trying to look for an easy solution,

95
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.930
right?
Yeah.
It's a mirror of society.
It's,

96
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.690
you mean it let a lot of people in on a,
a part of the world that they have?
No,

97
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.730
no other really like voice from,
where were you during the La Riots?

98
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.760
I was in,
I was in New York.
I hadn't moved here yet.

99
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.120
That was after the Rodney King you mean?
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
I hadn't moved here yet.

100
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.470
In laverne working at Mcdonald's.
I remember watching it on TV going,

101
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.240
this is the end of the war.
Reginald Denny getting,

102
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.120
remember that helicopter when the guy fucking threw a brick at his head,

103
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.360
dude's smashed him full clip with a brick in his head.

104
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:49.290
Random innocent truck driver.
Do you remember?
We had to see him on TV,

105
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.430
meet with the guy.
Was It on Oprah?
One of those shots.

106
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:55.390
I remember one of those shows that guy actually met with them and Reginald

107
00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.110
Denny's heads are all fucked up.
The guy threw the brick man.
Yes,
yes.
Awkward.

108
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.430
Ooh,
fuck.
So yeah,
he's gonna.

109
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.120
We're digging to that party tonight and it's going to be awesome.

110
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.950
I don't think there's going to be much mushing though.

111
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.240
It's usually it's going to,
these parties are fucking hilarious dude.

112
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.761
Cause what you get,

113
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:15.020
it's like jaded game journalists and celebrities and they're all kind of like,

114
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.150
ah,
what's up?
How's it going?

115
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.100
And I heard that a halo had their last party and the Bieber showed up.
Right.

116
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.000
And apparently this is secondhand,

117
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.250
but apparently some of the bungee guys really pissed like what the fuck's he

118
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:30.560
doing here?
And I'm like,
dude,

119
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:33.020
don't be so short shortsighted phenomenon right now.

120
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:35.420
You should be on to have him playing your game and hadn't seen

121
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.920
the kid.
He's talented dude.
I know,
but he's like 16 or something.
Right.

122
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.291
Have you seen,

123
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:46.790
how could she be fucking mad as a 16 year old kid singing 16 year old kid songs?

124
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.050
The caterer is a global phenomenon and what the fuck man,
people,

125
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:55.160
people will get angry though.
Fucking faggot.
Don't want to fucking kill that kid.

126
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.130
That's new England mentality.
That was,

127
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.740
that was me growing up in Boston and was like what's with that guy?

128
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:04.370
Where did all the girls like and what could kick his fucking earth kids?
A queer.

129
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.190
He looks wicked queer and it turns out it was George Michael and he was,

130
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:11.130
but that wasn't,
that's besides the point,
right?
Boston was always a a,

131
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.350
that's a hard ass town.

132
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:16.700
I was there for two weeks recently doing a movie and I never spent,

133
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.060
I haven't spent that much time in Boston and a long time.

134
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:23.150
It's always been like a couple days.
I go in for gigs and then leave.

135
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.530
I was thinking even the whole see hex thing.

136
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:26.560
Did you see the fighter see acts thing?

137
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.540
That's my description of a lot of Boston women.
The fighter that,
yes,

138
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.600
those are all Christian Bale sisters,
right?
That was the dating pool growing up,

139
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.070
dude.
There were monsters.
The accent

140
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.970
to me,
like I'm some kind of

141
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.870
say like guys who at

142
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.210
Children's museum there and there was this woman and her kid was climbing up.

143
00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:59.930
There's a little thing at the Museum of Science.
No,
there's a kid's museum,

144
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:02.640
the children's museum,
and there's this crazy thing.

145
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.270
There were the kids climb up and she goes,
you can't go in there.
You too lit.

146
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.890
Oh he gotta be foul.
She said,

147
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.280
your Dick just weathers smells like rotten ass breath.

148
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.050
It's just everything.
It's just,
you just imagine what kind of a monster that it,

149
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.310
little mustache and the hair is off.

150
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.410
And the scary thing about it is nothing more dangerous than a person who's dumb

151
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.970
and doesn't know it and thinks they're smart because it's that you'll,

152
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.680
these guys can't fool me.
You know,
type mentality.
It's fucking horrified.

153
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:38.720
It's a fun town though,
man.
I'm telling you.
1230 it's,
it's fun.

154
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:41.030
At 1232 you just got to look out.
Well,
you can get more care.

155
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.120
You can defend yourself.
It's not a,

156
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:47.180
it's not a town that you want to get in an argument with people cause it turns

157
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:49.990
into,
they turn into fist fights all the time.
My favorite part of the fight,

158
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:53.660
or though it,
those girls just like,
oh,
she's that MTV girl.
She's at MTV who I,

159
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:56.910
she got three sons.
I know that girl.
Right?
Go get her.
Let's get her right.

160
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.750
It's fucking unbelievable.
Yeah,
that'll be a good show for the whole thing is uh,

161
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.690
what was going to get some celebrity showing up apparently on mini me might be

162
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:06.230
rolling up.
Oh no way.
Cool thing.
Right?
Like last time I saw it,

163
00:09:06.231 --> 00:09:08.790
it was on that reality show where he was all fucked up on the little scooter

164
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:09.930
pissing in the corner.
I met,

165
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.970
I met the girl that did the sex tape with him and it's really weird talking to

166
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:19.170
her because he was like climbing all over and shit like Gollum,
right?
Like yeah,

167
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.800
it was so weird.
You met her to remember she came whenever I need her.

168
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:26.190
I stayed back while everybody else met her and I observed,

169
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.760
she kind of scares me cause like she seems like she's kind of like I,

170
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.390
that's her job.
Like she'd find somebody and it's like,
Hey,

171
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:36.920
I'm going to make a sex tape with this person because I know people are willing.

172
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:37.631
You got to,

173
00:09:37.631 --> 00:09:41.850
you gotta really be careful around a person who's willing to make a mini me sex

174
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:43.140
tape.
Right.
That's what I'm saying.

175
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.600
He's willing to do two steps away from Schweizer.
Yeah.

176
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.760
It's two steps away from you.
You know,
you're just doing something dangerous.

177
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.970
You had some old story about him and some porn dude who used to pick up girls or

178
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:56.400
something,
right?
Like,
Huh?
Oh No.

179
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.400
I know a parent dude who's to told me that his move was,

180
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:04.401
he would get his whole arm in there and work the fingers and apparently he

181
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.070
dilated her cervix or something like that.
It's the crane kick.

182
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.940
It's fucking most of the monkey.
Yeah.
Steals monkey steals the peach.

183
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.560
It's a,
it's too powerful.
You can't defend it.
Apparently.
I heard that like,

184
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:20.720
you just,
you just orgasm like you get shot with,
you know,

185
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:24.450
like he can leave.
He flies across the room like he shot out of a fucking cannon.

186
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.550
Alright.
Why don't think he does.
Yeah.
Right.
He rockets out of her Jesus.
Yeah,

187
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:32.850
that'll sound,
it's apparently it says fucking strong move.
All right.

188
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.780
Just a little person or,
so you know many me but

189
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.760
pornography.
No,
he did a,
he does that with consenting adults by close doors.

190
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.250
It's a fascinating time,
isn't it?
With all the sex tapes.

191
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:48.280
It's like you're allowed to do that.
Lively and again,
her images that fucking uh,

192
00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:50.790
those that are senator wiener and he's like,
was like,

193
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.220
he like tweeting porn stars photos and shit.
Like dude,

194
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:55.910
like really like porn stars.
Yeah.

195
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.800
There's some girl like Amy Lee or something like that,

196
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:02.850
that something like that dude there you were talking about that in one of the

197
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:03.361
podcasts,

198
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:05.820
the current state of pornography where you get that big fat dude with the food.

199
00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:10.530
Fucking all these hot girls,
like what's his name?
Uh,
the fucking grim Laine guy.

200
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.280
And we'd have that big nasty guy that just gets hot chicks because that's
almost,

201
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.550
there'd porns looking for a new route and that's just one of them.

202
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:20.540
But the Internet is accelerating the cycle of depravity,
right?

203
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.650
Where like it used to be this like underground stuff.
You'd have to,

204
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:24.770
it'd be hard to find it now.
It's just like anything,

205
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.920
where's it going to be in five years?
Like I'm a completely horrified,
right?
Yeah.

206
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.510
No one would have ever anticipated like a whole section on cream pies.
Right.

207
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.680
Would be something because you were talking about gaping and all this shit and

208
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.820
like you sit here and like,
there's just like normal young,

209
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.120
beautiful 23 year old girls.
They're just like,
oh,
that's cool,
I'm doing this.

210
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.610
And you're like,
and that was one of other,
the thing about dating in La,

211
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:47.910
I just talking to a buddy who lived out here for awhile and he wound up,
uh,

212
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.670
he's dating a girl for a little while.
I want to be in that Chloe porn girl.

213
00:11:50.671 --> 00:11:53.700
I remember her fucking name.
Like,
like totally nasty green haven.

214
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.420
He was two weeks.
It was chasing Amy moment.
Right.

215
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:57.370
And then you found out who the fuck she was and she didn't even say anything.

216
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.100
<v 0>I think you're right though about the internet accelerating the,</v>

217
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.270
a deranged pornography fortune.

218
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.580
I don't think gaping was going on,
you know,

219
00:12:08.581 --> 00:12:12.080
a hundred years ago before the Internet,
before any kind of television,

220
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.523
any kind of,

221
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.320
<v 3>especially with Twitter and everything too.</v>

222
00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:18.490
We are so able to be connected to people immediately.
Right.
As far as like,

223
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.900
I know about celebrity deaths now because of Twitter.

224
00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:23.270
Like a day before CNN picks up on that Shit,
right?

225
00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.800
Like Sean Kingston crashed is a jet ski and a fucking bridge.

226
00:12:27.801 --> 00:12:30.760
Like I knew that like,
because it was a trending topic and I was like,
okay,

227
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.960
I know you know,
day later CNN alert.
Right?

228
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.510
So that's the fucking world we live in and we'd have to be connected 24,

229
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:37.200
seven to right.
You have to add it.

230
00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:40.760
I'm sitting there like a she Lawrence playing assassin's creed and I'm on my

231
00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:43.310
phone checking my Twitter,
I'm on,
I'm on my iPad checking my Facebook.

232
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.660
It's just like,
and we need that feed.

233
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:47.450
Our brains are being retrained for this kind of world and that's actually the

234
00:12:47.451 --> 00:12:50.710
kind of games we have to make now that kind of tap into that stuff I would think

235
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:52.180
of me.
What do you think about the iPad?

236
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:55.070
Cause it seems like the IPAD and the iPhone has come out of nowhere.
You,

237
00:12:55.071 --> 00:12:58.970
you have a great game on there,
uh,
over at epic and you ought to not,

238
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:02.160
some of it's come out of nowhere.
What are you talking about?
Well,
I mean it,

239
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.220
that the game boy was last year's huge thing.

240
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:07.820
Everyone had game boys game boy,

241
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.580
Nintendo was making shitloads of money and now out of nowhere a phone system.

242
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.920
So the three Ds was the shit.
I bought it.
I love it.
Right.

243
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:19.880
That augmented reality stuff's great.
Have you seen that?
Yes.
Right.
It's so,

244
00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:22.100
it's got a 3-d screen,
but it also has a camera.

245
00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:25.250
So we can use this augmented reality shit where you can take a little card and

246
00:13:25.251 --> 00:13:29.270
you put it down and then you move the three Ds and view it and out of the car to

247
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.820
fucking dragon will pop like in your room and then it will bend.

248
00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:35.910
You're like surface of your,
your,
uh,
you know,
shower or floor or whatever.
Like,

249
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.480
and it's just,
it's like crazy shit.
Wow.
I sat there,

250
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.640
I put Lauren on the bed and I put the fucking card in her stomach and this

251
00:13:41.641 --> 00:13:43.380
dragon came out like fucking aliens.

252
00:13:43.381 --> 00:13:46.840
Like it was a chest burster I was fucking crazy.
And it looks really good.

253
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:48.570
It looks great.
Yeah.
But the,
you know,

254
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.760
unintended cause they're announcing all sorts of stuff about that right now the

255
00:13:50.761 --> 00:13:51.890
press conference.
Incredible.

256
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.820
See that's not something I ever would have thought of.

257
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.090
The future of technology is sometimes the emerging of several things.

258
00:13:57.091 --> 00:13:59.070
That's why you know people are like why do you look conduct?

259
00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:02.220
I'm like cause it's not just the camera,
it's the motion control stuff.

260
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.410
And if the audio as far as votes,
voice recognition,

261
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:07.020
that's what makes it fucking cool.
Right.
Okay.
Love it.
I love the net.

262
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.380
Just a look like Netflix.
It's going like hey I have no page two.

263
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.320
So minority report type things.
I want this movie.

264
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.300
Yeah that's your order.
You can also people that are listening on Itunes,

265
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.250
he's just waving his hands back and forth.

266
00:14:20.251 --> 00:14:22.750
So that's all you have to do to change.
Yeah.

267
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.760
I got it in the other room we could do a dance off.

268
00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:28.980
I've got some dance evacuated that are you a dance off master?

269
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.050
I fucking pants off.
Dance off all that often.

270
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.760
So I stripper pants and I just tear that shit off.

271
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.000
Do you have velcro on the side?
Like a basketball player.

272
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.280
We so mad though about that game.
I love that fucking game.

273
00:14:38.281 --> 00:14:41.700
But you know the part where the breakdown where in the middle of the game you

274
00:14:41.701 --> 00:14:44.820
just do whatever you want.
There has to be a way to save that.

275
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.320
So much fun shit going on.
Time it did it.
So what happens to break it down?

276
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.940
It's a dance Gamey dads and then it has freestyle mode and you just move and

277
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:54.020
it's like you don't really know what's going on,

278
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:56.810
but what you don't know is it's recording you with a video camera.
Right?

279
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:59.450
The first time I did it I'm pulling down my pants and like shaking my shit

280
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:00.350
around and everything like that.

281
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.050
And then what it does is it plays it back Benny Hill style.

282
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.750
So like twice as fast.
And so there's you just like shaking your shit.

283
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:07.790
And I was like,
Oh fuck.
I hope it didn't record this man.

284
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.550
But some of the beauty of this is connected,
connected,
sexy,
right?
So,

285
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:15.580
and I dug the,
the police station moved because the place,

286
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.640
she moves like a week controller,

287
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:19.010
but you have these two glowing orbs and you're like,

288
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:21.350
look like you're bringing a plane in and it's,
it's,
it is what it is.

289
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:24.710
But imagine like those kinds of controls,
but you doing any fucking trailer,

290
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.320
the camera can detect you and they just announced they can detect the finger

291
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:31.010
movement.
It's that and it does instant face recognition.

292
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:34.970
So she's playing dance central.
I walk by,
it's like cliff's signed in.
I'm like,

293
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.970
fuck man,
it's little.
It's a big brother in your living room,
right?

294
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.710
You see transcendent man?
No,

295
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:45.010
it's the Ray Kurzweil documentary and one of the guys in the documentary is uh,

296
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.670
a pioneer on a human computer interfaces.

297
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:51.320
He hasn't been planted in his body.

298
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.460
And then he has it set up so that he walks into a room,
they go,
good morning Bob.

299
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.690
Like it recognizes him.
Like when you're going through a guarded guard,

300
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:00.524
gated community,

301
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.590
you have one of those things in your window and the scanner recognizing it lifts

302
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:07.130
up the gates.
I'm ready for the singularity.
I blowed my computer right now.

303
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.130
Cynthia and computers are going to decide that were retarded because that's the

304
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:14.600
most likely scenario to me.

305
00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:17.990
If I look at the way any intelligent life form that we're aware of,

306
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:22.580
whether it's chimpanzees,
human beings,
killer whales,
dolphins,

307
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.080
they all do evil,
fucked up shit to everything they can.
It's the matrix,

308
00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:28.030
right when you're talking about,

309
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.470
it's been 10 years since that and if you go weaving in there,
he's like,

310
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:33.650
human beings,
your disease.
We are the cure.
Right.

311
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:36.060
That's a pretty good impression of him too.
That's still holds up by the way.

312
00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:38.810
Every that shit,
fuck yeah,
that movie's so solid.

313
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:42.460
That was stitch is why it's so sad that the second one sucked so much I then

314
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.560
they did that.
They didn't happen.
That was fine.

315
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.270
The other ones like it was a third one was even worse.
It was like,

316
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:50.360
what are you doing?
Well,
this is,
this is a problem in video games have,
right,

317
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:52.700
and this is why it's really fucking hard to make a good superman game.

318
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.370
You have a character arc.
You want a character to do something.

319
00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:57.170
At the end of your movie that he hasn't done at the beginning.

320
00:16:57.171 --> 00:17:01.970
Classic screenwriting one on one.
Right?
Uh,
but if you make your guy,
God,

321
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.230
where do you go from there?

322
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.530
And so they made him superman at the end of the first movie.
So where do you go?

323
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:10.750
Right.
He's got to lose his power.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exact kryptonite loses back.

324
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.090
Get it back with the fuck.
It's so simple.
And I never figured that out.

325
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.460
Well they do.
And then you superman movie with us acts Snyder,
right?

326
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.050
Well that dude is nuts too,
right?
Isn't one of them.
Uh,

327
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:24.100
he's a heavy cross dresser and then he what of uh,
yeah,

328
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.920
it was,
I think it was Larry Rakowski decided to go transgender.
Dude,
man,

329
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:30.700
you know,
it might not be nuts.
I'll be saying in all the rest,

330
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.080
but when I was younger I used to be like,
what the Fuck's wrong with you?

331
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:34.980
You fucking Weirdo.
And I'm sitting there like,
can you imagine it?

332
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.730
Would it be like every day to wake up and think that you're in the fucking wrong

333
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:41.930
gender,
recognizing that she had a horrible,
horrible,
I've seen the operation.

334
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:43.240
If you've looked up like what they do

335
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.240
willingly go through that in order to get to you and we've seen it all right.

336
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:50.130
Like you know there's people man,
that they're,
they're

337
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.700
<v 4>not happy with who they are and they will decide,
you know,
what,</v>

338
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.270
whatever it needs to be to make them whole and make them whole.

339
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.390
And for some it's a sexual thing and for some it's a psychological thing.

340
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.540
But the idea behind it,
man,

341
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.810
you're going to chop your fucking egg financially like a hot dog,

342
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:12.150
which throw an apple core in there and clear out an opening.

343
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:14.970
There are a little nutmeg on that.
Can you imagine going through medical school,

344
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:18.670
Jesse?
You can do that to people though.
That's the one you need to look at.
Like,

345
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.780
all right,
you know,
it's the guy decides to become a gynecologist,
right?

346
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.560
Or doing it in like hotel rooms,
office buildings.

347
00:18:25.561 --> 00:18:27.540
I shit ever seen paint Olympics.

348
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.130
They've done documentaries on guys who do like sex changes and it's like

349
00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:34.070
discount sex changes.
Yeah.

350
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.650
That's not something you want to just count on the people who were involved,

351
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.920
you know,
the people that are uh,
you know,

352
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.040
so confused that they want to change their gender.
You know,

353
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:46.650
I'll think a lot of those people can be led in some really fucking creepy ways.

354
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.470
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,
part of it's,
uh,
I don't,
I,
you know,

355
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.610
one thing you have to be careful of is his charisma and when you get a person

356
00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:56.450
who can be led easily,
it's the cult mentality.
Also when you have,
you know,

357
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.010
a god we were talking about all the other day,
I,

358
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.350
the whole Hale Bopp thing that happened years back where they,
you know,

359
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.710
that crazy fucker and all the people with those are the things that Nike's and

360
00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:05.491
everything,
right?
Like that.

361
00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:09.870
Like that's all it takes is one charismatic fucker fixate everyone else on one

362
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:10.704
concept,

363
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.760
one charismatic dude to get a huge podcast and huge following on Twitter scene.

364
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.620
No one is really confident as to where this life is going.
Yes.

365
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:21.240
He was completely confused.

366
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.060
And if someone comes along and they seem like they're confident,

367
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.560
our natural monkey,
yeah,
we just follow that guy.

368
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.310
He's confident.
I'm not,
he's speaking like he has the facts.
I'm not,

369
00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:35.430
he says he was touched by God,
I believe in God.
And the next thing you know,

370
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.750
they're fucking drinking the Koolaid art sort of our archetype,

371
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:41.630
old DNA is people is to,
uh,

372
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:46.670
to search for those sorts of figures throughout history that religious icons and

373
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.380
you know,
people are naturally drawn.

374
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:53.640
And I think it's a byproduct of evolution looking for a leader to follow so you

375
00:19:53.641 --> 00:19:57.360
can be successful in the same way because nobody knows what the fuck's going on

376
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.780
anywhere in the operating system that you can exploit.
You know?

377
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.500
I mean really that's what it is.
We really do need it,
you know?
I mean,
and the,

378
00:20:05.501 --> 00:20:06.120
those though,

379
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.560
that's the system can be manipulated to the system can be hijacked by different,

380
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.870
you know,
fucked up things that can happen in your life.

381
00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:16.640
Like the reason why he girls who don't have daddy's become strippers,

382
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.420
you know what I mean?
Like what's that from?

383
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:23.250
It's just extraordinary need for male attention because a deficits been created.

384
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:27.480
So this natural system,
it's set up in place.
It's been hijacked by a deficit,

385
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.700
and I used to love titty bars when I was married to June.

386
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.300
That's when a lot of people love them.
Right.

387
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:36.300
Chris rock says somebody's got to entertain the married men of America.

388
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:41.510
If your daughter's a stripper,
you fucked up.
That is indeed true.
I'll look.

389
00:20:41.511 --> 00:20:44.760
He's hit.
His Shit's still holds up,
man.
I fucking love it.
All of it.
Yeah,
it does.

390
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.630
Like you go back and watch and be a bigger and blacker and never scared and

391
00:20:47.631 --> 00:20:48.160
everything.
It's just

392
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.880
<v 3>especially bigger and blacker.
That's one of the best comedy performances ever.</v>

393
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.870
I've always been classic.

394
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:56.310
I've always believed that a lot of what my personal belief of good comedy is

395
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.210
calling out the shit that everybody knows is true.

396
00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:02.170
That never realized it in a public venue.
Yeah.
And things that,
you know,

397
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.320
everybody knows it's true,
but you're not supposed to touch on,
you know,
like his,

398
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.970
the one bit that he did that he had the hardest time with was the,

399
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:15.040
I love black people.
I hate niggers and that bit it's a genius fucking bit.

400
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.310
Apparently Chris rock bombed with that bit for like a year.

401
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.080
Really couldn't get it to work with it.

402
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.410
Just stuck with it because the tweak was the tweak that did it.
Who knows?

403
00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:27.460
You know,
it's like there's some bits that you don't know what it is.
He just,

404
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:29.290
you know,
there's a concept in there,

405
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.300
but you just can't find a way to get other people to see it the way you,
you,

406
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.720
you know,
the weights in your mind.
It's like,
and sometimes he'd just,
it just,

407
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.500
you got to try it a bunch of different ways.

408
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.770
But apparently he stuck with it for a long time and then it became unstoppable.

409
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.740
It's so funny,
like us.

410
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.840
So sitting here and hanging out backstage with ice tea and talking about,

411
00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:48.550
cause he's doing this documentary called the art of rap where he like went

412
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:50.350
around and interviewed like everybody,

413
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:52.390
you got everybody from like Doug e fresh to m and M.
Right?

414
00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:53.920
And he's just like talking about the rap game.

415
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.460
And then when I get like moments to chat with you and talk about how comedians

416
00:21:57.461 --> 00:22:00.430
are the comedian circle and then realizing how that applies to like game

417
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:01.980
designer creatives and how like,
you know,

418
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.790
I'm texting like Ken Levine and he's like,
oh,

419
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:07.000
I hope you can come by and see the new bio shock.
I'm like,
ah,
fuck yeah,
dude,

420
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.780
I'm day fucking one.
Right.
And uh,
and so I've realized from my position,
you know,

421
00:22:11.781 --> 00:22:14.860
and being fairly physical and games and having some success with it,
like,

422
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.000
you know,
we all need to like fucking stick together,
Dude.
Like,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,

423
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.620
I'm specifically when I was in Boston,
the last,
you know,

424
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.410
went out with Ken and his wife and we had dinner and like comparing notes about

425
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:26.020
things like that,
especially with game developers because we're not,
you know,

426
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.940
rappers who are out there like,
what's up?

427
00:22:27.941 --> 00:22:30.160
We're not competing to get on stage where usually the kind of guys in the back

428
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:32.140
of the room like,
you know,
ain't nothing going on,
right?
So it's like,

429
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.100
it is like that,
you know,

430
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.710
people want to assume that there's a fucking war going on at all times,
right?

431
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.620
Halo,
don't you hate on chartered?
I'm like,
no,

432
00:22:41.621 --> 00:22:44.530
they're good and I'll play the fuck out of them.
What's your problem?
Right.
Well,

433
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:48.400
that's healthy.
Some people aren't healthy.
Some people can't have competition.

434
00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:51.590
They can't have anybody out there that's doing what they're doing because they

435
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.900
are in battle to be number one because they're not secure with who they are.

436
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.100
They're not comfortable and they're fucking crazy,

437
00:22:57.101 --> 00:22:59.440
which is why they got to be where they got in the first place.

438
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.060
The Internet does help those people very much.
Now,

439
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.870
the obsession the Preston kills me though,

440
00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:06.940
cause that's the beauty of Twitter is you can catch that shit immediately.

441
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.870
And I had a story.
I'm so after e three,
um,
uh,
taking my sabbatical,

442
00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:12.490
I've been working since I was fucking 17.

443
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:15.460
I'm taking a month off gears as they're ironing out a couple of final bucks.

444
00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:18.950
It's pretty much done,
right?
So we're going to Mexico,
we're going to Barcelona,

445
00:23:18.951 --> 00:23:21.130
I'm going to have fun.
Right?
And I tweeted it like,
you know,

446
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:22.510
I'm going to go on sabbatical for a month,
right?

447
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.070
A reporter who I know by the way,

448
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:26.650
who actually is a friend of mine for some reason picked this up and he's like

449
00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:29.560
Blah Sinskey to retire after e three.
I'm like,

450
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.900
there's a big fucking difference between a sabbatical and retiring dude.

451
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.160
Like what are you doing?
Right?
Desperate for.
Well,
so what it is,
it's,
it's,

452
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.130
people only read the poll quote,
you know,
and it's,
it's just like,

453
00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:41.170
and then they don't even read where people clarify it.

454
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:43.720
They jump immediately to the flame war and that's how shit happens.

455
00:23:43.721 --> 00:23:46.310
Cause people are like anger,
they love fights.
They'll controversy.

456
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.480
<v 4>Let people have beef,
right?
That whole ice tea and soldier boy thing.</v>

457
00:23:48.481 --> 00:23:52.550
And it happened a while ago.
People still asking,
okay,
well ice tea,
seriously,

458
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.980
ice tea,
put sunglasses on,

459
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.480
which you always lose if you're standing in front of a camera and you're making

460
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:02.510
your point and you're wearing sunglasses.
What the fuck are you doing?
All right,

461
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:05.720
what does this amazing,
you're on soldier boy's size [inaudible] side.

462
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.980
Cause I saw the boy didn't do anything wrong.

463
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.510
Soulja boy was making songs that some fucking 16 year old kid would make.

464
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.260
I mean that's what he was doing.
Would you rather hang out with those?
For sure,

465
00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:19.970
but I would have rather ice tea,

466
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:24.470
smoke a joint and reassess that situation before it calls out some 16 year old

467
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:27.370
kids like picking one rap like is like,
you know,

468
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.530
be just compared to electroplate a beaver a little bit.
I did.

469
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.220
It's like a little kid,
the black Bieber and he looks like he's having fun.

470
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:37.490
Like what the fuck do you care if it's not your style,
you don't like it.

471
00:24:37.491 --> 00:24:42.491
So I headaches this big stupid video about it and Soulja boy soldier,

472
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.270
you might hear some things that ice tea said.
So he responds.
And then ice tea,

473
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.110
make some video about it where he stands in front of the camera and with

474
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:54.020
sunglasses on.
And I love ice tea.
I'm an ice into that.

475
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.890
It was propositive somehow like in,

476
00:24:56.891 --> 00:25:00.630
in the middle of this shit because what happened was like a met Soulja boy a

477
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.810
couple of years ago to e three,
and he's really helpful and really nice in a war.

478
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:07.280
Well,
I'm going to have to be strapped everywhere I go down,
it goes down.

479
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.380
If the ship goes down the ice,
the game.
And soldier tweeted me the other day,

480
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:15.680
he's like,
Yo man,
how come you don't follow me?
I thought we were friends.
Oh Shit.

481
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:18.650
So,
and this was like two days before body count reunion,
all this shit.
I'm like,

482
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:21.050
okay,
you have a fall Soulja boy.
I hope he doesn't sales ice tea shit.
Right?

483
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.950
So that was fucking awkward.
But speaking of sunglasses,

484
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.140
they need to get it together and let it go.
If there's this,
uh,

485
00:25:27.141 --> 00:25:31.390
this dude speaking to connect,
have you,
do you know who killed your boy?
You know,

486
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.360
you know Kudo,
go to Sonata.
What?
Brian?

487
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.480
He's the main connect creative guy.
Right?
Okay.
Yeah.
Really cool dude.
Right?

488
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:43.250
Real chill.
Right.
And uh,
he,
he's one of the sunglass guys and wears them indoors.

489
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.580
He wasn't all the fucking time.
That's why the thing is,
is I asked him,
I'm like,

490
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.160
dude.
And he's like,
he's like a,

491
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.490
he has really super sensitive to like light because you go out on stage like

492
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:54.560
that while you look like a Douche.
Now this shit is ridiculous.

493
00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.000
You look like you're in a lecture so you can have conversations with people and

494
00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:02.210
just,
I'm going to cut off this sense.
I don't want you look into my eyes,

495
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.570
you know,
I'm just going to look at this little thing about him is the internet,

496
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:09.350
but just because of that one fucking factor just because of the sunglasses.

497
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:10.370
There's a website,
Kudos,

498
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:15.140
a douche.com and they've taken everything from him like every quote,

499
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.330
every image,
and they just bagged on them all the time.
Right.

500
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:19.730
And Center and I had the same shit,
like I still get shit.

501
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.660
I used to wear earrings or like big diamond studs and some do at one point they

502
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:25.880
just got stolen from me.
Like they just vanished my fucking house,

503
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:28.480
which is scary shit to have happened to you by the way.
And uh,

504
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.530
then like I was stopped wearing my start doing interviews.

505
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.360
Suddenly I'm reading the comments.
I'm starting to like cliff now.

506
00:26:32.361 --> 00:26:34.970
I used to think he was a Douche just because of the fucking earrings.
Yeah,

507
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:39.770
you gotta be careful.
I wear a wallet chain.
I'm 43 years old.
It's very dangerous.

508
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:46.050
Very Douche.
Hot Topic.
No Man,
I hadn't made custom jewelry.

509
00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:50.400
I lost my wallet once,
no twice in the early nineties.
I said,

510
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:53.130
this is ridiculous.
I go out and get fucked up too much.

511
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:57.050
I need something that connects my wallet to my body.
And so I got a boy.

512
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.340
I've found wall chains.
Like,
you know you can get a chain,

513
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.790
you're kind of wearing it like a badge though now you know like I lose my wallet

514
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:06.930
frequently so like I need to belt the shit.
No,
I like to change.

515
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.140
I think it's a cool,
that one's sweet.

516
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.910
You got a bad mother fucking officially cool again.
By the way.

517
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.150
Is that what you said?
Last podcast?
Did he put that out?

518
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.210
That's the shit out anywhere.
But why not parties but Mitzvah.

519
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.970
You're a smart man though.
You go wallet in the front pocket,

520
00:27:26.971 --> 00:27:29.730
which is the move never in the back of your right.
That's the correct.

521
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.280
Funny cause like a hair won't grow there now cause I always have my phone and

522
00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:36.380
shit.
Fuck that hair laser.
Right.

523
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.710
We're a little fucking patches.

524
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.230
It's so smart too because that's fucks your backup.

525
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:43.150
Having that wallet in the back,
sit on it all the time.

526
00:27:43.151 --> 00:27:44.480
I always take it out when I sit down,

527
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.530
which is also a good thing when it's connected bikes and skulls on it as a mace.

528
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:55.170
Fuck you up.
There's an amazing,
you can't bring a a pool cue on a plane,

529
00:27:55.171 --> 00:27:56.160
but I could bring this chain,

530
00:27:56.161 --> 00:28:00.450
I'll kill you with this chain wrap to shut her up behind you in the airport

531
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:02.600
security dude,
you fucking pulling metal off of everyone.

532
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.540
He gets a big race and you,
you know a belt.
He could kill someone.

533
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:08.010
That belt pretty God damn easy.
Well,

534
00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:09.510
we're actually at the point now in the airplane if you,

535
00:28:09.511 --> 00:28:11.910
if you get upgraded to first class where that you can actually have metal now,

536
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:17.390
right?
Oh yeah.
The little tiny metal.
What are the lessons I learned flying those,

537
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.820
if you're ever in a,
in the seats that are kind of like fabric,

538
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.080
it's okay to let when rip,

539
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:27.110
but if you're in the leather ones that she goes to food right back on carpet

540
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:31.950
bomb the whole [inaudible] cycle so quick and you just see everybody cringing

541
00:28:31.951 --> 00:28:33.730
and crumbling around you.
I was doing the,

542
00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:38.370
the UFC the other day and someone wouldn't stop forwarding through the whole

543
00:28:38.371 --> 00:28:40.170
production and I don't,

544
00:28:40.171 --> 00:28:44.640
I didn't know if it was Goldberg or the production assistant or Joe Silva was

545
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:49.020
someone was just opening hours for hours,

546
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:53.250
too much gaping.
So I blamed one dude and I'm pretty sure I'm correct.

547
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.680
It was my radar.
If it looks like a duck,
smells like shit.
Go with my instincts.

548
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.270
Like sometimes if it's totally silent,

549
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:03.810
you have to watch their facial expressions and the subtle nuance.
It was brutal.

550
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:05.700
I would caught trying to concentrate on the fights that I was going.

551
00:29:05.701 --> 00:29:09.630
You Stinky mother fucker.
It was like a percentage of my brain.
It was going,

552
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:12.660
I can't believe you're doing this to me.
I see what were saying.

553
00:29:12.661 --> 00:29:14.550
Dana white pop id,
Xbox event.

554
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:16.080
And he just fucking come right in and goes right out.

555
00:29:16.081 --> 00:29:19.500
And it's funny cause there's people who know Dana and how huge all the shit is.

556
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:21.720
And there's those who don't like with the folks with the guys.
Like dude,

557
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.840
he's leading his own religion at this point.
Right.
And,
uh,

558
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.040
one of my favorite hobbies right now is watching Jenna and Tito fight on
Twitter.

559
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:34.850
Like what the fuck dude?
Like,
oh my God,
if my style,

560
00:29:34.851 --> 00:29:38.060
a thief gay wasn't even like that tea.
There's like,
you're a whore.

561
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.870
I use like what the fuck was unbelievable.
Like

562
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.500
<v 3>they need some friends.
What Ha happened?
This thing?
Yeah,
man.</v>

563
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.330
I just turn it up right there.
It's,
oh Jesus.
Brian,
just turn it up right here.

564
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.980
Yeah.
Your volume control.
How did it die off?
Because it was just turned up.

565
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.760
Nevermind.
Technical Talk.
Oh,
that's super technical.

566
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:01.360
Camera's technical as you get,
Hey,
get any more dogs from many ex girlfriends.

567
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.160
Yeah,
there's actually a second one back there now.

568
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.260
There's two dogs now is the current one,
right?
Uh,
yeah.

569
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:11.510
And I'm about to get another pet.
I think I'm just going to get snakes,
snake,

570
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.500
all the other
rather than a car,

571
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.820
you're going to get a huge lizard or ups,
I guess he come home.

572
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:20.040
There's body parts.

573
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.510
I want to get a frilled lizard and happened to run across my pond.

574
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:25.960
Just like that movie.
Anaconda was stupid as fuck.

575
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.920
Like I'd probably read the idea behind it is amazing because there there's some

576
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.670
enormous anacondas in the jungle Brazil that they found so,

577
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:35.780
and the idea is that there's,

578
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.760
there might be some that are a hundred feet long and your fucking that's
awesome.

579
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.940
See I want to get one of those and just clean house with all my pets and started

580
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:44.650
wanting to get ahead.
Get to get rid of that.
Right.

581
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.350
That's how you wind up getting the Tigers to get rid of everything else,
right?

582
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.040
Yeah.
Are we ever going to see a gears,

583
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:54.490
a work connect video game at all?
Oh there's talk about it man.

584
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.330
Cause I know you were against it like in November.
My words,
of course.

585
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.020
I was basically shuffled in to talk to the European press yesterday with

586
00:31:02.021 --> 00:31:02.651
Microsoft.
Right?

587
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:05.350
And so it's like three Microsoft employees and then me and the Microsoft and

588
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:07.450
please God bless him,
he could tell they're very media trade.

589
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:09.880
Well this is what we're doing with connect and they do a good job with it.

590
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.100
And I come in and I'm like man my job is fucking awesome.

591
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:15.310
I think connect is cool.
Whatever,
right.
And,
uh,
there was talk of it,

592
00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:15.901
but the problem is,

593
00:31:15.901 --> 00:31:18.970
is if you look at the way gears is development cycle was if we were to put it
in,

594
00:31:18.971 --> 00:31:22.120
it would have been totally tacked in.
Like,
Oh,
you can play it with connecting.

595
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:26.380
If you move your head a little Marcus,
his head moves.
Wow.
Right.
And it's like,

596
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:30.150
dude,
like if you're going to do it,
design the fucking game for it,
right.
Like uh,

597
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:35.240
Molyneux and uh,
the,
the fable guys,
how would you make a move forward?
You would,

598
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.960
you'd have to start from the ground up,
right?
Like you,
you'd have to,
it's like,

599
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.220
it's like infinity blade for the IPAD.

600
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:41.680
We didn't want to do like dual analog sticks on an iPad because that fucking

601
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:45.370
sucks.
So we're like tap,
tap,
Swipe.
That's what works.
Angry birds,
a fruit Ninja,

602
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.440
all that stuff,
right?
Yeah.
Which I played on connect last night,

603
00:31:47.441 --> 00:31:51.340
which is fucking awesome.
I was like,
that's a good game for it.

604
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:54.040
How would you get a guy to walk though?
How would you get to go?

605
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.370
I can't hear this dude right there.
Turn Up.
I did.
I just did.
I can hear you.

606
00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.160
You can hear me just turn off your phone.

607
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.980
It comes and it goes for some reason there's like a disconnect here.

608
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.090
You have to first and foremost design the pace of the game for it.

609
00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:06.550
So it's not like an intense pixel head first person shooter or whatever.
Right?

610
00:32:06.551 --> 00:32:08.110
You maybe make something,
it's a little bit more adventure,

611
00:32:08.111 --> 00:32:08.970
like a little bit more missed,

612
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.290
like where you kind of explore and then you kind of gesture like you know,

613
00:32:11.291 --> 00:32:13.570
it was kind of,
you know,
move,
move forward and then kind of,
you know,

614
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.690
like you're kind of like maybe your character is kind of driven by the breeze of

615
00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:18.850
the wind and you're kind of guiding the wind and maybe it's kind of like that

616
00:32:18.851 --> 00:32:20.230
game flower and that kind of thing.
Right?

617
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.120
I fucking audio is going all over the board here.

618
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.060
You can design anything for that.
Any kind of interface.

619
00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:28.140
As long as you designed the right game,
be a touchscreen,
be a connect,
be a move,

620
00:32:28.141 --> 00:32:30.910
be at anything,
right?
You just have to step back and build it for it.
Right?

621
00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:34.720
You play Mario Galaxy Mario Galaxy too.
I wasn't a fan of it.

622
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:39.740
Really careful.
This is sacred ground.
Your,
I see the problem is I um,

623
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.940
I don't like that.
And the we controller at all.
I hate the,

624
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:48.640
we just because of the controller you late and no,
no.
I mean it's just,
I,

625
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.400
it's just too much for me.
I liked the ps three,

626
00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:54.380
the Xbox controller for the most part.

627
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:57.740
I think that's just what I'm used to for people don't know what is the

628
00:32:57.741 --> 00:32:58.670
difference?
Well the,

629
00:32:58.671 --> 00:33:01.880
we have like a nun chuck and you have this whole thing going on and what is the,

630
00:33:01.881 --> 00:33:05.130
we look like?
It's like a long slender little mini controller.

631
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.650
The left with a stick and then the right is like,

632
00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:09.800
it looks like a remote control and like to hold a swim at the same time.

633
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.290
They're connected with a string.
And you'll think going to strangle somebody,

634
00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:15.170
right?
Like we were wallet chain or I've never played a single year.
I have it.

635
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:19.100
I haven't even touched it.
Yeah.
See I like the,
Oh,

636
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.530
I wish that you had the opposite.
See that's the problem.

637
00:33:21.531 --> 00:33:23.180
When you get into like connect and stuff like that.

638
00:33:23.181 --> 00:33:26.900
Cause I would love to be able to play gears of war connect but I have to also

639
00:33:26.901 --> 00:33:29.150
like the option once in a while to lay in bed and not play

640
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.460
the advancements that they unveiled yesterday at the press conferences that you

641
00:33:33.461 --> 00:33:34.131
can play.
You know,

642
00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:36.620
the whole connecting with all the motion sensor but you can do it on your couch

643
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.470
now she can sit there and do this kind of stuff and the finger controls.

644
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.350
So they showed this really sweet demo where this guy was sitting there and

645
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.760
drawing those uh,

646
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.030
like it was like Verizon commercials where they were moving the light and kind

647
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:49.310
of with the long exposure and kind of creating those shapes.

648
00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.310
And he was like drawing this little like a spark pattern with his finger.

649
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.400
And then he rotated his hips and it kind of it around to show it looked pretty

650
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:59.120
cool.
I'm going to draw a Dick so and have the dad.

651
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:00.710
The other thing they unveiled with a ted to connect Cameron,

652
00:34:00.711 --> 00:34:02.450
you can take a little stuffed animal and take a photo of it.

653
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.050
It makes a little animated version of that in the game.
It's pretty high.

654
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.760
That's cool.
Shit.
I love how this technology is starting to the,

655
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.820
to actually recognize us now.
Technology like the connect and the Internet is,

656
00:34:12.821 --> 00:34:17.570
is showing similar abilities of actually identifying you and shaping you out of

657
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:21.390
the universe and saying,
hmm.
You know,
and that's a good deal.
What are the,

658
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:24.200
one of the best things you could ever do is to get it is disabled Facebook

659
00:34:24.201 --> 00:34:27.290
notifications because what happens is like you're,

660
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:29.900
you're a slave to that shit and it's telling you when to read it as opposed to

661
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.880
going and checking in at your leisure.
Right.

662
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:34.790
Cause it's just a spam to you all fucking day long man.
I know where you are.

663
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.440
Don't even get me started on the locator.

664
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.660
We talked a little bit at the end of privacy last time and how it was like

665
00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:43.010
showing all this a apple iCloud shit that's going on.
I think it's cool cause uh,

666
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:46.640
you know when you have a fucking iPhone and an iPod and iPad and you don't like

667
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.610
getting iTunes to sync and transfer all that stuff.
Can Be Pretty fucking,

668
00:34:49.611 --> 00:34:53.180
we've lost music multiple times,
right?
Um,
but it's having all the fucking cloud.

669
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.830
Cool.
I mean that's what gaming is.
They wanted to go,

670
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:57.470
they have this shit called online where it's basically you're playing a video

671
00:34:57.471 --> 00:35:00.560
stream,
right?
And so you don't actually have a hard drive.

672
00:35:00.561 --> 00:35:03.710
It's a little micro console and there's just a video stream that's barely

673
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:07.670
compressed and there's maybe a little bit of lag.
Not much,
but it works.

674
00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:09.650
And you just play it immediately on demand.
Any game.

675
00:35:09.651 --> 00:35:11.960
And you don't even have to have an insane PC.

676
00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:15.510
You can play the highest end graphic PC experience too.
Cause she goes,

677
00:35:15.511 --> 00:35:17.240
it's video,
it's bacon it out to video.
And so what,

678
00:35:17.241 --> 00:35:20.120
they had all these data centers around and those are the states and it just
goes,

679
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:24.080
right.
Brian and I were talking about this yesterday and Brian was saying,
uh,

680
00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:27.140
I think it's a real good point.
With everything up in the cloud,

681
00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:30.170
people are going to hack into people's shit somehow or another,

682
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:32.250
a lot of stuff's going to get all of those,

683
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.270
the numbers that it costs Sony for all that fucking hat.
And unbelievable.

684
00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.670
Sony got hacked twice.
Sony got hacked.
Crazy.

685
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.370
It cost them a ton of fucking money there.
The police station entirely session.

686
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:43.950
Eric was down for like a month and it whole network,

687
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:46.800
it goes all goes back to that one dude who like hack the ps three and then Sony

688
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:48.720
tried to sue him because the hackers were pissed off about it.
Right.

689
00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:50.490
So this is by sitting down for a month.

690
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:53.670
Does that mean kids couldn't get online and play?
Imagine Xbox live,

691
00:35:53.671 --> 00:35:54.180
you just can't,

692
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.440
it doesn't work in entire like virtual good purchasing people playing all the

693
00:35:58.441 --> 00:35:59.730
different games online.
Just done.

694
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.150
There are games that could not have their Beta because the shit was down like in

695
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.250
the gears.
Beta was huge for us.
Right.
For testing it.

696
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:09.150
It took them off the market essentially for a whole month and then they came

697
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:12.090
back and had to give free games to everybody.
Yeah,
I shit load.

698
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:16.140
It's like a vehicle but also everybody's credit card numbers got compromised.

699
00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:17.670
Right.
Well apparently they were.

700
00:36:17.671 --> 00:36:20.320
So the stuff is being stored and like texts off our mat or something too,

701
00:36:20.321 --> 00:36:24.740
which is kind of
like injecting coated.
That's the rumor.

702
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.140
Yeah.
Yeah.
And there's still just,
that's ridiculous.

703
00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:32.160
And these people are on Twitter just talking about it every day now it's so

704
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:32.981
weird that that,

705
00:36:32.981 --> 00:36:37.110
that all this money is taken and all this identity and these guys can just be on

706
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:39.870
Twitter,
go like,
Hey I'm going to,
do you want us to do Sony,

707
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:44.160
Brazil next or the future of terrorism is Cybermen it's,

708
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.520
and that's why I love to connect because now our,

709
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.260
my whole house is scanned with my connect,
you know,

710
00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:51.660
so they have like a blueprint in my whole entire thing.

711
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.880
They could turn it on and listen to them.

712
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.920
<v 4>We turned the connect around for that weeping.
It's,</v>

713
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:03.950
it's the equivalent of light and gentle slap [inaudible] turn the connector,

714
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.690
take taking a photo of your parents and kind of putting that down.

715
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.180
And I do like how they connect does move up and down too.

716
00:37:14.181 --> 00:37:17.480
I didn't know that cause I just had it sitting on my TV and it flew off.

717
00:37:17.481 --> 00:37:19.970
I'm like,
what the fuck just happened?
And I noticed that it did.

718
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.850
It's following you.
It's a head.
It's a robot.

719
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.400
It's watching any Roebuck and approving of your moves is going to be a video

720
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:31.280
game,
right?
Don't you think there'll be a fuck video game?
Oh you,
you,
you,

721
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.120
they'll scan your body and then you'll both look hot as fuck in the video game.

722
00:37:35.121 --> 00:37:37.640
You remember the whole teledildonics thing to watch yourself.
Fuck.

723
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:41.930
And it does what you're doing,
but it's actually people that are hot.

724
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.560
We just put like,
just don't look at each other ever.

725
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:48.250
Fleshlight integration and you only look at the screen.

726
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:48.701
<v 3>I fucking,</v>

727
00:37:48.701 --> 00:37:52.180
last time you busted that flashlight out and you pulled the main rubbery thing

728
00:37:52.181 --> 00:37:53.700
out and the water dripping off of it,

729
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.710
<v 4>like don't do it.
Don't fucking know.
I just,
I was thinking about that.</v>

730
00:37:57.711 --> 00:38:00.800
That probably is the future of pornography.
What's that?

731
00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.620
That's the future that to do,
to have like a virtual relation peel ritual,

732
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:10.550
hot person that moves the way you move and so you can watch this instead of this

733
00:38:10.551 --> 00:38:13.460
disgusting person you're married to guy or girl.

734
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.600
You can watch this super hot male or female doing to you,

735
00:38:17.601 --> 00:38:21.460
everything that's happening in real life,
but you're seeing it on the screen.
Yup.

736
00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:26.000
So when you flip over and she's gone doggy style like,

737
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.970
and she's not looking at you and you're not looking at how you both look at the

738
00:38:28.971 --> 00:38:33.290
screen and you're seeing what you're actually doing.
But it's hot people.

739
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.070
But that's more for dudes because dudes are visually

740
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.520
<v 3>oriented.
Right?
You don't think girls are slightly visually oriented.</v>

741
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.450
But if you get a stack rank,

742
00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:45.220
that shit gave up the option to have Ashton Kutcher bone in you or you know,

743
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.920
cause it definitely,
or Brock Ashton Kutcher,

744
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:53.830
he's got some Nice La douce double going on there.
I don't know.
Brian does.

745
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.040
That's lazy.
That's donor right there.
Yeah.

746
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:02.080
I just shaved my beard led douche doubles.
Just a little more manicured dude.

747
00:39:02.081 --> 00:39:05.650
It's so fucking funny.
Whatever.
Met these conferences and we yo,
you stay like,

748
00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:08.410
you know like the standard or the W or whatever.
Right.
Those are the worst.

749
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.350
You're hanging out and like I love it when like it's my people,
right.

750
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:14.470
I could spot the gaming people and were,
you know,
they're trashed.

751
00:39:14.471 --> 00:39:17.590
Journalists are like,
what's up?
I love your shit man.
I'm like,
cool man.
Right.

752
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:19.090
It's cool.
It's what's up.

753
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:22.030
And then there's always the last day of the conference where everybody gets out

754
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:24.400
of town because I have to go to the east coast.
I have to stay that last night.

755
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.280
And he could just see like when the dude she's come back in.
Right.

756
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:29.420
It's like all of the dazzled shirts and shit.

757
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:38.170
Shit.
Those ed hardy fucking glitter shirts.
Who thought that was good?

758
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.800
The Florida Lee Dude,
they took,

759
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.600
they took a symbol floor delete Orleans French thing.
Right.

760
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:48.300
It's a French Canadian thing and it sets Lawrence from New Orleans and she's a

761
00:39:48.301 --> 00:39:51.470
year and the number one tattoo all if he ever gets that fucking flirted.
Liam,

762
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.850
what does it stand for though?
I'm not actually sure.
Something French.
Yes,

763
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.810
it's Franci.
Well I know Randy couture has it tattooed on his arm too.

764
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.240
I'm going to get my ass kicked for saying that now.

765
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:05.800
Thanks to [inaudible] understand what it was for.
I might have a heritage thing.

766
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:08.290
Right.
As far as French Canadian or it might be a,
you know,

767
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:10.660
as far as the French New Orleans type thing.
Have you been to that city man?

768
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:14.680
New Orleans?
Yeah,
a long time ago.
We need to go back.

769
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.720
He was only there for a UFC.
I was there.
I didn't get to see it.

770
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.930
When you're in town for that stuff,
do you,
I mean you do your show,

771
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:23.770
you do UFC in new jet.
It depends.
It depends on how much time I have.
You know,

772
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.690
sometimes I get there a day or like Vancouver,

773
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:29.050
I get there a day early because I have a show on Thursday so I'll do Thursday

774
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.400
night,
Friday nights.
I'll stop you there for three nights.
Okay.

775
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.850
You come back to Charlotte chance to check it out?
No,

776
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.060
I don't have anything booked in Charlotte.
Bummer.
You love that place.

777
00:40:37.061 --> 00:40:40.870
I know you still love living in North Carolina.
I do,
man.
Very Green.

778
00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:44.080
I love it because I get to travel all the fucking time.
Right.
Like Ifr,

779
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.000
the sleepy little southern town cause making video games.

780
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:47.320
It's not always hanging out.

781
00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:49.600
Doing podcasts like this and fucking hanging out with ice tea.

782
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:53.410
You sit behind a fucking TV or computer monitor and you do email or you're

783
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:55.840
sitting in a test lab plane of broken game going,
fuck,
this sucks.

784
00:40:55.841 --> 00:40:57.010
Why are we done yet?
Right.

785
00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.450
Bunch of people must figure out the cliffy be from epic games lives in our town

786
00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.300
and that must be a weird thing.
You must be that weird guy.

787
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.610
It gets weird because you're in a little tiny ass town and you're driving around

788
00:41:07.611 --> 00:41:12.370
in a fucking Lamborghini.
You're,
you're that guy.
I'm not going to lie.

789
00:41:12.371 --> 00:41:16.800
The car has not gotten old.
The brothers always yell at me.
How does yell yellow?

790
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.160
You're sitting there at the top down and mind my own business.
Just show it.

791
00:41:19.161 --> 00:41:24.040
Also just relaxing.
I was like,
Yo.
I'm like,
fuck,
what's up man?
I'm like,

792
00:41:24.041 --> 00:41:27.550
dude,
don't scares the shit out of me every fucking time.
Right?

793
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.650
People driving by it,
they're like,

794
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.200
they were like following me and they think that they also want to race too and

795
00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.130
like you don't have 30 fucking six years old.
I got a lot to lose here.

796
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:36.980
I'm not being thrown in jail for fucking drag racing down Glenwood fucking

797
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:39.440
avenue.
Like seriously.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

798
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.600
I don't get the racing shit.
I don't bet
I've done it.

799
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.390
Really?
Sure.
What are you driving it for?
Sure.
I have a gt three,

800
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:51.040
a Porsche gt three cools my favorite car.
I fucking,
dude,
I'm,
I'm not,

801
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.210
I don't want to wrap my shit around a treatment.
Yeah,
I don't do that either,

802
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.250
but I've done it.
I knew a guy in town.
You fucking did that ever.

803
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:57.710
It's rappers miles ride around a tree fucking dive or from the cops,
right?

804
00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.460
Oh Jesus.
I think it's just a certain type of guy who,
who cannot go out who you,

805
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:03.680
if,
if you get a nice car like that and you like to go out and drink,

806
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.790
you can't bring the fucking car.
Right.
Because it's not gonna end well.
Right.

807
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:10.100
And you're like so insecure and you need to park the car outside the fucking

808
00:42:10.101 --> 00:42:14.390
club,
dude.
Like really what your car is up to the whole time,

809
00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.530
you have to put your keys in the bar.
Like what's up?
How's it going?
Right.

810
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:22.600
But yeah,
it's fun in that town though,
Dude.
Um,
like when,
you know,
I did Fallon,

811
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.580
like the bars I go to all head to the show on and everything like that.
Right.

812
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:29.570
And um,
it's tiny though.
I'll tell you the dating scene is fucking horrible.

813
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.500
I'm sure it's monsters,
right?
And uh,
but North Carolina monsters,

814
00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.630
you believe in Jesus.
People are cool.
I need to know before this goes,

815
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:44.480
North Carolina is a great state and
you go 20 minutes outside of town.

816
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:46.850
It gets really fucking scary.
Texas.
I Love Austin.

817
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.080
What if you drive 20 minutes outside of Austin to just drag and black people

818
00:42:51.081 --> 00:42:54.770
behind trucks?
Once you see a fucking cracker,
once a cracker barrel shows up,

819
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.450
fucking run.
That's my rule.
It's like the end of civilization,

820
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:02.030
like the cracker barrel and beyond that,
the cracker Trex,

821
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:06.080
this has got these amazing spots,
these amazing bright lights.

822
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:10.780
And then as you go deep into the,
you know,
Texas is fucking huge.
I know,
I know.

823
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.080
But as you go deep into those shady,
weird,
barely populated areas,

824
00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.700
they're scary as fuck.
Yup.
Yup.

825
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.720
And there's a math everywhere out there.

826
00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.310
All those little lightly populated areas.
Oh,
at one point out here too.

827
00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.890
It's like at what point you're like,
I'm going to huff.

828
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.330
That sounds like a fucking,
probably very early.

829
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.510
Some fucking whippets and grow up in Palmdale.
And you know,

830
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:37.070
Bakersfield Dad's been punching in the face every day since you were six,

831
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:41.030
you know?
What do you think on the console timeline?

832
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.750
Where do you think we are with the,
like the current generation console?

833
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:45.820
They're going to try it.
They're gonna ride this.
One of the wheels fall off.

834
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.570
It's like they can write,
well dude,
I'm sitting here like,

835
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:49.760
you look at some of the shit we haven't gears three and you look at it,

836
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.310
I saw the new tomb raider last night.
We'll look.
It looks really fucking good.

837
00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:53.144
And all the kids in the form,

838
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.520
and it's 2011 they're still making a tomb raider last equals the one that fails

839
00:43:58.521 --> 00:44:02.160
to make money,
dude.
All right.
Yeah.
So the thing is is it looks really good,
right?

840
00:44:02.161 --> 00:44:04.430
And so what they did was Lara Croft no longer looks like a trainee.

841
00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:08.050
Michael Jackson,
she looks like this hot little girl,
right?
And she,
and she puts,

842
00:44:08.051 --> 00:44:09.890
she just looked like a stripper.
She's,
she's attractive,

843
00:44:09.891 --> 00:44:12.620
but she didn't look like a whore and she's like filthy all the time.
Right.

844
00:44:12.621 --> 00:44:15.020
And so I'm sitting there looking at the demo last night and all I can think of

845
00:44:15.021 --> 00:44:18.050
is that scene in grandma's boy with the guys jerking off to the little aircraft

846
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:20.210
figure.
And he said,
cause she's dirty or in the game,
right?
It's,

847
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:25.220
you're a dirty girl there
and it's fucking brutal.
Like she's,

848
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.610
she's on this island with these fucking savages and like they keep trying to

849
00:44:28.611 --> 00:44:30.270
grab it,
right.
It's like a little cutie.

850
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:32.520
Like you're going to get raped and he had x to not get raped.
Right.

851
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.990
And the grabbing and it takes like a fucking actually hits and killed and right

852
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.540
in the fucking head,
man.
It's like brutal.

853
00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:40.560
And like she got crushed by rocks and just die and all these crazy ass ways.

854
00:44:40.561 --> 00:44:42.120
Right.
He gets killed with an axe.

855
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:44.850
Was it a pick ax or an ax to like a throw to the forehead?
Man,

856
00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:46.250
it was fucking harsh,
man.
Yeah.

857
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.510
I don't think you should have video gangs where women get killed by accident.

858
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.990
You just play them just to lose it.

859
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.140
<v 0>What's up bro?
Get hacked up.
Loser.</v>

860
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.620
The coppers chop.

861
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.570
<v 3>I think it was,
could talk.
It was like a,
when you announced girls in gears three,</v>

862
00:45:02.571 --> 00:45:05.820
they're like,
should she be chainsawed I've thought about this for about a beat.

863
00:45:05.821 --> 00:45:06.171
And we're like,

864
00:45:06.171 --> 00:45:08.330
let me tell you the gears for some reason has a lot of female fans.

865
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.930
I don't fucking know why right now we haven't lockable pink guns just for shits

866
00:45:11.931 --> 00:45:14.090
and giggles.
Right?
It's even better if I kill you and have a pink gun.

867
00:45:14.091 --> 00:45:16.070
It's an inner,
he was way better.
And uh,

868
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.890
and I guarantee if you were to take any of those fans of the game and the girls

869
00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:21.800
and be like,
you can't get chain saw the big fuck that I don't want to chance.

870
00:45:21.801 --> 00:45:24.100
I'd like everybody else.
I want you to curb stuck in my head,
right?

871
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.980
So when you see this locus creature stand over little blonde on Ya and rip off

872
00:45:27.981 --> 00:45:32.800
her fucking arm and beat her to death with it.
Yeah.
It's like

873
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.110
evil dead violence.
Right.
He's not like,

874
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.960
he's not like climbing on top of her and gouging out her fucking eyeballs.
Right.

875
00:45:38.961 --> 00:45:42.320
It's comedic.
Right.
Beating somebody does with their own fucking arm.
Really?
Yeah.

876
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.830
<v 0>It's not legible.
It's not going to inspire someone to go out and do that.
No.</v>

877
00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.940
I would argue the opposite is true.

878
00:45:47.941 --> 00:45:52.110
That someone who might be inclined to do that might find vicarious pleasure

879
00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:56.640
through the argument that Japan uses.
Right?
Yeah.
I mean,
look,

880
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:57.250
a lot of people

881
00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.870
<v 3>believe that and then it makes sense to me.</v>

882
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.090
It makes sense that there needs to be some sort of outlet.

883
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.720
I bet if you could get like porn and flashlights in prison,

884
00:46:04.721 --> 00:46:08.290
I bet rapes would drop dramatically.
It's such a fucking fan.
I'm sitting there.

885
00:46:08.291 --> 00:46:08.580
Um,

886
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.080
so we were hanging out with ice and he had a couple of boys and they're talking

887
00:46:11.081 --> 00:46:13.300
about it.
He's like,
yeah,
he did three,
he did five and I'm like,

888
00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.180
I would be fucked in prison.
I'd have three a year.
So cage.

889
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.420
And that's such a weird mentality.
We take it,
you know,

890
00:46:19.421 --> 00:46:22.660
straight men and put them all together and get matter of time,

891
00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.760
they're going to fuck dude.
Right.

892
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.420
It's so popular in the Mexican community that called gay for the stay.

893
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.850
<v 0>Have like a</v>

894
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.140
movie with Edward James Olmos.
Yeah,

895
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.580
I remember they were all gay for each other.

896
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.120
<v 3>Yeah.
Well apparently that's just the way it is.
You know,</v>

897
00:46:41.121 --> 00:46:43.820
like these guys just accepted.
That's like the gay for pay.

898
00:46:43.821 --> 00:46:45.860
The guys who just do gay porn just for the money.
Right?

899
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.330
<v 0>Yeah.
I don't ever buy that,
man.</v>

900
00:46:48.331 --> 00:46:51.810
I remember I read that there's a guide that they were talking about that did

901
00:46:51.811 --> 00:46:54.510
that years ago,
and there was a story in Esquire and I was,

902
00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:59.010
I remember reading it going,
this is fucking
Peter North did a gay porn.

903
00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:02.790
Yes.
An orgasm.
Fucking man.
You're probably gay.

904
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.250
Why is your Dick hard dude fucking hangup.

905
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.950
Yeah.
I'm pretending to be gay right now.

906
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:14.400
They're only gay for pay if they never come.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

907
00:47:14.401 --> 00:47:18.410
you have to this to get your money.
You got to get paid [inaudible] shot.
No,

908
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.370
I don't want to see that.
It's not a good dude.

909
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.180
It was the same story as the movie,
but the ratchet it up there,

910
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.690
there's fucking lady boys in there.

911
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:28.950
They shut the whole nine yards and Helms gets fucked by a lady by,

912
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.940
sorry to spoil the movie.

913
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:35.030
<v 3>What the fuck dude,
spoiler alert.
He had his,
where he's talking to his,</v>

914
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.930
his,
he's like,
I got a demon in me and Zach Alphadex is just like,

915
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:42.760
you've got to see me in yet.
They show up at this bar,

916
00:47:42.761 --> 00:47:45.070
they're trying to figure out what happened and you see this girl and you're

917
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:45.401
looking at it.

918
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:48.310
She looks like a dude version of Nicole Scherzinger from the pussycat dolls.

919
00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:51.640
Right.
And I'm like,
I look at Lauren,
I'm like,
it's a lady boy.
She's like,
what?

920
00:47:51.641 --> 00:47:54.240
I'm like,
wait for it.
And eventually she's like,
she's not,

921
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:56.920
it's not called Bangkok,
it's called,
it's not called bank cons.

922
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:57.910
It's called Bangkok.

923
00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.820
And should they show the fucking lady boy dick just like right out there,
right.

924
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.840
Not only is it like you thinking he fucked her in the ass,
but no,

925
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.450
she plowed him in the ass.
And then she's like,
yeah,
and then,
you know,

926
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:09.520
I came and you came in the floor.
That's how it was.
I was just like,

927
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.810
this is a number one opening rated r movie in America in 2011.
I'm like,

928
00:48:13.811 --> 00:48:14.760
Holy Shit.
Right?

929
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.040
There's a lot of Dick in movies these days and you notice that I shouldn't try

930
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:20.950
not to.
Ever since,
uh,
forgetting Sarah Marshall,

931
00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:23.680
there's just full frontal Dick Everywhere.
It's so loud.

932
00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:25.120
But you can't show vaginas yet.

933
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.820
You can't insert sheep aren't ready for that because Dick's or funny,

934
00:48:27.821 --> 00:48:29.680
especially when they're not,
when they're hard,

935
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:32.020
they're totally different than it's threatening.
It's like,
no,

936
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.720
there's no two different vaginas,
vaginas,
vaginas.

937
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.670
But there's two different things though.
The baboons in flame,

938
00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:41.380
he posts sex vagina's different,
little blown out one,
right?

939
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.670
I don't know what kind of damage you're doing.
I want to back off.

940
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:50.230
A little might be ruined and something son get a little pinker,

941
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.210
but Dick's,
you know,
there's,
there's quite a,

942
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:58.730
there's quite a difference between the flacid in the hard dude.
You know,

943
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:03.060
I remember I was threatened.
I saw 28 days later in the theater.
Right.

944
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.980
There's the opening scene.
Fucking awesome movies.
See Cillian Murphy.

945
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:09.160
He sees Dick for like two seconds.
I was in the theater enough time for you.

946
00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:14.110
I needed,
I need hours.
I need miles up.
Dik Dik Dik dik dik dik all the time.

947
00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.410
You,
oh,
I,
that's a good ring.
Turn right there guys.
Cut that part out.

948
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:21.350
[inaudible]

949
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.080
Harvey Keitel was reservoir dogs.

950
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.730
My whole point is about the American cycling.

951
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.280
People walked out of the fucking theater because of the day,

952
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.250
just because of the two seconds a day.
Walked out of the theater.

953
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.300
I was in Laverne,
California.
That's a Dick Junkie.

954
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.150
That's what they just showed him a line of meth and he could take it.

955
00:49:40.151 --> 00:49:42.310
That's what that looks.
That line,
but tower level payments.

956
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.360
It's your point about interracial porn in the south.
Right.

957
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:47.560
I quoted that to ist the other day.
He thought that was fucking funny.
Man.

958
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:52.840
That's never in my life.
Did I think I'd be quoting Joe to ice?
What the fuck man?

959
00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:56.290
Right.
Do everything.
We'll see like old school,

960
00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:59.830
like when Webcam is first came back on a are into video games where you used to

961
00:49:59.831 --> 00:50:03.070
be able to like take a photo of your face and it puts you on like a Tony Hawk

962
00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:05.300
characters.
Oh Dude,
we're going to see that again.

963
00:50:05.301 --> 00:50:07.720
But I'm sure it's some of the working on that kind of stuff for connect so that

964
00:50:07.721 --> 00:50:10.600
I can put my balls on my character's face.
Exactly.
Our gears of war.

965
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.800
Cause like you think with the connect,

966
00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:16.970
like paste a bunch of Dicks to your head in the game and I can run around a

967
00:50:17.051 --> 00:50:20.650
million.
Well you have a meter that fills up and they're all flashing.

968
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:24.400
You unleashed the rage now I'll go [inaudible] yeah,
why not?

969
00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.190
It would probably have some dick detector to make sure done.
We've thought it up

970
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.230
<v 4>right now.
Someone else beat us to it.</v>

971
00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:35.230
Somebody else thought about doing that and probably just done it.
Yeah.
That,
that,

972
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.570
that subset of Japanese pornography where it's like the girls being torn apart

973
00:50:38.571 --> 00:50:43.571
while they're shitting and alien with a Coptic posters with dicks and stuff.

974
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.130
I was in fucking Akihabara.
Uh,

975
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.100
in Japan they have these little shops that are like,

976
00:50:49.101 --> 00:50:52.070
the stairways are only so wide that one person can make it through and it's

977
00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:55.010
these little porn stores and there's like six floors in the first floor is just

978
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:55.844
kind of like,
you know,

979
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.630
little school girls naked and as you go up it gets worse and worse and worse.

980
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:03.590
It's like the dark days and Ferno levels of hell and you get to the top and it's

981
00:51:03.591 --> 00:51:06.560
like stuff you can't unsee.
You're like,
what subset?

982
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:09.650
Like it's the same thing with like the David Carradine shit where like,
you know,

983
00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:13.840
the auto Rocky's fixation,
right.
At what point is jerking off that boring?
Yeah.

984
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:17.780
You need to almost die to make it fun.
Or they killed David Carradine and said,

985
00:51:17.781 --> 00:51:21.270
what's the best way to kill this guy?
Make it look completely ridiculous.
Well,

986
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:26.300
it's just them,
his dick out put them in a fucking wetsuit.
You know,

987
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.370
I wrote to make him look like a pre,
there was a priest that died.
It was a,

988
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.350
he had,
uh,
a black dildo up his ass.

989
00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:38.351
He was wearing a full scuba wet suit and he stuffed this dildo up his ass and

990
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:41.940
then died and strangled to death while I'm autoerotic UK's we've seen,

991
00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:46.760
the first thing I thought of is if I was going to kill a priest that molested
me,

992
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:51.920
I would probably do is choke them to death and then hang him and then put a

993
00:51:51.921 --> 00:51:56.040
black dildo up his ass and put them in a fucking wetsuit and love the adjective.

994
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:59.190
It's not pink one,
it's not a poker one who was black?

995
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.890
Black Dildo is deep up his ass and the drink.

996
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:08.100
I want to make the black cock and you get a double story like straight up,

997
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.600
extra stiff.
Right?
I guarantee you that's a murderer.

998
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.610
I guarantee you that's an unsolved murder.

999
00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:19.250
The preacher with a jerking off one day and he's like s and then like cut the

1000
00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.700
four is six months later and he's got the deal.
When he's asked,
he's like,

1001
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:26.480
it's not fucking working wet suit to me.

1002
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:29.810
Like there's an easier way to choke yourself if you had like a tie and just

1003
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:31.520
started twisting it.
Yeah.
Cause once you,

1004
00:52:31.521 --> 00:52:34.270
once you're fixing it to something they need to needed,

1005
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:38.330
it never ends well just about the suicide in it,
in the act I think,
you know,

1006
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.130
they're not trying to kill themselves.
Well no,

1007
00:52:40.131 --> 00:52:42.680
but the having an orgasm is like a,

1008
00:52:42.681 --> 00:52:47.180
you know the French call it a little bit of like linking the two together.

1009
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.680
So close is a ups the ante.
Uh,
not that I know.
Yeah.

1010
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:54.120
You get a little red around your neck.
Hit us with a,

1011
00:52:54.121 --> 00:52:56.570
a psychological point that I never ever considered.

1012
00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:00.740
There's always one kid in high school that like dyes that way and it's gotta be

1013
00:53:00.741 --> 00:53:01.790
hard enough to lose a kid.

1014
00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:06.791
But imagine fucking coming home and finding that like should just use one.

1015
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:08.000
It was like blood pressure,

1016
00:53:08.001 --> 00:53:11.720
things like wrap up on your arm that you can give free like at cvs.

1017
00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:14.000
Just wear it around your neck and it's turn it on,

1018
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.860
maybe squeeze and then it kills you.
It doesn't that go.

1019
00:53:18.861 --> 00:53:21.910
You gotta let that thing go.
You better off with the Thai twist,

1020
00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.000
the tie until you're about to go out and then,
but with the,

1021
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.350
with the blood and once you're letting go the tile on Ralph multitasking so

1022
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:30.160
you're not only keeping track of your health.
Yeah.

1023
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:32.470
And then you keep track and to get an accurate meeting.

1024
00:53:32.471 --> 00:53:35.340
He got you digging your hand fingers up,
your ass going to be able to,

1025
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:40.110
he's not your normal resting heart rate.
Elevated.
Still excited,

1026
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:44.160
but I think the more safety,
yeah,
I think you got a point there.

1027
00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:46.050
I think there's something about the choking yourself,

1028
00:53:46.051 --> 00:53:48.570
the hanging where you're like,
I'm so dirty.

1029
00:53:48.571 --> 00:53:52.780
I'm hanging while beating off with a wetsuit on honeybadger.

1030
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:57.690
He don't give a shit that's best internet me and fucking,

1031
00:53:57.691 --> 00:54:01.840
it's one of my favorite watch out that that bird,
I'm like,

1032
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:04.680
that guy needs a development deal right now for the discovery channel.

1033
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.250
I will post.

1034
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:08.880
Part of that video is in the honeybadger fucks up the Cobra but gets stung.

1035
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.200
And so he,

1036
00:54:10.201 --> 00:54:13.460
he's eating it and then he blacks out from all the venom and he's laying there

1037
00:54:13.461 --> 00:54:18.150
looking like a fat Al Bundy dirty covered in dirt laying there with his stomach

1038
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:21.570
up in the air and then shakes out of it and an hour later and just fucks that

1039
00:54:21.571 --> 00:54:25.960
snake up.
Then I'm just went right through his fucking insane.

1040
00:54:25.961 --> 00:54:26.820
A little system.

1041
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.250
So you think about it in the grand scheme of like nineties video,

1042
00:54:29.251 --> 00:54:30.870
we had a fucking at Ku to hedgehog.

1043
00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:33.000
Where was the fucking honeybadger I know they fucked.

1044
00:54:33.001 --> 00:54:34.470
That goes back to the neo problem.

1045
00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:37.200
You could not make them video game about a fucking honeybadger cause he can not

1046
00:54:37.201 --> 00:54:39.000
be killed.
And he takes everything down.

1047
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:41.570
Like what's the Kryptonite to fucking honey badger?

1048
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:45.210
They fuck up cobras grows the stinging and go have bitch.
What about that?

1049
00:54:45.211 --> 00:54:47.880
He's like,
fine.
Or some shit.

1050
00:54:47.881 --> 00:54:51.450
Like fuck you lion the lion [inaudible] yeah,
everything's afraid of those.

1051
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.870
He's like the Joe Pesci,
the animal kingdom.
Little fucker came to share.
Really.

1052
00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:59.940
It's another bad ass wolverines.
Even larger.
That movie was on TV yesterday.

1053
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:01.600
The fucking expert origins one that those,

1054
00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.320
so the ends of the big mortal combat fighters get horrible man.

1055
00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.190
You're on top like some shit I would pitch.
It's like,
all right,

1056
00:55:08.191 --> 00:55:11.010
so we've combined all of their fucking powers into one unit.

1057
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:14.370
It's Ryan Reynolds by the way,
and his mouth is shut so we can't talk,
get it.

1058
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.450
And he's got all the powers and that it's fucking beast and wolverine in a three

1059
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:22.890
player fight on top of a nuclear cooling tower.
Go like,
Nah Dude.

1060
00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.140
Excellent.
First class supposed to be good though.

1061
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:28.820
Have you seen this new we you that I was just an ad.
They actually go there.

1062
00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.760
They unveil it.
Everybody on the Twitter feeds bagging on the name,
but it's like,

1063
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:36.100
dude,
they will make the name cool.
Like you like Thor.
Uh,

1064
00:55:36.101 --> 00:55:38.040
actually I wanted to hate it but I thought it was really good.

1065
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:40.830
I thought Thor was fun.
It's fun.
It's fucking great.
He's the area,

1066
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:45.330
the area and barbarian I bought into it.
It works.
Yup.
They committed to it,

1067
00:55:45.331 --> 00:55:47.400
but they had it up for that.
Like we were just like,
Oh yeah,
I'm a Thor.

1068
00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.740
Then they tase him.
Right.
And then I was like,
I liked this drink.

1069
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:53.370
This is delicious.
And he fucking smash it with a cup.
Right.
I liked that.
I was,

1070
00:55:53.371 --> 00:55:55.900
I thought it was big robot thing too.
Yeah.
The

1071
00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:01.180
green lantern.
Like why don't remember the green lanner being awesome.

1072
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:04.780
They're kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel superheroes right now.
Like,

1073
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:08.220
isn't it weird?
You can't come up with a new one?
What's the last,

1074
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:11.490
the last one I can remember?
Fucking spawn.
Yes.

1075
00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:17.250
Kick ass.
Why did they stop making spawns?
Remember the,

1076
00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:19.440
because the tool needs to do for HBO.
So that was good.

1077
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.270
What was wrong with the movie?
I didn't mind in the,
in

1078
00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:29.560
<v 3>my opinion.
Yeah,
it's Michael.
Jai White is a friend of mine,
so I liked the movie.</v>

1079
00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:32.680
You remember the,
uh,
the,
when she start knowing people in entertainment,

1080
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:36.520
it's such a nice guy.
He's one of the nicest guys in the world.

1081
00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:39.970
My buddy Gary widow used to edit PC gamer magazine and he wrote book of Eli.

1082
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.640
He's like posting photos of him at Danville.
Like what's up?

1083
00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:45.300
And I'm going into this like,
fuck,
I hope this is fucking good.

1084
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.830
It's actually pretty fucking good film right

1085
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:53.620
<v 4>to the end.
And you're like,
wait,
what?
He was blind.
What?
That's the Bible.</v>

1086
00:56:53.621 --> 00:56:57.820
Get the Fuck Outta here with dad.
You gotta have you damn dirty orbs.

1087
00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.700
You're ruined it all moment.
Right.
So you look at like Matthew,

1088
00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:02.330
<v 3>you looking at Mark Miller,</v>

1089
00:57:02.331 --> 00:57:04.940
Mark Miller and some of those comic book writers are doing it right now.

1090
00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:08.450
For some reason the studios don't want to bet on a lot of it cause kickass was

1091
00:57:08.451 --> 00:57:12.470
fucking great man.
The whole watchman was great too.
It was good.
Um,

1092
00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:14.600
apparently I didn't get to see sucker punch.
It wasn't,

1093
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:17.390
I loved the Watchman v for vendetta to,

1094
00:57:17.391 --> 00:57:21.060
that was terrific shit.
Son fucking days.

1095
00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:25.120
The most Dixie ever see on digital space Dick Right there and they,

1096
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:27.770
a real dick graphic novel is even better than the movie.

1097
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:34.010
<v 4>Tough week alert.
Yeah,
it's true though.
I mean you have to do graphics,</v>

1098
00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:37.970
fancy comic books,
graphic novels with my actions

1099
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.930
<v 3>figures.
This is a real novel.
Those clips,</v>

1100
00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:43.350
you have to go back to [inaudible].

1101
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.080
I gotta go be cooped up in a booth like veal p and journalists to go.

1102
00:57:47.081 --> 00:57:48.700
Can you tell me if I give it to soc

1103
00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:53.270
<v 4>across the table and fucking strangle them?</v>

1104
00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.480
<v 3>Yeah,
you're quite the impression is this,
the,</v>

1105
00:57:56.481 --> 00:57:59.420
you showed a side of yourself today on this podcast that you didn't allow.

1106
00:57:59.421 --> 00:58:01.540
That was a drama nerd in high school.
While you're,

1107
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:05.000
you're much more loose with your impressions today.
We appreciate it.

1108
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:07.510
Thank you for talking about Dicks and making me feel loose.
Dude.

1109
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.760
Thank you for coming over and being with us for an hour before you got to do

1110
00:58:10.761 --> 00:58:13.460
your official duties.
Cliff would be,
he's an awesome dude.

1111
00:58:13.461 --> 00:58:16.670
I've known cliffy forever.
We've known each other for like 10 years now.

1112
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.020
We're all dude,
he's a cool guy.
Very cool guy.
Follow him on Twitter.
Uh,

1113
00:58:21.021 --> 00:58:25.400
the real cliffy B and a and if anybody wants to get gears of war,

1114
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:29.490
that's easy.
You know where the fuck to get that shit.
Just don't rent it,
buy it,

1115
00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.030
don't buy it.

1116
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:36.230
That comes with a gears of war one and two it comes with a you against a dude's

1117
00:58:36.231 --> 00:58:38.150
resell on their shit on Ebay and stuff like that.

1118
00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.490
If you're a dude reselling your shit,

1119
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:42.440
it is what it is in the stuff's been a good partner as far as like launching the

1120
00:58:42.441 --> 00:58:46.130
game,
but three quarters of their businesses,
he used games,
man once.

1121
00:58:46.131 --> 00:58:50.990
If you buy a used game,
you're not our customer.
You're right.
Right.

1122
00:58:50.991 --> 00:58:54.080
So and so what's happening is everybody's moving to these games as service

1123
00:58:54.081 --> 00:58:56.780
movements and getting online and everything like that.
So big box retail,

1124
00:58:56.870 --> 00:59:00.170
how much can they save if they buy a used game stuff,

1125
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:03.350
we'll buy that shit from you for you buy for $60 day one they bought used for

1126
00:59:03.351 --> 00:59:05.630
like five or 10 and then they resell it for 50 it's bullshit.

1127
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:09.690
<v 4>Really?
Yeah.
Why?
For five bucks and resell it.
When a</v>

1128
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:12.360
<v 3>playstation two I wanted to get our places,
whatever.</v>

1129
00:59:12.361 --> 00:59:13.920
I wanted to get a new playstation three and I was like,

1130
00:59:13.921 --> 00:59:17.460
how much is it used when they were like,
ah,
it's the two 79 I'm like,

1131
00:59:17.461 --> 00:59:21.100
how much does a new and two 99 like what the fuck to call her?
Right?

1132
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.040
Can't complain

1133
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.580
<v 4>about this because I drive a Lamborghini.
So if I could wait,</v>

1134
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:27.790
you wind up looking like Lars.
All right,

1135
00:59:27.791 --> 00:59:31.040
remember Lars Lars,

1136
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:33.920
you live in a fucking castle in the sky,
which shut the fuck up.

1137
00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:38.120
Just completely ridiculous it that that fucked him man.
Because everybody said,

1138
00:59:38.121 --> 00:59:42.200
well,
this guy is super fucking greedy.
Yup.
But your point stands.
I mean,

1139
00:59:42.201 --> 00:59:43.880
it makes a lot of sense,
but the thing,

1140
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:46.100
the thing to keep in mind is forget about the fact that,
you know,

1141
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:49.220
I've been doing this inside 17 bleeding out of the eyeballs to do it.

1142
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:51.920
I'd like to think I earned when I fucking have,
right.
That said,

1143
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:53.510
if this trend continues,

1144
00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:56.390
you're not going to see as many AAA games because the money's not coming in for

1145
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:59.670
the budget for the fucking game has.
Because these guys,

1146
00:59:59.671 --> 01:00:02.060
his game flaw and all these different guys that sell used things.

1147
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.330
Have you seen a tangible drop off in sales because of this?
Uh,

1148
01:00:05.331 --> 01:00:10.331
so gears to sold over 6 million copies and we know how many unique user ids

1149
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.240
touched Xbox live of it.
I don't want to give numbers,
but it's significant.

1150
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:18.770
Would you be more in favor of a rental sort of market where I'm wondering why.

1151
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.381
I'm wondering why,

1152
01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:23.480
why Microsoft and Sony eight don't actually have their own rental boxes and say

1153
01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:26.500
resell the shit to us.
But the key,
they all,

1154
01:00:26.501 --> 01:00:29.630
the only way we can get past that as to make a game that gamers Marion don't

1155
01:00:29.631 --> 01:00:32.590
date,
right?
They make a game that they fucking play forever.
A cereal.

1156
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.670
I don't think most guys even consider the economic impact of it.

1157
01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:39.140
I think they look at it and they say,
well,

1158
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.060
I'm going to save 20 bucks buy button to use.
When I was like,
you know,
I'm,

1159
01:00:43.061 --> 01:00:46.310
I'm looking at my bank account when I was working at Mcdonald's and I could take

1160
01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:50.420
out $20 intervals and I had $43 I was like,
sweet.
I have two withdrawals left.

1161
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:51.960
I mean,
that's how it is when you're young.
Right?

1162
01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:54.740
Basically what you're saying is do what you gotta do,

1163
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:57.680
but if you can make a choice please by the,

1164
01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:01.130
and hopefully we'll make the game that justifies what we call a day fucking one

1165
01:01:01.131 --> 01:01:04.780
purchase.
Right?
The key to doing it,
it's buy it off Amazon and Amazon's always,

1166
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.290
I'm on a deal.
I don't really think so.

1167
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:08.720
I go to the store for an hour or a fucking clothing and food.

1168
01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:13.010
Everything else is online.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm a huge online shopper.
One quick,

1169
01:01:13.011 --> 01:01:16.460
one quick one.
So easy.
You can buy whatever sneaker you're looking for.

1170
01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:20.690
Black Dildos,
all our podcasts,
stuff you get by it all.

1171
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.870
You guys have fleshlight hooked me up by the way.
Oh,
here you got.

1172
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.100
Why you taking your fucking users that new?
That's the new debt.
That's very kind.

1173
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.490
There's an industry that will not be affected by you sales anytime.

1174
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.500
[inaudible]

1175
01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.710
that off the table fetish that comes up.

1176
01:01:38.711 --> 01:01:43.580
How do we stop the use market to start Victoria's secret doesn't have to deal

1177
01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:47.510
with the,
even the question would be like a Brian red band question.
Okay.

1178
01:01:47.511 --> 01:01:50.660
How do we stop them from selling used ones as masturbate on when we would just

1179
01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:53.630
go dude,
shut up.
The meeting would continue.

1180
01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:58.280
All right.
I think we got roll.
Please roll.
Thank you very much for coming.

1181
01:01:58.310 --> 01:01:59.860
We'll take a little intermission real quick.
Yeah.

1182
01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.170
We're to take just a couple of minutes and we'll be back with my boy Johnny

1183
01:02:03.171 --> 01:02:04.130
rotten.
He's to my right

1184
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:24.280
<v 3>where I didn't even notice that.
Where is it in the main living off the,</v>

1185
01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:25.450
check it out later.

1186
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:30.190
Have you ever talked to you by walking on the chase to go so she,

1187
01:10:30.191 --> 01:10:33.010
he's learned how to hit the start button and just sits there and plays with the

1188
01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:33.844
ghost.

1189
01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:40.210
The cats just turn off the whole pac man is what I'm saying.

1190
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:42.940
The very top of it.
On the very top left,

1191
01:10:42.941 --> 01:10:47.590
there's a power button that you push in on the very top.
Nevermind.

1192
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:48.850
Just lit.
That's all right.

1193
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:53.660
<v 1>Just push the button down.</v>

1194
01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.120
<v 3>There's a hole right there,
right where you left hand is</v>

1195
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.700
<v 1>check
Johnny.</v>

1196
01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:12.760
J.

1197
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:18.110

T.
O.
Yeah.

1199
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.863
Hello.

1200
01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:38.070
<v 4>We're back with a different configuration on the video screen.</v>

1201
01:16:38.071 --> 01:16:41.610
If you're watching on Ustream,
don't be confused.
It's the same show.

1202
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:45.060
This is my pal Johnny Rotten Akhi Christopher Harris,

1203
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.560
long time old school friend from back in the days we interdimensionally traveled

1204
01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:54.900
together.
That's what I'm calling it these days.
I think that's what happens.

1205
01:16:54.901 --> 01:16:56.870
That's how you got to talk about it because otherwise it's like,

1206
01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.360
just sounds like you're doing drugs and people can just tell you no,

1207
01:17:00.361 --> 01:17:02.210
that didn't happen.
When you talk about,

1208
01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:06.840
I'll put that close to you so you can hear yourself better.
So the folks at home,

1209
01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.680
yeah.
Yeah.
I love that argument.
That doesn't happen.

1210
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.770
<v 5>She's Jewish nation.
Are you sure?
Where are you there?
Yeah.</v>

1211
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.750
How the fuck can you be sure.
Who knows what goes on inside the mind.
Who knows?

1212
01:17:17.751 --> 01:17:20.030
I mean,
you know,
the idea of chemical,
you know,

1213
01:17:20.031 --> 01:17:22.880
some sort of a chemical interaction in your mind as being trivial,

1214
01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:23.990
not that big a deal.

1215
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:27.770
So that means free thought and form of communication that we have are our words

1216
01:17:27.771 --> 01:17:31.340
have no meaning,
nothing has meaning.
If it comes from within your own mind,

1217
01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.330
you can write it off as being an inconsequential.
That's kind of extreme.

1218
01:17:35.331 --> 01:17:36.350
But yeah,
sort of.
Right?

1219
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:40.190
But we know that some things give you hallucinations like so there are things

1220
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:42.920
that you take to give you an image of something that absolutely isn't there.

1221
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:46.580
So the problem is,
you know,
if you're a pragmatist and if you,
you know,

1222
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:49.490
he'd go all Ockham's razor on a mother fucker,
you go,
well,

1223
01:17:49.491 --> 01:17:53.060
is it more likely that what you're doing is just,
but you know,

1224
01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:56.480
but inundating your cerebral cortex with a bunch of chemicals,

1225
01:17:56.481 --> 01:17:57.680
it doesn't know how to control.

1226
01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.130
And so it gives you some faulty signals and you're looking at basically video

1227
01:18:01.131 --> 01:18:04.980
artifacts in the mind.
Right?
I think that's exactly what it is.
And I like the,

1228
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.800
the true hallucinations.

1229
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:10.640
That's the idea kind of at times because everything is a construct of the mind.

1230
01:18:10.641 --> 01:18:14.150
Everything in our universe.
Yeah,
no kidding.
Right.
I mean,
you know,

1231
01:18:14.151 --> 01:18:15.170
when you see a guy,

1232
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:19.070
it's always fascinated me to see someone who's obviously completely insane,

1233
01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:19.940
like walking down the street,

1234
01:18:19.941 --> 01:18:23.810
like some homeless person having a conversation with themselves and you almost

1235
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:27.260
wish you could see what they're seeing.
You know,
it,
it,
what was that movie,

1236
01:18:27.261 --> 01:18:31.220
the Fisher King,
the Robin Williams movie with Absolute Geoff Daniel,

1237
01:18:31.221 --> 01:18:32.054
Jeff Bridges.

1238
01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.440
And he played a insane person who like believed he was like fighting like

1239
01:18:36.441 --> 01:18:41.180
dragons and it wasn't that what it was.
It was,
it was,
it was about that guy,

1240
01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:42.200
you know,
he had a,

1241
01:18:42.201 --> 01:18:45.840
there were still a power in his words and his thoughts and you know,

1242
01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:49.400
they a lot of craziness around Ma,
the majority of the thoughts he had.

1243
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.420
But you know,
that was,

1244
01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.020
that was a pretty good example of a schizophrenia kind of homeless guy that is,

1245
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:57.710
you know,
has something to contribute to society.
You know,
I don't know that.

1246
01:18:57.711 --> 01:19:01.640
I wish I could see what was actually going on in his head.
Well,
I wonder,

1247
01:19:01.641 --> 01:19:02.001
you know,

1248
01:19:02.001 --> 01:19:05.920
I wonder when you see a guy just completely babbling to himself and talking and

1249
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:10.450
just,
I wonder what he's seeing.
Is it,
is that,
is it that clear?
I mean,
I mean,

1250
01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.990
it's obviously there's levels,
right?

1251
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.560
We all know someone who's only slightly crazy and you're like,
he's okay,

1252
01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:19.040
but he's just kind of crazy.
You know?
It just,
he can't keep it totally together.

1253
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:22.730
And then we know people that are like really,
really rational.
There's,
you know,

1254
01:19:22.731 --> 01:19:24.680
there's a,
there's a whole level,
there's a spectrum.

1255
01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:28.340
So there's gotta be a spectrum of crazy too.
At the high end of the spectrum.

1256
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:32.420
What is the craziest motherfucker on this planet seeing?
What are they saying?

1257
01:19:32.421 --> 01:19:36.080
I mean,
are they going through hobbit world every day fighting off orcs?
I mean,

1258
01:19:36.081 --> 01:19:37.970
it,
was that possible?
Is that what's going on?

1259
01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.330
That might be pretty fucking bad ass if it was,
you know,
imagine if you,

1260
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:44.060
everybody thought you were completely crazy,

1261
01:19:44.061 --> 01:19:48.020
so they fed you and they kept you in some sort of an institution somewhere.

1262
01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:53.000
But in your mind,
you were off on a fucking adventure superhero.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1263
01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:56.900
Everyday.
Was Conan the barbarian,
the new version better than a desk job,

1264
01:19:56.901 --> 01:20:00.710
I guess that's watching some murders show last night was like la homicide or

1265
01:20:00.711 --> 01:20:02.480
something like that.
It's about murders and La.

1266
01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:06.410
It's kind of like a mystery show and they actually showed the body like laying

1267
01:20:06.411 --> 01:20:08.040
on the ground is weird when you watch

1268
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.420
<v 6>a TV show and they actually showed dead bodies and stuff and murder scenes.
Yeah.</v>

1269
01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:13.970
I don't like that shit.
Yeah,
it's creepy.
But uh,

1270
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:17.760
they were talking about the wife is the murdered the husband and the wife was

1271
01:20:17.761 --> 01:20:18.391
starting to lose.

1272
01:20:18.391 --> 01:20:23.280
Her mind started to go crazy and when they were interviewing her,
they were like,

1273
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:27.390
first part she,
she started to make sense and then she would say like,
yeah,

1274
01:20:27.391 --> 01:20:29.040
I started stabbing him,

1275
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:33.840
but then all these tomatoes came out of his stomach and you're just like,
wow,

1276
01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:38.450
can you imagine that word?
Like you're half mixing real stuff with like,

1277
01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:41.250
you think you'd see tomatoes coming out of your husband when you're stabbing
him?

1278
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:44.190
<v 5>Well that's the mental illness is the inability to,</v>

1279
01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:48.380
or I guess one form of mental illness is to define reality properly and

1280
01:20:48.381 --> 01:20:51.630
correctly.
You know,
you don't always know what's properly correct.

1281
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.470
Well it's about the use of your sentences and how you process that information

1282
01:20:55.471 --> 01:20:59.010
into a,
an understanding and then she's the one who's right.

1283
01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:01.450
Maybe there are tomatoes coming out of that.
What the fuck are,

1284
01:21:01.451 --> 01:21:03.540
we just can't see them.
Maybe it's delicious.

1285
01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.690
Maybe these people are in touch with a different dimension,
you know,

1286
01:21:06.691 --> 01:21:10.050
like maybe a,
at least in form of consciousness.

1287
01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.100
Well that's one of the reasons why the,
when they first started,
uh,
you know,

1288
01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:17.880
many of the cycle psychedelic studies that have taken place when they first

1289
01:21:17.881 --> 01:21:22.320
started doing it,
we haven't lights.
Oh,
sexy,

1290
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.280
romantic.
Um,
when you know,
they,

1291
01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:29.160
they did a lot of studies with psychedelics where they were trying to figure out

1292
01:21:29.161 --> 01:21:32.220
if they would help people that were crazy or whether they were drugs.

1293
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.810
It doesn't seem like schizophrenia.
Totally area.
I think that if you're really,

1294
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.090
if you're having a hard time with regular reality,

1295
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.760
you're having a hard time like keeping shit together and then all of a sudden

1296
01:21:41.761 --> 01:21:45.860
you get blasted on mushrooms.
That shit I could take you deep over the,
you know,

1297
01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:49.800
over the rainbow and clippy was here we were talking about Colton sort of

1298
01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:54.801
leaders of they can fixate people on an idea or a thought and sometimes,

1299
01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:58.560
uh,
psychedelics can help you overcome those fixations that,

1300
01:21:58.561 --> 01:22:01.770
that you can develop in your own mind around a certain,
you know,

1301
01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.560
impression of yourself that you have or you know,

1302
01:22:04.561 --> 01:22:07.890
a way of seeing the world and you've never overcome that.

1303
01:22:07.891 --> 01:22:12.600
And it can be a stoppage in a,
a way of blocking your progress.
And it was,

1304
01:22:12.601 --> 01:22:12.781
you know,

1305
01:22:12.781 --> 01:22:16.650
blasting through that with psychedelics can dorsal or you could lose your

1306
01:22:16.651 --> 01:22:17.580
fucking marbles.

1307
01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:21.390
You could be barely hanging on and you do a massive dose of acid.

1308
01:22:21.391 --> 01:22:24.500
Everybody knows that one dude who never came back from absolutely.
No,

1309
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:26.940
we all heard about him when we were in high school.
You know,

1310
01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:30.960
it's always the acid acid or mushrooms,
I guess.
Even Mckenna,

1311
01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.710
his brother Dennis,
and when they went down in South America,

1312
01:22:34.711 --> 01:22:38.570
his brother lost his fucking mind for two whole weeks and they wrote about it in

1313
01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.620
the sessions.
Yeah.
I mean he just,
he did,

1314
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:45.840
he did so much mushrooms that reality was obliterated and he was,
you know,

1315
01:22:45.841 --> 01:22:48.990
essentially a crazy person for two weeks.
I also think that you have to,

1316
01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:51.150
to even dabble in things like that,

1317
01:22:51.151 --> 01:22:54.870
you kind of have to have a strong consciousness originally so you can

1318
01:22:54.871 --> 01:22:58.800
reconstruct the world is you start sobering up for work experience.

1319
01:22:58.801 --> 01:23:03.240
And to me that's always been what it's about is not the moment where I'm

1320
01:23:03.241 --> 01:23:05.990
hallucinating and seeing,
thinking I'm communicating with,
you

1321
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:07.390
<v 0>know,
a multidimensional entities.</v>

1322
01:23:07.391 --> 01:23:11.650
But it's about afterwards and sort of coming back into myself and then,

1323
01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:15.400
yeah,
yeah,
well if you can't live in me,

1324
01:23:15.401 --> 01:23:18.070
you're one of those people that has to trip all the time and you can't live in

1325
01:23:18.071 --> 01:23:19.750
this dimension where you're missing the whole point.

1326
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:24.910
The whole point of any psychedelic experience or even like intense yoga methods,

1327
01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:27.130
you know,
like,
you know,
intense Kundalini Yoga.

1328
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.260
The whole idea is that you can bring something back from that state.
You know,

1329
01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:34.990
you don't want to put yourself in the state of Yoga Bliss all day and just only

1330
01:23:34.991 --> 01:23:36.130
exist in the Ashram.

1331
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:40.480
You want to go out and fucking and you and utilize any lessons that you've

1332
01:23:40.481 --> 01:23:42.730
learned from any sort of a psychedelic experience,

1333
01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:45.880
whether it's isolation tank or drugs or whatever.

1334
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:49.510
You want to be able to integrate that into your life.
It takes you someplace.

1335
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:52.540
It is a real trip.
That's why they call it a trip.
It takes you someplace,

1336
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:57.430
but I think not many people try actively to bring something back from that
place.

1337
01:23:57.431 --> 01:24:01.500
You know,
have to learn something from it and you have to be able to,
to you,
well,

1338
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:03.280
you don't have to,
you can do whatever the fuck you want.

1339
01:24:03.281 --> 01:24:05.740
Why am I saying half too?
But I think as the most value though,
yeah,

1340
01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:08.530
I think there's the most value in learning something from it and bringing that

1341
01:24:08.531 --> 01:24:11.530
back,
learning something about yourself.
And then trying to,
you know,

1342
01:24:11.531 --> 01:24:16.150
take whatever weird,
exposing a experience you had,

1343
01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:20.410
I really like tuned you into your own reality and you gotta you gotta take that

1344
01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:22.630
and then be a better person with it,
you know,

1345
01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:27.190
take that and utilize whatever lesson you've learned from it and then you're

1346
01:24:27.191 --> 01:24:30.520
doing something good with psychedelics,
then psychedelics seem to make sense.

1347
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.760
Then there's no argument against it.
But some people don't do that.
You know,

1348
01:24:33.761 --> 01:24:35.680
it's all about balance.
You know,
if you're,

1349
01:24:35.681 --> 01:24:38.710
if you're imbalanced and you know you're doing psychedelics,
you know,
you're,

1350
01:24:38.711 --> 01:24:42.160
you're likely to get even more imbalanced.
It's,
you know,
it might,

1351
01:24:42.170 --> 01:24:46.450
it might jolt you into some sort of a state of a self awareness,

1352
01:24:46.451 --> 01:24:50.890
but it might not to your mind.
Well,
I think your point earlier too,
that,
you know,

1353
01:24:50.891 --> 01:24:51.520
these,

1354
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.710
these kind of things are easy to argue against as being just a hallucination,

1355
01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.180
a chemical flood if hallucinations.

1356
01:24:57.190 --> 01:25:01.030
But when you go into the experience with that kind of attitude that,
well,

1357
01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:05.260
whether it's real or not,
I'm going to experience something real at the time.

1358
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.630
And it's about how you process it afterwards.

1359
01:25:07.631 --> 01:25:09.880
A lot of people block it out of their memory.
You know,

1360
01:25:09.881 --> 01:25:11.380
if you ask them what their trip was like,

1361
01:25:11.381 --> 01:25:13.900
they'll kind of give you this standardized answer.

1362
01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.470
But the ego is healed over the wound.

1363
01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:19.240
If you ever seen a tree that got hit by lightning,

1364
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.890
I saw a tree that got hit by lightning.

1365
01:25:20.891 --> 01:25:25.180
It was at the Boston Science Museum and this tree got fucked up in a fire.

1366
01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:28.190
And uh,
after the fire was over,
uh,
the,

1367
01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.840
the fire got put out before the tree burnt down.
So the tree her,

1368
01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:35.050
this big ass hole in it and the tree over hundreds of years,

1369
01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.190
true is like thousands of years old.
It was a huge section of the tree.
The,

1370
01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:44.220
the edges of the tree were curling over to fill in the hole to like heal over

1371
01:25:44.741 --> 01:25:46.240
the wound.
And I think your ego does that.

1372
01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:50.620
I think when your ego takes a devastating blow from psychedelics and you know,

1373
01:25:50.621 --> 01:25:54.340
you just g reality gets obliterated,
boundaries dissolve,

1374
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:57.860
and you start to look at your existence as you know,
a as a,

1375
01:25:57.861 --> 01:26:01.960
a much less selfish and much more involved thing.
And this,
this,

1376
01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:06.410
this weird connection that we have to every aspect of our lives.
It's weird,

1377
01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:09.110
you know,
fiber that runs through the universe,
that,

1378
01:26:09.111 --> 01:26:13.550
that pulses through our own reality.
Sometimes it's too much for people.

1379
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.960
So you come back and then you just start fucking drinking and partying and

1380
01:26:17.961 --> 01:26:20.290
yelling at your ex girlfriend.
And the next thing you know,
you're,

1381
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:21.980
you're back in the negative grind.

1382
01:26:21.981 --> 01:26:24.990
You've replayed all of your behavior patterns and you're,

1383
01:26:24.991 --> 01:26:29.510
you're right back to square one.
So it's like every jolt of psychedelics,

1384
01:26:29.511 --> 01:26:33.260
every psychedelic experience,
every jolt of perception.
All it does is like,

1385
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:37.220
gets you,
gives you a little window and you've got to move forward.
Go,
go,
go.

1386
01:26:37.221 --> 01:26:39.950
You take your new position.
Okay,
wait for the next one,

1387
01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:41.540
learn and then wait for the next one.

1388
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:43.730
Then the next one at another window opens up and go,
whoa.

1389
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:46.120
Some guys don't go through that door though.
Some guys,

1390
01:26:46.130 --> 01:26:48.830
the window opens up and go,
no,
I'm good.
I'm going to say it right here.

1391
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:53.530
I'm gonna just pee all over myself.
Yeah,
I mean it's,
um,

1392
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:56.330
I think there's a,
there's something really valuable to them.

1393
01:26:56.331 --> 01:26:58.700
That's why we talk about them all the time.
You know,
people say it's so silly.

1394
01:26:58.701 --> 01:27:00.170
You're talking about,
uh,
you know,

1395
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.990
the psychedelics and all these different experiences that you have,

1396
01:27:02.991 --> 01:27:05.060
the isolation tank.
You talk about it all the time.

1397
01:27:05.061 --> 01:27:06.200
Why are you talking about it all the time?

1398
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.740
Talk about it all the time because it's fucking fascinating all the time.
To me,

1399
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:11.480
if you're experiencing these things,

1400
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.050
it would be the topic of your normal conversation on a regular basis because

1401
01:27:15.051 --> 01:27:18.230
they're so hyper realistic.
It's hyper reality.

1402
01:27:18.231 --> 01:27:22.940
It's just different way of observing and analyzing your,

1403
01:27:22.941 --> 01:27:27.860
your own position in this dementia and the fact that people don't take advantage

1404
01:27:27.861 --> 01:27:31.390
of it.
It might very well be responsible for our evolution.

1405
01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:35.380
<v 5>I agree.
I mean in that we're tribal people by nature as cliff,
he was talking,</v>

1406
01:27:35.381 --> 01:27:38.380
you know,
the gamers hang out together,
hang out together,

1407
01:27:38.381 --> 01:27:42.250
the Internet geeks hang out together.
And uh,
you know,

1408
01:27:42.251 --> 01:27:46.270
having these shared experiences that run throughout your tribe or a form of,

1409
01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:49.750
I guess a rite of passage that it's actually missing those sorts of things,

1410
01:27:49.751 --> 01:27:54.751
rites of passage into adulthood and sharing an experience that was traumatic but

1411
01:27:55.031 --> 01:27:59.890
meaningful and gives you an ability to discuss something intelligently as a

1412
01:27:59.891 --> 01:28:00.880
commonality.

1413
01:28:01.090 --> 01:28:04.690
That's a rite of passage that doesn't exist in widespread culture in America

1414
01:28:04.691 --> 01:28:08.740
anymore.
And we've lost that connection is tribal individuals to,

1415
01:28:08.741 --> 01:28:13.570
to nurture the,
the,
uh,
child into adulthood.
And for me,

1416
01:28:13.571 --> 01:28:15.480
that's when I use psychedelics the most.
I mean,

1417
01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.970
as I'm an adult with a lot going on in my life,
I,

1418
01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:21.880
I don't really do it anymore to be honest.
That not very often at least.

1419
01:28:21.881 --> 01:28:26.470
And it was tough when you have responsibilities to chalk off six hours,
we'll,

1420
01:28:26.471 --> 01:28:30.340
you'll be unavailable and actually and tired the next day.
But,

1421
01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:35.080
but I mean it was also for me,
it kind of passage into a,
how I view the world is,

1422
01:28:35.081 --> 01:28:37.140
you know,
kind of seeing,
uh,

1423
01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:42.180
the other side of sanity but also a reconstructing something with that

1424
01:28:42.821 --> 01:28:46.030
experience behind me and talking about it with people like you and my other

1425
01:28:46.031 --> 01:28:49.990
friends who we,
you know,
engaged in that kind of activity.
And,
you know,

1426
01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:52.120
it was very meaningful for how I see the world today.
Yeah.

1427
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:55.460
<v 0>You know,
it's,
it's really interesting what we're talking about,</v>

1428
01:28:55.461 --> 01:28:57.050
this rite of passage thing,

1429
01:28:57.051 --> 01:28:59.060
because I was just talking to my friend Justin the other night,

1430
01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:03.830
we were playing pool Justin from the actual report.com and we were playing pool

1431
01:29:03.831 --> 01:29:06.000
when we were talking about how people in this country,

1432
01:29:06.001 --> 01:29:09.210
in this day and age don't have like a,
uh,

1433
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:12.270
a rite of passage don't have something that makes you a man.

1434
01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:16.260
And that's probably something culturally that exists because you need to know

1435
01:29:16.261 --> 01:29:20.430
like,
okay,
I'm a man now,
you know?
Okay,
I just got my black belt in life.

1436
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.870
I'm a man now.
You know what I'm saying?

1437
01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:25.710
Like there needs to be some sort of a ceremony or there's this positive

1438
01:29:25.711 --> 01:29:29.130
affirmation that now I am a man.
It's like your joke.

1439
01:29:29.131 --> 01:29:33.630
We never really become adults because we don't have those rites of passage that

1440
01:29:33.631 --> 01:29:35.520
define us.
I think though,
rice of right,

1441
01:29:35.530 --> 01:29:39.150
a real rite of passage and doing something really difficult,
you know,

1442
01:29:39.151 --> 01:29:41.280
and realizing that you can,

1443
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:45.430
there's so few people that realize their own potential in it,

1444
01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.810
just enjoying things on this earth because they don't really know what their

1445
01:29:48.811 --> 01:29:53.370
limitations are.
What does that,
that marijuana is bad for you?
Um,

1446
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:57.900
you know,
I think that's a,
I,
that's something that maybe people need to rethink,

1447
01:29:58.700 --> 01:29:59.550
but you know,

1448
01:29:59.551 --> 01:30:03.030
they just kind of drift through a linear form of consciousness from the day

1449
01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:07.350
they're born to the day their hormones takeover and adolescence.
And,
you know,

1450
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:11.610
there's nothing to define them as adults and pass that experience.
I just,
yeah,

1451
01:30:11.611 --> 01:30:14.470
it's unfortunate.
And all you think about is getting out of school,
married,

1452
01:30:14.630 --> 01:30:19.110
no job.
And then,
you know,
I remember being a volume on or something.

1453
01:30:19.230 --> 01:30:23.460
I remember being,
um,
like uh,
you know,
uh,
21,

1454
01:30:23.461 --> 01:30:27.810
22 years old,
you know,
just having started standup comedy and you know,

1455
01:30:27.811 --> 01:30:29.400
and realizing that,
you know,

1456
01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:34.140
just completely bewildered by the fact that I was an adult now and totally

1457
01:30:34.141 --> 01:30:37.710
responsible for my own actions living on my own,
you know,

1458
01:30:37.711 --> 01:30:41.880
traveling around and I was like,
this is so bizarre.
I'm not ready for this.

1459
01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:46.650
I shouldn't be looking after myself yet.
I'm just still a child.
You know,
the,
the,

1460
01:30:46.651 --> 01:30:51.150
the missing thing,
the,
the,
the big event that lets you know that you're a man,

1461
01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.530
we need to bring that shit back.

1462
01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:57.620
I think we criminalize those behaviors as sort of a European influence over

1463
01:30:57.631 --> 01:31:00.870
then.
You know,
this continent is this sort of dominated,

1464
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:05.580
dominating a ideas where if you're doing things as rites of passage amongst your

1465
01:31:05.581 --> 01:31:09.240
tribe,
you're not following the greater agenda as a,
you know,

1466
01:31:09.241 --> 01:31:13.860
what society dictates is appropriate.
Right.
What would be a way around that?

1467
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:18.030
Would there be a way around that?
Oh,
how could you have a right of passage,

1468
01:31:18.031 --> 01:31:21.870
sort of a situation thing and not have everybody freak out and go all David

1469
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:25.740
Koresh risky thing.
Because we started saying,
okay,

1470
01:31:25.741 --> 01:31:29.880
we're going to do the Johnny Rotten Joe Rogan cultish.
And it's real simple.

1471
01:31:29.881 --> 01:31:32.230
We don't want your money.
We're just going to help everybody.
Yeah.

1472
01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:35.460
Nobody would buy that because after a while they were so many kids that would be

1473
01:31:35.461 --> 01:31:38.250
like,
so like in Nambour to view and wanting to keep it like,
Johnny,

1474
01:31:38.251 --> 01:31:40.440
can I do anything?
And you're like,
yeah,
well you can get me a sandwich.

1475
01:31:40.441 --> 01:31:42.770
I really like a sandwich.
And before you know,
it

1476
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:49.260
all changes.
You know,
we're,
we're very malleable,
so fuck.
Yeah,
we are,
man.

1477
01:31:49.530 --> 01:31:52.090
I've been having these conversations with,
uh,
you know,
um,

1478
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:56.880
I did this Kevin James movie and talking to one of the producers and he's got a

1479
01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.980
ton of experience in Hollywood and he was talking to me about all the years and

1480
01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:03.290
all the crazy things that he's seen in the movie business.
But one of the,

1481
01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:07.060
the standard ones is that once someone becomes like super famous,

1482
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:09.160
especially like a lot of crazy women,

1483
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.790
they go nuts and start yelling at people and ordering people around.

1484
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:17.380
Like I hought heard like stories of like Brett Butler on the set of that grace

1485
01:32:17.381 --> 01:32:22.240
under fire show being insane and,
and you know,
and this,
this guy and this,

1486
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:24.630
the topic of this conversation was how the,

1487
01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:29.730
the power that is bestowed upon them as actors into the love and adulation that

1488
01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:34.430
they get.
It's almost,
it's unmanageable and they lose their mind.
They,

1489
01:32:34.431 --> 01:32:36.850
they almost can't help losing their mind because they're your,

1490
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:41.610
it's such an unnatural level of love that they get that their,

1491
01:32:41.611 --> 01:32:46.600
their whole sense of how they're being perceived and what they're putting out as

1492
01:32:46.601 --> 01:32:47.680
far as what they're getting back.

1493
01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.310
It's completely skewed and they don't see themselves the way other people see

1494
01:32:51.311 --> 01:32:56.050
themselves.
We've actually as a culture wired them neurologically.

1495
01:32:56.051 --> 01:32:58.760
We've created to be royal to them that their royalty,

1496
01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:00.490
they really are like royalty.
I mean,

1497
01:33:00.491 --> 01:33:03.140
and some of them are benevolent gods and some,

1498
01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:07.390
and some of them are fucking angry.
And,
and you know,
and like,

1499
01:33:07.391 --> 01:33:08.870
I don't think we were talking about this with my,

1500
01:33:08.871 --> 01:33:10.120
with my friend Justin and I again,

1501
01:33:10.330 --> 01:33:13.930
we were talking about Elvis that I always say that I don't think it's possible

1502
01:33:13.931 --> 01:33:17.710
to be Elvis and not be crazy.
I think when you get to that Elvis level,

1503
01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:20.410
all bets are off.
Dude,
you can't walk out of your house.

1504
01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.950
Bitches are fucking screaming.
They're screaming for you everywhere.

1505
01:33:23.951 --> 01:33:26.560
They must be plotting to figure out a way to suck your Dick.

1506
01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:27.640
How do you mean they humble?

1507
01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:31.600
How can you ever watch those videos when he was on stage and they were going

1508
01:33:31.601 --> 01:33:36.601
fucking crazy screaming and crying and her hair everywhere he went?

1509
01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:41.890
I don't think any of us have a clue and bet.
By the way,

1510
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:45.850
there was nothing like that before him.
There had been some stars,

1511
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.670
there had been movie stars,
there had been a bunch of different things.

1512
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:50.530
But when did Elvis really crack?

1513
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.560
Was it the fifties or the sixties fifties needles were enormous.

1514
01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:58.540
No doubt about it.
And beetles are amazing.
I mean,

1515
01:33:58.541 --> 01:34:02.820
some of my favorite songs are Beatles songs,
especially post psychedelic.

1516
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.020
So it's not discounting the Beatles,

1517
01:34:05.021 --> 01:34:09.670
but Elvis was in a different level even than the Beatles.
The Jesus figure.

1518
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:13.300
It was like the Beatles were a fucking incredible and John Lennon had a lot of

1519
01:34:13.301 --> 01:34:15.310
Jesus figure going on with him too and that,
you know,

1520
01:34:15.311 --> 01:34:19.330
they were this amazing band,
but there was something about the Elvis,

1521
01:34:19.450 --> 01:34:19.961
you know what I mean?

1522
01:34:19.961 --> 01:34:24.460
This one mother fucker that would just go on stage and they had a censor his

1523
01:34:24.461 --> 01:34:27.850
hips,
they didn't want him to move in like he was fucking on stage.

1524
01:34:27.851 --> 01:34:31.810
Women are fainting everywhere.
Crazy.
A lot of

1525
01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:36.810
<v 5>him has to do with the medium that he was experienced and being television first</v>

1526
01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:39.930
blast of it,
first blast of TV.

1527
01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:44.340
This is the first time that the whole nation is fixated on one point,
you know,

1528
01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.900
of entertainment and just that,
you know,

1529
01:34:46.901 --> 01:34:51.880
the new medium I think is really contributed a lot to his importance because his

1530
01:34:51.881 --> 01:34:54.850
music was great.
There's no doubt about that for the time.

1531
01:34:54.851 --> 01:34:58.190
I mean it was an innovative and incredible,
but it was also the medium

1532
01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:01.100
<v 0>of the television that was innovative in crouch end.
Incredible.</v>

1533
01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:04.400
And drove a lot of nothing that ever been looked at before.

1534
01:35:04.450 --> 01:35:08.060
They didn't know how to deal with TV and the figures they saw on the television

1535
01:35:08.061 --> 01:35:10.610
where like in their living rooms and uh,
you know,

1536
01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:15.470
these are people who barely had electricity now going through the houses and now

1537
01:35:15.471 --> 01:35:18.590
all of a sudden they've got,
that is amazing to think about.

1538
01:35:18.591 --> 01:35:23.591
The distance between 1950 and 1900 and when was electricity really commonplace

1539
01:35:25.251 --> 01:35:26.620
in the United States?

1540
01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:30.740
218 was Tesla's big thing where he lit up.

1541
01:35:30.741 --> 01:35:33.650
This whole area was like super futuristic.

1542
01:35:33.651 --> 01:35:38.450
But I think it was one of his demonstrations of the benefits of AC DC current is

1543
01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:39.650
instead of direct current,

1544
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:43.670
and he lit up this enormous area with electricity and freaked everybody the fuck

1545
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:44.860
out.
But,

1546
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:49.400
but the distance between that and Elvis is not that far man.

1547
01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.890
It's like the distance between,
I mean,
what is it,

1548
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.530
what it was the years was at 50 years.
50 years.

1549
01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.400
Well if even 65 yeah,

1550
01:35:57.690 --> 01:36:01.760
70 so it's really like the distance between us and them.
I'll say an Elvis.

1551
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.100
So if you really think about it,
the dissonance between Austin,

1552
01:36:04.101 --> 01:36:07.280
Elvis and the distance between Elvis and electricity are pretty similar.

1553
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:10.490
That's fucking crazy.
Cause Elvis,
even though,

1554
01:36:10.491 --> 01:36:14.420
I mean it seems like so long ago,
it's memorable.

1555
01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.110
I can remember when Elvis was alive.
I'm 43 years old.
When I was a kid,

1556
01:36:18.111 --> 01:36:21.140
Elvis was alive.
I think Elvis died on my sister's birthday.

1557
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.910
I think that's one of the reasons why.

1558
01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:28.150
Like what year did he die on August 18th I have one here

1559
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:35.230
in the 70s yeah,
in the 1970 [inaudible] yeah.

1560
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:39.140
Why don't you Google that shit son?
That's the the,
we've got a new phrase.

1561
01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:44.090
Google that shit son.
That's why I say that all day long because we get any,

1562
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.390
you know,
I mean you get in these conversations where,
when did he die?
I dunno,

1563
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:52.130
go Google that shit son.
It's so simple.
There's no reason to ever guests anymore.

1564
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:55.580
It's incredible what a time we live in.
But that's our medium.

1565
01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:57.050
That's the Internet.
And you know,

1566
01:36:57.051 --> 01:37:01.040
our celebrities today are internet celebrities in many cases and reality.

1567
01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:05.840
I think that's part of why reality television became so popular is because the

1568
01:37:05.841 --> 01:37:09.740
Internet allowed us to think in that way of theirs.

1569
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:11.690
We're connected all of the sudden,

1570
01:37:11.691 --> 01:37:16.460
too many realities around the entire world and you can access anybody's

1571
01:37:16.461 --> 01:37:18.950
consciousness now and no matter where they are.

1572
01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:21.700
And that's why these Middle Eastern countries shut the fucking Internet off.

1573
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:24.890
First thing,
when the shit hits the fan,
when things get ugly,

1574
01:37:24.891 --> 01:37:28.820
the first thing they do is they don't want anybody looking in.

1575
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:30.950
They don't want anybody from the United States looking in.

1576
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:33.440
They don't want anybody from Egypt throwing out pictures.

1577
01:37:33.441 --> 01:37:37.460
They're going to try to minimize as much video footage and I mean you remember

1578
01:37:37.461 --> 01:37:40.860
that one?
There was an uprising and Thailand and a,

1579
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.690
there was a famous video online of this,
these rebels,

1580
01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:47.810
these people that are fighting against the current regime.

1581
01:37:47.811 --> 01:37:51.020
And one guy's fucking head explodes right in front of everybody.

1582
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:55.740
They just took him out with a sniper and he drops the ground and his brains and

1583
01:37:55.741 --> 01:37:56.160
blood

1584
01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.150
<v 5>are just splattered all over the US.
It's so fucking surreal,
man.</v>

1585
01:38:00.330 --> 01:38:02.460
It's so surreal.
And you know,
when,

1586
01:38:02.461 --> 01:38:06.390
when shit like that happens now they're just immediately yanking internet.

1587
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:07.920
They're just,
they're trying to do that.

1588
01:38:07.930 --> 01:38:10.950
Everybody know the influence is greater than their political influence.

1589
01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:14.490
So they also know that it's been successful.
They know that,
you know,

1590
01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:16.180
now that they got rid of Mubarak and they move,

1591
01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:19.500
mark is being brought up on charges through,
that's fucking crazy.

1592
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:24.300
Mubarak was running,
Egypt was our ally for 30 years.

1593
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:28.380
Protecting the borders into the countries that border them.

1594
01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:33.070
That's basically what Egypt was so important to us as an ally for us.

1595
01:38:33.071 --> 01:38:36.240
And they're going to run him up on charges on the people that die during the

1596
01:38:36.241 --> 01:38:38.460
rebellion.
They're saying that,
you know,

1597
01:38:38.461 --> 01:38:41.260
soldiers were murdering people and they're going to see,
you know,

1598
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:46.200
I mean this is like some crazy dark shit.
This is an amazing time.

1599
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:49.200
Well,
these are all new things that haven't happened before,
you know,

1600
01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.193
at least in our time.

1601
01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:54.630
And I also think it's easy to get distracted by the novelty of the Internet and

1602
01:38:54.631 --> 01:38:59.280
these new forms of,
uh,
communication that come along with it.
But you know,
I,

1603
01:38:59.281 --> 01:39:03.120
I think sometimes it's a case that now we can just see more of it and we're

1604
01:39:03.121 --> 01:39:05.520
aware of more things more so than,
you know,

1605
01:39:05.521 --> 01:39:08.100
what we were talking about with cliff and how technology and the Internet is

1606
01:39:08.101 --> 01:39:11.510
like driving people into new areas.
I think that's,
you know,

1607
01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:15.840
mainly with porn right now and other areas.

1608
01:39:15.841 --> 01:39:18.030
I think a lot of it has always been going on,

1609
01:39:18.031 --> 01:39:20.610
Middle Eastern dictators being toppled.
Uh,

1610
01:39:20.611 --> 01:39:25.050
and then I don't think we're talking about all these different guys and they

1611
01:39:25.051 --> 01:39:27.790
were around for a long time.
We're talking about mole market.

1612
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:32.460
D'Offay remember him?
Did I remember when I was in high school?
Okay.
So,

1613
01:39:32.461 --> 01:39:34.540
and then what Saddam Hussein,
you know,

1614
01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:38.730
these kinds of around for a long fucking time.
You know,
I don't,

1615
01:39:38.731 --> 01:39:41.880
I don't know if necessarily they would have been toppled without,

1616
01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:45.380
I mean obviously Hussein would've,
but I mean these,

1617
01:39:45.381 --> 01:39:47.520
these ones where their internal revolts,

1618
01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.530
I don't know if they would have existed without the Internet.

1619
01:39:49.531 --> 01:39:51.360
I don't think it was moving that ahead.

1620
01:39:51.361 --> 01:39:54.600
I want no way to organize it without getting killed.
Right.

1621
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:56.840
So you'd have to go out in public and,
you know,

1622
01:39:56.850 --> 01:40:00.330
say you're going to do it and put up fliers and then meet somewhere and then

1623
01:40:00.331 --> 01:40:04.800
they would kill you.
You know,
now you can do it from your cell phone.

1624
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:08.270
You could put Twitter updates,
you know,
this,
this is what's going on.

1625
01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:11.670
We cut the power off to the castle,
you know,
like that kind of shit.

1626
01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:15.860
They can set up a dancing flash mob and the fucking it,
you know,
uh,

1627
01:40:15.930 --> 01:40:20.130
grand central station and at noon,
I'm 20 minutes' notice.
You know,

1628
01:40:20.131 --> 01:40:23.790
they could probably get together and fucking pile up some guns and go kill some

1629
01:40:23.791 --> 01:40:27.830
mother fucking dictators.
You know,
if you get enough people to respond,
uh,

1630
01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:31.800
I'm sure you can mobilize via,
there's something faster than anywhere else.

1631
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:35.260
There's something beautiful about those flash moms.
I love that shit.

1632
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:36.570
It's beautiful.
There's,
there's a,

1633
01:40:36.571 --> 01:40:40.410
there's a new TV show that's based around flash mobbing now really where you

1634
01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:44.580
have to flash mob or something like that.
Dude,
it's so ridiculous that you can,

1635
01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.690
you can do that.
You ever see that?
The def photo of a um,
Elvis right there.

1636
01:40:48.691 --> 01:40:51.210
Isn't that weird and a funeral photos.
W pretty creepy.

1637
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:54.010
So grainy cameras sucked

1638
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:58.460
<v 0>back then.
That was like an old school cell phone.
Camera picture.
Yeah.</v>

1639
01:40:58.530 --> 01:41:02.890
August 16th by the way,
1977 was the death of the funeral.

1640
01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:05.200
Wow.
Is that your sister's birthday?

1641
01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:10.120
Did you say August 16th August 16th I was wrong about my sister's birthday.

1642
01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:14.620
I thought it was the 18th is the 16th that's fine.
You're close though.

1643
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:17.350
I know it's around my birthday.
It's in the area.

1644
01:41:17.770 --> 01:41:20.110
I'm terrible with birthdays because if it's just those little kiddos up,

1645
01:41:20.111 --> 01:41:23.080
they were so stupid like,
listen,
dummy,
you'd died once.
Are you?

1646
01:41:23.081 --> 01:41:27.280
You were born rather once you're born in 1970 let it go.
What does this,

1647
01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:30.880
you know it's my birthday.
No,
it's not your birthday.
No,
no.

1648
01:41:30.881 --> 01:41:33.640
It's the day that you were born,
but it's 40 years later.

1649
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:35.020
He needed to let that shit go.

1650
01:41:35.021 --> 01:41:37.060
I think the more excited you get about your birthday,

1651
01:41:37.061 --> 01:41:41.650
it's most likely that the rest of your life is that much less exciting

1652
01:41:41.651 --> 01:41:45.010
exponentially.
I used to get pissed off at is uh,

1653
01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:48.700
like if I was dating a girl and I didn't know or remember her birthday,

1654
01:41:48.701 --> 01:41:51.760
if she would get mad at me and I'd be like,
what are you doing?
You're,
you're,

1655
01:41:51.761 --> 01:41:54.410
you're mad at me.
Cause I don't remember the date it was important to you.

1656
01:41:54.411 --> 01:41:58.000
You'd remember my birthday.
That's what,
listen,
I'm nice you every day.

1657
01:41:58.270 --> 01:42:01.120
I don't need to remember a special day.
And by the way,
you don't need,

1658
01:42:01.121 --> 01:42:02.980
didn't remember my birthday either.
Deal.

1659
01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:06.070
We don't have to have a special fucking day where you're nice to people.

1660
01:42:06.130 --> 01:42:09.250
I want to be nice to you every time I see you.
I like you.
Yeah.
Okay.

1661
01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.200
I'm going to treat you well.
I don't,

1662
01:42:11.201 --> 01:42:13.190
I don't want you angry at me because I don't,

1663
01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:17.130
don't remember some stupid fucking day gift though.

1664
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:20.640
Well that those people,
those people that get upset by it and they'll,

1665
01:42:20.641 --> 01:42:21.520
they'll say it's not,

1666
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:26.050
I would way rather give somebody something when they don't expect it.

1667
01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.660
Give somebody something.
Cause I was thinking about them.

1668
01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:30.160
I saw this and I thought about you.

1669
01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:34.690
If that to me is way nicer and way more special that someone gives you something

1670
01:42:34.691 --> 01:42:39.520
on some obligation day.
I'm with that.
You know what I'm saying?
Let it go bitches.

1671
01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:41.570
Look at the Statue of Liberty's face it.

1672
01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:45.660
A lot of people think that the statue of liberty spaces Elvis Presley.
Um,

1673
01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:49.730
if you compare the two,
if you Google statue of liberty and Elvis photos,

1674
01:42:49.731 --> 01:42:51.040
and there's a funny comparison,

1675
01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:53.440
but didn't the statue of liberty come away before Elvis?

1676
01:42:55.980 --> 01:43:00.640
I'm nine.
11 theories that fucking makes your head hurt.
Wait a minute.

1677
01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:04.250
What's,
that was the trick and that's why people liked Elvis because he,
they,

1678
01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:09.270
he reminded them of the Statue of Liberty and America at the time.
I did a,

1679
01:43:09.271 --> 01:43:13.930
an interview today with our radio in Philly.
Real cool guy and fun conversation.

1680
01:43:13.931 --> 01:43:18.680
But one of the things that came up were I was laughing about the um,
um,
we're,

1681
01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:21.160
we're talking about conspiracy theories that you like.

1682
01:43:21.161 --> 01:43:25.980
If you're a person who's a pot,
small girl,
like an avid pot smoker,
you know,

1683
01:43:26.050 --> 01:43:28.810
it's probably best not to have conspiracy theories.

1684
01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:32.450
That's the first thing that people think,
oh,

1685
01:43:32.451 --> 01:43:36.480
he smoked weed and he's in a conspiracy theories how original you can write your

1686
01:43:36.481 --> 01:43:40.450
off with that first sentence right away right away.
And you know,

1687
01:43:40.451 --> 01:43:41.860
we were talking about that like,
yeah,

1688
01:43:41.861 --> 01:43:46.720
if somebody has some sort of conspiracy theory to go along with Jim and Randy,

1689
01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:48.610
that's what it was,
classic rock Pittsburgh.

1690
01:43:48.670 --> 01:43:52.220
It's important to at least understand them because

1691
01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:52.950
<v 5>you know,
the,</v>

1692
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:57.410
the world needs detectives looking into shit like that could blatantly be false.

1693
01:43:57.411 --> 01:43:59.480
You know?
I agree.
There's some value in that,

1694
01:43:59.481 --> 01:44:03.470
but I think you'll never find an answer.
Uh,
and part of it,

1695
01:44:03.471 --> 01:44:05.240
I guess is because of that,
that there's,
yeah,

1696
01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:08.310
<v 0>there's some things that though that are,
you know,
the,</v>

1697
01:44:08.311 --> 01:44:09.630
the idea of conspiracy there,

1698
01:44:09.631 --> 01:44:13.560
I hate the phrase conspiracy theorist because it's one of those phrases like,
oh,

1699
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:16.050
it's like someone calling you a misogynist.
Oh,

1700
01:44:16.051 --> 01:44:18.540
now there's something you have to defend that's ridiculous.
Like,
well,

1701
01:44:18.541 --> 01:44:21.030
who's to decide whether or not someone hates all women?

1702
01:44:21.031 --> 01:44:22.920
Just because they run into a few cons in their life.

1703
01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:24.240
It doesn't mean they hate all women.

1704
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:27.330
You know how Brian Post saying is going to be here on Monday?
Uh,

1705
01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:31.010
he said it best ones.
He said,
this woman said,
you know,
I think he,
we used to go.

1706
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:32.940
So I was in the middle of the argument is with this woman.
She goes,

1707
01:44:33.150 --> 01:44:34.650
I think you hate women.
He goes,

1708
01:44:34.651 --> 01:44:37.380
that's funny because everyone was ever said that to me.
I hate,

1709
01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:43.690
I think it's true.
That's the best way of looking at that and every,

1710
01:44:43.691 --> 01:44:45.090
every rose generalization,

1711
01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:50.040
<v 5>but everyone I think is a con.
It's probably in some way a cunt</v>

1712
01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:54.630
<v 0>as well.
In some ways.
We're all capable of consciousness.
I know.</v>

1713
01:44:54.631 --> 01:44:58.050
I'm capable of it.
I watched 2011,

1714
01:45:01.150 --> 01:45:06.120
28,
2011.
That's funny.
Shit.
Yeah.
Um,

1715
01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.260
it's like,
man,

1716
01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:10.650
I think we're all going to be better off if there weren't words like this that

1717
01:45:10.651 --> 01:45:14.580
are so fucking super hyper charged.
I don't think we need to let new words in.

1718
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.691
I think,
you know,

1719
01:45:15.691 --> 01:45:20.430
like people that are start screaming that all of a sudden a midget is just like

1720
01:45:20.431 --> 01:45:25.140
saying nigger.
Then I'll come on.
What do we do our,
yeah,
exactly.

1721
01:45:25.230 --> 01:45:28.470
And why does everything have to be,
you know,
just like,

1722
01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:32.700
it's just like saying nigger,
every fucking word is like,

1723
01:45:32.701 --> 01:45:33.900
just like saying Nigger,

1724
01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:37.290
you know midget is just like saying nigger faggot is just like saying nigger.

1725
01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:41.010
Like I have heard so many versions of that cunt.
It's just like saying nigger.

1726
01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:42.083
No it wasn't.

1727
01:45:42.150 --> 01:45:47.100
You know why there's nobody on the nigger equivalent to bitches.
Exactly.

1728
01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:51.840
Exactly.
And you know what,
it's,
it's a different thing.
You know,

1729
01:45:51.841 --> 01:45:56.190
like everybody wants to say it's like nigger because nigger is the most

1730
01:45:56.191 --> 01:46:00.420
offensive thing.
It's a dehumanizing thing.
They just keep going and going,
no,

1731
01:46:00.421 --> 01:46:04.980
this is the most you can had things you can't add things to.

1732
01:46:04.981 --> 01:46:05.880
The banned list

1733
01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:11.140
<v 5>tells you so much about a person by how much power they ascribed to irrelevancy.</v>

1734
01:46:11.410 --> 01:46:14.140
You know,
how much importance did that word have over them?

1735
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:16.630
What did they let that word due to them?

1736
01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:21.670
How weak are they in retrospect for that?
For a simple word,

1737
01:46:21.671 --> 01:46:26.560
it used in a particular way wielding that much power over you and and your,

1738
01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:27.753
your happiness

1739
01:46:28.230 --> 01:46:33.110
<v 0>name.
It's a game because we all know intent and intent is what's important.</v>

1740
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:36.270
And a lot of times when you write something,
intent is lost,
you know,

1741
01:46:36.450 --> 01:46:38.690
but when you,
when you,
you,
you describe it and talk about it,

1742
01:46:38.691 --> 01:46:41.970
and this is my intent,
you know,
that's supposed to be what's important,

1743
01:46:41.971 --> 01:46:46.830
not super charged words,
you know,
supercharged words are so fucking dangerous.

1744
01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.980
The idea that you can literally start a,
I mean,
you

1745
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.520
<v 5>could walk into a room full of black people and just had no one in particular</v>

1746
01:46:53.521 --> 01:46:55.470
say the word nigger over and over again.

1747
01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:58.530
And nine times out of 10 someone's going to beat the fuck out of you.

1748
01:46:58.770 --> 01:47:01.510
Especially if they look like,
if it looks like you can,
you know,

1749
01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:04.610
if you walk in there and you look like fucking Bill Goldberg the wrestler and

1750
01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:04.801
you know,

1751
01:47:04.801 --> 01:47:08.130
maybe you might get off a few niggers and everybody might move around you and

1752
01:47:08.131 --> 01:47:09.720
the argument they give and not,

1753
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:12.810
not that group of people specifically for beating you up,

1754
01:47:12.811 --> 01:47:17.570
but it's that you're being insensitive to their feelings basically.
And,

1755
01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:18.430
and,
uh,
the,

1756
01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:22.860
the way that they feel about that word carries such impact upon them that you

1757
01:47:22.861 --> 01:47:26.670
have to be conscious of how uh,
that word affects them.
And,

1758
01:47:26.671 --> 01:47:29.460
and to some extent I agree that that's why we're polite to each other at a

1759
01:47:29.461 --> 01:47:33.720
certain level.
But I think you're also a comic and part of what you do it is,

1760
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:38.750
is it involves giving power and intent to words and kind of shaping a words into

1761
01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:42.870
a particular meaning.

1762
01:47:42.871 --> 01:47:47.640
And you don't have to be sensitive all the time to every person in the audience

1763
01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:50.940
and what they are going to have on their,
you can't shoulders,

1764
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:54.020
you can't or you're not going to get out.
One point of view.
We won't,

1765
01:47:54.021 --> 01:47:57.210
some points of view are offensive to other people.
It doesn't mean they're wrong.

1766
01:47:57.211 --> 01:48:00.040
It just means they're offensive to your ideals.
You know,

1767
01:48:00.090 --> 01:48:01.140
how you're looking at it.

1768
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:05.850
But also you go to an environment a lot where people aren't going to be
offended,

1769
01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:09.090
typically saw.
I'm always do.
If you go to a comedy show,
I always let you know,

1770
01:48:09.710 --> 01:48:14.010
see a couple people walk out different points of your activity map,
the uptight,

1771
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:17.640
the uptight,
uh,
crazy Christians,
you know,

1772
01:48:17.641 --> 01:48:21.750
often get very sensitive about that.
But you know that,
that's part of it too.

1773
01:48:21.751 --> 01:48:26.250
I think sometimes you'll get criticized for using a word like conti because

1774
01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:31.520
someone who is is not aware of how you use words for your,

1775
01:48:32.301 --> 01:48:35.310
your standup act.
Like I'm sure these Maggie centres moving,

1776
01:48:35.370 --> 01:48:38.550
using him for my standup act that's using them in regular life.
Right.

1777
01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:40.740
All my friends will say Kentucky,
like it's no big deal.

1778
01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:44.940
But some people you know will tell you that country is just like nigger.
Well,

1779
01:48:44.941 --> 01:48:46.260
they use it to each other.

1780
01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:49.260
If I think your friends probably do call each other containers and stuff,

1781
01:48:49.261 --> 01:48:53.070
you know,
my friends do.
It's like a funny word.
That's right.

1782
01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.850
But to some people it's not that at all.

1783
01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:00.810
And really the effectiveness is a word of a word is always based on how other

1784
01:49:00.811 --> 01:49:04.860
people interpret it.
So clearly I have a degenerate group of friends.

1785
01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:07.890
To me it's like a normal word,

1786
01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:11.160
but to some people it's like highly charged and offensive.

1787
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:14.970
And I don't mean it that way,
whatever way it's hitting them.

1788
01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.510
I do apologize for that because I didn't mean it that way.

1789
01:49:18.511 --> 01:49:21.390
I didn't mean to hurt people's feelings.
I thought I didn't mean it like,

1790
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:24.390
like I didn't mean like you hear it,
you're like,
oh,

1791
01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:27.590
he said that like to me Cunty is like,

1792
01:49:28.530 --> 01:49:31.230
one of the things I love about England as you go to England and the other one's

1793
01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:35.200
a con.
I use it all the time of just comes flying eyes.
It's fucking cut.
Oh yeah,

1794
01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:38.370
this guy's a fucking cut.
Look at it.
It's like good cut fucking bloke.

1795
01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:42.620
And this guy was tweeting me and he said,
uh,
in Ireland,
um,

1796
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:47.990
girls say she's be Cunty,
they call each other.
She may kind of

1797
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:50.860
<v 0>like a sex and the city type thing.
Come on.
How beautiful does that sound?</v>

1798
01:49:50.861 --> 01:49:54.130
She's me country.
I'll tell you what,
content is a beautiful word.

1799
01:49:54.131 --> 01:49:58.660
If it's used properly and the right context,
like you fucking cunt,
how were they?

1800
01:49:58.661 --> 01:50:03.100
Can Be behind that word is amazing.
Dave Foley said it best.
He said,

1801
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.820
my ex wife is a fucking con.

1802
01:50:05.410 --> 01:50:08.650
He was talking about how horrible his struggle has been,

1803
01:50:08.651 --> 01:50:12.130
is financial struggle where he can't even go to Canada to see his kids or he'll

1804
01:50:12.131 --> 01:50:14.410
go to jail.
Yeah.
I saw that.
Owe so much money,

1805
01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:17.500
three times more than he makes it a month.
He owes.

1806
01:50:17.650 --> 01:50:21.730
It's like complete nonsense and craziness.
And when he said,
my wife has a cunt,

1807
01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:25.730
like the words resonate.
Yeah.
That was,
there was the reason.

1808
01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:30.400
That was the time to use it.
That was the absolute time to use it.
Yeah.

1809
01:50:30.450 --> 01:50:33.910
Do you think they would ever be able to make new bad words?
Like,
no.

1810
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:38.380
You don't think it's possible?
No.
But you know the,
the real problem is that it,

1811
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:43.180
the real issue with,
with,
you know,
any,
any sort of bad word like that,
like,

1812
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:47.800
especially like the word nigger with the real issue to me is the impact that it

1813
01:50:47.801 --> 01:50:51.700
has on the psychology of a young person,
you know,
and even a girl,

1814
01:50:51.701 --> 01:50:55.210
you know what I mean?
Look,
if you tell some little young girl that she's a cunt,

1815
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:59.890
like,
Whoa,
you know,
it's the word is so hyper charged,
it would crush her.

1816
01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:02.910
You know what I'm saying?
And if you could tell some boy something,

1817
01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:05.110
just a little black boy that he's a nigger,
man,

1818
01:51:05.111 --> 01:51:08.400
that's a horrible thing to do to the de-humanize.

1819
01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:12.700
Some really insecure and vulnerable child with some definition.

1820
01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:16.510
That's sub human.
You know?
That's,
that's where the real issue lives.

1821
01:51:16.530 --> 01:51:19.480
It's like with intent.
But I've always wondered about this.

1822
01:51:19.690 --> 01:51:23.520
Do you think that bad words need to exist as a,

1823
01:51:23.521 --> 01:51:28.521
a natural function of language to represent places where you won't go to

1824
01:51:28.691 --> 01:51:33.280
represent places where you know that maybe there should be a word like nigger,

1825
01:51:33.370 --> 01:51:37.480
so that when one of your,
your people that you hang out with goes,
yeah,

1826
01:51:37.481 --> 01:51:39.430
you know what the problem is?
They're letting niggers vote.

1827
01:51:39.610 --> 01:51:44.470
You need to know that this guy is so fucking dumb.
He actually thinks this way.

1828
01:51:44.471 --> 01:51:49.360
And we'll say this in that context and any that that a,
that word,

1829
01:51:49.361 --> 01:51:52.180
which is so offensive in that context,

1830
01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:55.390
you need to know that that guy's capable of that so you can go,
okay,

1831
01:51:55.391 --> 01:51:58.510
I'm glad that word exists because of that word didn't exist.

1832
01:51:58.511 --> 01:52:01.060
I wouldn't know how fucking stupid you are.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1833
01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:05.020
I think that's totally what words are 40 to kind of showed the other person's

1834
01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:08.430
mentality or thoughts and 10 that's why intense.

1835
01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:11.260
It's like you're supposed to be able to infer it in the context of the

1836
01:52:11.261 --> 01:52:15.670
conversation,
you know?
And it's very difficult when people write things down.

1837
01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:16.121
You know,

1838
01:52:16.121 --> 01:52:19.780
I've seen so many flame wars on the Internet that can totally be avoided.

1839
01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:23.650
It's just that someone will write something and kind of a weird way and another

1840
01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:24.251
one person,

1841
01:52:24.251 --> 01:52:28.180
we'll just make an interpretation of it and in a defensive way and then all of a

1842
01:52:28.181 --> 01:52:32.440
sudden it becomes insults and you know it escalates and it gets fucking crazy.

1843
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:36.340
What I like about that whole dynamic though is is what you see now are all these

1844
01:52:36.341 --> 01:52:40.540
Internet memes popping up and people and people trying to hide a massive amount

1845
01:52:40.541 --> 01:52:45.541
of intent behind a few dopey words that pretty much when use that,

1846
01:52:45.641 --> 01:52:46.070
and that means

1847
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:51.070
<v 5>like you as a human being are prone to getting bought her about insignificant,</v>

1848
01:52:51.710 --> 01:52:54.530
inconsequential areas.
But all they say is two words,

1849
01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:57.380
six letters you mad question mark.

1850
01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:01.100
And so now it's getting harder to understand intent behind people's words

1851
01:53:01.101 --> 01:53:04.010
because they're not using broad terminology.

1852
01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:08.960
I'm a fan of those photos with little sayings though.
Big Fat cat I love.

1853
01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:12.520
Yeah,
cat sayings and the all the ones they've done with Obama,
you know,

1854
01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:16.100
those are awesome.
Those are fucking funny man.
Ar,
those are funny.

1855
01:53:16.101 --> 01:53:19.100
That's one of the most beautiful things about the internet is we have such a

1856
01:53:19.101 --> 01:53:21.350
wide variety of comedy,
you know,

1857
01:53:21.351 --> 01:53:24.530
from people that would have never entered into the comedy business.

1858
01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:26.270
They just made some sort of a,

1859
01:53:26.370 --> 01:53:29.510
an animated Gif file on their own because they know how to fuck with computers

1860
01:53:29.690 --> 01:53:32.960
and it's Arnold Schwarzenegger's head on a dog.

1861
01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:37.670
That's fucking another dog with his maids face on it and he's fucking her.

1862
01:53:37.670 --> 01:53:41.780
And then he throws up after he's done fucking her and then the dog starts eating

1863
01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:44.270
the throw up.
And so Arnold doing it in this animated Gif file,

1864
01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:49.220
it's fucking hilarious.
And you know,
it's probably some just some dude,
you know,

1865
01:53:49.221 --> 01:53:53.330
he's got a job working with computers or maybe he's just at home fucking around

1866
01:53:53.331 --> 01:53:55.640
with some program and he slaps it together.

1867
01:53:55.790 --> 01:54:00.370
You would have never seen that 20 years.
People don't get the voice,
you know,

1868
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:04.020
to date breast themselves artistically know.

1869
01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:07.730
I mean all these internet photos and all these different things.
I mean,

1870
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:10.670
and it's so funny how many different people think up the same thing.

1871
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:13.880
And I don't necessarily even think that it's,
a lot of it is stealing.

1872
01:54:14.170 --> 01:54:17.360
I think there's just a lot of parallel thinking.
There's a lot of things,

1873
01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:22.120
ideas that were born with as part of our DNA.
There are a,

1874
01:54:22.150 --> 01:54:26.900
the way our brains are wired is such that it causes certain thought patterns to

1875
01:54:26.901 --> 01:54:30.550
be shared.
And you know that that's how we're wired,

1876
01:54:30.551 --> 01:54:33.890
where we share thoughts and ideas that sometimes pop up and very weird and

1877
01:54:33.891 --> 01:54:34.550
disturbing ways.

1878
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:39.410
I got to be honest sometimes I enjoy watching a very clever troll take place.

1879
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:44.030
Trolls are fascinating man.
Sometimes they ain't know that shit out of me,

1880
01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:46.340
especially when someone's trying to troll me and my bitch stop.

1881
01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.080
But I do enjoy watching people get roped into some ridiculous argument.

1882
01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:52.130
I think they're important.

1883
01:54:52.131 --> 01:54:56.150
That's a regional person clearly doesn't mean it is important to see who's in on

1884
01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:00.590
it,
who can see who is wise enough to see that they're just expressing the polar

1885
01:55:00.591 --> 01:55:05.180
opposite of your own ideas and then someone will inevitably come along with that

1886
01:55:05.181 --> 01:55:08.210
photo of the black guy with his finger and says,

1887
01:55:08.211 --> 01:55:11.800
y'all niggas be posted in a troll through it.
Okay,

1888
01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:16.070
that's inevitable.
He pops up in every,
every good solid troll thread.

1889
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:20.880
Your message board is great though.
Weird place,
man.
I'll tell you,
I actually a,

1890
01:55:20.881 --> 01:55:24.350
I think there's a lot more bullshit posted there these days,

1891
01:55:24.351 --> 01:55:28.970
but I think some of the people there are terrific and there are some really

1892
01:55:28.971 --> 01:55:32.900
sharp mother fuckers that post there regularly.
It's just harder now to,

1893
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:37.310
the numbers are saying to you now,
four and a half million posts on that thing.

1894
01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:41.480
When did you start crazy?
When you start the messenger,
it go God damn September,

1895
01:55:41.481 --> 01:55:44.220
I think.
How weird is it by the way that you talked about

1896
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:48.420
<v 0>Swartz and Agar and your dream last week?
And then the next day after saying it,</v>

1897
01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:48.751
uh,

1898
01:55:48.751 --> 01:55:53.700
all those photos of Arnold Schwarzenegger in naked popped up and those were from

1899
01:55:53.701 --> 01:55:55.620
like,
uh,
several years ago,

1900
01:55:55.621 --> 01:55:59.670
but they just got leaked out the following day.
That's so ridiculous.

1901
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:03.960
It's so crazy because my dream was I've been taking these nootropics where we're

1902
01:56:03.961 --> 01:56:07.680
coming out with this whole line of I'm losing volume again,
dude.

1903
01:56:07.890 --> 01:56:10.400
The fuck is going on.
Did you touch that?
I might have to anything Mito.

1904
01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.460
Did you shut the volume loss son?
Get your fucking,

1905
01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:22.020
my foot did didn't
dirty feet off the controllers,

1906
01:56:22.021 --> 01:56:26.640
man.
How's that?
Um,
that's cool.
So,
um,
I've been taking,

1907
01:56:26.670 --> 01:56:28.670
so that we're coming out with these nootropics and we're,

1908
01:56:28.671 --> 01:56:31.710
we're fucking around with the different formulas of it.

1909
01:56:31.711 --> 01:56:36.000
And the first initial forming of the crips came up with is really powerful.

1910
01:56:36.001 --> 01:56:39.960
It's nuts,
but it's a read the future,
I guess,
and your dreams.

1911
01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:41.940
That's one of the side effects.

1912
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:45.540
It was different in my dream and where it took place was different.

1913
01:56:45.541 --> 01:56:48.690
And what took place in some fantasy place where it was like,
in my mind,

1914
01:56:48.691 --> 01:56:49.710
it was my parents' house.

1915
01:56:49.890 --> 01:56:52.710
What's really strange is that I have so much recall of this dream,

1916
01:56:52.711 --> 01:56:56.070
which is very rare for me.
I usually don't have this much dream recall,

1917
01:56:56.071 --> 01:56:57.780
but this one is very crystal clear.

1918
01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:02.290
He was in this House that was my parents' house,
but it wasn't,
and it was on,

1919
01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.390
my parents lived on the water in Florida and uh,
this was supposedly their house,

1920
01:57:06.391 --> 01:57:08.940
but it wasn't their house.
It was just something different.

1921
01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:10.620
It was representing their house.

1922
01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:14.460
And so I'm hanging out there with them and Arnold Schwarzenegger is walking

1923
01:57:14.461 --> 01:57:19.140
around just owning it,
you know,
owning that he's a freak.
And he said,
well,

1924
01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:23.130
he was much more muscular.
He looked like the Arnold Schwarzenegger of like,

1925
01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:27.810
you know,
like the photos that where he got,
where he got caught.
That was in,

1926
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.820
those are the photos where he's naked.
They were released.

1927
01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:33.960
That was from like 2000 and 1000 right.
That's what he looked like in my dream.

1928
01:57:34.230 --> 01:57:36.120
Wow.
It doesn't look like the Arnold up today.

1929
01:57:36.150 --> 01:57:41.010
He looked like the Arnold of like a 50 year old in shape guy.

1930
01:57:41.130 --> 01:57:41.963
That's what he looked like.

1931
01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:46.170
But owning the fact that he was a freak and he was walking around in his little

1932
01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.750
tidy little,
you know,
little banana Hammock,

1933
01:57:49.170 --> 01:57:54.170
Jammy fucking underwear type things and his balls were so big that he had um,

1934
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:58.050
tucked up behind his asshole and pulled out through the back band.

1935
01:57:58.070 --> 01:58:02.190
This is your dream.
Since my band,
the storage gas,
please do.

1936
01:58:03.690 --> 01:58:04.320
But anyway,

1937
01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:08.100
so this ridiculous fucking dream that I have of Arnold sports and constantly

1938
01:58:08.101 --> 01:58:08.934
pulling his dick out,

1939
01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:12.240
like washing himself and pulling his pants down and having a need to wash

1940
01:58:12.241 --> 01:58:15.270
himself like in front of everybody.
Like it was like preposterous.
Like,

1941
01:58:15.271 --> 01:58:18.450
why is this guy was like,
I was thinking,
is this a European thing?
And they,

1942
01:58:18.451 --> 01:58:20.980
until like a pulling their pants out of Washington are assholes.
Whether,

1943
01:58:21.130 --> 01:58:24.190
you know,
swimming is after his scandal,
uh,

1944
01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:28.410
was that all of it was after the scandal.
And so,
um,

1945
01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:32.000
so I had this dream and then like two days later these fucking photos came out

1946
01:58:32.001 --> 01:58:36.540
and you got those photos.
It's ridiculous,
man.
I mean,
it almost,

1947
01:58:36.541 --> 01:58:41.541
the only thing that looks different between him of these photos and him of him,

1948
01:58:41.891 --> 01:58:45.620
of my dream is that his hair was longer in my dream.
His hair was like this,

1949
01:58:45.850 --> 01:58:50.850
this one young Arnold with the long wavy 1970s hair,

1950
01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:54.540
when he was the rock,
that shit,
it wasn't like high and tight.
Like he has it now.

1951
01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:00.340
I thought it was just fucking scary.
Like how,

1952
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:04.420
how just the following day I went on Tmz and saw that I was like,
Whoa,

1953
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:07.830
this is just weird upon what would Tyler Durden do?
He had it.

1954
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:13.360
He's our buddy.
He,
uh,
but um,
yeah,
it was very strange that these photos came out.

1955
01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:16.810
I mean,
it was basically what I dreamed of.
Just different,

1956
01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.550
that's really surreal when that happens.

1957
01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:20.890
Do you think that's like just synchronicity and uh,

1958
01:59:20.891 --> 01:59:25.870
there's some kind of meaningful collective focus on this or it could be that

1959
01:59:25.890 --> 01:59:28.780
motherfuckers a free and just pulling his ass out everywhere.

1960
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:35.870
You just had a fucking dream of Colombo Arnold One and two together.

1961
01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:40.600
Boy might be the kind of dude to pull his dick out every now and again.

1962
01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:43.750
I think he probably,
he's so fucking crazy.
He's over the top crazy.

1963
01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:49.480
This is him pulls his pants down.
He's like,
where's my bowls?

1964
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:53.320
Bowls?
The

1965
01:59:57.350 --> 02:00:00.820
dead two balls.
And that's exactly what he looked like in my dream.

1966
02:00:00.930 --> 02:00:03.910
And it was like muscular still,
but like 50.

1967
02:00:03.970 --> 02:00:07.750
But his hair was like following along and he was strutting around like a peacock

1968
02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:11.440
and diving in the water and so comfortable.
And I remember thinking,

1969
02:00:11.441 --> 02:00:15.760
I gotta get every woman I know fuck out of here.
He's got my fuck my mom.

1970
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:18.400
Like I was thinking,
this is my mom's house aren't swatch.
Let's work.

1971
02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:21.790
This guy's a Predator towards Nigga might just pull his dick out in front of my

1972
02:00:21.791 --> 02:00:24.700
mom and I might walk in on him and my mom bagging,

1973
02:00:24.730 --> 02:00:27.160
nothing your mom could do about it.
She might not be able to handle it.

1974
02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:31.840
The fame of Arnold and Arnold Dick and she made me think she could tell my dad

1975
02:00:31.841 --> 02:00:35.170
and he would understand that it was just,
it was Arnold.
I mean,

1976
02:00:35.171 --> 02:00:37.990
I didn't even mean anything.
You analyze your own dream.
This is getting deep.

1977
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:42.670
I don't know mean it is strange though that two days later this fucking

1978
02:00:42.671 --> 02:00:47.020
photograph came out.
That's a Arnold's,
but a crack right there that's,

1979
02:00:47.021 --> 02:00:50.020
we're not going to see in that picture.
But I'm looking at it from right here.

1980
02:00:51.130 --> 02:00:56.080
That's so strange how clear it is on your,
uh,
on your,
your video but not here.

1981
02:00:56.081 --> 02:00:57.220
Looking right at it.
It looks,

1982
02:00:57.470 --> 02:01:01.060
it's doing the old pixel thing where from afar it looks normal,
but like,

1983
02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:03.700
you know,
close up.
See it's kind of like this painting right here.

1984
02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:05.670
So you flipped his asshole.
That's his asshole.

1985
02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:10.030
That's why the gap from under it between his ass crack right there and his
balls.

1986
02:01:10.031 --> 02:01:11.770
I think the dark area might be his balls.

1987
02:01:11.890 --> 02:01:16.330
If you were Richard Hoagland and you are analyzing those arguments on Mars,

1988
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:21.970
I will find and you're like,
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
homeboy back the fuck up.

1989
02:01:22.110 --> 02:01:27.030
That's a bird.
That's a bird.
That's rock and it's tiered.
Yeah.

1990
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:28.660
This is a burden.
If you notice,

1991
02:01:28.661 --> 02:01:33.100
if you draw a line between this rock and that rock,
you're like,
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,

1992
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:37.290
Whoa,
whoa.
You just making shit up.
You're deciding where to measure and you're,

1993
02:01:37.291 --> 02:01:41.060
you're saying,
well,
this matches this setup in Egypt,
but fuck it does.

1994
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:42.320
It doesn't look anything like,

1995
02:01:42.321 --> 02:01:46.730
he just reminds me of how unsophisticated we are when it comes to space travel

1996
02:01:46.731 --> 02:01:49.790
because of the ideas that we're still giving credence to.

1997
02:01:49.791 --> 02:01:53.910
We've got people who believe what he's saying about Mars and all that.
I just,

1998
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:57.140
I think it's a real fucking shame that we can't get there with cameras and

1999
02:01:57.141 --> 02:02:00.170
fucking,
it is a chilly really explore that place,

2000
02:02:00.171 --> 02:02:04.340
but I do think that there is something to a few of those structures.

2001
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:07.040
There are some of those high resolution photographs.

2002
02:02:07.130 --> 02:02:10.130
None of the face I look at the face,
that's not interesting to me.

2003
02:02:10.131 --> 02:02:11.390
That looks like it could be shadows.
Right.

2004
02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:13.460
Is Interesting to me is the base of the face.

2005
02:02:13.670 --> 02:02:17.670
The base of the face looks pretty symmetrical.
Not completely but enough to the,

2006
02:02:17.671 --> 02:02:20.090
you might think,
wow,
what does,
what is that?
What is that?

2007
02:02:20.210 --> 02:02:22.670
And there's a few of these other ones that are like five of start,

2008
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:26.180
five sided pyramids and you,
you look at those and go,
wow,

2009
02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:29.390
they're really does look like it might be at one point in time,

2010
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:33.620
thousands of years ago,
it could have been some sort of a structure,
but or not.

2011
02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:37.730
It could have easily not been anything.
When you look at that thing,

2012
02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:41.000
I mean it looks like I'm just a mountain to me,
man,
I look at this,

2013
02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:43.130
this is the one that freaked everybody out,

2014
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:47.370
but they've determined that when they,
when they took the photographs,
the the,

2015
02:02:47.371 --> 02:02:50.630
the high resolution photographs so much closer when they've determined it's
just,

2016
02:02:50.631 --> 02:02:52.700
this is just a trick of lighting.
It's really that simple.

2017
02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:56.510
What's more interesting is the outside of the,
of the face on Mars,

2018
02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:00.230
but some of the pyramids are kind of trippy but not trippy enough where you

2019
02:03:00.231 --> 02:03:04.130
would go.
You definitely know that that is a pyramid and that someone built that,

2020
02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:05.450
you know,
50 million years ago.

2021
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:09.750
I think lost civilization is very interesting as a concept.
And I like,

2022
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:14.180
I like looking for it.
I think there's nothing definitive on Mars.

2023
02:03:14.210 --> 02:03:16.550
Well you know that thing that they found in Turkey recently,

2024
02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:19.220
they had very sophisticated temple in Turkey cut.

2025
02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:23.810
It was back when and it really re it fucks up the whole dating for the whole

2026
02:03:23.811 --> 02:03:28.811
hunter and gatherer versus a settlement because this is 9,600 BC.

2027
02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:32.480
They thought that people didn't even have agriculture back then.

2028
02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:36.500
And yet here's this amazingly sophisticated temple with uh,

2029
02:03:36.501 --> 02:03:40.610
you know all these stone carvings of different animals and birds and shit.

2030
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:45.790
It's called the go Beckley Eco Beck look up like a new site in Turkey predates

2031
02:03:48.291 --> 02:03:50.150
civilization.
So,
and this is,

2032
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:55.330
this shit is all 9,600 BC and it these big stone columns.

2033
02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:59.660
These are just hunter gatherers back then.
So everybody's freaking out.

2034
02:03:59.661 --> 02:04:04.190
They're like,
how did hunter gatherers stop and build this and not just build it?

2035
02:04:04.191 --> 02:04:09.191
But apparently they buried at all because it was really well preserved and

2036
02:04:09.561 --> 02:04:11.240
they're,
they're freaking out about that.
They're saying,
well,

2037
02:04:11.241 --> 02:04:14.330
this is something that wasn't even like weathered for thousands of years.

2038
02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:16.850
There's some,
it's so well preserved that had been covered.

2039
02:04:16.851 --> 02:04:21.230
So it's just really rare opportunity for these archeologists to study this

2040
02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:25.640
really totally unknown little section of the world.
It'll tech,

2041
02:04:25.670 --> 02:04:30.530
they have technology now that they can find those kinds of things.
But yeah,

2042
02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:33.780
I mean I,
and you always want to finding a bunch of new pyramids because of that.

2043
02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:36.950
They jumped,
they found a bunch of new burial sites,
a bunch of new pyramids,

2044
02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:38.360
all with satellite technology.

2045
02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.240
<v 5>I was going to say,
I,</v>

2046
02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:44.260
I really do believe that there's been many iterations of wireless technology

2047
02:04:44.341 --> 02:04:48.780
used in different forms throughout the history.
Yeah,
I do because one,

2048
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:52.800
it's impermanent.
I,
I think that the nature of it,
other than satellites,

2049
02:04:52.801 --> 02:04:53.191
I mean there's,

2050
02:04:53.191 --> 02:04:55.830
we would probably know if there were satellites floating around up in space,

2051
02:04:55.831 --> 02:05:00.450
but maybe not.
But I think that it's likely that other tech,
um,

2052
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:01.470
civilizations,

2053
02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:06.471
ancient civilizations have had forms of wireless technology that don't last.

2054
02:05:07.051 --> 02:05:10.680
Because if you think about how our wireless technology is set up with antennas

2055
02:05:10.681 --> 02:05:15.630
and the way that you have to use radio waves and you know,
point them,
uh,

2056
02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:19.950
it,
they're not prone to lasting under,
you know,
disaster.
So I mean,
you know,

2057
02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:24.300
ancient Egyptians in the way that they used their pyramids could have well been

2058
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:28.500
associated with some sort of wireless,
a antenna and some sort of,

2059
02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:29.760
I'm not saying it's likely,

2060
02:05:29.761 --> 02:05:34.530
I'm saying that I'm open to the idea of game center right there.
The idea that,

2061
02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:37.230
yeah.
Then that school,
Becky,
what did you,
what do they call it?

2062
02:05:37.231 --> 02:05:39.710
How they're described this place?
What is it called?
The heroin,

2063
02:05:39.711 --> 02:05:42.930
let me go back to the actual crazy name.
Cool.

2064
02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:46.890
9,600 BC man.
Yeah,
it's really nuts.

2065
02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:49.290
Go Becky [inaudible] or something like that.

2066
02:05:49.590 --> 02:05:51.850
How do they actually creation at the six day creation?

2067
02:05:51.851 --> 02:05:53.610
A six planets are kind of temple.

2068
02:05:55.890 --> 02:06:00.120
How do you say this name?
Quebec.
Quebec Lee Tepi.

2069
02:06:00.210 --> 02:06:03.810
Is that how you said go back to the tap and go back to lead happy either way.

2070
02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:07.550
Incredible discovery.
Do you think that that um,

2071
02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:10.800
like you one of those people that believes that there's been a series of

2072
02:06:10.801 --> 02:06:14.160
cataclysmic disasters and people have rebounded so they reach great heights?

2073
02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:19.470
I think it's likely that great civilizations emerge and then dissipate.

2074
02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:20.161
And you know,
we've,

2075
02:06:20.161 --> 02:06:24.540
we've seen that we just don't have much historical evidence of anything really.

2076
02:06:24.541 --> 02:06:25.374
If you think about it,

2077
02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:30.010
it's only because of our technology and our books even that we're able to,

2078
02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:33.510
to have a semblance of what occurred throughout time.
So,

2079
02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:37.590
and we've only been keeping records for so long and so that's why,
you know,

2080
02:06:37.591 --> 02:06:40.950
the pyramids are interesting and the hieroglyphs and the uh,

2081
02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.660
Dead Sea scrolls were really interesting and,

2082
02:06:43.661 --> 02:06:46.620
and those kind of historical records are very important.

2083
02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:50.670
And I don't know that we keep important historical records if this world and its

2084
02:06:50.671 --> 02:06:53.180
civilization is wiped out or eliminated.

2085
02:06:53.250 --> 02:06:55.410
The real thing is when everything goes digital,
right?

2086
02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:58.770
Because then no hard copies of it that we can take with us places.

2087
02:06:58.771 --> 02:07:02.940
And then essentially all information from a certain period of time forward gets

2088
02:07:02.941 --> 02:07:06.160
lost and he sort of cataclysmic.
Right.
And that's where I think a lot of,
uh,

2089
02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:10.380
archetypal a religious imagery emerges from are those times where we can't

2090
02:07:10.381 --> 02:07:13.140
really explain what happened and we don't remember.
There's no record.

2091
02:07:13.141 --> 02:07:17.070
So we have to fill because it's our inclination to look back,
uh,

2092
02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:22.100
to fill with myth and mythology is what we do when we don't know what else to do

2093
02:07:22.921 --> 02:07:27.080
or how to explain something.
Yeah.
And you know,
the John Anthony West guy is a,

2094
02:07:27.090 --> 02:07:27.730
he's a,

2095
02:07:27.730 --> 02:07:32.330
the egyptologist that's spent so much time trying to move the date of the

2096
02:07:32.331 --> 02:07:36.150
Egyptian history back far,
far,
far,
far the past whether he

2097
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:39.370
<v 0>wants to predate them than before 10,000,
500 BC.</v>

2098
02:07:39.371 --> 02:07:43.180
He thinks that it's been like a 34,000 year old history and that they can show

2099
02:07:43.181 --> 02:07:46.930
it in hieroglyphs.
But they always say to him like,
where's the evidence?

2100
02:07:47.170 --> 02:07:50.380
Where's the evidence of this besides the,
uh,
water erosion on the Sphinx.

2101
02:07:50.381 --> 02:07:53.860
And besides all the hieroglyphs that detailed these pharaohs going back way,

2102
02:07:53.861 --> 02:07:54.730
way far in the past,

2103
02:07:54.850 --> 02:07:57.320
they look at those pharaohs from like 34,000 years ago and they say,

2104
02:07:57.321 --> 02:07:58.270
well that's just fiction.

2105
02:07:58.510 --> 02:08:02.600
It's just folklore and a certain point in time it became fact.
But when you,

2106
02:08:02.630 --> 02:08:05.410
it's really fun to pass.
It's folklore and uh,

2107
02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:09.850
but the real question is what would be left of us like this room.
Okay.

2108
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:14.860
With all these televisions and all this electronics and shit,
if we died,

2109
02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:18.040
if there was a nuclear blast and North America was wiped out,

2110
02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:19.980
how long would this shit last?

2111
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:24.760
Oh Shit would be gone in a few thousand years.
Two or 3000 years.

2112
02:08:24.761 --> 02:08:26.830
Everything that's in that metal box,

2113
02:08:26.831 --> 02:08:28.450
we'll have been swallowed up by the [inaudible].

2114
02:08:28.730 --> 02:08:31.550
<v 5>Yeah.
The things that last are like oil based things like,
you know,</v>

2115
02:08:31.551 --> 02:08:35.120
they always talk about landfills in the kind of thing that will fill a landfill

2116
02:08:35.121 --> 02:08:38.720
for thousands of years and it's like your plastic bags and things that are made

2117
02:08:38.721 --> 02:08:42.720
of oil or the thing the substance they originate from is,
you know,
a,

2118
02:08:42.730 --> 02:08:44.720
a natural substance.

2119
02:08:44.721 --> 02:08:48.260
Those are the kinds of things that stick around and that's what remains on this

2120
02:08:48.261 --> 02:08:52.880
planet.
It's a,
I don't know,
stone stone,
the way to really mark angel labs.

2121
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:56.180
<v 0>I mean everything that we know that's really,
really,
really,</v>

2122
02:08:56.181 --> 02:08:59.480
really old that people make.
We know because it was,
it was made out of stone.

2123
02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:02.240
I don't know if anything else would be around,
you know,

2124
02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:06.240
I think that most would and all these things would rot out and water overtakes

2125
02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:10.660
this was water can overtake that.
Like those,
those um,

2126
02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:11.840
sunk in,
uh,

2127
02:09:11.930 --> 02:09:16.130
structures outside of Japan that there've been arguing back and forth or whether

2128
02:09:16.131 --> 02:09:19.190
or not their natural man,
I,
I've looked at those,

2129
02:09:19.191 --> 02:09:23.360
there are cut pieces of fucking slabs that are perfectly cut,

2130
02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:25.910
stacked one right next to each other.

2131
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.970
And if you're looking at some of the aspects of it,
you go,
well,

2132
02:09:28.971 --> 02:09:32.900
I guess it could be some really strange natural phenomenon.
It is possible,

2133
02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:35.930
but not when you get to these slabs,

2134
02:09:36.050 --> 02:09:40.880
there's these two slabs that are like these monoliths that are so clearly cut

2135
02:09:40.881 --> 02:09:43.190
and quarried and they're stacked right next to each other.

2136
02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:45.620
And I look at that and I go,
okay,
well there's so many made this,

2137
02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:47.300
this is bullshit.
So,

2138
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:52.280
and they know that this part of Japan had been underwater as recently as like

2139
02:09:52.281 --> 02:09:57.170
10,000 years ago.
So like it up until rather recently.
It's like 10,000 years ago.

2140
02:09:57.260 --> 02:10:01.880
So this is like some fucking incredibly old shit somebody made and it just got

2141
02:10:01.881 --> 02:10:04.370
swallowed up by the ocean and you can still see it.

2142
02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:07.970
And if you know that that's where the water was and you know that the land had,

2143
02:10:07.971 --> 02:10:10.520
you know,
water had covered over that area for the last,
you know,

2144
02:10:10.590 --> 02:10:14.320
x thousand years,
then you know,
how old this shit is roughly,
you know,
and,

2145
02:10:14.450 --> 02:10:16.100
but they're not willing to look at it that way.
There they,

2146
02:10:16.130 --> 02:10:19.120
it's so preposterous to them that they're,
they're,
they,

2147
02:10:19.170 --> 02:10:21.140
they look at it and say it's a natural formation.

2148
02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:22.100
<v 5>But on the other hand,</v>

2149
02:10:22.101 --> 02:10:26.230
Dell embrace climate change right now as if we're in danger of being submerged

2150
02:10:26.231 --> 02:10:30.790
around the edges.
And,
uh,
I think it's just part of the cycle of this planet.

2151
02:10:30.791 --> 02:10:34.130
We go through periods where we freeze and melt.
And I don't know how much man

2152
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:36.920
<v 0>contributes to climate change.
I think,
I know it happens though.</v>

2153
02:10:36.921 --> 02:10:39.110
And I know that things,
you know,
uh,

2154
02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:43.610
disasters like the tsunamis we've been seeing will overtake land and wash away

2155
02:10:43.611 --> 02:10:45.290
whatever's there and you know,

2156
02:10:45.291 --> 02:10:48.170
throughout thousands of years there's really no telling what man,

2157
02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:49.033
where man has come from.

2158
02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:52.040
I think that's why it's so fascinating to think about most people,
uh,

2159
02:10:52.041 --> 02:10:55.280
that are religious.
Uh,
it gives them their answers.
You know,

2160
02:10:55.290 --> 02:11:00.230
it says this is where we came from.
It was fucking magic.
And that's where,

2161
02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:03.800
you know,
so we're going to find answers to that.

2162
02:11:03.801 --> 02:11:08.240
I think people that are skeptical and curious individuals who,
uh,

2163
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:11.090
will look back and wonder,
you know,

2164
02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:13.910
we'll talk about shit like this and kind of say what could have been,

2165
02:11:13.911 --> 02:11:18.290
and it's a volatile situation.
The Earth's position is,
it moves,
you know,

2166
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:20.890
the earth's position around the sun in new,
we know,
we,
we,
we were,

2167
02:11:20.891 --> 02:11:25.030
we're spinning around this thing and we're spinning on this axis and you know,

2168
02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:28.130
the,
the climate changes,
sometimes things get radically different.

2169
02:11:28.130 --> 02:11:32.600
North America 10,000 years ago was covered under a mile of ice.

2170
02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:37.160
You half of North America was covered by ice.
Yup.
A mile high.
Man,

2171
02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:39.050
this is just 10,000 years ago.
We'll,
we'll,

2172
02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:43.490
we're pretty sure 10,000 years ago we didn't have global warming because of

2173
02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:45.770
carbon dioxide made my engines.

2174
02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:49.490
What I mean it's like I think I,
and I wonder too,

2175
02:11:49.491 --> 02:11:52.010
when I see like ancient civilizations like Egypt,

2176
02:11:52.190 --> 02:11:57.190
I wonder if we're looking at society one way because we have this petrochemical

2177
02:11:58.881 --> 02:12:00.480
based society,
this,
you know,

2178
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:04.520
we have this gasoline and oil and plastic based society that we use it.

2179
02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:06.140
It's such an important resource to us.

2180
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:09.440
What if there was a society that figured out some other way,
right?

2181
02:12:09.441 --> 02:12:14.030
They were based around different natural resources or they figured out some

2182
02:12:14.031 --> 02:12:16.130
other way of to manipulate matter.

2183
02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:19.400
I mean there's a lot of questions as to how the pyramids were construction.

2184
02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:21.890
If they stack those stones where they got them,

2185
02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:23.540
the ones that were cut from there was some of them,

2186
02:12:23.541 --> 02:12:25.700
the quote from a quarry there was hundreds of miles away.

2187
02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:29.180
They don't know exactly how they transported those things,
those massive,

2188
02:12:29.630 --> 02:12:32.450
huge fucking stones and buy.
There's only that,

2189
02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:34.430
there's not that many people on the planet back then.

2190
02:12:34.431 --> 02:12:37.970
Supposedly there's only supposed to be like 2 million people on the whole planet

2191
02:12:37.971 --> 02:12:39.740
back then.
And how do they do that?
I mean there's,

2192
02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:42.230
there's a lot of possible explanations,

2193
02:12:42.231 --> 02:12:45.450
but there is not any evidence of how that was done.
That's,

2194
02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:50.430
that's beyond a reasonable doubt to still wonder.
And you know,
I,

2195
02:12:50.431 --> 02:12:53.690
I just argue with that.
It's amazing.
People will argue with that,

2196
02:12:53.730 --> 02:12:58.100
but that's not interesting.
No,
no,
no.
We've get figured it out.
You're wrong.

2197
02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:01.370
It's like they take this religious position.
It is like,

2198
02:13:01.371 --> 02:13:04.190
almost like you're questioning God,
you know,
when you say,
you know,

2199
02:13:04.191 --> 02:13:07.040
I don't think we do know how the fuck they built the pyramids.
And you know,

2200
02:13:07.041 --> 02:13:09.530
there's also significant evidence that was,

2201
02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:13.220
that they were made out of concrete and they would did it.
His word Horn.
Yeah.

2202
02:13:13.221 --> 02:13:15.620
These stones.
The significant evidence.
I agree.

2203
02:13:15.710 --> 02:13:19.010
As far as the composition of the stones.
I mean I've seen it argued it's a,

2204
02:13:19.011 --> 02:13:21.860
it's a,
it's a fascinating point of view.
And if that was true,

2205
02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:24.070
well then want to make it considerably easier to,

2206
02:13:24.190 --> 02:13:27.110
to make these things cause you would just sort of cast these stones as you moved

2207
02:13:27.111 --> 02:13:31.040
along,
but that still doesn't make up for the margin of error.

2208
02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:35.430
The margin of error there were so spectacular would their construction methods

2209
02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:39.720
that there was,
it was a perfect thing all the way to the top of 2 million,

2210
02:13:39.721 --> 02:13:43.110
300,000 stones.
I mean that's an amazing thing.

2211
02:13:43.111 --> 02:13:46.710
I wonder what kind of calculations they were capable of back then.
You know,

2212
02:13:46.711 --> 02:13:49.140
when that library of Alexandria burned down,

2213
02:13:49.141 --> 02:13:53.730
we lost so much information about how Egypt figured things out and what their

2214
02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:56.280
history was and how they put it all together.

2215
02:13:56.281 --> 02:14:01.281
But the stuff that they did is so amazing and beyond comprehension for someone

2216
02:14:01.741 --> 02:14:05.450
who lived literally 5,000 plus years ago,

2217
02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:07.200
<v 5>they were measuring their,</v>

2218
02:14:07.201 --> 02:14:11.970
their distance to the stars and they were using the universe as a tool to guide

2219
02:14:11.971 --> 02:14:14.730
what they were doing.
And there's evidence of this at least.

2220
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:19.620
And I always wonder how much technology did they have and what is our technology

2221
02:14:19.621 --> 02:14:22.680
doing to us that could potentially kill us off as you said.

2222
02:14:22.681 --> 02:14:25.740
And that's why it doesn't last because we're not around to make it,
you know,

2223
02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:30.150
you're talking about sentient machine deciding where the bad guy,
but what,

2224
02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:30.510
you know,

2225
02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:34.110
what if our simple internet technology and cell phones are killing are going to

2226
02:14:34.111 --> 02:14:35.690
ultimately kill us off with the,

2227
02:14:35.691 --> 02:14:40.170
the type of a radio wave they're pumping into our bodies and our children and

2228
02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:43.380
the genetic effect that these technologies have.

2229
02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:47.430
This is brand new and things of the rise in autism and epilepsy and these kinds

2230
02:14:47.431 --> 02:14:50.100
of issues I think is directly a,

2231
02:14:50.101 --> 02:14:53.000
it's another area that needs to be looked at and discussed.

2232
02:14:53.001 --> 02:14:56.800
But no one is doing that in the medical,
the scientific community.
Um,

2233
02:14:56.850 --> 02:14:58.490
there aren't many of these studies that,

2234
02:14:58.970 --> 02:15:03.690
that seem like they should be important lady radiation studies and let's see,

2235
02:15:03.691 --> 02:15:05.870
I mean they're,
they just came out with uh,

2236
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:09.470
evidence and I think the World Health Organization published a report where,

2237
02:15:09.471 --> 02:15:13.410
and they agree that cell phone technology is,
uh,

2238
02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:18.150
can cause cancer in your brain if you use it on your ear all the time.

2239
02:15:18.151 --> 02:15:18.820
It was

2240
02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:20.520
<v 0>Anderson Cooper was talking about it.</v>

2241
02:15:20.521 --> 02:15:24.360
It was saying that what you have to do is you have to hold it away from your
ear.

2242
02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:27.590
Right.
And I was like,
what are they saying?
Like they were measuring it,

2243
02:15:27.591 --> 02:15:30.960
the acceptable amount of radiation that comes off of these headsets.

2244
02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:33.780
But they said the way to measure it is it has to be away from you here,

2245
02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:36.120
if you use it the way everybody else uses it,

2246
02:15:36.150 --> 02:15:38.430
when you put it actually up to your ear,
hold it.

2247
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:41.070
Especially if there's a lot of people talking around your pressure up your ear

2248
02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:44.210
<v 5>frying your brain.
I'm not saying it's going to literally fry your brain.</v>

2249
02:15:44.211 --> 02:15:48.110
I just mean there are radio waves that are going into your brain that well the

2250
02:15:48.111 --> 02:15:48.790
question is fine.

2251
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:52.010
It's debatable how much of it is healthy or how much of it you can take.

2252
02:15:52.011 --> 02:15:56.960
And we carry it in our pocket to right and our sperm is as potentially,

2253
02:15:56.961 --> 02:16:00.110
it's definitely receiving the radiation from the phone.

2254
02:16:00.150 --> 02:16:04.400
So who knows what that's going to have the effect that that's going to have

2255
02:16:04.430 --> 02:16:07.970
maybe nothing,
but maybe you know,
it's very possible.
It's so new.

2256
02:16:07.971 --> 02:16:09.410
We just don't know if she'd had rabbit,
but

2257
02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:13.750
<v 0>that was born,
uh,
outside of the blast zone in the,
um,</v>

2258
02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:17.690
the uh,
and Japan where the reactors are down a rabbit.

2259
02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:21.580
We started wearing a rabbit was born.
That was no ears.
Wow.

2260
02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:26.820
A lot of the freak round headed rabbit with no ears.
It's so weird,
man.

2261
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:30.490
It's weird.
It's got a round head.
Nuclear technology

2262
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:34.360
<v 5>is the most likely suspect to kill all of us in,
in,
in this generation.</v>

2263
02:16:34.361 --> 02:16:36.990
And to wipe up out this whole planet even more than you know,

2264
02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.840
comets and asteroids.
I think,
uh,
it's very possible,

2265
02:16:40.841 --> 02:16:42.130
but it's still,

2266
02:16:42.270 --> 02:16:46.840
<v 0>uh,
sugar on this rabbit.
This is this little girl right here is good.
No years.</v>

2267
02:16:47.250 --> 02:16:51.720
Wow.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
That's an x man rabbit I'd like to have.

2268
02:16:51.721 --> 02:16:53.460
It's going to take over the world and 10 years,

2269
02:16:53.890 --> 02:16:56.640
is it after I've put on a black leather suit and he's going to be a,

2270
02:16:57.550 --> 02:17:01.590
I'm like a man and he'll be the x men.
He'll be the bad guy.

2271
02:17:01.591 --> 02:17:05.290
That nuclear rabbit.
That's great.
Yeah.
The,

2272
02:17:05.310 --> 02:17:09.060
the amazing thing is that they allow these people to make these reactors and

2273
02:17:09.061 --> 02:17:13.980
they didn't have a multitude of backup plans for this incredible amount of

2274
02:17:13.981 --> 02:17:16.230
energy that you're producing and you're trying to contain.

2275
02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:19.720
<v 5>And we use the same technology here in many cases they were talking about</v>

2276
02:17:19.721 --> 02:17:24.460
California are a lot of our,
uh,
reactors are rated to withstand a,

2277
02:17:24.461 --> 02:17:28.470
you know,
a 6.9 earthquake or a 7.1 earthquake.
Well,
what do you know?

2278
02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:31.250
What about an 8.141 or any point to you?

2279
02:17:31.251 --> 02:17:34.180
And they're trying to predict the faults that they lie on and what they're

2280
02:17:34.181 --> 02:17:38.080
capable of to do that.
So if we'll have the same thing in California,

2281
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:41.380
we have an earthquake like that and the big one is near San Diego,

2282
02:17:41.381 --> 02:17:44.080
right on the ocean.
Right on the ocean guys,

2283
02:17:44.081 --> 02:17:47.440
there's photos of guys surfing and right behind them you see this nuclear

2284
02:17:47.441 --> 02:17:52.080
fucking power plant and it's like what?
That's crazy.
It's amazing.
And

2285
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.500
<v 0>do you know how what crazy bad lands it's going to be between San Diego and</v>

2286
02:17:57.501 --> 02:18:00.230
Mexico?
If that reactor black,

2287
02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:03.950
that reactor when it goes black and then the guard goes down,

2288
02:18:03.951 --> 02:18:07.040
everybody moves out of the border.
There's nobody watching the border.

2289
02:18:07.041 --> 02:18:11.770
So Tiawana all of a sudden become San Diego in a flood of humanity.

2290
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:15.500
Reactors melting down.
Yeah.
There's people that are living in San Diego,

2291
02:18:15.501 --> 02:18:20.501
especially like in La Jolla and he's fucking fantastic mansions and they are 20

2292
02:18:20.690 --> 02:18:24.680
minutes,
half an hour Max away from Tiawana.

2293
02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:30.780
What all you have to do is get your fucking car from your mansion and in a half

2294
02:18:31.550 --> 02:18:35.090
an hour you can be in one of the scariest cities on the planet.

2295
02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:40.970
You know some the tomatoes are coming in.
We've got tomatoes,

2296
02:18:40.971 --> 02:18:45.380
our own tomatoes for our salad for lunch.
That's wonderful.

2297
02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:47.810
I'm going to shopping.
I'm going to take the poodle.

2298
02:18:47.930 --> 02:18:52.670
She's taken the poodle shopping,
walking down the street and 20 minutes away,

2299
02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:56.480
people are selling their children.
Oregon's left the right,

2300
02:18:56.540 --> 02:19:00.350
Oregon's left and right.
Violence everywhere.

2301
02:19:00.410 --> 02:19:04.370
Headless police officer's stacked,
legalize and coat.

2302
02:19:04.390 --> 02:19:07.910
Taco stand,
total anarchy.
Well,

2303
02:19:07.911 --> 02:19:11.630
they've decriminalized everything.
They've decriminalized every fucking drug.

2304
02:19:11.660 --> 02:19:14.300
Good for you.
People don't know if you want to get fucked up.
If you're,

2305
02:19:14.460 --> 02:19:18.110
if you're not scared,
if you ain't scared,
homie,
go to Mexico,
go to Mexico.

2306
02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:22.800
You just got to find the right gardener.
Find the right dude.
You know,

2307
02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:26.990
it was working.
Go to one of those resorts and uh,
the,
the,
the Gardner that looks,

2308
02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.070
you know,
the gardener,
it looks like the cool guy.
That's still my friend,

2309
02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:35.810
my friend.
Um,
yeah.
Know your country has a deep history of mushrooms.

2310
02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:39.830
You're your people.
Embrace this.
Yeah.

2311
02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:44.450
How was a Gringo like myself?
Get Ahold of such a thing.

2312
02:19:44.670 --> 02:19:47.720
Yeah.
Yeah,
but it's not worth it.
So dangerous.

2313
02:19:47.721 --> 02:19:51.500
They just found another bunch of dead people and Poco just giant piles of bodies

2314
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:54.050
down so crazy.
They're just killing each other.

2315
02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:58.190
There's way more people have died over there that American troops in Afghanistan

2316
02:19:58.191 --> 02:20:02.210
and Iraq,
they said that the death toll from the drug war is somewhere around,

2317
02:20:02.390 --> 02:20:04.850
it was somewhere around 28,000.

2318
02:20:04.851 --> 02:20:08.890
Now that's like the imagine 28,000 bodies stacked on top of each other.

2319
02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:12.740
They would know it's not working anymore.
I mean,
it's not even a drug war.

2320
02:20:12.741 --> 02:20:15.550
It's about the war of the,

2321
02:20:15.820 --> 02:20:18.600
<v 5>it's a civil war going on there.</v>

2322
02:20:18.601 --> 02:20:22.320
It's about territory and power and money just like every other war.

2323
02:20:22.321 --> 02:20:27.200
And we've demonized this because their commerce is drugs and we,

2324
02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:31.050
we buy from them and we kind of use their native industry to,

2325
02:20:31.650 --> 02:20:36.510
<v 0>uh,
perpetuate this civil war.
That bomb that you just showed in the background,</v>

2326
02:20:36.511 --> 02:20:39.960
the bombing of Hiroshima in the water,
the one that blew up in the water.

2327
02:20:40.350 --> 02:20:44.960
This is just showing a collection of tons of different,
uh,
nuclear explosions.

2328
02:20:44.970 --> 02:20:49.260
It's just from the beginning.
Did you rewind it?
No.
There's one,

2329
02:20:49.261 --> 02:20:52.170
if you can find it where they want,
it doesn't matter.
But they blew up one,
right?

2330
02:20:52.171 --> 02:20:54.170
The ocean to the testing and the ocean.
Yeah.

2331
02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:57.510
They did a testing and the ocean and it was fucking insane.

2332
02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:02.340
The water shot up like a mile into the sky.
It's insane.
It's so beautiful.

2333
02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:07.220
So destructive but so incredible and beautiful at the same time as much.
Yeah.

2334
02:21:07.230 --> 02:21:11.920
These,
these crazy ass holes looking at this one.

2335
02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:15.240
Look at that.
So this isn't this what killing the water for real John Wayne.

2336
02:21:15.241 --> 02:21:16.860
Basically this,
no,
not this one.

2337
02:21:17.310 --> 02:21:21.270
John Wayne got killed by the one that was in the desert.
Right,
right.
Man,

2338
02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:25.050
it's amazing man that we've created something that does that.
And by the way,

2339
02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:26.310
we do it way better now.

2340
02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:29.760
The new ones are way stronger when they're coming out with new ones.

2341
02:21:29.850 --> 02:21:33.360
They were able to contain anti-matter for 16 seconds the other day.
Wow.

2342
02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:38.390
I don't know what that means.
No,
but I know that,
you know,
I've heard,
uh,

2343
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:42.150
there's been development there where they're trying to develop an anti matter

2344
02:21:42.151 --> 02:21:42.750
weapon.

2345
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:45.720
So if they're trying to develop an anti matter weapon and they been able to

2346
02:21:45.721 --> 02:21:47.640
contain matter for 16 seconds,

2347
02:21:48.210 --> 02:21:50.720
it's very possible they're eventually going to come up with something.

2348
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:53.100
They can actually harness that shit somehow.

2349
02:21:53.130 --> 02:21:57.320
I don't even understand what anti matter is.
It just,
it causes matter to a,

2350
02:21:57.350 --> 02:22:02.140
it's not matter.
Yes.
Hates matter.
Matter Hates Mamet.
It causes matters

2351
02:22:04.110 --> 02:22:08.130
and it just fucks matter up something that's like a Nigga Kryptonite for matter.

2352
02:22:09.310 --> 02:22:14.170
Is that what it is?
I think so.
Basically well anti matter is uh,

2353
02:22:14.930 --> 02:22:18.230
<v 5>a physics term isn't it?
And that's what they're,
their military,</v>

2354
02:22:18.231 --> 02:22:21.770
the way we're talking about is how the military is developing it and harnessing

2355
02:22:21.771 --> 02:22:26.070
it to basically use it as a weapon and

2356
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:30.030
<v 0>some point,
I think that's how all things get funded there.
You know,
it has to be,</v>

2357
02:22:30.031 --> 02:22:32.250
there has to be some potential for weaponry.

2358
02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:37.170
And you like the large Hadron collider in that court glue on plasma.

2359
02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:41.550
Incredibly dense,
40 billion tons sugar cube size.

2360
02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:43.350
Why would they make something like that?

2361
02:22:43.351 --> 02:22:45.210
Cause it would be the most awesome bullet ever.

2362
02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:50.760
Did you imagine you shot a bullet and 40 billion tons and that bullet hits your

2363
02:22:51.391 --> 02:22:54.840
city.
Can I take care of you buddy?
Hey,
where's that city?

2364
02:22:54.841 --> 02:22:58.290
It's not even here anymore.
Why is there a new ocean in its place?

2365
02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:01.560
That's just anti matter.
Yeah.
I mean,
could you imagine,

2366
02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:04.680
could you imagine if they come up with something that literally knocks off giant

2367
02:23:04.681 --> 02:23:09.510
chunks of the earth?
Just like an apple.
It took a,
you know,

2368
02:23:09.511 --> 02:23:10.980
someone took a slice out of it.

2369
02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:15.300
Pretty much what happens and that why we have moons and,
yeah,
right,
right.

2370
02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:18.410
That's the number one theory is earth one in earth too,
but it's,

2371
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:19.470
it's a collision.

2372
02:23:19.650 --> 02:23:24.060
That earth was actually hit by something and that it was so fucking big.

2373
02:23:24.061 --> 02:23:24.990
Whatever it is,
it hit us.

2374
02:23:24.991 --> 02:23:29.600
It broke off a giant chunk and created the moon blocked off forcible.

2375
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:34.110
Yeah.
Very positive.
Walker.
Cow Count wants to play slot machine now.

2376
02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:36.690
Yeah,
you cancer are annoying.
They're a little needy.

2377
02:23:37.530 --> 02:23:40.240
Like that's annoying to my cats.
Needy as funny.

2378
02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:43.960
My cat is not allowed in the room while the podcasts is going on anymore because

2379
02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:47.980
she's,
she's rude.
She's,
it's always about her as she meows a lot.
Yeah.

2380
02:23:48.090 --> 02:23:51.060
My cat meows a lot.
She wants attention.
She'll sit up on my lap,

2381
02:23:51.090 --> 02:23:55.290
just start me out on like right in the mic man.
That shit's rude.

2382
02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:59.580
<v 6>We got this pac man machine in the other room that I got and my cat's gotten to</v>

2383
02:23:59.581 --> 02:24:04.450
the point where it loves to,
uh,
chase the ghost on it.
So it's learned how to,

2384
02:24:04.490 --> 02:24:08.700
uh,
hit the player one button so it starts the game and it just sits there and

2385
02:24:08.701 --> 02:24:12.960
chases the ghost on the PAC man.
And then it's annoying as fuck.

2386
02:24:12.961 --> 02:24:15.790
Cause you're just like laying here watching TV and suddenly here don't,

2387
02:24:15.810 --> 02:24:19.440
I mean you're an earner.
You need to make your video.
Yeah.
The video though.

2388
02:24:19.441 --> 02:24:23.010
So you're the king of cat videos and uh,
he's just too busy.

2389
02:24:23.390 --> 02:24:25.520
<v 0>But you need to do that.
That's something you needed to do.</v>

2390
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:28.720
You need to trick that cat and the doing it for you now because it might be one

2391
02:24:28.721 --> 02:24:29.181
of those things you'll,

2392
02:24:29.181 --> 02:24:31.990
he does like once every three days and if you're not there when it happens,

2393
02:24:33.070 --> 02:24:37.300
how often does he do it?
Every,
every day.
He,
that's his name.
Yeah,
I'll do it.

2394
02:24:37.420 --> 02:24:38.110
Set up some,

2395
02:24:38.110 --> 02:24:43.110
set up some motion detector camera right on that it just come on your fucking Mr

2396
02:24:43.181 --> 02:24:47.710
Johnny I spy.
You know how to do this.
He doesn't like the slot machine though,

2397
02:24:47.711 --> 02:24:50.020
cause it can't figure out how to put coins and to start it.

2398
02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:54.930
That slot machine hookers on it.
There's a little girls in our underwear there

2399
02:24:56.650 --> 02:24:59.890
and then you're a little Hitler cat.
Yeah.
You Man.

2400
02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:03.580
Boy you think this fucking shows over folks.
They're like,
we petered out.

2401
02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:07.150
I think we hit the end like Brian's cap talk.
That's all it took.

2402
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:11.110
He just pulled his fucking an apocalypse.

2403
02:25:11.140 --> 02:25:15.520
Mexico anti matter and he's like,
yeah,
I'm,
yeah,
all cats are fluffy

2404
02:25:17.370 --> 02:25:20.500
video games.
Don't go to Mexico.
I guess.
Whatever.
Whatever.

2405
02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:25.060
What are you going to move when the shit hits the fan?
Do you have a spot?

2406
02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:29.230
You know,
I'm just going to stay where I am and fucking watch it.
Ride it out.

2407
02:25:29.231 --> 02:25:33.880
Ride it out,
man.
Beans.
Yeah,
I just don't think there's anywhere great to go.
I do.

2408
02:25:33.881 --> 02:25:36.910
I have a,
yeah,
got to talking to that microphone.
Sorry about that.
Yeah,

2409
02:25:36.911 --> 02:25:39.100
I do not like that.
There you go.

2410
02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:42.160
Felon all so no,

2411
02:25:42.161 --> 02:25:46.300
I mean I don't really have any plans because where are you really going to go to

2412
02:25:46.301 --> 02:25:48.530
hang out with the fucking desert?
People are,

2413
02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:52.270
you know that know the terrain better than you.
There's going to be Mad Max,

2414
02:25:52.271 --> 02:25:56.470
right?
Yeah.
I'll probably the lands between Santa Monica or San Diego and Mexico.

2415
02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:59.830
If I had to really slowly,
if shit was going down,
I'd go up into the mountains.

2416
02:25:59.831 --> 02:26:03.160
Probably could you have and how crazy it would be if there was something that

2417
02:26:03.161 --> 02:26:07.780
was so serious that the border didn't exist anymore and the borders were opened

2418
02:26:07.781 --> 02:26:10.330
up and everybody from Tiawana just came running over.

2419
02:26:10.390 --> 02:26:15.190
That's the John Lennon Song.
Imagine.
Imagine there was no countries.

2420
02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:19.910
Well,
imagine you live in Canada.
That's what I imagined.
I imagined him.

2421
02:26:19.911 --> 02:26:23.350
I'll give some moving to Toronto.
I'm going to learn how to shovel snow again.

2422
02:26:23.380 --> 02:26:25.510
Canada's one.
Canada is amazing,

2423
02:26:25.511 --> 02:26:27.490
but you can't even get into Canada if you have a fucking,

2424
02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:31.090
if you put gum under a table,
they won't let you in Canada.

2425
02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:34.080
Even your kids have to have passports.
We just went and got my kids,
uh,

2426
02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:38.860
two passports because they can't get in without it anymore.
I've got a 18,

2427
02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:42.850
19 month old girl and a seven year old boy and they both,
you,

2428
02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:47.530
no one can get across the border without a passport.
Wow.
Even babies,
even babies.

2429
02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.510
Wow.
That's amazing man.
Yup.
Yeah.
Well that's why it's so cool up there.
I mean,

2430
02:26:52.511 --> 02:26:53.344
Canada has,

2431
02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:58.240
I would say 10 to 20% less douche bags per capita than the United States to us.

2432
02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:00.530
Right.
They're very polite.
I mean,
my wife and I,
and they're,

2433
02:27:00.540 --> 02:27:04.930
they're just great people.
I mean,
eh,
but there's still this sort of arrogance.

2434
02:27:04.931 --> 02:27:08.530
I mean,
they were watching America like,
you know,
you people are fucking crazy.

2435
02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:12.210
They're just,
could you imagine being connected to the,
the nuttiest?

2436
02:27:12.250 --> 02:27:16.690
It's really like us and Mexico.
Mexico,
look at Mexican,
but no,
but no,

2437
02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:17.500
because you know,

2438
02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:22.500
obviously it's safer than that in most spot America is getting a little more

2439
02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:24.130
violent and dangerous.

2440
02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:26.800
We were talking yesterday about Detroit and about how nutty it is.

2441
02:27:26.801 --> 02:27:30.820
A Detroit has 47% illiteracy rate and that,
you know,

2442
02:27:30.821 --> 02:27:33.540
when you're living in a place like that,
it's,
you know,
it's,

2443
02:27:33.541 --> 02:27:37.480
it's really scary because information doesn't pass along anymore.
Yeah.
And La,

2444
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:38.020
I mean,

2445
02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:43.020
50% of our high school kids don't graduate and the Lha 50% 50% crazy,

2446
02:27:43.331 --> 02:27:45.880
3% drop out or get a GED,

2447
02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:51.630
47% of the kids who go through La Public Unified School district,
uh,

2448
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:55.540
don't graduate.
That's terrifying.
Yeah.
Even high school.
Yeah.

2449
02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:57.100
I don't even get out of high school.
Nope.

2450
02:27:57.310 --> 02:27:59.980
That makes you feel like you just got to get out.
You got to get up.

2451
02:27:59.981 --> 02:28:01.600
Don't get Adam Carolla started on this.

2452
02:28:02.470 --> 02:28:05.550
People are starting charter schools and you know,
they're trying to,

2453
02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:09.760
if we don't educate our,
our children properly in general,

2454
02:28:09.761 --> 02:28:13.090
but I think homeschooling makes a lot of fucking sense nowadays.

2455
02:28:13.091 --> 02:28:17.950
I think just just teach your kids yourself on this would be a better idea,

2456
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:22.730
but your kids are socially ill adjusted then.
Yeah.
You know,
it's just the fact,

2457
02:28:22.731 --> 02:28:27.620
I've known a lot of homeschool kids in my life and they're just socially awkward

2458
02:28:27.621 --> 02:28:29.990
and you know one,
you know,
you don't resent them for it,

2459
02:28:29.991 --> 02:28:34.280
but they just have a hard time in groups and paying attention.

2460
02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:35.240
It's part of life.

2461
02:28:35.241 --> 02:28:37.670
You're supposed to be hanging around with someone your age and you know,

2462
02:28:37.671 --> 02:28:41.750
and all figuring shit out together.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's supposed to be,

2463
02:28:41.751 --> 02:28:42.950
that's,
that's a part of it all.

2464
02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:47.780
The problem is when you have 50% that aren't graduating and the kind of climate

2465
02:28:47.781 --> 02:28:52.640
that that creates,
50% of don't give a fuck 50% that are just causing trouble.

2466
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:57.110
50% that are just,
you know,
just eking through life.
Yeah,
it's,

2467
02:28:57.650 --> 02:29:00.020
it's tough.
I mean,
but a lot of rich refrigerator,

2468
02:29:00.021 --> 02:29:03.650
that noise now it's outside air conditioner and the nailers.

2469
02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:07.460
What kind of a fucking studio?
This ghetto,

2470
02:29:07.461 --> 02:29:09.640
I'm thinking about moving actually soon.
Are you going to,

2471
02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:12.260
you've been here for awhile and then here too.
I'm just,
I,

2472
02:29:12.370 --> 02:29:14.870
this time when you move you should probably not tell people where you're moving

2473
02:29:14.871 --> 02:29:19.100
to.
Yeah.
I just,
I'm done with not having one bathroom is just awful.

2474
02:29:19.101 --> 02:29:22.130
You can't fucking have one bath.
We can't have a studio.

2475
02:29:22.131 --> 02:29:25.130
Also people coming to your house so much to Andy.

2476
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:30.130
Dick been showing up in any decks in the kitchen for Andy did.

2477
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:36.500
He got arrested shortly after show.
It's amazing.

2478
02:29:36.501 --> 02:29:39.980
I never would have thought then we'll decide happened actually at the

2479
02:29:39.981 --> 02:29:43.490
conversation you had,
I saw that podcast and he's like crazy sometimes.
You know,

2480
02:29:43.491 --> 02:29:47.240
sometimes I'm sober,
sometimes I'm not.
Sometimes I'm gay,
sometimes I'm straight.

2481
02:29:47.241 --> 02:29:48.051
He was like whatever.

2482
02:29:48.051 --> 02:29:53.051
I just don't really embrace any particular idea of how I am and what I believe

2483
02:29:53.721 --> 02:29:54.980
in sticking to his guns.

2484
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:58.580
I was bullying and we work together really so ridiculous.

2485
02:29:58.581 --> 02:30:01.250
He was so out of control and you just had to yell at him like,

2486
02:30:01.251 --> 02:30:06.251
don't touch my Dick [inaudible] every day.

2487
02:30:10.821 --> 02:30:12.970
Living like,

2488
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:17.120
Oh made everyday living hell cause I would threaten them.

2489
02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:19.190
Don't pull your dick out.
Stop it.

2490
02:30:22.460 --> 02:30:24.920
I loved it.
You did love that show.

2491
02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:28.800
I think it was just funny seeing it was you out of your element for,
for the,

2492
02:30:28.970 --> 02:30:33.230
for a weird deal.
You have to manage him.
He's dangerous.
Irrational.

2493
02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:36.620
He's nuts.
What are you,
when he started talking about being attracted to me,

2494
02:30:36.621 --> 02:30:39.450
I was like,
oh Jesus,
how such?
Yeah,

2495
02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:41.750
she knows how to make you uncomfortable though.

2496
02:30:41.751 --> 02:30:45.200
I could tell by watching that he was actually more than anyone I've ever seen

2497
02:30:45.201 --> 02:30:47.690
and we've known each other for a long time.

2498
02:30:47.691 --> 02:30:51.880
I've never seen you as uncomfortable as you were during that change.

2499
02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:57.780
How you know he has a thing for you or use to and you're just like [inaudible]

2500
02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:03.620
never seen you at a loss.
Also one of the funniest people I've ever worked with,

2501
02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:07.160
he's very,
very talented and I almost think that you,

2502
02:31:07.161 --> 02:31:12.161
you almost have to be kind of crazy to be that funny because I'm telling you,

2503
02:31:12.621 --> 02:31:17.450
we did some scenes together and Andy made me laugh harder than anybody I've ever

2504
02:31:17.451 --> 02:31:18.680
worked with ever by far.

2505
02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:22.890
There was more scenes with him where I had to stop because I was laughing and I

2506
02:31:22.891 --> 02:31:26.190
couldn't go on.
I fucked up the scene there.
I used to happen all the time.

2507
02:31:26.370 --> 02:31:29.850
It was so,
he was,
he's really good.
He was a really good,

2508
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:35.030
like comedic actor and I think it's almost like to be that character that he

2509
02:31:35.701 --> 02:31:39.000
was,
you almost have to be completely wild in real life.

2510
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:41.610
You know why you keep fucking with the satellite?

2511
02:31:41.650 --> 02:31:45.250
I'm talking he needed more up and down,
left,
left.

2512
02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:47.050
It's only the headphone Jack something wrong.

2513
02:31:47.051 --> 02:31:49.060
I heard that wasn't my faith this now,
you know,

2514
02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:53.820
I always think that whenever I see anybody that's brilliant but crazy.

2515
02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:58.920
I almost say I think you have to be crazy to be brilliant,
you know?

2516
02:31:59.250 --> 02:32:02.790
Yeah.
I think I really do.
He,
the way he was nurtured as a child,

2517
02:32:02.791 --> 02:32:07.620
probably doesn't remember it.
He doesn't remember anything before like age eight.

2518
02:32:07.770 --> 02:32:10.230
It's kind of like he's a product of his environment.
I mean,

2519
02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:15.090
just as much as any of us are close.
That's probably an interesting subject.

2520
02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:16.140
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

2521
02:32:16.141 --> 02:32:18.690
no one knows what kind of fucking hand you're going to be dealt with born into

2522
02:32:18.691 --> 02:32:22.860
this world.
And oftentimes it's a fucking mess.
But it's just,
um,
that's so true.

2523
02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:25.020
When I see people and I see fascinating people,

2524
02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:28.700
I always wonder how much is nurture?
How much is nature?
You know,
what,

2525
02:32:28.701 --> 02:32:31.560
what does it take to create a person like this?
You know,

2526
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:33.360
and it went and talented people,

2527
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:37.950
the most talented comedians that I know are the most out of control.
You know,

2528
02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:41.670
like Joey Diaz keeps it together today,
like this taste.

2529
02:32:41.671 --> 02:32:44.100
But I've never met a more out of control person in my life.

2530
02:32:44.430 --> 02:32:48.210
And I've also never met a funnier person in my life,
you know?
I mean,
he's,

2531
02:32:48.240 --> 02:32:52.050
he's the funniest guy I've ever met.
He was,
he's,
he's ridiculous

2532
02:32:53.350 --> 02:32:56.980
<v 5>bar in La the other night and he was just standing on the stage,
you know,</v>

2533
02:32:57.010 --> 02:32:58.510
everyone's super baked.

2534
02:32:58.511 --> 02:33:02.800
So no one really got the jokes until like three seconds afterwards and he's just

2535
02:33:02.860 --> 02:33:05.140
going mad.
It was,
it was a beautiful thing.
And he's like,

2536
02:33:05.350 --> 02:33:09.950
this is the fucking wait house.
And he's like losing his mind sweating.

2537
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:14.680
And just hilarious.
But no one was getting it because everyone's so high.

2538
02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:17.300
Oh,
it was hilarious.
Super

2539
02:33:17.320 --> 02:33:21.710
<v 0>high crowd is a different animal.
I've only done a few.
I've done a few of those.</v>

2540
02:33:21.711 --> 02:33:25.160
Uh,
they used to do medical marijuana shows at the comedy store.
I've done those,

2541
02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:28.370
but they weren't nearly as intense as the one I did in Toronto where you're

2542
02:33:28.371 --> 02:33:32.510
allowed to smoke in the club.
So the club was filled with bongs.

2543
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:35.870
I mean it was ridiculous.
It was so thick.

2544
02:33:35.871 --> 02:33:39.530
It was like doing comedy inside a cloud and I'm not bullshitting.

2545
02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:44.570
My throat was killing me the next day because I was essentially just breathing

2546
02:33:44.571 --> 02:33:47.090
in pot.
There was no air left in the room.

2547
02:33:47.091 --> 02:33:49.480
It was like we were just redistributing each other's pot,

2548
02:33:49.481 --> 02:33:54.310
smoke recycled breath everywhere.
Yeah,
it was,
that was,

2549
02:33:54.311 --> 02:33:56.530
uh,
that was completely ridiculous.
And it was,

2550
02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:59.100
I felt like shit the next day after that,
my throat,

2551
02:34:00.010 --> 02:34:04.610
because it was smoky in there.
If you're going to have a fucking look,

2552
02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:09.110
I go to a cigar bar cause I'm fucking high roller like that.
I go and I was like,

2553
02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:13.730
oh blah.
I would talk about scripts.
This is what everybody does.
The Cigar Bar,

2554
02:34:13.731 --> 02:34:17.770
they all sit down with scripts and go over this guy and [inaudible] and he's

2555
02:34:17.771 --> 02:34:18.040
going to be

2556
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.940
<v 5>the lead.
The black white girls like them.
But they've got air systems.
Exactly.</v>

2557
02:34:21.941 --> 02:34:23.950
That's my point.
While we're smoking these cigars,

2558
02:34:24.130 --> 02:34:26.320
it said that the have Havana room and there's,

2559
02:34:26.321 --> 02:34:29.020
there's these things that suck air out of the room.

2560
02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:31.990
So it's always air conditioned and it's always clean.

2561
02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:34.900
So even though you're sitting there with a big fat stokey the air,

2562
02:34:34.901 --> 02:34:37.210
you're smoking,
breathing,
it doesn't suck.

2563
02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:39.640
That's the way you're supposed to do it.
But these fucking hippies,

2564
02:34:40.130 --> 02:34:43.720
they just some more here man with smoker in here.
You didn't even have a window.

2565
02:34:43.721 --> 02:34:46.630
You fuck.
It's like what Amsterdam is like.
Everyone's like,
oh,

2566
02:34:46.631 --> 02:34:49.930
you got to go to Amsterdam and I've got to go fucking sit in their hash bars and

2567
02:34:49.931 --> 02:34:51.070
try it out over there.
I'm like,
why?

2568
02:34:51.071 --> 02:34:55.830
So I can sit there and breathe second hand breath from all these fucking growth

2569
02:34:56.380 --> 02:35:00.700
forest and people do the bar,
the bud tender,
this place,
real cool guy.

2570
02:35:01.150 --> 02:35:03.970
But he's serving water.
You know,
like little cups.

2571
02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:07.960
Everyone had a Dixie Cup that was see through and they were pouring water out of

2572
02:35:07.961 --> 02:35:11.950
jugs into this cup and everyone's got the exact same cop.
And I was like,
boy,

2573
02:35:11.951 --> 02:35:14.190
this would be a great place to roofie somebody.

2574
02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:17.970
<v 6>No,
but if I was</v>

2575
02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:21.270
<v 5>go on on the TV,
Huh?
I don't know.</v>

2576
02:35:22.110 --> 02:35:26.940
<v 6>But it made no sense at all because it seemed like the beverages would be the</v>

2577
02:35:26.941 --> 02:35:30.770
most important.
Like you would make so much money from that.
Like you're,
you're,

2578
02:35:31.310 --> 02:35:35.000
these people are like totally stoned and totally fucked up on Hash.

2579
02:35:35.090 --> 02:35:36.720
They're going to be hungry and thirsty.

2580
02:35:36.721 --> 02:35:39.510
If you want these people to stay here and fucking make some money,

2581
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:43.120
sell some $20 ice teas and we'll have to,
I hope

2582
02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:44.620
<v 5>they're listening to this.
Yeah,</v>

2583
02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:49.990
well didn't they just say that now you can't have tourists and I'm in Amsterdam.

2584
02:35:49.991 --> 02:35:53.500
Amsterdam.
Yeah.
I can't smoke pot.
In September of this year,

2585
02:35:53.501 --> 02:35:55.810
they've passed some sort of ordinance.
These things come and go.

2586
02:35:55.811 --> 02:35:59.530
They don't always last.
But yeah,
they,
they've basically banned tourists,

2587
02:35:59.590 --> 02:36:03.610
locals only,
which is fine.
And I've been there many times and it's kind of,

2588
02:36:04.210 --> 02:36:06.610
you go there once you experience it,
that's cool.

2589
02:36:06.611 --> 02:36:08.710
But it's just a smokey room where they sell weed.

2590
02:36:08.711 --> 02:36:11.620
I think what we have in California here is vastly superior.

2591
02:36:11.621 --> 02:36:16.390
We have many better strains.
We have all of the Dutch strains,

2592
02:36:16.391 --> 02:36:19.630
all the Nevilles haze in the hybrids that have come from the Netherlands,

2593
02:36:19.631 --> 02:36:21.430
white widow and originated there.

2594
02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:25.930
We've got all those strange strains and all of Canada and what we've created

2595
02:36:25.931 --> 02:36:29.450
here in the states,
and it's clean.
Usually with the exception of this place,
you,

2596
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:32.190
you don't have to breathe other people smoke and you know,
it's,

2597
02:36:32.191 --> 02:36:35.140
it's just a better vibe down here,
the medical community.
And I like,

2598
02:36:35.170 --> 02:36:37.270
I like this much,
much more.

2599
02:36:37.330 --> 02:36:41.040
People in other states don't have any idea how huge it is.
Oh,

2600
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:42.430
it's so huge.

2601
02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:45.520
It's something that's kept off the mainstream news for the most part,

2602
02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:49.520
but it really has revolutionized the city of La.
Yeah.
I mean it's this,

2603
02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:53.020
this is a different fucking city.
There's all a lot more stoners.

2604
02:36:53.380 --> 02:36:57.910
There's a lot more and it's easy access,
openly discussed as well.
I mean,
I,

2605
02:36:57.911 --> 02:37:01.210
I'd talked about it with my fucking nanny the other day.
I mean,
it's like,

2606
02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:03.400
it's okay.
It's how it should be.

2607
02:37:03.401 --> 02:37:06.600
You have to be very responsible though with the way you do it here.
And it's,

2608
02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:09.190
it's a clean,
a positive experience.

2609
02:37:09.191 --> 02:37:12.640
I mean it is for the most part how it's supposed to be and that's what it would

2610
02:37:12.641 --> 02:37:16.070
be if it was all legal.
You fucks if it was all legal

2611
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:17.810
<v 0>and you could buy it anywhere and you know,</v>

2612
02:37:17.811 --> 02:37:19.250
just had to have a license to sell it,

2613
02:37:19.251 --> 02:37:22.640
just like you have to have licensed to sell liquor.
It would be amazing.

2614
02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:26.150
It'd be so much tax money that would be generated from this.
It would,
it would,

2615
02:37:26.151 --> 02:37:29.870
it would revolutionize the,
the culture,
the way people interact with each other,

2616
02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:33.980
make people so much nicer.
Yup.
But it's happening.
It's happening slowly.
Right?

2617
02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:37.810
<v 5>It is.
I mean,
we're seeing it here where at the very forefront and,
uh,</v>

2618
02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:41.290
I would rather,
you know,
come to La for a,

2619
02:37:41.430 --> 02:37:43.950
this experience and then go to Amsterdam in any case.

2620
02:37:43.951 --> 02:37:45.700
But Colorado has got the same thing.
Yeah.

2621
02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:49.910
Colorado right now was just like this Washington,
I guess Jason,
uh,

2622
02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:54.950
mute was telling me that they opened up a medical community shops and co-ops,

2623
02:37:55.740 --> 02:37:56.910
uh,
up in Seattle now

2624
02:37:58.270 --> 02:38:00.610
<v 0>30,
around Seattle.
So progressive.
It's amazing.</v>

2625
02:38:00.611 --> 02:38:04.240
They'd be so far behind San Francisco because San Francisco and Oakland,
I mean,

2626
02:38:04.241 --> 02:38:07.320
they've had that shit forever now,
you know?
I mean,
they've,
they're,

2627
02:38:07.321 --> 02:38:11.260
they're just open as fuck about it up there.
Yup.
Hmm.
What's the problem there is,

2628
02:38:11.261 --> 02:38:13.000
there is no problem,
man.
It's just,

2629
02:38:13.001 --> 02:38:16.420
it's a disgusting situation where everybody has to deal with the fact that it's

2630
02:38:16.421 --> 02:38:19.420
still illegal federally.
It's just so stomach turning.

2631
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:24.720
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean,
I think the,
the real point of it all is it,</v>

2632
02:38:24.721 --> 02:38:28.480
it would be nice to be able to use hemp for things to be nice,

2633
02:38:28.481 --> 02:38:32.310
to be able to have long lasting,
durable goods.
Yeah.

2634
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:34.240
But it's amazing how many people

2635
02:38:34.290 --> 02:38:37.080
<v 0>don't even know about that.
What did it makes?
Superior paper,</v>

2636
02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:39.680
superior building products.
It's incredibly light,

2637
02:38:39.681 --> 02:38:42.830
but amazingly strong doesn't have to grow for 20 years.
Like a tree.

2638
02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:44.690
It grows quick and it's,

2639
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:49.870
the fiber is like fucking alien fiber took the most amazing fibers for making

2640
02:38:49.911 --> 02:38:51.600
clothes and paper way.

2641
02:38:51.601 --> 02:38:56.120
Superior paper were used to paper that just rips real easy papers like way

2642
02:38:56.121 --> 02:38:59.510
stronger than cotton paper then rather tree paper.

2643
02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:02.220
But all the hemp again now has to be imported from Canada,

2644
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:06.370
has regulated and licensed so stupid.
You can't,
hamp can't even get you high now.

2645
02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:09.590
You know,
there's people don't understand it's so it's a cousin of marijuana.

2646
02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:13.610
I mean it's,
it's,
you know,
it's related to marijuana but it's not,

2647
02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:15.050
doesn't have any THC in it.

2648
02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:18.890
They grow that shit just to make clothes out of it and just to make sales and

2649
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:22.280
you know,
they did that forever.
George Washington fucking grow it.

2650
02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:27.590
The end definitely was tired of that.
That stoner ramble.

2651
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:32.580
<v 5>Yeah.
Hey man,
we can make like oil out of it man.</v>

2652
02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:37.540
Biodiesel man.
Well we were,
we were talking about uh,

2653
02:39:37.710 --> 02:39:40.870
Amsterdam and I'll have to tell you I'll fire,
but uh,
the crazy,

2654
02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:43.980
it's cold and there's whores everywhere.
Is that good?

2655
02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:49.140
That pretty much sums it up.
And,
and frank was there.
And Holla at your boy.
Um,

2656
02:39:49.170 --> 02:39:53.400

2663
02:40:15.091 --> 02:40:18.180

that's it.

2664
