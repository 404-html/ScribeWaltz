<v Speaker 1>stress like they think of stress as</v>
<v Speaker 1>being bills.</v>

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>They think of stress as being traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no stresses,</v>

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

<v Speaker 1>your job,</v>

<v Speaker 1>work at the end of the day and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weight lifted off your shoulders,</v>

10
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>that means you're in a bad job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta figure out a way where you</v>

11
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's possible,</v>

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.830

<v Speaker 1>find that way.</v>

13

<v Speaker 1>together make me want to fucking jump</v>

16
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>off a roof on Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would literally get depressed on</v>

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.560
<v Speaker 1>do chores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk cows,</v>

118
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.530
<v Speaker 1>go to football practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go home,</v>

120
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>do chores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go up on the mountain,</v>

121
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:55.470
<v Speaker 1>sleep on the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back home.</v>

122
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of how,</v>

123
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.220
<v Speaker 1>how my brothers and I grew up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

124
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just have a yearning for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild.</v>

125
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean there some of the coolest</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that I've had in life have</v>

126
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:10.080
<v Speaker 1>been when I'm by myself and go and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something totally random that,</v>

127
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nobody else would really even think</v>

128
00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:12.901
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

129
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:14.250
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say nobody,</v>

130
00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:17.940
<v Speaker 1>in college I'd drive home two hours to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my folks' house,</v>

132
00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:19.620
<v Speaker 1>then I drive another hour up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>canyon.</v>

133
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.960
<v Speaker 1>By the time I get to the trail head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 11 o'clock at night,</v>

134
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.200
<v Speaker 1>hike in for three or four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find some more sleep,</v>

135
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>get up on top of the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sitting there as,</v>

136
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:30.540
<v Speaker 1>as the sun's coming up and three</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolverines come up,</v>

137
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:32.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and circle the lake and it's like back</v>

138
00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:33.571
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:36.120
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 90s there weren't wolverines in</v>

140
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There weren't supposed to be anyway.</v>

141
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was one of the very first or</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few to actually see wild wolverines</v>

142
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.620
<v Speaker 1>in Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

143
00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:46.950
<v Speaker 1>had I not been there by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced in that,</v>

144
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:47.850
<v Speaker 1>in that canyon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:51.570
<v Speaker 1>if there's other people or other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those wolverines might not have been as</v>

146
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:52.291
<v Speaker 1>comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:55.770
<v Speaker 1>but because I was there by myself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only one there looking down over</v>

148
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:56.790
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that.</v>

149
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of opportunities like that</v>

150
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have someone else there,</v>

151
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>you're focused on the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're focused on,</v>

152
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>your conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your buddies,</v>

153
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>your friends and everything.</v>

154
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really tuned in to what's</v>

155
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not tuned in to your</v>

156
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>surroundings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's certain things that I</v>

157
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 1>think you miss out on when you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people there.</v>

158
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that I don't enjoy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

159
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like when I'm there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a connection,</v>

160
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a connection to the land,</v>

161
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a connection to the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

162
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:28.071
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:29.730
<v Speaker 1>you could bring all of into if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

164
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're a Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>tree hugger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Voodoo type person,</v>

166
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you can bring in the nature and the gods</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that kind of stuff into the</v>

167
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>whole element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that really and truly is what is</v>

168
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're out there with no one but</v>

169
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>yourself and God and his creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

170
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all surrounding you.</v>

171
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And being like that deep in nature where</v>

172
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 1>you're actually a part of it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

173
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no,</v>

174
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>there's no conversations going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conversations there just with</v>

175
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

176
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>

177
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 1>no anchor that brings you back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

178
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>You just seeing wild shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just seeing wildlife.</v>

179
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing animals that would exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way regardless of whether or not</v>

180
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:10.390
<v Speaker 1>you were there or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
