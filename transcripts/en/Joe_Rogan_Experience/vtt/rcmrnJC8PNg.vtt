18
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>You are the ones that who's used to say it on Wikipedia.</v>

21
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:25.981
<v Speaker 1>It's a rumor.</v>

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

25
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.550

<v Speaker 1>Do I now?</v>

27
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Now I think you were the one who told me about Gracie Jujitsu.</v>

28
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.334
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

30
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I remember we connected immediately.</v>

31
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>You show up in those guys are all just low blood sugar and just a bunch of</v>

33
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>actors.</v>

34
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden this guy,</v>

35
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:42.331
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

36
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:42.601

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:42.931
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

38
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:43.651
<v Speaker 1>that guy looks like me,</v>

39
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>but he's thicker and then he looks way more extreme and you had a tank top on</v>

40
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:48.791
<v Speaker 1>and you were like,</v>

41
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>can possibly muster.</v>

42
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.801
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

43
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>that guy looks like he fights and you're like,</v>

44
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

45
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>if I like to fight,</v>

46
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.191
<v Speaker 1>I need to fight.</v>

47
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do I need to be in class,</v>

48
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>otherwise I will end up in jail.</v>

49
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.161
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

50
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>that guy's going to be my friend forever.</v>

51
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>We connected so quick right away with everything,</v>

52
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>every retarded thing.</v>

53
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>We'd love pit bulls and,</v>

54
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

55
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.801
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>

56
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>we both know it's retarded.</v>

57
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.231
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference.</v>

58
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Like all of my extreme macho psycho shit.</v>

59
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I know it's fucked up.</v>

60
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I know my tattoos are fucked up.</v>

61
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I know my neck is too big.</v>

62
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck,</v>

63
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I know my car is too loud.</v>

65
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

66
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>You won't like it.</v>

67
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You've always been my,</v>

68
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>my canary in the coal mine.</v>

69
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.331
<v Speaker 1>You as well.</v>

70
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:24.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>as long as I know you're still out there alive,</v>

72
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:27.500
<v Speaker 1>someone's rocking it the right way.</v>

73
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

74
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy to think that you would ever want to do anything different because</v>

75
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>whatever you've done has made you,</v>

76
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

77
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.171
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

79
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.941
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

81
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry for anybody that ever hurt their feelings,</v>

82
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'm so happy.</v>

83
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Everything turned out the weird turning against you,</v>

84
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.051
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

86
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of that.</v>

87
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that.</v>

88
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.380
<v Speaker 1>As I was thinking of as a,</v>

89
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:43.051
<v Speaker 1>as you were talking,</v>

90
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

91
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time wishing I was somebody else.</v>

92
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm an accurate,</v>

93
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm a comic.</v>

94
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:47.941
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

95
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>that is who I am,</v>

96
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

97
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 1>We don't want a guy who wishes he was,</v>

98
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>who spends a lot of time wishing he was somebody else.</v>

99
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>That's my identity.</v>

100
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Every guy wants an undefeated record.</v>

101
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

102
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.151
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you,</v>

103
00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>that shit ain't good for you.</v>

104
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand what it's like to lose.</v>

105
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.991
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

106
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand failure.</v>

107
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.851
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

108
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to look back in your past at a moment where you fuck</v>

109
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>something up and feel uncomfortable about it and that should provide you with a</v>

110
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of humility and they're just trying to understand that.</v>

111
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I think a man is,</v>

112
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>is the product of what partially a large but largely a product product of of how</v>

113
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>of the actions he chose to take as a response to failure.</v>

114
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.733
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

115
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

116
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.731
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

117
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you learn anything other than the hard way.</v>

118
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

119
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't really,</v>

120
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>you don't really look where we're a strange animal that's dealing with infinite</v>

121
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:40.731
<v Speaker 1>variables and the only way to truly find a focused way through this path is to</v>

122
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:47.121
<v Speaker 1>have accumulated a massive amount of experiences and forged positive information</v>

123
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>and game plans from these experiences and be able to move forward.</v>

124
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>You cannot know it all right away from the get go.</v>

125
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>That's all you can do is control how you,</v>

126
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>how you respond to failure,</v>

127
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>what you choose to do differently or readjusting your approach.</v>

128
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And by the way though,</v>

129
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>the one thing for me is I've learned just to enjoy,</v>

130
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>enjoy that and allow the frustration,</v>

131
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.190
<v Speaker 1>you be able to make fun of yourself when you fuck.</v>

133
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>You guys can do that.</v>

134
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>So huge.</v>

135
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy that's some big,</v>

136
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>so big and then you're great at it.</v>

137
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy recently,</v>

138
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.361
<v Speaker 1>I say recently,</v>

139
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>it was in within the last couple of years.</v>

140
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It was back when,</v>

141
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

142
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.490
<v Speaker 1>legends was at the,</v>

143
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:30.360
<v Speaker 1>the old bomb squad on Santa Monica Boulevard where the two Jimmys.</v>

144
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.151
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

146
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>this guy picked up a hooker.</v>

147
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>He came back from Iraq,</v>

148
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>picked up a hooker,</v>

149
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>turns out the hooker was a dude the had sucked this deck for,</v>

150
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I was a guy,</v>

151
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:40.160
<v Speaker 1>shot him,</v>

152
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

153
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Dumped the body in an alleyway and an alley way,</v>

154
00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>like a movie.</v>

155
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>So the cops apparently see this guy dumped the body,</v>

156
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>the high speed,</v>

157
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.484
<v Speaker 1>chase and sues.</v>

158
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>They chased him all the way up to the desert,</v>

159
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>gets out of the car with his gun suicide by cop.</v>

160
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.700
<v Speaker 1>They shoot him dish.</v>

161
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And all I'm thinking of is this motherfucker,</v>

162
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>if he could just make fun of himself,</v>

163
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.580
<v Speaker 1>would have the best story ever.</v>

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

295
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I looked in her eyes.</v>

296
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 1>She was so hurt his eyes.</v>

297
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 1>He was so like,</v>

298
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:29.601
<v Speaker 1>he was just like,</v>

299
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:33.580
<v Speaker 1>please let this big and I'm such a fucking onstar.</v>

300
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I felt so bad that I go,</v>

301
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I go back in to kiss her.</v>

302
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I kiss her him for another like two seconds,</v>

303
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:41.661
<v Speaker 1>three seconds.</v>

304
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 1>When I go on the lips,</v>

305
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.680
<v Speaker 1>of course food.</v>

306
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.160
<v Speaker 1>You fuckers now listen.</v>

307
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.713

00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:51.340

314
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.170
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I have an old sir.</v>

316
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I have an ulcer in.</v>

317
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Speaker 1>My stomach is killing me.</v>

318
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.190
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

319
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:57.551
<v Speaker 1>you do?</v>

320
00:07:57.551 --> 00:07:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

321
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.291
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

322
00:07:58.291 --> 00:07:58.511
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

323
00:07:58.511 --> 00:07:59.291
<v Speaker 1>do you have to go to the bathroom?</v>

324
00:07:59.291 --> 00:07:59.441
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

325
00:07:59.441 --> 00:07:59.501
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

326
00:07:59.501 --> 00:07:59.571
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

327
00:07:59.571 --> 00:07:59.740
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

328
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I just have to.</v>

329
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I have a very bad old sir.</v>

330
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it just keeps,</v>

331
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.450
<v Speaker 1>so I want to protect her feelings.</v>

332
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.411
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad.</v>

333
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Him,</v>

334
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.640
<v Speaker 1>his shit,</v>

335
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>his ass.</v>

336
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.220
<v Speaker 1>That's how I got out and I left and I never,</v>

337
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I did not come back to that quote.</v>

338
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you went back in and you got to be,</v>

339
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be rude.</v>

340
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.393
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

341
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.471
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

342
00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:19.771
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

343
00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:21.150
<v Speaker 1>We've been the person,</v>

344
00:08:21.151 --> 00:08:24.720
<v Speaker 1>some person pretended to be a girl and tricked you into kissing him.</v>

345
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Never even told you something.</v>

346
00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 1>That for a lot of guys would make them violent.</v>

347
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I would a gay band for a lot of guys.</v>

348
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.133
<v Speaker 1>What'd you relive?</v>

349
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I would've been mad if that,</v>

350
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.240
<v Speaker 1>if this person [inaudible] guys,</v>

351
00:08:36.241 --> 00:08:37.074
<v Speaker 1>it's an experience.</v>

352
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

353
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.201
<v Speaker 1>okay for you,</v>

354
00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:41.280
<v Speaker 1>but for a lot of guys,</v>

355
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:44.220
<v Speaker 1>it's an experience that they don't want to have and someone tricked them into</v>

356
00:08:44.221 --> 00:08:46.560
<v Speaker 1>doing it and they could get violent and I don't,</v>

357
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't justify it,</v>

358
00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:48.570
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying a lot of guys,</v>

359
00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:49.560
<v Speaker 1>that would be the reaction.</v>

360
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.180
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you felt bad.</v>

361
00:08:51.181 --> 00:08:51.881
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

362
00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 1>And he went back and then,</v>

363
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.731
<v Speaker 1>and then what?</v>

364
00:08:53.731 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Or a poem did you have a of ton after that?</v>

365
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.641
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

366
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe a kissed with Tom,</v>

367
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 1>but if I tell the story again,</v>

368
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll definitely use that.</v>

369
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny how Lego a memory from that far back?</v>

370
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 1>It's almost bullshit anyway,</v>

371
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>cause it's so like fragmented and odd.</v>

372
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like I can recite the facts of a lot of details of my life,</v>

373
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 1>but do it truly recall them.</v>

374
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>And if I didn't have a language,</v>

375
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:19.700
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't even exist to my memory banks to tell you another story.</v>

376
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Please do this.</v>

377
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Did I tell you that Jimmy Burke story?</v>

378
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

379
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:25.750
<v Speaker 1>A midnight?</v>

380
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

381
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 1>a million Jimmy Burke stories.</v>

382
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>The one where where we were both together with two girls on a bed.</v>

383
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.633
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

384
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.923
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

385
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.063
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

386
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

387
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

388
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

389
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 1>So I had my best friend's thumb in my ass.</v>

390
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

391
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.103
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

392
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>but that's a whole different story.</v>

393
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

394
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 1>What you put your thumb.</v>

395
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

396
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.921
<v Speaker 1>what should I tell?</v>

397
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Did I tell him,</v>

398
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.313
<v Speaker 1>sign my thumb?</v>

399
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's be clear about because we refer to each other as best friends and I tell</v>

400
00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>him my thumb was never anywhere near the punchline away,</v>

401
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:56.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's a very,</v>

402
00:09:56.871 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 1>very good excuse for it.</v>

403
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.980
<v Speaker 1>No wonder why it's not on the podcast.</v>

404
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:01.621
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

405
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:02.700
<v Speaker 1>should I tell him the podcast,</v>

406
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a little late because you already gave away.</v>

407
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 1>The punchline is if you can tell the story somehow or another make it</v>

408
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:09.440
<v Speaker 1>entertaining even though the punchline is already,</v>

409
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I used to have ice date,</v>

410
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I two girlfriends for a long time that I had sex with 10 years after the fact.</v>

411
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:16.680
<v Speaker 1>They were just my two girls.</v>

412
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Loved them,</v>

413
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>loved them.</v>

414
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I had touched with those girls.</v>

415
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

416
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 1>you know that we dated in college and then I dated him.</v>

417
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>We want to add right after college and and for the next 10 years,</v>

418
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe longer.</v>

419
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 1>They were always a booty call and I was kind of,</v>

420
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 1>relationships are so strange,</v>

421
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:32.583
<v Speaker 1>so weird.</v>

422
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Even through their boyfriends to girlfriends and we would always get crazy.</v>

423
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

424
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:36.961
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>

425
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 1>how many girls like that have a guy like that somewhere in their life where they</v>

426
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:44.370
<v Speaker 1>just have some arrangements and they can always up places.</v>

427
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.863
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

428
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.621
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

429
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:47.454
<v Speaker 1>Dirty.</v>

430
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.920
<v Speaker 1>How can you tell what,</v>

431
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.180
<v Speaker 1>what do you most of all?</v>

432
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 1>And because they're there,</v>

433
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 1>they talk about him a lot because he's still in their life because he's still</v>

434
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 1>really important to them because they had a long time.</v>

435
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.733
<v Speaker 1>I can always tell him,</v>

436
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 1>you're saying you could sniff it if a girl's doing it to you,</v>

437
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.383
<v Speaker 1>you can tell.</v>

438
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:02.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

439
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:02.941

<v Speaker 1>I don't make out with guys.</v>

658
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>

659
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Can't do it.</v>

660
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

661
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I had to do it.</v>

662
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a part,</v>

663
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

664

<v Speaker 1>you said you wrote a plate that you guys are good.</v>

665

<v Speaker 1>I wrote this play as we can make out.</v>

666
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

668
00:15:41.411 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 1>But I did write this play where I make out with can every letter and it's</v>

669
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:47.360
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate that it had to be that way,</v>

670
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.710
<v Speaker 1>but I had to make out with a guy.</v>

671
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:50.840
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I wrote,</v>

672
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:52.250
<v Speaker 1>that it's what I wrote.</v>

804
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy and I had so much fun in New York.</v>

805
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking about how we used to pick up girls by posing as doctors.</v>

806
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.573
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.110
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:49.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:52.400
<v Speaker 1>so you do like I'm a doctor and yeah,</v>

815
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.580
<v Speaker 1>but we'd set up like this.</v>

816
00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:54.630
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times we set out like this,</v>

817
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:54.990

820
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Every time.</v>

821
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.451
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

822
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:01.540
<v Speaker 1>we'd be in there like a couple of years.</v>

823
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 1>We find really hot girls.</v>

824
00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I come up and go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sorry to bother you.</v>

827
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Girls were doctors and my buddy just said,</v>

828
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 1>and he's a great surgeon,</v>

829
00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 1>but he just lost his first patient.</v>

830
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.210
<v Speaker 1>He's really bummed out if you guys went over there and just talk to them and</v>

831
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>make them see it and feel so much better.</v>

832
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.550
<v Speaker 1>And they'd be like,</v>

833
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 1>he's a surgeon.</v>

834
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.140

837
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 1>and she was actually a doctor.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No Fun.</v>

968
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.280

<v Speaker 1>a lot of times what human beings do is we apply a construct on someone.</v>

1043
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.721
<v Speaker 1>So they'll,</v>

1044
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 1>you'll find somebody that looks the part and then you just apply a construct.</v>

1045
00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:30.621
<v Speaker 1>You just go,</v>

1053
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:35.901
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1054
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:36.591
<v Speaker 1>on a fucking,</v>

1057
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.231
<v Speaker 1>While the girl was like,</v>

1058
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm from fucking Michigan,</v>

1059
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I never been on a sample of my fucking life and I like to do drugs every day.</v>

1060
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:44.144
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

1061
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 1>why were you trying to construct the,</v>

1064
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:49.650
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of a,</v>

1065
00:24:49.651 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 1>a really non realistic reality though all the time.</v>

1066
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1067
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.020
<v Speaker 1>because it wasn't like,</v>

1068
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.040
<v Speaker 1>it was really strange.</v>

1069
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the kind of behavior that you get from people that have a hard</v>

1070
00:24:58.251 --> 00:24:59.210
<v Speaker 1>time meeting girls.</v>

1071
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.940
<v Speaker 1>But you had no problem eating girls.</v>

1072
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:02.751
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that at all.</v>

1073
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 1>You were not shy.</v>

1074
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.290
<v Speaker 1>You're always charming and you're always funny.</v>

1075
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.131
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1076
00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember a time where you're like,</v>

1077
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:09.141
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1078
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I can't meet girls.</v>

1079
00:25:10.671 --> 00:25:12.230
<v Speaker 1>And just tired of being alone.</v>

1080
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.370
<v Speaker 1>It was never that.</v>

1081
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:13.910
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1082
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:14.541
<v Speaker 1>it was you,</v>

1083
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:15.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1084
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.810
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason would wind up getting,</v>

1085
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't crazy girl like this.</v>

1088
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:22.700
<v Speaker 1>that I was trying to figure out.</v>

1089
00:25:22.701 --> 00:25:27.701
<v Speaker 1>I spent many an hour by myself thinking about you after many of our crazy</v>

1090
00:25:29.421 --> 00:25:30.230
<v Speaker 1>adventures,</v>

1091
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 1>thinking about you going,</v>

1092
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.170
<v Speaker 1>how did this happen?</v>

1093
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.130
<v Speaker 1>How did this guy get to this state of mind where he lets this person in his life</v>

1094
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.510
<v Speaker 1>and then he can't see that.</v>

1095
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

1096
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.910
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm hanging out with you.</v>

1097
00:25:40.911 --> 00:25:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1098
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.040

1099
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:43.821
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

1100
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:48.821
<v Speaker 1>objective self deprecating guy who's really well read and yet he's hanging</v>

1101
00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:50.930
<v Speaker 1>around with legit methods.</v>

1102
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.930
<v Speaker 1>You were hanging around with like scary people there were like,</v>

1103
00:25:53.931 --> 00:25:54.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1104
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1105
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know what that was.</v>

1106
00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it was just,</v>

1107
00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:57.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1108
00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I think what it was was I'd go,</v>

1109
00:25:59.360 --> 00:25:59.571
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1112

<v Speaker 1>I think that was a lot of them.</v>

1113
00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:03.960
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

1114
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I found that very intriguing where I'd say,</v>

1115
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.700
<v Speaker 1>All you need is someone like me to change your life and I know how to help you.</v>

1117
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.210
<v Speaker 1>And it took me a long time to realize that that is the dumbest shit you can</v>

1118
00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:15.044
<v Speaker 1>advocate for it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anybody dead fucking end or you never want to do that shit like goodness.</v>

1120

1121
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 1>You know you never want to do that because you can't.</v>

1122
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:24.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1124
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:26.810

<v Speaker 1>He said a sock and he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What would you want to talk to her?</v>

1177
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I've been married to your mother for 50 years.</v>

1178
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to her and I'm not going.</v>

1179
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:21.090
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

1180
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:21.631
<v Speaker 1>You've got to work.</v>

00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a fun guy to talk to him.</v>

1191
00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.540
<v Speaker 1>He's more of those.</v>

1192
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I call them every day when I needed it.</v>

1193
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

1194

<v Speaker 1>talk about just crazy with them.</v>

1196
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.040
<v Speaker 1>How deep do you go in the rabbit hole?</v>

1197
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.120
<v Speaker 1>As deep as it gets.</v>

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:21.811
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1244
00:28:21.811 --> 00:28:22.111
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1245
00:28:22.111 --> 00:28:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Ms. Guy doing nice to meet you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1247
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.870
<v Speaker 1>And he just leaves.</v>

1248
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:25.581
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>

1249
00:28:25.581 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 1>my father,</v>

1250
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:27.023
<v Speaker 1>my father goes,</v>

1251
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.373
<v Speaker 1>what's that guy do?</v>

1252
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1253
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:29.491
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1254
00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1255
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.653
<v Speaker 1>he's a writer.</v>

1256
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 1>My father said,</v>

1257
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.213
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1258
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that's not going to work out for him.</v>

1259
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.380
<v Speaker 1>And I go and I go,</v>

1260
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.090
<v Speaker 1>how did you know that?</v>

1261
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes,</v>

1262
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.340
<v Speaker 1>pattern recognition.</v>

1263
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.660
<v Speaker 1>I've been around,</v>

1264
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm 71 years old.</v>

1265
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.100
<v Speaker 1>That's how pattern rather than Russian mission.</v>

1266
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 1>So he's like that guy from the Bill Ben Stiller movie where he has like the</v>

1267
00:28:50.131 --> 00:28:51.410
<v Speaker 1>human lie detector on it.</v>

1268
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what he can read you in a heartbeat,</v>

1269
00:28:53.521 --> 00:28:53.761
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1270
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:54.271
<v Speaker 1>He can read,</v>

1271
00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:55.470
<v Speaker 1>he can see you walk across the street.</v>

1272
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.580
<v Speaker 1>He knows your whole fucking life.</v>

1273
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Then again,</v>

1274
00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.400
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck are you so bad at that?</v>

1275
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1276
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually good at it.</v>

1277
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I choose to ignore it.</v>

1278
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1279
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.421
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1280
00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I did actually.</v>

1281
00:29:04.441 --> 00:29:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm very good at it,</v>

1282
00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 1>but when I see a project I go,</v>

1283
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:09.414
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1284
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.590

1285
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:12.060

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:12.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1287
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.210
<v Speaker 1>there was a self destructive aspect to you.</v>

1288
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1289
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:15.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1290
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.940
<v Speaker 1>the always disturbed me being your friend.</v>

1291
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what would drive me nuts,</v>

1292
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1293
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.300
<v Speaker 1>And it was a distraction and it drives me.</v>

1294
00:29:22.301 --> 00:29:23.340
<v Speaker 1>It hurt my career by the way.</v>

1295
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1296
00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:24.670

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1299
00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:29.130
<v Speaker 1>It hurt my career and it hurt my relationships with people that were significant</v>

1300
00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:30.180
<v Speaker 1>in my life and yeah.</v>

1301
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1302
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.660
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of that self sabotage,</v>

1303
00:29:33.661 --> 00:29:35.040
<v Speaker 1>we all go through that stuff.</v>

1304
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.000
<v Speaker 1>You go through it,</v>

1305
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:36.271

1307
00:29:37.711 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 1>than anybody.</v>

1308
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 1>I knew actually you were always very good at cutting out the fat and I kept it</v>

1309
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.440
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted an excuse maybe to,</v>

1310
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:44.980

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1312
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like a parachute.</v>

1313
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:47.254
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1315
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:48.863
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1316
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:54.040
<v Speaker 1>there's very few reasons in life to give yourself more problems and if you can</v>

1317
00:29:54.041 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 1>find all your own problems and address them and try to deal with all your own</v>

1318
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 1>problems and be real honest about that,</v>

1319
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Speaker 1>then it makes it really easy to see other people's problems.</v>

1320
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 1>But I've found that in my life when I wasn't being honest with myself about my</v>

1321
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 1>own problems,</v>

1322
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.840
<v Speaker 1>when I had issues,</v>

1323
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:12.760
<v Speaker 1>when I had unresolved things in my mind,</v>

1324
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:13.091
<v Speaker 1>just went,</v>

1325
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:14.080
<v Speaker 1>it was a real young man.</v>

1326
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I was still growing up and trying to get over my fucked up childhood.</v>

1327
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I found it much more difficult for me to see problems in other people because of</v>

1328
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:22.231
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1329
00:30:22.231 --> 00:30:25.060
<v Speaker 1>the shield that I put on recognizing my own issues.</v>

1330
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't as intuitive or insightful when it came to recognizing other people.</v>

1331
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.860
<v Speaker 1>As I get older and I became as honest as is humanly possible,</v>

1332
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.240
<v Speaker 1>which is how I am now,</v>

1333
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1334
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.380
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1335
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 1>then it became where I just see it everywhere.</v>

1336
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 1>That became really obvious.</v>

1337
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what I have now become obsessed with and that's why I don't suffer fools</v>

1338
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:47.531
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1339
00:30:47.531 --> 00:30:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Like that's why,</v>

1340
00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:48.910
<v Speaker 1>because what I'm,</v>

1341
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.220
<v Speaker 1>what I'm very interested in is figuring out,</v>

1342
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay as undiluted as I can and as authentic when I was watching</v>

1343
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Springsteen,</v>

1344
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1345
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.540
<v Speaker 1>the word that kept popping into my head was just authentic.</v>

1346
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.950
<v Speaker 1>He's never lying.</v>

1347
00:30:59.951 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 1>It's everything about him,</v>

1348
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:01.691
<v Speaker 1>the way he dresses,</v>

1349
00:31:01.691 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 1>the way everything about it and nothing is in his way.</v>

1350
00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:08.140
<v Speaker 1>There's no resistance is why you can do a back bend and touch his head at 62.</v>

1351
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.511
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

1352
00:31:08.511 --> 00:31:08.711
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1353
00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:09.970
<v Speaker 1>He could literally back Ben,</v>

1354
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 1>he went all the way back and hit his head.</v>

1355
00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.330
<v Speaker 1>He can,</v>

1356
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.163
<v Speaker 1>he can run.</v>

1357
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.110
<v Speaker 1>He's 62.</v>

1358
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.003
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1359
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.903
<v Speaker 1>On stage,</v>

1360
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:16.481
<v Speaker 1>on stage,</v>

1361
00:31:16.481 --> 00:31:18.130
<v Speaker 1>on lot back then at 62.</v>

1362
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And I went and I went,</v>

1363
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.820
<v Speaker 1>that guy is so out of his own way.</v>

1364
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:22.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1365
00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:23.171
<v Speaker 1>I've said this before,</v>

1366
00:31:23.171 --> 00:31:24.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe on the podcast,</v>

1367
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of my favorite metaphors that Michelangelo said when he was Clark.</v>

1368
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.313
<v Speaker 1>He says name.</v>

1369
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean when,</v>

1370
00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:30.131
<v Speaker 1>when we got last week,</v>

1371
00:31:30.131 --> 00:31:30.641
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry guys,</v>

1372
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:31.474
<v Speaker 1>I speak Thai.</v>

1373
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1374
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.311
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1375
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:34.000
<v Speaker 1>There are no girls here.</v>

1376
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.833
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1377
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:35.411
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1378
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1379
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.663
<v Speaker 1>When Michelangelo,</v>

1380
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:37.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1381
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1382
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1383
00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:42.760
<v Speaker 1>when he carved the David The statue of David and he had this piece of marble and</v>

1384
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.271
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1385
00:31:43.271 --> 00:31:44.710
<v Speaker 1>and this is a great metaphor for art,</v>

1386
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.071
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1387
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 1>it's already in there.</v>

1388
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I just had to get all this shit out of the way.</v>

1389
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:49.331
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1390
00:31:49.331 --> 00:31:51.220
<v Speaker 1>that's how you should look at yourself as a human being.</v>

1391
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Speaker 1>You're born and you acquire a lot of shit as you're,</v>

1392
00:31:54.431 --> 00:31:55.600
<v Speaker 1>as you're growing up,</v>

1393
00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1394
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So as you grow up,</v>

1395
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.120
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Shit's put on you,</v>

1396
00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1397
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.070
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:00.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1399
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:01.630
<v Speaker 1>how they define you,</v>

1400
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:02.051
<v Speaker 1>what they,</v>

1401
00:32:02.051 --> 00:32:03.070
<v Speaker 1>what they do to you.</v>

1402
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1403
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.271
<v Speaker 1>PA school,</v>

1404
00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:04.811
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>

1405
00:32:04.811 --> 00:32:05.890
<v Speaker 1>the trauma of school,</v>

1406
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.270
<v Speaker 1>the grief you go through,</v>

1407
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:07.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1408
00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:08.920
<v Speaker 1>your body is and what you wanted to do,</v>

1409
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:11.320
<v Speaker 1>those losses and stuff and you put on a lot of stuff,</v>

1410
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1411
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:12.020
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1412
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you come to the world when you're ready to take it on at 30 with a whole lot of</v>

1413
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking baggage.</v>

1414
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.360
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it's negative,</v>

1415
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1416
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.460
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

1417
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the job then is to figure out a way to get that stuff off you,</v>

1418
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 1>to shed that stuff and get back to who you really are,</v>

1419
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.440
<v Speaker 1>the authentic you.</v>

1420
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is at least as a comic and as somebody who writes and stuff,</v>

1421
00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:37.030
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1422
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.500
<v Speaker 1>that's all I think about now.</v>

1423
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:39.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1424
00:32:39.111 --> 00:32:39.891
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

1425
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 1>what is how honest can I truly be with my expression,</v>

1426
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 1>even if I'm being silly and like talking about saving a whale,</v>

1427
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of me in there that I'm,</v>

1428
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.400

1434
00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:57.980
<v Speaker 1>means and,</v>

1439
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 1>and not being able to show up her a part of me,</v>

1440
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:03.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:04.821
<v Speaker 1>who I want,</v>

00:33:04.821 --> 00:33:05.720
<v Speaker 1>she's gonna model the men.</v>

1445
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.190
<v Speaker 1>She dates after me,</v>

1446
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.840
<v Speaker 1>so I gotta be a fucking,</v>

1447
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I got to be the,</v>

1448
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I gotta be her hero.</v>

1449
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I got to be the guy that she actually,</v>

1450
00:33:12.651 --> 00:33:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to Dayton the guy I used to be,</v>

1451
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:16.363
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1452
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 1>So there's all those responsibilities that you start taking on as you get older.</v>

1453
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.800
<v Speaker 1>But so much of that is,</v>

1454
00:33:21.801 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 1>and so much of fucking thought,</v>

1455
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:24.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1456
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:24.870
<v Speaker 1>but I've got to think,</v>

1457
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Speaker 1>they act like it's an active process.</v>

1458
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Thinking and being creative is actually learning what not to think about because</v>

1459
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:35.660
<v Speaker 1>the rest of it comes to it.</v>

1460
00:33:35.661 --> 00:33:36.171
<v Speaker 1>There's the dead.</v>

1461
00:33:36.171 --> 00:33:36.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

1462
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 1>that's a real philosophy.</v>

1463
00:33:37.821 --> 00:33:42.821
<v Speaker 1>If you can open yourself up and think of thinking as being more of a channel for</v>

1464
00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 1>what's available to you,</v>

1465
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.080
<v Speaker 1>that that's a very important distinction.</v>

1466
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.333
<v Speaker 1>This notion that,</v>

1467
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.660
<v Speaker 1>that see a lot of people come and say,</v>

1468
00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:50.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1469
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:52.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm missing something.</v>

1470
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm missing something that I have to add to my arsenal.</v>

1471
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:55.723
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1472
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:56.211
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1473
00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:57.440
<v Speaker 1>what you're probably doing is there's,</v>

1474
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.010
<v Speaker 1>there's something you've got to let go of and when you let go of that,</v>

1475
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you'll get what you're looking for or you'll find that that that's a,</v>

1476
00:34:04.131 --> 00:34:06.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a fundamental difference in thinking about thing.</v>

1477
00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of times we're taught,</v>

1478
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.863
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1479
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:09.291
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1480
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you're missing something.</v>

1481
00:34:10.341 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You got to add to your year.</v>

1482
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.760
<v Speaker 1>You got to put another Arrow in your quiver.</v>

1483
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:14.871
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1484
00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:15.690
<v Speaker 1>you might have the,</v>

1485
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1486
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:16.683
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1487
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:17.120
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

1488
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.250
<v Speaker 1>better advice may maybe to say,</v>

1489
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.930
<v Speaker 1>you got to let some stuff go,</v>

1490
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1491
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 1>You're holding on to some stuff.</v>

1492
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.750
<v Speaker 1>You've got to let some stuff go.</v>

1493
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.260
<v Speaker 1>You're still defining yourself along lines that are not helpful to you.</v>

1494
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:28.250
<v Speaker 1>You're still,</v>

1495
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 1>you still have people in your life that are not your friends,</v>

1496
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:32.150
<v Speaker 1>even though they seem like they are,</v>

1497
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you still have,</v>

1498
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.800
<v Speaker 1>you're still doing a job that you hate because it's an excuse to not do,</v>

1499
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:40.640
<v Speaker 1>not go for what you really want.</v>

1500
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.350
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of things that you should be deleting.</v>

1501
00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.590
<v Speaker 1>You should be taking out of your life and,</v>

1502
00:34:44.591 --> 00:34:44.921
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1503
00:34:44.921 --> 00:34:48.920
<v Speaker 1>and then there will be room for something that's much better.</v>

1504
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:49.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

1505
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.331
<v Speaker 1>that's a very,</v>

1506
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a scary way to think of it,</v>

1507
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:53.740
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we talk about that enough.</v>

1508
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
