<v Speaker 1>Every time we do this,</v>

8
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I could have sworn I muted it this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you do it by yourself,</v>

9
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You catch yourself.</v>

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>enough for the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough for the Greeks.</v>

19
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got an ipad even though I said I </v>

20
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to get one for you to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

21
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Like walked by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said you guys got in them bitches.</v>

22
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>St Guys said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said okay,</v>

23
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>let's go first day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting.</v>

24
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I am interested in is what's going </v>

25
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.081
<v Speaker 1>gonna happen with these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are these things eventually </v>

26
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.441
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually these things are going to be </v>

27
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:15.441
<v Speaker 1>able to control your house and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>you could already do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the dragon naturally speaking,</v>

29
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>is any good on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know it?</v>

30
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

31
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 2>It's alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's alright if you have a headphone </v>

32
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.251
<v Speaker 2>microphone thing plugged in to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to do it like in a loud room in </v>

33
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:27.251
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

34
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Well I got to write a book now and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just signed a deal.</v>

35
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's fucking official.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the middle of writing this thing </v>

36
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

37
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>it takes a long time to write shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be easier to just talk it out,</v>

38
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that stuff is any </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

39
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:46.401
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the people told me that I'm a </v>

40
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 1>voice recognition software is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good on pcs,</v>

41
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.540
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not quite there on the Mac yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of?</v>

42
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't miss that because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best ones on the PC is dragon naturally </v>

43
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.130
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same technologies the same.</v>

44
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Everything's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there shouldn't be a difference,</v>

45
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same version because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a unix based for the Mac operating </v>

46
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan is totally different.</v>

47
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like a different version.</v>

48
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 2>It's the same programming language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

49
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

50
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like a xbox and ps three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the same tech.</v>

52
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 2>The programming is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just two different ways.</v>

53
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

54
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:24.501
<v Speaker 1>did it maybe you wizards out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>know whether or not he's speaking the </v>

55
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:24.501
<v Speaker 1>truth because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I believe Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also believe that Brian did not </v>

57
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>know the answer.</v>

58
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like I barely used dragon so I</v>

59
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.310
<v Speaker 2>could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a huge dragon nerd,</v>

60
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 2>but to me it makes sense that if a </v>
<v Speaker 2>company makes that kind of software,</v>

61
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 2>it would be the same on pc and Mac and </v>
<v Speaker 2>might have to get there a different way,</v>

62
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Speaker 2>but the actual brains of the software </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the same.</v>

63
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>The same program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about actually writing</v>

64
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:52.361
<v Speaker 1>things too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's better than speaking it and </v>

65
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:52.361
<v Speaker 1>writing it because like when I write </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

66
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>if I write a blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't type that fast,</v>

67
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm writing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each word that I'm thinking about,</v>

68
00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing really dwelling on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other words that come</v>

69
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.980
<v Speaker 3>after it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why one of the things people are </v>

70
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.111
<v Speaker 3>always really impressed about is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to speak without stammering and </v>

71
00:03:07.111 --> 00:03:10.940
<v Speaker 3>that have something to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the reason why Obama got </v>

72
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.940
<v Speaker 3>elected really is because not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's black,</v>

73
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 3>but because he's black and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good speaker,</v>

74
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's really good at talking and there is</v>

75
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 3>an art form to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a management of your,</v>

76
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 3>the ability to recognize like what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna say next and the inflection</v>

77
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna use and preparation and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>

78
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.190
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

79
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.460
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

80
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 3>there's an art to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

81
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more interesting.</v>

82
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Usually when I read things that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote and they actually wrote it,</v>

83
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 3>they sat down and they really thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how this is going to be absorbed.</v>

84
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a craft,</v>

85
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 3>there's a craft to both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a real craft to writing,</v>

86
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual writing itself.</v>

87
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 3>I really appreciate it when I read good </v>
<v Speaker 3>writers,</v>

88
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>

89
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

90
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't read that much,</v>

91
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.200
<v Speaker 2>but the few books that I choose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pick out certain things I want to read</v>

92
00:03:55.201 --> 00:04:00.201
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read all day on the Internet when it </v>

93
00:04:00.201 --> 00:04:00.201
<v Speaker 2>comes to a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

94
00:04:00.201 --> 00:04:03.081
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read so much today I don't need to </v>

95
00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:03.081
<v Speaker 2>read anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:03.720
<v Speaker 2>type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've actually been reading less books</v>

97
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:06.300
<v Speaker 2>ever since the Internet kind of grabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbed me,</v>

98
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed.</v>

99
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

100
00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:09.660
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Last good book I read was a book called </v>
<v Speaker 2>early bird.</v>

102
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Highly recommended though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about a guy that used to write for,</v>

103
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I think letterman and he retired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is real,</v>

104
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.390
<v Speaker 2>a real guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he retired and he went to Florida </v>

105
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.061
<v Speaker 2>and lived in a retirement home and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>documented his life inside a retirement </v>

106
00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:29.760
<v Speaker 2>home being retired at the age of 35.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the funniest books.</v>

107
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.890
<v Speaker 2>It's weird how they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the retirement village is like high </v>

108
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.890
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

109
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.121
<v Speaker 2>there's like the popular old people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have like their cliques and stuff </v>

110
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:38.490
<v Speaker 2>like that and it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of go back to that,</v>

111
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 3>that old school thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

112
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Early bird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

113
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 3>People are like that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like that no matter what,</v>

114
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.830
<v Speaker 3>they're like that if they're 80,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like that.</v>

115
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:48.870
<v Speaker 3>If there were 180 for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

116
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 3>we're monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

117
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.520
<v Speaker 3>We have a whole bunch of instincts that </v>

<v Speaker 3>of fiction and nonfiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that was so </v>

<v Speaker 3>cool about hunter's writing is like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy was just crazy.</v>

146
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.780
<v Speaker 3>It was making all kinds of crazy shit up</v>
<v Speaker 3>about like Las Vegas and campaigns and </v>

147
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 3>dudes being on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

148
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 3>when Ed Muskie was running for </v>
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>

149
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Hunter Thompson just started printing in</v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling stone magazine every week that </v>

150
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 3>it was like widely known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy had an ebook again,</v>

<v Speaker 3>addiction and that he was bringing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian doctors.</v>

152
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.650
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody ever done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's ever done like real serious </v>

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 3>coverage of like a political event and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just started adding nutty shit to it.</v>

154
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:27.791
<v Speaker 3>That totally wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So literally this guy changed the </v>

155
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:31.301
<v Speaker 3>fucking course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the election because that guy was like </v>

156
00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:33.310
<v Speaker 3>one of the favorites and because hunters</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing about him having an evil game </v>

157
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.930
<v Speaker 3>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is this crazy exotic drug from </v>

<v Speaker 3>and this guy literally fell apart on the</v>

160
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:44.741
<v Speaker 3>campaign trail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were heckling him and he's doing </v>

161
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:44.741
<v Speaker 3>these campaign speeches and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>crumpled,</v>

<v Speaker 3>wrote.</v>

163
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 3>And when they asked him about it and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

164
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

169
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't print.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said it was a rumor and it goes in.</v>

171
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 3>It was a rumor and I started in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Milwaukee.</v>

172
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.320

<v Speaker 3>It was just.</v>

173
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 3>But he got away with it and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly on acid.</v>

174
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.300

<v Speaker 4>would recommend about all this?</v>

179
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.060
<v Speaker 3>watched the documentary Gonzo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to move you fear and loathing </v>

180
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.470
<v Speaker 3>in Las Vegas and I'd seen him on talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows before.</v>

181
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.280
<v Speaker 3>I always knew that he was just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy guy.</v>

182
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:32.710
<v Speaker 3>There was this older dude who was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutty,</v>

186
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.691
<v Speaker 3>sixties that somehow or another morphed </v>
<v Speaker 3>into this like super violent fucking </v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Where it's very good documentary,</v>

193
00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:00.730

<v Speaker 3>So it really gets you into how fucking </v>

194
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 3>interesting this guy was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it brings me back to the same thing </v>

195
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 3>that I always think of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

196
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm when you're really that good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so good.</v>

197
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I always wonder how fucking crazy you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be to be really good.</v>

198
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

199
00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:16.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in almost everything like Michael </v>

200
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:16.221
<v Speaker 3>Jackson and fucking sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody like tiger woods,</v>

201
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look how crazy is.</v>

202
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 3>I almost think that you have to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain.</v>

203
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain amount of imbalanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you to be really the best at anything</v>

204
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent.</v>

205
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why you're considered the </v>

206
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.991
<v Speaker 4>best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually not in the same road as </v>

207
00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 4>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're on the side street,</v>

208
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a little different than everyone </v>

209
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.360
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the most successful people are</v>

210
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 4>not just a common person in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do,</v>

211
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.940
<v Speaker 3>not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that the commitment </v>

212
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.190
<v Speaker 3>that's involved in order to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest levels of anything,</v>

213
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.940
<v Speaker 3>like you almost have to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>not knowing that I hit those Rpms,</v>

214
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like um,</v>

215
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 3>with so many things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to the working </v>

216
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to like the world,</v>

217
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 3>I could see a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

218
00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 3>an argument for there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's never too much.</v>

219
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.300
<v Speaker 3>It's never too much art that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce because you just producing </v>

220
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.640
<v Speaker 3>positive energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that get addicted to success in </v>

221
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 3>the business world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And try to be like the number one guy in</v>

222
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 3>the business world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

223
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:14.601
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the main reasons why we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have all these problems today with </v>

224
00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 3>corporations or corporations are sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these consciousness list entities,</v>

225
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:22.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean now corporations basically are </v>

226
00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:22.401
<v Speaker 3>allowed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

227
00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're judged as an individual.</v>

228
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations are a thing,</v>

229
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:29.871
<v Speaker 3>like they have rights and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can contribute to campaigns </v>

230
00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:32.340
<v Speaker 3>now as much as they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can do all kinds of crazy shit,</v>

231
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

232
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 3>as a corporation and get away with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't think of it as them,</v>

233
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 3>as an individual doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think of it as well,</v>

234
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all business and we're part of </v>

235
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.411
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can do fucked up things in </v>

236
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:45.411
<v Speaker 3>overseas countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:49.310
<v Speaker 3>third world countries and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even think that they're doing anything </v>

238
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.551
<v Speaker 3>bad because what they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just doing business and there's </v>

239
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:52.551
<v Speaker 3>just a bunch of people involved doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

240
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 3>So no one person feels like total </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for what's happening,</v>

241
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.410
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

242
00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 3>that's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a real problem that we have.</v>

243
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.850
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the real problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have is related to people just </v>

244
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.850
<v Speaker 3>being super competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

245
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 3>that's the only reason why these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>super crazy billionaire dudes would keep</v>

246
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 3>pushing forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

247
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:16.251
<v Speaker 3>at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much fucking money do you have to </v>

248
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:16.251
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

249
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 3>when you're one of those dudes that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 30,</v>

250
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:21.831
<v Speaker 3>$40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars and you're still trying </v>

251
00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:21.831
<v Speaker 3>to rape third world countries.</v>

252
00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how much money do you need,</v>

253
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:23.820
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

254
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of goddamn money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is that?</v>

255
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:31.221
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would they not be able to recognize </v>

256
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:31.221
<v Speaker 3>that there's something wrong there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then they're crazy.</v>

257
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is to get at the highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels of anything.</v>

258
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's golf or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You got to be a little naughty man.</v>

261
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's singing or performing the </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

264
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 3>to really achieve those,</v>

265
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:54.230
<v Speaker 3>those crazy great highs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you almost have to like lose your </v>

266
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.880
<v Speaker 3>connection to everybody else or lose </v>
<v Speaker 3>control of your connection.</v>

267

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird because that's our high </v>

268
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.670
<v Speaker 3>watermark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

269
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.970
<v Speaker 3>and we're always aspiring towards higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>and higher levels of performance in </v>

270
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 3>everything we do.</v>

271
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's athletic or anything you </v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like a human ethic that we</v>

274
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:19.881
<v Speaker 3>have and it's a very strange man because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's never a point in time where we </v>

275
00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:19.930
<v Speaker 3>ever stepped back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>let's concentrate our time right now.</v>

279
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:29.541
<v Speaker 3>Instead of making more money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's try to concentrate all our time </v>

280
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:29.790
<v Speaker 3>and trying to make things better for </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

281
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's kind of try to concentrate our </v>

282
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:35.300
<v Speaker 3>time and dealing with all these problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>that exist all over the world.</v>

283
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Instead of trying to fucking smash atoms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and create black holes.</v>

284
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's settle down.</v>

285
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let's concentrate on some other shit</v>

286
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 3>when we look at a surplus of money that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>

287
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.600
<v Speaker 3>but they don't ever think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they think of as more and more and </v>

288
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.271
<v Speaker 3>more and more and more and more and more</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're going to live forever and </v>

289
00:11:53.271 --> 00:11:53.271
<v Speaker 3>those motherfuckers drop a heart attacks</v>
<v Speaker 3>left and right.</v>

00:11:53.271 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>Those like ceos</v>

291
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 5>of big corporation type dudes,</v>

294
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:04.590
<v Speaker 5>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the reasons is,</v>

295
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 5>is because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just such an evil cunt.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you're pushing constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly,</v>

300
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:18.120
<v Speaker 5>constantly.</v>

<v Speaker 5>to be the fucking CEO of a corporation </v>

302
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.931
<v Speaker 5>like Halliburton and then go from that </v>
<v Speaker 5>to being the vice president of the </v>

303
00:12:27.931 --> 00:12:32.460
<v Speaker 5>United States and then go from that to </v>
<v Speaker 5>signing billion dollar agreements with </v>

304
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 5>Halliburton.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Halfway in the middle we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about shit.</v>

384
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.610
<v Speaker 3>The way the human mind works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

385
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 3>that there's an error and the way the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human mind works and that's the reason </v>

386
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.940
<v Speaker 3>why people are doing all this crazy shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to conquer the world and you</v>

387
00:16:18.941 --> 00:16:23.941
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and billionaires are fucking torturing </v>

388
00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:27.301
<v Speaker 3>these third world countries and crushing</v>
<v Speaker 3>their resources and doing it all for </v>

<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're.</v>

390
00:16:27.301 --> 00:16:31.310
<v Speaker 3>The reason why is there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an error and the human mind and </v>

391
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.490
<v Speaker 3>there's an error that causes us to never</v>
<v Speaker 3>have perspective.</v>

392
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.640
<v Speaker 3>We're always moving in a direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't have a perspective like </v>

393
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.271
<v Speaker 3>nobody ever stops and very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very few people stop and realize that a </v>

394
00:16:42.271 --> 00:16:43.670
<v Speaker 3>certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I would rather live a,</v>

395
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:48.690
<v Speaker 3>an easy going really peaceful life and </v>
<v Speaker 3>make less money and have less bullshit </v>

396
00:16:49.631 --> 00:16:53.170
<v Speaker 3>and less drama in my life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just be happy all the time.</v>

397
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.830
<v Speaker 3>Then be this like super ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

398
00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.600
<v Speaker 3>gotta go get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Typical American,</v>

399
00:16:58.810 --> 00:16:59.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

400
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:05.010
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem in that fucking typical</v>
<v Speaker 3>American attitude is bullshit because </v>

401
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.340
<v Speaker 3>we're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're fucking dying.</v>

402
00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:07.560
<v Speaker 3>All of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just.</v>

403
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.700
<v Speaker 3>This is totally temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like the,</v>

404
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.720
<v Speaker 3>the one thing to do is to try to balance</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all out and have the most amount of </v>

405
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.160
<v Speaker 3>fun possible and the most amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive time,</v>

406
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.710
<v Speaker 3>the most amount of positive energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the time that you have.</v>

407
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.490
<v Speaker 3>But then there's the keeping up with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joneses thing.</v>

408
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.630
<v Speaker 3>This trick that gets us thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another,</v>

409
00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:30.010
<v Speaker 3>like bigger houses and bigger cars or </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit is going to make you happy.</v>

410

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about.</v>

<v Speaker 3>this guy is a very</v>

417
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 5>successful guy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

423
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:06.390
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a few steps before murder.</v>

424
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 5>Suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

425
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.970
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's right there.</v>

426
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:11.520
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to murder suicides door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

427
00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.380
<v Speaker 5>if you got that phone call in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the night,</v>

428
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:15.880
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't be that surprised you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But God damn it.</v>

429
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.630
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should've done something else.</v>

430
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is nothing you can do.</v>

431
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.270
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the cold hard facts.</v>

432
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:22.950
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the day,</v>

433
00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:26.670
<v Speaker 5>these motherfuckers have to go home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you have to figure out what is</v>

434
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:28.860
<v Speaker 5>it that we're really doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it,</v>

435
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 5>and because they're so fucking many of </v>
<v Speaker 5>us,</v>

436
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.380
<v Speaker 5>I think that human beings have lost this</v>
<v Speaker 5>sense of community.</v>

437
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:39.410
<v Speaker 5>I think human beings are programmed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be in tribes were programmed to be in </v>

438
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.180
<v Speaker 5>tribes of like 50 to 200 people or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>more,</v>

439
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 5>but enough that you know everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

440
00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:47.280
<v Speaker 5>when we live alone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're fucking miserable.</v>

441
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:52.281
<v Speaker 5>Like that's why we don't trust hermits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't trust people that go off into </v>

442
00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:52.960
<v Speaker 5>the woods by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We look at this sketch,</v>

443
00:18:52.961 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 5>you motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wants to be by himself.</v>

444
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't trust that shit because that's </v>

445
00:18:59.920 --> 00:18:59.920
<v Speaker 5>not how you're supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not programmed for that.</v>

446
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 5>We're programmed to be in small groups </v>
<v Speaker 5>of people so that we worked together and</v>

447
00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:04.440
<v Speaker 5>we protect each other and we support </v>
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>

448
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.410
<v Speaker 5>But we're living in a group that's way </v>
<v Speaker 5>too big.</v>

449
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:11.010
<v Speaker 5>Were tricked into believing that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>were a part of some $300,</v>

450
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:13.380
<v Speaker 5>million strong group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

451
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:18.470
<v Speaker 5>That's why like wars work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the reason why wars work is </v>

452
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.470
<v Speaker 5>because we feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

453
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:23.031
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got to defend ourselves and we all </v>

454
00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:23.031
<v Speaker 5>know we have this sort of sense of </v>
<v Speaker 5>loyalty,</v>

455
00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:26.130
<v Speaker 5>defend ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a certain port tenants like against </v>

<v Speaker 5>You can't support it.</v>

469
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 5>You can't be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

470
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:58.330
<v Speaker 5>there's a video that was released that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you haven't seen yet that it was on Wiki</v>

471
00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:03.331
<v Speaker 5>leaks where it shows this a Apache </v>
<v Speaker 5>helicopter shooting these hellfire </v>

472
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:04.740
<v Speaker 5>missiles into these people and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>weren't soldiers.</v>

473
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.710
<v Speaker 5>They were mistaken as soldiers and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know us did it.</v>

474
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.630
<v Speaker 5>I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The US duty.</v>

475
00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:10.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

476
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.980
<v Speaker 5>The 2007 and covered it up and then wiki</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaks got ahold of it.</v>

477
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:18.981
<v Speaker 5>Someone in the armed forces apparently </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a whistleblower and just thought </v>

478
00:20:18.981 --> 00:20:21.240
<v Speaker 5>that this was a horrible situation and </v>
<v Speaker 5>needed to be corrected.</v>

479
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.610
<v Speaker 5>And these guys were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

480
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.790
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if they thought there were </v>

481
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.081
<v Speaker 5>insurgents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could see how they develop this </v>

482
00:20:30.081 --> 00:20:30.930
<v Speaker 5>antagonistic attitude towards the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 5>because this guy's willing to.</v>

483
00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.640
<v Speaker 5>They shot him up as one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>survivors.</v>

484
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:37.641
<v Speaker 5>I just pick up a weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just pick up a weapon like he's asking </v>

485
00:20:37.641 --> 00:20:40.551
<v Speaker 5>them to just pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pick up a weapon so he could isom and </v>

486
00:20:40.551 --> 00:20:40.551
<v Speaker 5>he's got these 30 and they've looked at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

487
00:20:40.551 --> 00:20:44.660
<v Speaker 5>they're the bad guy and this guy is out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and he's in the shit and he's </v>

488
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:44.660
<v Speaker 5>trying to survive.</v>

489
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the attitude you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

490
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.260
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have that attitude and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in war,</v>

491
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.810
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get killed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what it shows you is like,</v>

492
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are we doing there?</v>

00:21:00.601 --> 00:21:04.681
<v Speaker 5>that guy are subject to being put in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation when they are shooting at </v>

496
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 5>civilians accidentally and thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're insurgents.</v>

497
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:10.471
<v Speaker 5>They have to live with these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>memories because someone told us that </v>

498
00:21:10.471 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 5>we're supposed to be over there for some</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking strange reason,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That was an 18 year old pilots.</v>

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.671
<v Speaker 5>these fucking dudes anyway.</v>

555
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.320
<v Speaker 5>living in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was 100 or thousand.</v>

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 5>What is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a goddamn money grab.</v>

578
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:43.330
<v Speaker 5>Like how is this money grab going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The money grabs grown out because </v>

579
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 5>they're all corrupt that Democrats and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Republicans,</v>

580
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.180
<v Speaker 5>they all owe favors to people that got </v>
<v Speaker 5>them in office and they suck Dick and </v>

581
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.200
<v Speaker 5>kiss ass and they let this bullshit pass</v>
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

582
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:55.130
<v Speaker 5>So it's not just the Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not just the people who want war,</v>

583
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:58.150
<v Speaker 5>the military industrial complex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking all of them.</v>

584
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.090
<v Speaker 5>It's all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We live in a horribly corrupt system.</v>

585
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.300
<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're.</v>

586
00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:06.980
<v Speaker 5>We're like sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're like the human race is sick.</v>

587
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:12.190
<v Speaker 5>There's something wrong with the way we </v>
<v Speaker 5>think and behave and or it's right and </v>

588
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:16.811
<v Speaker 5>we think it's wrong to think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it doesn't know because it </v>

589
00:25:16.811 --> 00:25:21.221
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have to be this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want total enjoyment for the </v>

590
00:25:21.221 --> 00:25:24.071
<v Speaker 5>people that are participating in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have to be this way and the </v>

591
00:25:24.071 --> 00:25:27.611
<v Speaker 5>way it is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's this way because too many people </v>

592
00:25:27.611 --> 00:25:30.851
<v Speaker 5>are passive and they're sitting back and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just allowing this life to keep </v>

593
00:25:30.851 --> 00:25:31.130
<v Speaker 5>rolling forward in the same direction.</v>

594
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.770
<v Speaker 5>It's going in a certain direction for </v>
<v Speaker 5>sure,</v>

595
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't have to be negative and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have to fucking involve war.</v>

596
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to involve all the shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going on in these other countries</v>

597
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.920
<v Speaker 5>were being tricked into thinking it does</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

598
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.940
<v Speaker 5>We're supposed to be getting past that </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit and we're supposed to be evolving </v>

599
00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.270
<v Speaker 5>in a technological sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we should be evolving socially too,</v>

600
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 5>and we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're still socially the same way.</v>

601
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 5>We're 30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40,</v>

602
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:59.090
<v Speaker 5>50 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're still doing the same dumb shit </v>

603
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.960
<v Speaker 5>where it's gigantic groups of people led</v>
<v Speaker 5>by a couple of leaders will attack </v>

604
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.461
<v Speaker 5>another gigantic group of people and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of fucking people that have </v>

605
00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 5>nothing to do with anything die and </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone is getting money from it all.</v>

606
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.930
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all it is.</v>

607
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:14.050
<v Speaker 5>It's all about resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every fucking one that's ever been </v>

608
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.201
<v Speaker 5>fought ever there about resources and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just crazy that in 2010 we know the</v>

609
00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:20.300
<v Speaker 5>real problem is we live too long.</v>

610
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.020
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now we live to be 80,</v>

611
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:26.450
<v Speaker 5>9,100.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You live long enough to figure out.</v>

612
00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:31.451
<v Speaker 5>It's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Back in the day when you were fighting </v>

613
00:26:31.451 --> 00:26:34.271
<v Speaker 5>for the Roman empire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you died a fucking plague when </v>

614
00:26:34.271 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Speaker 5>you're 19.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

615
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.220
<v Speaker 5>If you live to be 30 you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

616
00:26:36.221 --> 00:26:38.390
<v Speaker 5>you did a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got a long ass life.</v>

617
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.880
<v Speaker 5>You know Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they killed him at 33.</v>

618
00:26:40.881 --> 00:26:42.380
<v Speaker 5>If he was ever real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

619
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.580
<v Speaker 5>Look at all the people that live back </v>
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

620
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.790
<v Speaker 5>You know the holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Motherfuckers live forever.</v>

621
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:48.850
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

622
00:26:48.851 --> 00:26:51.140
<v Speaker 5>you hear about some new lady in France,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

623
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>100 2,626</v>

624
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 5>smoke cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drank red wine,</v>

625
00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.060
<v Speaker 5>but the one in 26,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's incredible.</v>

626
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.900
<v Speaker 5>People live way low and you live if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>live past a certain point,</v>

627
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:08.901
<v Speaker 5>like you and I are very fortunate </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're in the entertainment </v>

628
00:27:08.901 --> 00:27:11.880
<v Speaker 5>industry so we don't have a specific job</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have to do every morning like we</v>

629
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:15.630
<v Speaker 5>don't have to go to work and work on say</v>
<v Speaker 5>insurance cases all day stuff that we're</v>

630
00:27:15.631 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 5>not interested in.</v>

631
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 5>We're lucky that we get to create and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're lucky that we get to do stuff that</v>

632
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 5>we find interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's all fun.</v>

633
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 5>But for most people that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when,</v>

634
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:30.380
<v Speaker 5>when it's not the case and when your </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole day is filled with work and I've </v>

635
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:30.380
<v Speaker 5>been there before and you've been there </v>
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>

636
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 5>you don't fucking think too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't figure too much out.</v>

637
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:38.660
<v Speaker 5>You know when you're working eight hours</v>
<v Speaker 5>a goddamn day plus and you try and get </v>

638
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:38.660
<v Speaker 5>some overtime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

639
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.480
<v Speaker 5>because you got extra bills and credit </v>
<v Speaker 5>card debt and shit.</v>

640
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it gets to a certain point in time,</v>

641
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of your day,</v>

642
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:48.051
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't got time to contemplate the </v>

643
00:27:48.051 --> 00:27:49.170
<v Speaker 5>universe or culture or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why people behave the way they behave.</v>

644
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.850
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just fucking keep going.</v>

645
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.560
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>life has got damn hard.</v>

646
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:58.910
<v Speaker 5>You just keep fucking going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you and I have way more time by </v>

647
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.810
<v Speaker 5>ourselves to think on our own than most </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

648
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.180
<v Speaker 5>So you get to a certain point in time </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know what,</v>

649
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:05.910
<v Speaker 5>by the time 42,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the time you're like 42,</v>

650
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:10.911
<v Speaker 5>like fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole hustle is so obvious and </v>

651
00:28:10.911 --> 00:28:14.301
<v Speaker 5>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the same hustle that would've </v>

652
00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:16.460
<v Speaker 5>gotten me when I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would've got them joined the army for </v>

653
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.891
<v Speaker 5>sure when I was 18 for when I'm 42.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes me angry because somebody my </v>

654
00:28:18.891 --> 00:28:21.360
<v Speaker 5>age is doing this hustle on someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's 18,</v>

655
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not even my age older than me.</v>

656
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.500
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

657
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.060
<v Speaker 5>it's like you motherfuckers should have </v>
<v Speaker 5>figured it out already.</v>

658
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.790
<v Speaker 5>You motherfuckers that are older than me</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are running the planet.</v>

659
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:32.640
<v Speaker 5>You should be delivering this message.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should have figured this out.</v>

660
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.090
<v Speaker 5>You should know that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're living like retards,</v>

661
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.170
<v Speaker 5>that this is nonsensical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this is.</v>

662
00:28:38.171 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not sustainable,</v>

663
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:45.830
<v Speaker 5>but we could live a sustainable life and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't involve going to countries </v>

664
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.520
<v Speaker 5>where you've never been in fucking up </v>
<v Speaker 5>people you've never met.</v>

665
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.590
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't involve that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

666
00:28:49.591 --> 00:28:52.110
<v Speaker 5>and this fucking argument like about our</v>
<v Speaker 5>boys.</v>

667
00:28:52.111 --> 00:28:52.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

668
00:28:52.471 --> 00:28:57.471
<v Speaker 5>what do you want our boys to die?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how they have to behave over </v>

669
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:57.471
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's stupid.</v>

670
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:57.471
<v Speaker 5>That's a stupid argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

671
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 5>I know that that's how they have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>behave when they're at war.</v>

672
00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.650
<v Speaker 5>A 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not the argument.</v>

673
00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:02.570
<v Speaker 5>The argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

674
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:07.730
<v Speaker 5>this is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They shouldn't fucking be there in the </v>

675
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.860
<v Speaker 5>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that they're not heroes.</v>

676
00:29:07.861 --> 00:29:09.600
<v Speaker 5>It's not that they're not brave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are.</v>

677
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:11.280
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be.</v>

678
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's real fucking fighting.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That must be white knuckled.</v>

681
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:23.580
<v Speaker 5>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't even like hurt locker,</v>

682
00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:24.300
<v Speaker 5>did you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

683
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.210
<v Speaker 5>How come he didn't like hurt locker?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was boring as fuck.</v>

684
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.520
<v Speaker 5>You need to go to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get your balls checked out.</v>

685
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.430
<v Speaker 5>That movie was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talked about this a million times.</v>

00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:33.930
<v Speaker 5>I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you gotta get your balls?</v>

687

<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thing?</v>

819
00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.060
<v Speaker 3>It's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too many people.</v>

820
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too many people.</v>

821
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 3>Have I ever seen the movie called </v>
<v Speaker 3>falling down with Michael Douglas.</v>

822
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 3>His grades are good goddamn movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

823
00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:14.750
<v Speaker 3>And that's how you feel when you live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>La,</v>

824
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.460
<v Speaker 3>in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After awhile you're like,</v>

825
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.890
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's too many humans.</v>

826
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:22.610
<v Speaker 3>They did population density studies with</v>
<v Speaker 3>rats who had took rats.</v>

827
00:35:22.611 --> 00:35:24.380
<v Speaker 3>They put them in a box and there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

828
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:29.770
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain population of rats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were cool with each other and then </v>

829
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.471
<v Speaker 3>they doubled it and they started getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little crazy and they tripled it and </v>

830
00:35:32.471 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 3>when they got to like a high number with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wrapper on top of each other,</v>

831
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.350
<v Speaker 3>rats developed mental illnesses just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like human beings do.</v>

832
00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:41.160
<v Speaker 3>There's some would sit by themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shake and just like face the corner.</v>

833
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:45.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean they literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way human beings are is mirrored and</v>

834
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.990
<v Speaker 3>population density studies for all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of animals.</v>

835
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.490
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take us and he put us in the same.</v>

836
00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 3>The reason why people yell at each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the highway.</v>

837
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:59.710
<v Speaker 3>That's craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why we get so angry and angry on the </v>

838
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.710
<v Speaker 3>highway with this because we grow on top</v>
<v Speaker 3>of each other.</v>

839
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Just eat each other's energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All Atlantic.</v>

840
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to live like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that movie,</v>

841
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 3>that movie just resonates with </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

842
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I think when he just went fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you live in at a place like La,</v>

843
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 3>La has got 20 million people in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was the reason why I moved </v>

844
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.771
<v Speaker 3>to Colorado in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to get away from this heavy </v>

845
00:36:18.771 --> 00:36:18.771
<v Speaker 3>vibration of all these people.</v>

846
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:24.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this is a healthy way to </v>

847
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.080
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a healthy thing to be</v>

848
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.080
<v Speaker 3>like this many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

849
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm living in a game of </v>
<v Speaker 3>musical chairs.</v>

850
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Like one day some shit's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and I'm just going to have to go </v>

851
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:31.340
<v Speaker 3>further away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

852
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I could stay here now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you feel that earthquake the other </v>

853
00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:35.420
<v Speaker 3>day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

854
00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

855
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the car either,</v>

856
00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:42.261
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't Mexican wave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our friend Duncan said that his </v>

857
00:36:42.261 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Speaker 3>bookshelf was moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said it felt like you were on a boat,</v>

858
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.420
<v Speaker 3>like you're waving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That said,</v>

859
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:47.250
<v Speaker 3>our friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duncan's done a lot of acid in his.</v>

860
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard from a few people.</v>

861
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same exact thing.</v>

862
00:36:49.921 --> 00:36:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Wavy motions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like three people told me,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Duncan trussell,</v>

<v Speaker 3>places.</v>

939
00:40:44.961 --> 00:40:46.790
<v Speaker 3>But it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah,</v>

940
00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:51.320
<v Speaker 3>a Edison was a con westing house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were constant.</v>

941
00:40:51.321 --> 00:40:56.321
<v Speaker 3>Tessa was a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in their Defense Tesla also fell in </v>

942
00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:58.580
<v Speaker 3>love with a pigeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

943
00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:01.610
<v Speaker 3>And he had an issue where he destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 3>his sexuality,</v>

944
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.840
<v Speaker 3>like he had some fucking crazy problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with some actress and he fell in love </v>

945
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.960
<v Speaker 3>with her and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all like really vague stuff.</v>

946
00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.360
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his own words,</v>

947
00:41:11.361 --> 00:41:14.940
<v Speaker 3>he destroyed his sexuality and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if they could cast,</v>

948
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.100
<v Speaker 3>rated themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what.</v>

949
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:19.220
<v Speaker 3>It was also a lot of speculation that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>might've been gay or whatever to,</v>

950
00:41:19.221 --> 00:41:19.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

951
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.370
<v Speaker 3>he was definitely a loan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

952
00:41:22.371 --> 00:41:27.371
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to be alone to be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking greatest genius that the </v>

953
00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:27.470
<v Speaker 3>world has ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy was nuts,</v>

954
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:32.500
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That got created all kinds of shit </v>

955
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:32.990
<v Speaker 3>alternating current and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you like literally.</v>

956
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean you created a way to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast electricity through the air.</v>

957
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only problem with it was a,</v>

958
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 3>it would be like free Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't be able to control it.</v>

959
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:43.160
<v Speaker 3>Like to have it in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd just be able to have it.</v>

960
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.220
<v Speaker 3>But I guess now you could have like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>password you've paid for the password.</v>

961
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.090
<v Speaker 2>Well they already do that in some cities</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have city wide Wifi.</v>

962
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

963
00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:50.110
<v Speaker 3>It's free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

964
00:41:50.111 --> 00:41:52.000
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not talking about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about electricity.</v>

965
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about if they would be able to </v>

966
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:57.150
<v Speaker 3>do that with electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like and put a password on it.</v>

967
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.260
<v Speaker 3>The way we put a password on Wifi today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either way,</v>

968
00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Nikolai Tesla is a perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we were talking about earlier is a </v>

969
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:06.190
<v Speaker 3>dude who's just gigantic super fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>

970
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:10.480
<v Speaker 3>Like the greatest genius ever end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely Bat Shit Insane.</v>

971
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:15.890
<v Speaker 3>Just just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just out of his fucking mind claimed </v>

972
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:18.340
<v Speaker 3>that all of his information he received </v>
<v Speaker 3>from aliens that he would,</v>

973
00:42:18.341 --> 00:42:23.341
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would tune into alien signals and </v>

974
00:42:23.341 --> 00:42:23.341
<v Speaker 3>they would tell him I'd do all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

975
00:42:23.341 --> 00:42:24.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

976
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:29.641
<v Speaker 3>I always wonder about that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wonder where the fuck ideas </v>

977
00:42:29.641 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 3>come from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

978
00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.580
<v Speaker 3>what if ideas are literally like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>living organism.</v>

979
00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:35.950
<v Speaker 3>What if ideas are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

980
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we think about like parasites,</v>

981
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.750
<v Speaker 3>we talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like parasites infecting a host,</v>

982
00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:46.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they take over the host body like </v>

983
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:46.660
<v Speaker 3>that grasshopper that gets infected by </v>
<v Speaker 3>this worm.</v>

984
00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.200
<v Speaker 3>The aquatic worms grows inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grasshopper to maturity and then when it</v>

985
00:42:50.201 --> 00:42:52.600
<v Speaker 3>gets to maturity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it convinces the grasshopper that it has</v>

986
00:42:52.601 --> 00:42:57.601
<v Speaker 3>to jump in the water and drown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the grasshopper commit suicide so </v>

987
00:42:57.601 --> 00:43:01.261
<v Speaker 3>that this warm can come out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if like language and ideas </v>

988
00:43:01.261 --> 00:43:05.821
<v Speaker 3>literally are like another sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>organism and what if like they are </v>

989
00:43:05.831 --> 00:43:09.820
<v Speaker 3>manipulating our consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what if like language and ideas</v>

990
00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:14.821
<v Speaker 3>and all these different things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people come up with a creativity in </v>

991
00:43:14.821 --> 00:43:14.821
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people are creative about things,</v>

992
00:43:14.821 --> 00:43:15.820
<v Speaker 3>they pull these things down out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>

993
00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

994
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:17.650
<v Speaker 3>You freak them out</v>

995
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.720

997

<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do some tech support here </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see if are you stream shows?</v>

998
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:29.420
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need to see it.</v>

999
00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:34.421
<v Speaker 2>We can watch it on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really bothered because you were</v>

1000
00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:37.070
<v Speaker 2>not having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The conversation,</v>

1001

<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why you need to in </v>

1004
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.580
<v Speaker 2>there and I've seen this flash of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking line saying that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending yourself when I'm telling you </v>

1008
00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:58.250
<v Speaker 2>it's distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry for listening to you while looking</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've gone through two knee surgeries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one meniscus,</v>

<v Speaker 3>One</v>

1168
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.610
<v Speaker 4>of the things like if you had like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>stove that smelled like gas,</v>

1169
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:36.611
<v Speaker 4>you're always burning herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was always flames coming out of </v>

1170
00:50:36.611 --> 00:50:36.650
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you keep on using that stone?</v>

1171
00:50:36.651 --> 00:50:37.340
<v Speaker 4>Why would they keep it</v>

<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1174
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:44.840
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu when you get good at it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>really fun,</v>

1175
00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:46.070

<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1177
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:51.970
<v Speaker 5>you're going basically hand to hand </v>
<v Speaker 5>combat and you're doing it with good </v>

1178
00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 5>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like these guys that I did you just to,</v>

1179
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:53.130
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1180
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.820
<v Speaker 5>you would trust each other with </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically each other's lives,</v>

1181
00:50:55.821 --> 00:50:56.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I do get,</v>

1182
00:50:56.571 --> 00:51:01.571
<v Speaker 5>gets my back and chokes me and I tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trusting that he's going to let me </v>

1183
00:51:01.571 --> 00:51:04.000
<v Speaker 5>go before he fucking kills me because </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically he's got to a point where he's</v>

1184
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:09.010
<v Speaker 5>killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the same thing with you when </v>

1185
00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.591
<v Speaker 5>you get on top of a dude and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>finishing off a choke or an arm bar or </v>

1186
00:51:11.591 --> 00:51:14.441
<v Speaker 5>something and the guy start tapping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's basically trusting that you're not </v>

1187
00:51:14.441 --> 00:51:14.441
<v Speaker 5>going to injure him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1188
00:51:14.441 --> 00:51:15.050
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes people get injured </v>
<v Speaker 5>accidentally,</v>

1189
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:17.390
<v Speaker 5>but the amount of times that I don't get</v>
<v Speaker 5>injured,</v>

1190
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:19.760
<v Speaker 5>it's way more the amount of continent.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I get injured but I've had these </v>
<v Speaker 5>operations and shit over the course of </v>

1192
00:51:24.761 --> 00:51:26.000
<v Speaker 5>doing Jujitsu for 14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a long ass time,</v>

1193

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the first year,</v>

<v Speaker 5>issue that I had.</v>

1195
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:34.820
<v Speaker 5>I already had like the knee surgery on </v>
<v Speaker 5>my left knee.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I have the,</v>

1197
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.760

<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1198
00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:42.761
<v Speaker 5>So it was a preexisting injury,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so really the only major one that I had </v>

1199
00:51:42.761 --> 00:51:45.821
<v Speaker 5>was the knee surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's just get it fixed and you </v>

1203
00:51:50.351 --> 00:51:52.850
<v Speaker 5>You've got to make sure you don't train </v>
<v Speaker 5>with anybody that you don't trust.</v>

<v Speaker 5>even though you know they can beat you,</v>

1211
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.050
<v Speaker 5>they're going to beat you with technique</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're much safer.</v>

1212
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.300

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:28.330
<v Speaker 5>and get ahold of it so quick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to tap you out that he hurts you </v>

1218
00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:28.330
<v Speaker 5>before you even get a chance to tap.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I love this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to do it.</v>

1265
00:54:07.961 --> 00:54:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Mine is just trying to get what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I thought of out fast.</v>

1266
00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:15.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm making notes with the iphone using </v>
<v Speaker 3>that little uh,</v>

1267
00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 3>application.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't like that I have to fucking </v>

1268
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 3>go in the menu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find it,</v>

1269
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:20.770
<v Speaker 3>press that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>press record.</v>

1270
00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to get like a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny voice notes thing and when I have </v>

1271
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:27.160
<v Speaker 3>ideas like that when I'm writing and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an idea,</v>

1272
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 3>but I'm trying to write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm just going to press it and </v>

1273
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 3>say the idea into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I know for sure that I'm not going to</v>

1274
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.500
<v Speaker 3>lose it,</v>

1275
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.750
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

1276
00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:35.400
<v Speaker 2>do you have your iphone night record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abby?</v>

1277
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Just open up program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit record.</v>

1278
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:38.630
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1279
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.150
<v Speaker 3>But I want to be able to just one press </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's recorded.</v>

1280
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:45.360
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Step two projects for real.</v>

1281
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:46.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds ridiculous,</v>

1282
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:47.670
<v Speaker 3>but it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1283
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:48.540
<v Speaker 3>it is that.</v>

1284
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have the biggest problem,</v>

1285
00:54:52.551 --> 00:54:57.551
<v Speaker 2>like I will have an idea that might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the coolest thing I've ever thought of </v>

1286
00:54:57.551 --> 00:54:58.120
<v Speaker 2>and if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1287
00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.950
<v Speaker 2>last or wait like five seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 seconds,</v>

1288
00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I might accidentally think of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1289
00:55:02.391 --> 00:55:07.391
<v Speaker 2>And that idea has gone down so much and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now I know it's mostly when I was </v>

1290
00:55:07.391 --> 00:55:09.620
<v Speaker 2>smoking weed because lately I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking weed maybe once,</v>

1291
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.490
<v Speaker 2>twice a week instead of almost everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>

1292
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I feel so much sharper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My memory is so much better.</v>

1293
00:55:15.201 --> 00:55:20.201
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how much better I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>already and I'm just just from cutting </v>

1294
00:55:20.201 --> 00:55:20.201
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

1295
00:55:20.201 --> 00:55:24.660
<v Speaker 3>you also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also don't exercise that much </v>

1296
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:24.660
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part about the weed.</v>

1297
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.990
<v Speaker 3>You got to blow that out of your system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1298
00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:31.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just sit around and just keep </v>

1299
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.181
<v Speaker 3>smoking weed everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday we'd starts to lose the effect </v>

1300
00:55:33.181 --> 00:55:34.900
<v Speaker 3>and then you start to have to get more </v>
<v Speaker 3>weed too to kind of an ad.</v>

1301
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:37.270
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like flooding your system.</v>

1302
00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.610
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that when you smoke weed,</v>

1303
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:44.900
<v Speaker 3>you can you shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you want to do something </v>

1304
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:44.900
<v Speaker 3>creatively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't smoke too much.</v>

1305
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:45.610
<v Speaker 3>You gotta have one hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one hits good.</v>

1306
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:50.820
<v Speaker 3>If you have two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might lose track of what the fuck </v>

1307
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:50.860
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's fun to have two or three,</v>

1308
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:53.530
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part one it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1309
00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I read this or this professor not read </v>
<v Speaker 3>or saw this interview once with this </v>

1310
00:55:58.590 --> 00:55:59.310
<v Speaker 3>professor is a um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1311
00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.010
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1312
00:56:00.011 --> 00:56:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I think he was a physics professor.</v>

1313
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure when he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and he was saying that he </v>

1314
00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:11.010
<v Speaker 3>smokes a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that the key is to not overdo </v>

1315
00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:12.010
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smoked one hit and I go on walks and I</v>

1316
00:56:12.011 --> 00:56:13.870
<v Speaker 3>contemplate my theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1317
00:56:13.871 --> 00:56:17.560
<v Speaker 3>and he says that that one hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says it's like a magical push,</v>

1318
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:20.020
<v Speaker 3>like a little boost just helps give </v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1319
00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:21.100
<v Speaker 3>give some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little momentum,</v>

1320
00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:22.720
<v Speaker 3>little wind in his sails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1321
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:25.060
<v Speaker 3>and it starts the ball rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1322
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.170
<v Speaker 3>don't you ever think that like sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're creating something,</v>

1323
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to do something and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not smoking weed and you're like,</v>

1324
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:34.651
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I get anywhere and then you smoke a </v>

1325
00:56:34.651 --> 00:56:34.651
<v Speaker 3>little weed and then also Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1326
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:40.640
<v Speaker 4>The main thing I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just gives you a different </v>

1327
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:40.640
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the same idea that you,</v>

1328
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.840
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're thinking almost like you're </v>

1329
00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:44.840
<v Speaker 4>multitasking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're thinking one way this way and you</v>

1330
00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.790
<v Speaker 4>smoke weed and you can think of it a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different way and that's one of the only</v>

1331
00:56:47.791 --> 00:56:49.320
<v Speaker 4>ways you could ever do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1332
00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:53.100
<v Speaker 4>it's changing your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you probably do it on cough syrup</v>

1333
00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.720
<v Speaker 4>and think of it a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1334
00:56:54.721 --> 00:56:55.480
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we,</v>

1335
00:56:55.590 --> 00:57:00.590
<v Speaker 4>I think is most effective and fastest </v>
<v Speaker 4>and reliable because you're so used to </v>

1336
00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:00.590
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

1337
00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:02.810
<v Speaker 3>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Carlin had an interesting take on</v>

1338
00:57:02.811 --> 00:57:04.310
<v Speaker 3>writing what he would do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is right,</v>

1339
00:57:04.311 --> 00:57:09.311
<v Speaker 3>who would write everything first sober,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he would smoke a joint and go </v>

1340
00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:13.241
<v Speaker 3>over it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is kind of interesting </v>

1341
00:57:13.241 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 3>because it's kind of like he put up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>skeleton of the house first and then he </v>

1342
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 3>starts adding up.</v>

1343
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:17.370
<v Speaker 4>Don't do it the other way around that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because then it always sucks,</v>

1344
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if you,</v>

1345
00:57:21.031 --> 00:57:22.300
<v Speaker 4>if you die</v>

1346
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:27.450
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you can come up with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit and then if you go over it </v>

1347
00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:27.450
<v Speaker 3>sober you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1348
00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:28.630
<v Speaker 3>this is too ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you can edit it.</v>

1349
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.030
<v Speaker 3>I think the combination of the two is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's important.</v>

1350
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1351
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's necessary which </v>
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>

1352
00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:38.930
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think thinking of the idea sober and </v>

1353
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:41.310
<v Speaker 4>then going off on the idea stoned always</v>
<v Speaker 4>helps.</v>

1354
00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.600
<v Speaker 4>I have better odds that way.</v>

1355
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I think,</v>

1356
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might want to do that with my writing.</v>

1357
00:57:45.811 --> 00:57:47.880
<v Speaker 3>I might want to label it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1358
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:52.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like s t and s o stoned and sober and </v>

1359
00:57:53.341 --> 00:57:54.760
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'll write s,</v>

1360
00:57:54.761 --> 00:57:55.920
<v Speaker 3>t e s o,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1361
00:57:55.921 --> 00:57:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I did it stone and edited sober or like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1362
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:59.690
<v Speaker 3>sos to.</v>

1363
00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:05.030
<v Speaker 4>I have some funny stone jokes that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>write and I look at them and they are </v>

1364
00:58:05.251 --> 00:58:07.070
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me see if I could pick out one</v>

1365
00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 3>real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bit that I do in my act.</v>

1366
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:15.690
<v Speaker 3>That is totally true that I wrote down </v>
<v Speaker 3>something when I was high and then I </v>

1367
00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:18.721
<v Speaker 3>went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to read it when I was sober and it's </v>

1368
00:58:18.721 --> 00:58:18.730
<v Speaker 3>like a unicorn is a donkey from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1369
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I looked at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could I have ever possibly thought </v>

1370
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.750
<v Speaker 3>that that was something that I needed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>write down?</v>

1371
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:29.340
<v Speaker 3>That is for sure a sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sure sign that I got way too fucked </v>

1372
00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:29.340
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1373
00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.820
<v Speaker 3>Here's one of my stone jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marble,</v>

1374
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:33.550
<v Speaker 3>marble industry has to be hurting right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1375
00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:39.410
<v Speaker 4>Remember when you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck does marbles nowadays?</v>

1376
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.740
<v Speaker 4>That's actually funny.</v>

1377
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:44.560
<v Speaker 3>That really is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

1378
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:48.910
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is I would have to</v>

1380
00:58:52.371 --> 00:58:54.950
<v Speaker 3>like start out sober and then step off </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage,</v>

1381
00:58:55.190 --> 00:59:00.190
<v Speaker 3>go outside and get high and that's when </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cops grabbed me because mother </v>

1382

<v Speaker 4>he laying in.</v>

1384
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:04.611
<v Speaker 4>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The words on twitter is when you find </v>

1385
00:59:04.611 --> 00:59:04.800
<v Speaker 4>out that you're following a fake Lisa </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kudrow,</v>

1386
00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:09.980
<v Speaker 4>you feel ashamed and disgusted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not ashamed that you were </v>

1387
00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:09.980
<v Speaker 4>following her to begin with.</v>

1388
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.780
<v Speaker 3>I follow everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

1389
00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no one that I follow a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of real dummies,</v>

1390
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:20.630
<v Speaker 3>a lot of really dumb celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really annoying an end to </v>

1391
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:26.020
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I follow people that like give out like </v>

1392
00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.051
<v Speaker 3>really patronizing advice and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous God quotes and just really </v>

1393
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.870
<v Speaker 3>dumb shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1394
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:32.900
<v Speaker 3>twit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some really dumb shit.</v>

1395
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Deepak Chopra is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of this stuff is just like,</v>

1396
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:40.940
<v Speaker 3>why are you fucking talking about Deepak</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chopra?</v>

1397
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:43.640
<v Speaker 3>You don't know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like some really famous authors.</v>

1398
00:59:43.641 --> 00:59:46.570
<v Speaker 3>Like a ace has a lot of brilliant shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I've,</v>

1399
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:49.280
<v Speaker 3>let's do a lot of his interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says a lot of brilliant shit,</v>

1400
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.310
<v Speaker 3>but God damn some of his tweets make me </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to kick him in the Dick.</v>

1401
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.550
<v Speaker 3>The balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's missing the balance.</v>

1402
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.840
<v Speaker 3>My friends</v>

1403
01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:02.520
<v Speaker 3>take a Brownie at the start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a bad idea,</v>

1404
01:00:02.521 --> 01:00:07.521
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with brownies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brownies and comedy do not mix my </v>

1405
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:11.001
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I took a Brownie at the start of my </v>

1406
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:11.001
<v Speaker 3>act and our end of the act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the Brownie kicked in,</v>

1407
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:13.320
<v Speaker 3>I would be so high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not be able to function.</v>

1408
01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:14.940
<v Speaker 3>When I get really high on brownies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1409
01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:17.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't want him to be talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to talk to people.</v>

1410
01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 3>That stuff's too strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't trust edibles.</v>

1411
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:25.930
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like doing small amounts of </v>

1412
01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:27.651
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms now to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes I feel like I'm really </v>

1413
01:00:27.651 --> 01:00:27.750
<v Speaker 3>tripping and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1414
01:00:27.751 --> 01:00:28.920
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1415
01:00:28.921 --> 01:00:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1416
01:00:29.521 --> 01:00:29.940
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1417
01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.160
<v Speaker 3>the eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is spooky man.</v>

1418
01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:34.140
<v Speaker 3>And for people that don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creates something.</v>

1419
01:00:34.141 --> 01:00:36.630
<v Speaker 3>When you eat it called 11 hydroxy </v>
<v Speaker 3>metabolite,</v>

1420
01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.330
<v Speaker 3>that's four times stronger than thc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you eat,</v>

1421
01:00:39.331 --> 01:00:42.000
<v Speaker 3>it literally is a totally different drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>than when you smoke it.</v>

1422
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:43.650
<v Speaker 3>That's why people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they eat brownies,</v>

1423
01:00:43.651 --> 01:00:45.630
<v Speaker 3>they always think they got laced with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1424
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can't do that.</v>

1425
01:00:47.551 --> 01:00:50.070
<v Speaker 3>So that's the answer to that question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way I could eat a Brownie,</v>

1426
01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:55.250
<v Speaker 3>go onstage than an hour in the brown </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks in because then I would just want </v>

1427
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:57.210
<v Speaker 3>to lie on my back on stage and start </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the universe and you know,</v>

1428
01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:02.480
<v Speaker 3>some people might be into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there'd be a lot of people that </v>

1429
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:02.480
<v Speaker 3>would leave and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking show sucked.</v>

1430
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.930
<v Speaker 3>It was really funny for like an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he just started talking crazy.</v>

1431
01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.040
<v Speaker 3>He's lying on his back saying it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to everything and people would</v>

1432
01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:12.540
<v Speaker 3>just not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not enjoy it.</v>

1433
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Just take a social dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1434
01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:19.041
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't figure out what a social dose </v>

1435
01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:22.791
<v Speaker 3>is because you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're making the brownies </v>

1436
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:22.791
<v Speaker 3>yourself and then even if you make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brahmins yourself,</v>

1437
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:26.901
<v Speaker 3>you could fuck up the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get it too strong and I don't have </v>

1438
01:01:26.901 --> 01:01:27.570
<v Speaker 3>that time to be mastering the right dose</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Brownie.</v>

1439
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Smoking is the way to go.</v>

1440
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:30.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1441
01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved you in Calgary to jen Ab.</v>

1442
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Calgary was the shit that was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1443
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.130
<v Speaker 3>That was a good fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A stone universe tour.</v>

1444
01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should do that.</v>

1445
01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would really be cool.</v>

1446
01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now we can't do it,</v>

1447
01:01:45.481 --> 01:01:48.960
<v Speaker 3>but eventually when I get to a point </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we can do stone shows,</v>

1448
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:54.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I could do a show like somewhere </v>

1449
01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.070
<v Speaker 3>like in Amsterdam they have those cafes </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they allow you to smoke weed.</v>

1450
01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:59.460
<v Speaker 3>If we had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a place like that in America.</v>

1451
01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully in November.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1452
01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully in November,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't buy it,</v>

1453
01:02:03.271 --> 01:02:08.271
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you don't think that's going to </v>

1454
01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:10.011
<v Speaker 3>fucking put the Kibosh on that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the drug movement is </v>

1455
01:02:10.051 --> 01:02:14.220
<v Speaker 3>that making drugs illegal is good for </v>
<v Speaker 3>business and making drugs.</v>

1456
01:02:14.221 --> 01:02:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Legal puts a lot of people out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He puts the dea out of work.</v>

1457
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:20.880
<v Speaker 3>It puts private prisons of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It puts prison guards out of work.</v>

1458
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.360
<v Speaker 3>It puts parole officers and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>police officers.</v>

1459
01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Literally 50 percent of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in prison are in prison for </v>

1460
01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:33.831
<v Speaker 3>nonviolent drug offenses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of those are weed and what </v>

1461
01:02:33.831 --> 01:02:33.831
<v Speaker 3>happens when we become illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1462
01:02:33.831 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking colossal mess.</v>

1463
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:40.410
<v Speaker 3>So what they're doing by keeping it </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal is really protecting business.</v>

1464
01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:45.411
<v Speaker 3>And it sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like nobody will be doing </v>

1465
01:02:45.411 --> 01:02:45.411
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way the government staff fuck</v>

1466
01:02:45.411 --> 01:02:45.720
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1467
01:02:45.721 --> 01:02:47.220
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fucked up.</v>

1468
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:51.060
<v Speaker 3>That literally is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why it's still illegal is all</v>

1469
01:02:51.061 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 3>because of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one dying.</v>

1470
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:58.340
<v Speaker 3>There's no one getting cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one losing their fucking </v>

1471
01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:58.340
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no yet.</v>

1472
01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.451
<v Speaker 3>It's still illegal when you can go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cvs and buy jugs of wine and cheap </v>

1473
01:03:02.451 --> 01:03:06.921
<v Speaker 3>liquor and cartons of cigarettes and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could smoke cigarettes and drink </v>

1474
01:03:06.921 --> 01:03:07.680
<v Speaker 3>yourself to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Easy,</v>

1475
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.260
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1476
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.660
<v Speaker 3>literally you can't die with pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can't.</v>

1477
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could do something really </v>

1478
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:16.880
<v Speaker 3>stupid when you're stoned and wind up </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing yourself,</v>

1479
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.511
<v Speaker 3>but if you're that dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably would've done something </v>

1480
01:03:20.511 --> 01:03:20.511
<v Speaker 3>stupid anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1481
01:03:20.511 --> 01:03:20.660
<v Speaker 2>And when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't dye pot though,</v>

1482
01:03:20.661 --> 01:03:25.661
<v Speaker 2>you could totally die if you say start </v>
<v Speaker 2>panicking because your stone and then </v>

1483
01:03:25.661 --> 01:03:27.260
<v Speaker 2>your heart had a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Die.</v>

1484
01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you?</v>

1485
01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.770
<v Speaker 2>You would you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't think that ever happened?</v>

1486
01:03:30.771 --> 01:03:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Somebody got sue stone started freaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1487
01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Then there are heart fails or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of it.</v>

1488
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they can't be saying that.</v>

1489
01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:40.930
<v Speaker 2>The weed is like,</v>

1490
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.800
<v Speaker 3>let's look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

1491
01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 3>let's Google this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a week ass</v>

1492
01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:46.200
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weak as weak ass.</v>

1493
01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:48.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to google weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Attack.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heart attack.</v>

1495
01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:49.710
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1496
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can Marijuana caused harm tech?</v>

1497
01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Yahoo answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

1498
01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:02.350
<v Speaker 3>Marijuana said the trigger heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks.</v>

1499
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just wiki answers.</v>

1500
01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Wiki answers a stupid because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like answer.</v>

1501
01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:11.740
<v Speaker 3>That's how I thought that that whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the killer whales used to kill people.</v>

1502
01:04:11.741 --> 01:04:16.741
<v Speaker 3>I read this online a couple of different</v>
<v Speaker 3>places to killer whales used to kill </v>

1503
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:21.031
<v Speaker 3>people until World War II and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were using the whales as target </v>

1504
01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:21.031
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read this online and I talked about</v>

1505
01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:25.771
<v Speaker 3>on the Adam Carolla show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even though I said I don't know if </v>

1506
01:04:25.771 --> 01:04:28.471
<v Speaker 3>it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read it online that after World War </v>

1507
01:04:28.471 --> 01:04:28.471
<v Speaker 3>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the bombers,</v>

1508
01:04:28.471 --> 01:04:29.980
<v Speaker 3>killer whales stop killing human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually started saving,</v>

1509
01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.720
<v Speaker 3>which would be really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on a second.</v>

1510
01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:35.050
<v Speaker 3>But it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just fucking wicky answers,</v>

1511
01:04:35.051 --> 01:04:37.090
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some crazy whaling guy on wiki answers.</v>

1512
01:04:37.091 --> 01:04:39.610
<v Speaker 3>And I had to like chase it down on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>website.</v>

1513
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Marijuana said the trigger heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks,</v>

1514
01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard,</v>

1515
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:48.690
<v Speaker 2>five times the amount of having a heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack</v>

1516
01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:53.730
<v Speaker 3>in the first hour after smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person's risk of heart attack could </v>

1517
01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:54.970
<v Speaker 3>rise almost five times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>

1518
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:56.800
<v Speaker 3>That's if you're a weak ass bitch</v>

1519
01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:00.820
<v Speaker 2>or if you're just one step away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a heart attack because they eat a</v>

1520
01:05:00.821 --> 01:05:01.660
<v Speaker 2>lot of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1521
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:06.670
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And careful we guess bitches don't want </v>

1522
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:08.430
<v Speaker 2>to write this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be careful where you use.</v>

1523
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:11.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why we didn't say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana's are killed when.</v>

1524
01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.570
<v Speaker 2>True it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't.</v>

1525
01:05:13.571 --> 01:05:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Employees and anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't,</v>

1526
01:05:15.341 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have other problems and</v>

1527
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:23.040
<v Speaker 4>he smoked weed or absolutely you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing could happen if you lik </v>

1528
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.070
<v Speaker 4>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you get him out,</v>

1529
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:26.090
<v Speaker 4>there might be something allergic on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoe that,</v>

1530
01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:30.670
<v Speaker 4>that could trigger off a sinus infection</v>
<v Speaker 4>that will make you die.</v>

1531
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.110
<v Speaker 4>I really don't know where you're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this.</v>

1532
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

1533
01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:38.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just told her that careful weak ass</v>

1534
01:05:38.941 --> 01:05:40.860
<v Speaker 3>bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana can give you a heart attack if</v>

1535
01:05:40.861 --> 01:05:42.780
<v Speaker 3>your ticker socks and you can read the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1536
01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1537
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:48.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you really got to get a heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack from weed because you're freaking</v>

1538
01:05:48.421 --> 01:05:53.421
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that there's another </v>

1539
01:05:53.421 --> 01:05:56.031
<v Speaker 3>problem though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is that you're in </v>

1540
01:05:56.031 --> 01:05:56.031
<v Speaker 3>terrible shape and you need to take care</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your body.</v>

1541
01:05:56.031 --> 01:05:56.280
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not pot.</v>

1542
01:05:56.550 --> 01:06:01.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the way I've always described </v>

1543
01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:02.090
<v Speaker 3>pot not being able to help dumb people </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you can't,</v>

1544
01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:05.190
<v Speaker 3>you put jet fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jet fuel and a fucking lawnmower.</v>

1545
01:06:05.191 --> 01:06:06.670
<v Speaker 3>It's still a lawnmower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1546
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:11.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put jet fuel in a jet and it's </v>

1547
01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:11.890
<v Speaker 3>pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line is,</v>

1548
01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:16.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about what kind of hardware </v>

1549
01:06:16.371 --> 01:06:16.371
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people just have wheat brains.</v>

1550
01:06:16.371 --> 01:06:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Their brains just suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1551
01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:20.310
<v Speaker 3>have you ever met people and you look in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their eye and you're talking to them and</v>

1552
01:06:20.311 --> 01:06:20.970
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1553
01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.510
<v Speaker 3>like there's no hope for this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This dude's just doll.</v>

1554
01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm looking in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making any connection.</v>

1555
01:06:25.811 --> 01:06:28.290
<v Speaker 3>And just like talking to a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like a fucking idiot.</v>

1556
01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.530
<v Speaker 3>There are people and people don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>admit this for whatever reason,</v>

1557
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:33.480
<v Speaker 3>because there are people that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb.</v>

1558
01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.510
<v Speaker 3>They're just troubled and their lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>have fallen apart because they,</v>

1559
01:06:36.511 --> 01:06:37.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1560
01:06:37.081 --> 01:06:39.160
<v Speaker 3>they've got all sorts of issues and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1561
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:39.750
<v Speaker 3>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1562
01:06:39.751 --> 01:06:41.640
<v Speaker 3>that guy's a retard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not really retired.</v>

1563
01:06:41.641 --> 01:06:42.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of smart.</v>

1564
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.650
<v Speaker 3>There are people like that that are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>troubled and fucked up and you know,</v>

1565
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.730
<v Speaker 3>perhaps they never figured out what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is in this life that they're good for us</v>

1566
01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:49.380
<v Speaker 3>should be doing.</v>

1567
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:54.620
<v Speaker 3>But there's definitely people with cas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine volt brains that are just supposed </v>

1568
01:06:54.661 --> 01:06:58.500
<v Speaker 3>to be out there digging ditches and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deny that it's just unscientific.</v>

1569
01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.930
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the entire fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>

1570
01:07:00.931 --> 01:07:05.931
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about things improving and </v>

1571
01:07:05.931 --> 01:07:05.931
<v Speaker 3>getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at human beings,</v>

1572
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.180
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of programs and things</v>

1573
01:07:09.181 --> 01:07:12.150
<v Speaker 3>set up to make sure that the week can </v>
<v Speaker 3>still survive.</v>

1574
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:14.460
<v Speaker 3>They don't drop off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when that happens,</v>

1575
01:07:14.461 --> 01:07:19.461
<v Speaker 3>you're going to create a bunch of dumb </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and having those dumb people </v>

1576
01:07:19.461 --> 01:07:19.461
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1577
01:07:19.461 --> 01:07:20.460
<v Speaker 3>they all fit their purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all here for a reason.</v>

1578
01:07:20.461 --> 01:07:22.410
<v Speaker 3>But if you're going to have a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nikolai Tesla,</v>

1579
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.330
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1580
01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:28.331
<v Speaker 3>an Einstein for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have dick ditch diggers </v>

1581
01:07:28.331 --> 01:07:28.840
<v Speaker 3>dudes who are here to ditch Dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick's,</v>

1582
01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Dick's,</v>

1583
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:32.670
<v Speaker 4>you'll have ditches you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably,</v>

1584
01:07:32.671 --> 01:07:37.671
<v Speaker 4>they'd set the retard are so low in like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 19 hundreds that they just haven't </v>

1585
01:07:37.981 --> 01:07:39.060
<v Speaker 4>raised it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1586
01:07:39.061 --> 01:07:41.580
<v Speaker 4>there should be maybe a test or two that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>

1587
01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:44.700
<v Speaker 4>we haven't been doing that makes people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are considered dumb.</v>

1588
01:07:44.701 --> 01:07:45.870
<v Speaker 4>They're just retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1589
01:07:45.871 --> 01:07:46.500
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1590
01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:47.850
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm talking about?</v>

1591
01:07:47.851 --> 01:07:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Like this person is so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are retarded.</v>

1592
01:07:50.221 --> 01:07:52.710
<v Speaker 4>But you know that their loved one's </v>
<v Speaker 4>passed away for</v>

1593
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.320
<v Speaker 3>want to say that because we want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1594
01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:56.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give people a chance and you know,</v>

1595
01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.010
<v Speaker 3>everyone's got a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are.</v>

1596
01:07:58.011 --> 01:08:00.710
<v Speaker 3>There are certain people where it's very</v>
<v Speaker 3>much cultural.</v>

1597
01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.010
<v Speaker 3>It's very much they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1598
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:07.200
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're raised in an environment where </v>

1599
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.971
<v Speaker 3>no one's questioning anything there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their role models are all dunces that </v>

1600
01:08:09.971 --> 01:08:11.690
<v Speaker 3>grew up in a family of people who scream</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yell at each other for no reason.</v>

1601
01:08:11.691 --> 01:08:13.730
<v Speaker 3>And they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they live in this stupid world.</v>

1602
01:08:13.731 --> 01:08:18.731
<v Speaker 3>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they imitate their and they become </v>

1603
01:08:18.731 --> 01:08:18.731
<v Speaker 3>stupid themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1604
01:08:18.731 --> 01:08:18.731
<v Speaker 3>there's people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1605
01:08:18.731 --> 01:08:23.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not an exact science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is there's a lot of </v>

1606
01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:23.620
<v Speaker 3>really fucking dumb people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1607
01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.900
<v Speaker 3>When you see those videos of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that go to those Sarah Pailin,</v>

1608
01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:30.940
<v Speaker 3>book signings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those teabag or people and they're all </v>

1609
01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:30.940
<v Speaker 3>up in arms against the government.</v>

1610
01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:34.100
<v Speaker 3>There are some wooden minds and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>just some doll motherfuckers,</v>

1611
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1612
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:40.001
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really a problem that everybody </v>

1613
01:08:40.001 --> 01:08:40.001
<v Speaker 3>has to have a say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1614
01:08:40.001 --> 01:08:44.381
<v Speaker 3>how do you fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you fix what we got going on as </v>

1615
01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:45.980
<v Speaker 3>far as like the idea of a democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of,</v>

1616
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half the people you know or more have to</v>

1617
01:08:50.121 --> 01:08:54.230
<v Speaker 3>agree or have to have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the idea of a real democracy.</v>

1618
01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:59.231
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if more than 50 percent of people </v>

1619
01:08:59.231 --> 01:08:59.231
<v Speaker 3>retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think they are,</v>

1620
01:08:59.231 --> 01:08:59.231
<v Speaker 3>I would say more than 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than 50 percent.</v>

1621
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:02.840
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck do you move forward?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck do you.</v>

1622
01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.840
<v Speaker 3>The only way to do it is to make those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people smarter,</v>

1623
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.160
<v Speaker 3>is to figure out a way to educate those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to,</v>

1624
01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:12.410
<v Speaker 3>to raise the number of dom raised the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of uninterested,</v>

1625
01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:14.920
<v Speaker 3>uninvolved or 50 percent or retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1626
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.620
<v Speaker 3>like they have bad brains or just </v>
<v Speaker 3>education environment.</v>

1627
01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1628
01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:20.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1629
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:25.690
<v Speaker 2>I know people that are great people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason they just don't </v>

1630
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:29.660
<v Speaker 2>think the same way that other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my other friends do,</v>

1631
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:30.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they don't,</v>

1632
01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.370
<v Speaker 2>they're not thinking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1633
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 2>putting your seatbelt on because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to get in a car accident.</v>

1634
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Just get in the car and just drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1635
01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>

1636
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.340
<v Speaker 2>they just don't have as like a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their brain is not working.</v>

1637
01:09:43.650 --> 01:09:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1638
01:09:44.351 --> 01:09:45.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deep,</v>

1639
01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.850
<v Speaker 2>like just thinking outside the box </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1640
01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 2>if you think that's how they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised,</v>

1641
01:09:49.401 --> 01:09:50.970
<v Speaker 2>is it nature or nurture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1642
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not using the same parts of </v>

1643
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.000
<v Speaker 2>brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their brain,</v>

1644
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>

1645
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think that they have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in him,</v>

1646
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:00.410
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1647
01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

1648
01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.130
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how much of that is due to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

1649
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:07.560
<v Speaker 3>like how much of it is due to pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1650
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:12.590
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is due to what your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother was eating and doing while she </v>

1651
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:13.170
<v Speaker 3>was watching is probably totally that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

1652
01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:15.300
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has to have a big effect.</v>

1653
01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:15.810
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1654
01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you go on Youtube and search </v>
<v Speaker 2>me smoking cigarettes,</v>

1655
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:24.750
<v Speaker 2>you'll see some just guy in West </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia just sit near smoking a </v>

1656
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:25.450
<v Speaker 2>cigarette and you can tell just by </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at him,</v>

1657
01:10:25.451 --> 01:10:26.770
<v Speaker 2>he's retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1658
01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.450
<v Speaker 2>he is probably not considered retarded.</v>

1659
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:30.060
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any can vote.</v>

1660
01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anticonvulsant.</v>

1661
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a conversation.</v>

1662
01:10:32.911 --> 01:10:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I've been having all these conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>about religion on the Robin Board lately</v>

1663
01:10:36.241 --> 01:10:37.980
<v Speaker 3>because all this Catholic scandal that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

1664
01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:43.140
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if you know the latest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've proven that the pope knew </v>

1665
01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.690
<v Speaker 3>about pedophiles and hid the cases that </v>
<v Speaker 3>went before he was the pope,</v>

1666
01:10:45.691 --> 01:10:50.691
<v Speaker 3>that he knew about these pedophile cases</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he did everything that he could to </v>

1667
01:10:50.691 --> 01:10:51.900
<v Speaker 3>shield the information and protect the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The priests.</v>

1668
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.070
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1669
01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:58.100
<v Speaker 3>how could you not think that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic religion as a cult at that </v>

1670
01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:58.100
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that point,</v>

1671
01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:58.610
<v Speaker 3>it's a cult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1672
01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a cold period definition </v>

1673
01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:03.650
<v Speaker 3>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at that point in time you're like,</v>

1674
01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:04.840
<v Speaker 3>how could this possibly be good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1675
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:07.350
<v Speaker 3>if at the very top this kind of shit is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

1676
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.620
<v Speaker 3>how do people get tricked into that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

1677
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:12.360
<v Speaker 3>how was that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1678
01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:13.920
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are people so silly</v>

1679
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 5>that in 2010 this is still considered a </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility?</v>

1680
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe these kid fuckers are on the ball.</v>

1681
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're the ones that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 5>follow.</v>

1682
01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:25.260
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe this crazy organization in Italy,</v>

1683
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.000
<v Speaker 5>maybe they're the masters of all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowledge like that's,</v>

1684
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that nature,</v>

1685
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:32.520
<v Speaker 5>is that nurture?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that.</v>

1686
01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:33.790
<v Speaker 5>It's both.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1687
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:34.670
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>

1688
01:11:34.671 --> 01:11:39.671
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the same thing that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you talk to certain people they don't </v>

1689
01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:39.671
<v Speaker 4>get technology like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1690
01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:41.660
<v Speaker 4>they're not informed as much as other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1691
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.040
<v Speaker 5>Is that nature is that nurture?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean how could people see to me and to</v>

1692
01:11:46.041 --> 01:11:49.580
<v Speaker 5>you when we look at gadgets and new </v>
<v Speaker 5>things like you know what both,</v>

1693
01:11:49.581 --> 01:11:52.070
<v Speaker 5>like Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll find some new thing online,</v>

1694
01:11:52.071 --> 01:11:57.071
<v Speaker 5>like Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at this and they'll send it to me </v>

1695
01:11:57.071 --> 01:11:57.071
<v Speaker 5>or I'll send something to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1696
01:11:57.071 --> 01:11:57.071
<v Speaker 5>and you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1697
01:11:57.071 --> 01:11:57.470
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are they doing?</v>

1698
01:11:57.471 --> 01:12:00.470
<v Speaker 5>Look what they're doing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This multitouch fucking interface.</v>

1699
01:12:00.471 --> 01:12:02.780
<v Speaker 5>Like a minority report type shit or </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything,</v>

1700
01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:06.560
<v Speaker 5>anything new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That stuff becomes fascinating man.</v>

1701
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:07.590
<v Speaker 5>I think though the</v>

1702
01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:12.820
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more we kind of kill off a certain </v>

1703
01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:16.000
<v Speaker 4>age group of people that didn't grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the more people are going to </v>

1704
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.240
<v Speaker 4>research for themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religion and stuff like that.</v>

1705
01:12:17.241 --> 01:12:22.241
<v Speaker 4>I think religion is probably their </v>
<v Speaker 4>future and the religion is probably </v>

1706
01:12:22.241 --> 01:12:23.510
<v Speaker 4>going to be a lot different in say the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next hundred years.</v>

1707
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:25.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever been ever.</v>

1708
01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:30.240
<v Speaker 5>I think it's probably more people have </v>
<v Speaker 5>realized how ridiculous it is now than </v>

1709
01:12:31.061 --> 01:12:32.210
<v Speaker 5>ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1710
01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:37.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's ever been more </v>
<v Speaker 5>questioners and there's probably never </v>

1711
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:37.410
<v Speaker 5>been more options either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1712
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:42.500
<v Speaker 5>with scientology and the moonies and </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything else and new ones that are </v>

1713
01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.441
<v Speaker 5>popping up left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all these new ideologies that </v>

1714
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:46.441
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are popping up left and right.</v>

1715
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:48.490
<v Speaker 5>People are offering like new </v>
<v Speaker 5>alternatives,</v>

1716
01:12:48.491 --> 01:12:52.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it can't last.</v>

1717
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:53.920
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be too much.</v>

1718
01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:57.820
<v Speaker 5>There's gonna come a point in time where</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know the truth.</v>

1719
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
<v Speaker 5>We know it's not going to be something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have to like wonder and make a </v>

1720
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.310
<v Speaker 5>judgment call on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be like,</v>

1721
01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:04.750
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you're full of shit.</v>

1722
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:06.010
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you're lying.</v>

1723
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1724
01:13:06.611 --> 01:13:08.470
<v Speaker 5>The information you're giving me is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>truthful.</v>

1725
01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I can read this and I can understand </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1726
01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:13.960
<v Speaker 5>We have an intuitive sense of what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong and what's right.</v>

1727
01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.350
<v Speaker 5>We also have an intuitive sense of when </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are lying,</v>

1728
01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:22.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when someone is not being honest with </v>

1729
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:22.680
<v Speaker 5>you or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or when you ever been talking to someone</v>

1730
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:26.791
<v Speaker 5>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're secretly hoping that </v>

1731
01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:26.920
<v Speaker 5>something goes wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's some secret hate,</v>

1732
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:28.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you ever been talking to someone</v>

1733
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.930
<v Speaker 4>well on the Internet everyday.</v>

1734
01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1735
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:35.910
<v Speaker 5>you know that feeling where somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>really is like,</v>

1736
01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.670
<v Speaker 5>they're being douchey to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's something there and it's,</v>

1737
01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:42.190
<v Speaker 5>you can't describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you get a feeling from them.</v>

1738
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's instinctual feelings that we </v>

1739
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 5>have and deception is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1740
01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:52.500
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When someone's being deceptive and </v>

1741
01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.340
<v Speaker 5>someone's lying to you or does that not </v>
<v Speaker 5>drive you fucking bananas?</v>

1742
01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.810
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't that drive you crazy?</v>

1743
01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1744
01:13:57.711 --> 01:14:02.711
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to also think that the </v>

1745
01:14:02.711 --> 01:14:03.530
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason why this person's acting like</v>

1746
01:14:03.531 --> 01:14:08.531
<v Speaker 4>this or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because it's something that they </v>

1747
01:14:08.531 --> 01:14:10.721
<v Speaker 4>don't like that you've done to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or is that something that you do or you </v>

1748
01:14:10.721 --> 01:14:10.930
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then you have to eight.</v>

1749
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:14.300
<v Speaker 5>But that's not always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes throwing shortcomings,</v>

1750
01:14:14.301 --> 01:14:16.460
<v Speaker 5>it's causing them to be a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1751
01:14:16.461 --> 01:14:21.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're talking about earlier this </v>

1752
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:21.461
<v Speaker 5>girl that's upset of this other girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1753
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:22.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1754
01:14:22.101 --> 01:14:23.480
<v Speaker 5>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where is that coming from?</v>

1755
01:14:23.481 --> 01:14:25.270
<v Speaker 5>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And no one did anything wrong there.</v>

1756
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:30.470
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like sometimes it's their own </v>

1757
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.470
<v Speaker 5>shortcomings is people choosing you over</v>
<v Speaker 5>another person,</v>

1758
01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:33.380
<v Speaker 5>someone seeing something that someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>else has and saying,</v>

1759
01:14:33.381 --> 01:14:35.450
<v Speaker 5>well that should be me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How can this guy successful?</v>

1760
01:14:35.451 --> 01:14:37.670
<v Speaker 5>How come this girl is so happy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>

1761
01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:40.210
<v Speaker 5>They get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

1762
01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.190
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of shit to human beings </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not logical,</v>

1763
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:44.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1764
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:47.270
<v Speaker 5>but we can feel that when you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>to someone and you.</v>

1765
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many times you talked to a dude,</v>

1766
01:14:49.161 --> 01:14:54.161
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to a bunch of dudes where I </v>

1767
01:14:54.161 --> 01:14:55.631
<v Speaker 5>know there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some weird jealousy hate thing when I'm </v>

1768

<v Speaker 5>talking to them and I tried to be as </v>
<v Speaker 5>nice as friendly as possible and like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you think you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1774
01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:08.580
<v Speaker 5>this rivalry with me because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see me on television and you don't </v>

1775
01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:08.990
<v Speaker 5>like the fact that I'm doing something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you want to do,</v>

1776
01:15:08.991 --> 01:15:10.220
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1777

<v Speaker 5>I'm a dude.</v>

1778
01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:14.480
<v Speaker 5>And the reality is I'm not taking your </v>
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>

1779
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:19.510
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reality is I got this job and the </v>

1780
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.510
<v Speaker 5>other reality is you can get something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it.</v>

1781
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.700
<v Speaker 5>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1782
01:15:19.701 --> 01:15:23.120
<v Speaker 5>you can become exactly like me except </v>
<v Speaker 5>your own version of it.</v>

1783
01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:23.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can.</v>

1784
01:15:23.991 --> 01:15:26.810
<v Speaker 5>Anybody can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody can be successful in any,</v>

1785
01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:32.080
<v Speaker 5>any area that they pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just have to figure out your way </v>

1786
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:32.390
<v Speaker 5>through the fucking path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is possible,</v>

1787
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:33.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1788
01:15:33.471 --> 01:15:38.471
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>muggsy bogues was a fucking basketball </v>

1789
01:15:38.471 --> 01:15:38.471
<v Speaker 5>player who is five foot six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1790
01:15:38.471 --> 01:15:39.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything's possible.</v>

1791
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:40.330
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1792
01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:44.300
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just has to be your own path.</v>

1793
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:46.850
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think human beings especially have</v>

1794
01:15:46.851 --> 01:15:50.810
<v Speaker 5>a real problem being jealous of other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and being upset at other people.</v>

1795
01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.960
<v Speaker 5>But you can what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of my point is that you could feel </v>

1796
01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.001
<v Speaker 5>that when someone does that to you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be able to tell when </v>

1797
01:15:58.001 --> 01:16:00.671
<v Speaker 5>people are lying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to eventually going to be </v>

1798
01:16:00.671 --> 01:16:00.671
<v Speaker 5>able to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's for sure.</v>

1799
01:16:00.671 --> 01:16:04.731
<v Speaker 5>More like something that we're evolving </v>
<v Speaker 5>in us with language and with </v>

1800
01:16:04.761 --> 01:16:08.180
<v Speaker 5>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're figuring out deceptive behavior.</v>

1801
01:16:08.181 --> 01:16:13.181
<v Speaker 5>We're figuring it out because we </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand that we recognize it in </v>

1802
01:16:13.181 --> 01:16:15.470
<v Speaker 5>yourself and the more truthful you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more easy it is to pick out laws and</v>

1803
01:16:15.471 --> 01:16:16.400
<v Speaker 5>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1804
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:21.590
<v Speaker 4>and just so much information to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just like twitter alone is </v>

1805
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:25.511
<v Speaker 4>probably killed a million relationships </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a million rumors too and then I </v>

1806
01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:30.780
<v Speaker 4>can't do anything nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like imagine being married and imagine </v>

1807
01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:34.091
<v Speaker 4>going to a bar and then you'd meet as </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl and you start talking to her and </v>

1808
01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:34.910
<v Speaker 4>somebody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh hey,</v>

1809
01:16:34.911 --> 01:16:38.090
<v Speaker 4>there's that person takes a photo of you</v>
<v Speaker 4>puts it on their twitter.</v>

1810
01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Now you are just being caught in front </v>
<v Speaker 4>of 5 million people.</v>

1811
01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.630
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>

1812
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:49.810
<v Speaker 4>You pretty much have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We going to have to all have to start </v>

1813
01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:49.810
<v Speaker 4>wearing disguises like fake mustaches </v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>

1814
01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 4>And I know it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be like that</v>

1815
01:16:52.090 --> 01:16:54.520

<v Speaker 3>And we're programming</v>

1834
01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:34.550
<v Speaker 4>what does not even cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you could have just met this person</v>

1835
01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:37.730
<v Speaker 4>at a bar set high and just started </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking.</v>

1836
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:39.040
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mr.</v>

1837
01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:42.530
<v Speaker 4>camera phone behind you took a picture </v>
<v Speaker 4>of you and now you're fucking,</v>

1838
01:17:42.531 --> 01:17:44.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't like shit's all crazy.</v>

1839
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:45.570
<v Speaker 4>You can't do any short.</v>

1840
01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.070
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is,</v>

1841
01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:50.040
<v Speaker 3>the reason why it's an issue at all is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that human beings,</v>

1842
01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:55.041
<v Speaker 3>especially men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are wired to try to populate an entire </v>

1843
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:55.140
<v Speaker 3>village because that's how the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>sperm survives.</v>

1844
01:17:55.500 --> 01:18:00.500
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why all these crazy conquer </v>

1845
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:00.500
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers like tiger woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1846
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.640
<v Speaker 3>these guys that are so uber competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I had so many checks,</v>

1847
01:18:02.641 --> 01:18:04.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like guys just doing nature.</v>

1848
01:18:04.951 --> 01:18:07.890
<v Speaker 3>He spread his seed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this was 2000 years ago,</v>

1849
01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:10.950
<v Speaker 3>that would be totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like an offshoot,</v>

1850
01:18:11.370 --> 01:18:14.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an offshoot of a,</v>

1851
01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking warrior instincts,</v>

1852
01:18:16.741 --> 01:18:21.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's out there conquering and then he's </v>

1853
01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:21.741
<v Speaker 3>conquering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1854
01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:23.640
<v Speaker 3>he's doing what he's supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like driving forward.</v>

1855
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:28.290
<v Speaker 3>Women are wired to grab a man and keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>him for protection.</v>

1856
01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true too.</v>

1857
01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:33.300
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sex addiction is total bullshit.</v>

1858
01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:35.120
<v Speaker 3>Is it you sex addicted</v>

1859
01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:40.190
<v Speaker 4>mother would have to disagree because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know some people that are totally </v>

1860
01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:40.190
<v Speaker 4>addicted to sex and a different level </v>
<v Speaker 4>than I am.</v>

1861
01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.700
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never met some friends of mine.</v>

1862
01:18:42.701 --> 01:18:45.070
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever talk about the Saran wrap or</v>
<v Speaker 4>the</v>

1863
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:46.890
<v Speaker 3>lotion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1864
01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:51.980
<v Speaker 3>you said talking about front who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should do a thing called shooting </v>

1865
01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:54.840
<v Speaker 3>and what he would do is he would get </v>
<v Speaker 3>these running pants,</v>

1866
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:58.170
<v Speaker 3>like those on those really thin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like,</v>

1867
01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:02.580
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a nylon nylon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really silky running pants.</v>

1868
01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:07.730
<v Speaker 3>And he would literally rub the crotch </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a fine grit sandpaper and,</v>

1869
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.000
<v Speaker 3>and then he would a baby oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his balls and his shit is junk and baby </v>

1870
01:19:15.511 --> 01:19:16.260
<v Speaker 3>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1871
01:19:16.261 --> 01:19:21.261
<v Speaker 3>So it's all nice and slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he takes this super thin running </v>

1872
01:19:21.421 --> 01:19:24.000
<v Speaker 3>pants and he puts them on over his baby </v>
<v Speaker 3>oiled shit.</v>

1873
01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:29.090
<v Speaker 3>And then would go get lap dances and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just shooting this past </v>

1874
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:30.350
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] girl would be hot and she'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>be riding on.</v>

1875
01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:32.670
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was literally like sex,</v>

1876
01:19:32.671 --> 01:19:35.340
<v Speaker 3>like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had,</v>

1877
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 3>he was like obsessed with his work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has his own company and so he would </v>

1878
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:41.600
<v Speaker 3>work like these long hours and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1879
01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:42.800
<v Speaker 3>he was really successful.</v>

1880
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:46.290
<v Speaker 3>Millionaire had the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No big fucking house in the hills.</v>

1881
01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:51.320
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had the whole package and he worked </v>

1882
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.170
<v Speaker 3>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so he had no time for </v>

1883
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:56.601
<v Speaker 3>relationships and he like had some bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences with women so he thought </v>

1884
01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:58.860
<v Speaker 3>women were just trying to rip him off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this chip that he was dating,</v>

1885
01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:03.861
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wound up cheating on him and he </v>

1886
01:20:03.861 --> 01:20:05.571
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got his heart crush so he just </v>

1887
01:20:05.571 --> 01:20:05.571
<v Speaker 3>decided to just go shooting and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be his day.</v>

1888
01:20:05.571 --> 01:20:05.910
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1889
01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:07.500
<v Speaker 3>go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>work day.</v>

1890
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Then he would get something to eat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he would go shooting or he would go</v>

1891
01:20:11.351 --> 01:20:16.351
<v Speaker 3>shooting on the way home and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would get something to eat and then go </v>

1892
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:16.351
<v Speaker 3>to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it all over again.</v>

1893
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:20.021
<v Speaker 3>And that was his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of his relationships were lap </v>

1894
01:20:20.021 --> 01:20:20.021
<v Speaker 3>dances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would just go,</v>

1895
01:20:20.021 --> 01:20:20.470
<v Speaker 3>we got caught eventually.</v>

1896
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Did any or he fucked up once and he went</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he put too much baby oil or I think </v>

1897
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:27.790
<v Speaker 3>he used lube and literally his pants </v>
<v Speaker 3>were soaked.</v>

1898
01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.580
<v Speaker 3>And so the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the girl sat,</v>

1899
01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:31.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck would she like?</v>

1900
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:32.230
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pissed himself,</v>

1901
01:20:32.231 --> 01:20:33.250
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1902
01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.300
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1903
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:37.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said I was so embarrassed and he left</v>

1904
01:20:37.031 --> 01:20:41.770
<v Speaker 3>and he leaves with this puddle and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>pants of baby oil and move and it's like</v>

1905
01:20:41.771 --> 01:20:46.771
<v Speaker 3>dripping into his socks and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a Dixon Dixon mean.</v>

1906
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:50.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's into massages.</v>

1907
01:20:50.771 --> 01:20:54.070
<v Speaker 3>He was into like big rewarded for his </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard work.</v>

1908
01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:59.220
<v Speaker 3>He was into like fine food and massages </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if prostitution was legal he would </v>

1909
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:00.240
<v Speaker 3>just hire a hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if there's like a,</v>

1910
01:21:00.490 --> 01:21:02.650
<v Speaker 3>if it was like an acceptable normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to do,</v>

1911
01:21:02.651 --> 01:21:04.600
<v Speaker 3>like you've lived in some foreign </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

1912
01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:05.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1913
01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:06.250
<v Speaker 3>they allow prostitution.</v>

1914
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:08.950
<v Speaker 3>He would just go to the prostitutes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get serviced and then go home.</v>

1915
01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:10.810
<v Speaker 3>You know there's a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1916
01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:16.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand how people have </v>

1917
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.530
<v Speaker 3>allowed that to be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you stop that?</v>

1918
01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Why do you stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop people.</v>

1919
01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Health reasons I think you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking aids going ramp.</v>

1920
01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:29.120
<v Speaker 3>It hurt everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having herpes really though is that </v>

1921
01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:29.260
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you go to brothels,</v>

1922
01:21:29.261 --> 01:21:31.570
<v Speaker 3>they have to check those girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They test those girls.</v>

1923
01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:34.210
<v Speaker 3>If you go to a brothel in a country </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's respectable,</v>

1924
01:21:34.211 --> 01:21:36.970
<v Speaker 3>supposedly they're testing those girls </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like they test porn stars,</v>

1925
01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:42.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a good argument </v>

1926
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:42.330
<v Speaker 3>because I think that if you're paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention more,</v>

1927
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:43.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot safer than if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1928
01:21:43.721 --> 01:21:46.300
<v Speaker 3>if it's some fucking underground thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>where these,</v>

1929
01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:51.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a lot of violence that </v>

1930
01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:51.340
<v Speaker 3>comes with it too though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1931
01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.010
<v Speaker 3>people going a little bit too far and </v>
<v Speaker 3>raping the person falling.</v>

1932
01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.510
<v Speaker 3>But if wouldn't it be safer if they did </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in a brothel where their security and</v>

1933
01:21:55.511 --> 01:21:58.290
<v Speaker 3>when people get screened and they know </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's not crazy,</v>

1934
01:21:58.690 --> 01:21:59.770
<v Speaker 3>purity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're everywhere.</v>

1935
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:05.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes much more sense to me than </v>

1936
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.710
<v Speaker 3>some poor girl has to put a fucking add </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some magazine and then show up.</v>

1937
01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:07.330
<v Speaker 3>Normally that girl that came to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store,</v>

1938
01:22:07.331 --> 01:22:08.170
<v Speaker 3>one night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk to her,</v>

1939
01:22:08.171 --> 01:22:11.680
<v Speaker 3>she said she was a hooker and she would </v>
<v Speaker 3>respond to ads and she would,</v>

1940
01:22:11.681 --> 01:22:13.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would only go to them,</v>

1941
01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:18.061
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wouldn't let them come to her as I </v>

1942
01:22:18.061 --> 01:22:19.411
<v Speaker 3>would have worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would go to them so that she had an </v>

1943
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:19.411
<v Speaker 3>address,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1944
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:19.420
<v Speaker 3>and she would tell her friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1945
01:22:19.421 --> 01:22:21.080
<v Speaker 3>this is where I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if anything happens to me,</v>

1946

<v Speaker 3>I think there'll be a lot less crime.</v>

1958

<v Speaker 3>There will be certainly way less rapes </v>

1962
01:22:56.501 --> 01:23:00.010
<v Speaker 3>like there wouldn't be this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this overwhelming desire to be with</v>

1963
01:23:00.011 --> 01:23:05.011
<v Speaker 3>someone just to have sex because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could always have sex so you could just </v>

1964
01:23:05.011 --> 01:23:05.011
<v Speaker 3>pay for it if you want to.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people,</v>

1985

<v Speaker 3>they're all go get them to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they're immigrants.</v>

1987
01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:52.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grandparents were immigrants and </v>

1988
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:52.690
<v Speaker 3>they moved there from another country </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not some serious.</v>

1989
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Go get them shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take all your stuff,</v>

01:23:53.541 --> 01:23:55.490
<v Speaker 3>pack it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in a boat,</v>

1991
01:23:55.730 --> 01:24:00.730
<v Speaker 3>sail across the fucking world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and starting some new place and learn </v>

1992
01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:05.381
<v Speaker 3>the language and learn how to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how go get these people were.</v>

1993
01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:07.910
<v Speaker 3>So the people that initially came to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country on the east coast,</v>

1994
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:10.940
<v Speaker 3>those are all savages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the people that went west or all the</v>

1995
01:24:10.941 --> 01:24:13.580
<v Speaker 3>people that want to get away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>establishes all the people were like,</v>

01:24:15.861 --> 01:24:19.640
<v Speaker 3>And they all took off and the furthest </v>
<v Speaker 3>they could get was here.</v>

1998
01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.760
<v Speaker 3>That's why people in California are like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most laid back in the most </v>

1999
01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:24.760
<v Speaker 3>progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2000
01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:29.141
<v Speaker 3>it literally is because they're the ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are the ancestors of the ones that </v>

2001
01:24:29.141 --> 01:24:29.141
<v Speaker 3>wanted to get the fuck away from where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

2002

<v Speaker 1>next time you're in Houston.</v>

2004

2005
01:24:37.951 --> 01:24:42.951
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd probably still get </v>

2006
01:24:42.951 --> 01:24:43.380
<v Speaker 1>diseases within running pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a listen,</v>

01:24:43.381 --> 01:24:45.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an excellent possibility.</v>

2008
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I should add that whole story to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

2009
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Vegas routine.</v>

2018
01:25:21.081 --> 01:25:24.020
<v Speaker 1>so you should have no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's a new version.</v>

2019
01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder though,</v>

<v Speaker 1>one or is it the exact same sense if,</v>

2022
01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.880
<v Speaker 1>if the PC ones better used to be that </v>

<v Speaker 1>It definitely used to be.</v>

2025
01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.740
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2026

2073
01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to page one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She questions we've got here.</v>

2074
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:05.770
<v Speaker 3>How do you think the world would turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>out if it were to be divided by </v>

2075
01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:09.671
<v Speaker 3>believers and nonbelievers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would the believers eventually end up </v>

2076
01:28:09.671 --> 01:28:11.510
<v Speaker 3>just raping and murdering the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonbelievers into their cult?</v>

2077
01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I hate these questions.</v>

2078
01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:20.960
<v Speaker 3>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real problem with believers and </v>

2079
01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:20.960
<v Speaker 3>nonbelievers is nobody fucking knows you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>

2080
01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.860
<v Speaker 3>and nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be a goddamn believer.</v>

2081
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:25.320
<v Speaker 3>We should it be a questionnaire which </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to figure things out,</v>

2082
01:28:25.321 --> 01:28:30.321
<v Speaker 3>but what I need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever anybody tells you they got the </v>

2083
01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 3>answers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person's either full of shit or </v>

<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

2085
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 3>No one has the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

2086
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.140
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

2087
01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Have I listened to any Daniel Dennett </v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures?</v>

2088
01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.540
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who Daniel Dennett is.</v>

2089
01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Do you know dental than it is now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will never find information.</v>

2090
01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Some more information.</v>

2091
01:28:47.230 --> 01:28:52.230
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't go off on me about the last </v>

2092
01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:52.230
<v Speaker 2>APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Podcast.</v>

2093
01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:52.650
<v Speaker 2>How about politics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2094
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Emailed me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made a threat about it.</v>

2095
01:28:55.031 --> 01:28:57.370
<v Speaker 2>He fucking tried to contact me on some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

2096
01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:59.020
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting topic.</v>

2097
01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:04.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I go back and forth on it and I </v>

2098
01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:04.150
<v Speaker 3>agree with you to a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is silly.</v>

2099
01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:09.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can waste so much of your energy </v>

2100
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:10.560
<v Speaker 3>thinking about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you know,</v>

2101
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:12.870
<v Speaker 3>the argument is we're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>governing ourselves,</v>

2102
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:17.900
<v Speaker 3>governing ourselves in this country and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get the option to vote and you </v>

2103
01:29:18.171 --> 01:29:23.171
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the right to express your </v>

2104
01:29:23.171 --> 01:29:23.171
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can actually change the world.</v>

2105
01:29:23.171 --> 01:29:23.610
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2106
01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:28.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm not completely convinced at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point with the amount of money that </v>

2107
01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:31.971
<v Speaker 3>they're able to contribute to campaign </v>
<v Speaker 3>funds that giant corporations are able </v>

2108
01:29:31.971 --> 01:29:31.971
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2109
01:29:31.971 --> 01:29:32.610
<v Speaker 3>they're literally shaping the way people</v>
<v Speaker 3>see things,</v>

2110
01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:34.430
<v Speaker 3>they're putting ads and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2111
01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:39.480
<v Speaker 3>and manipulating people's thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting people to believe things that </v>

2112
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:39.540
<v Speaker 3>aren't necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

2113
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.820
<v Speaker 3>they can push a certain agenda so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody can make money.</v>

2114
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the situation is totally corrupt.</v>

2115
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:50.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much money is involved in politics </v>

2116
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.030
<v Speaker 3>now and so much money is involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2117
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:54.981
<v Speaker 3>in running the world and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just look at what Obama's done with </v>

2118
01:29:54.981 --> 01:29:57.540
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this fucking bailouts and this.</v>

2119
01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:00.990
<v Speaker 3>When you look at this whole healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 3>system thing,</v>

2120
01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:06.020
<v Speaker 3>someone has to be making money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way they'd be putting this </v>

2121
01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.320
<v Speaker 3>much effort into this whole healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing if it was just about,</v>

2122
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping people healthy and making sure </v>

2123
01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:12.540
<v Speaker 3>that people have medical coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not there,</v>

2124
01:30:12.541 --> 01:30:14.370
<v Speaker 3>they're just there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's money involved in it.</v>

2125
01:30:14.371 --> 01:30:19.371
<v Speaker 3>It's corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna get crazy and it's a goddamn </v>

2126
01:30:19.371 --> 01:30:20.760
<v Speaker 3>money grabbed just like the bailout is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's all very,</v>

2127
01:30:20.761 --> 01:30:25.761
<v Speaker 3>very boring to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the real thing about it is it does </v>

2128
01:30:25.761 --> 01:30:29.361
<v Speaker 3>get boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real thing about it is you can </v>

2129
01:30:29.361 --> 01:30:29.361
<v Speaker 3>never have all the information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

2130
01:30:29.361 --> 01:30:34.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I care about the things I want to care </v>

2131
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.250
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the government.</v>

2132
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:37.850
<v Speaker 4>Meaning if they decided to make a bill </v>
<v Speaker 4>about banning the internet or that </v>

2133
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:38.670
<v Speaker 4>night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cats are going to be illegal.</v>

2134
01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.740
<v Speaker 4>They don't care about that part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not part of it.</v>

2135
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:45.830
<v Speaker 4>But I'm not going to sit there and try </v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out everything from a to z </v>

2136
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:46.020
<v Speaker 4>about our government and freak out about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it because you know what I.</v>

2137
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm freaking out about my mail being </v>
<v Speaker 4>delivered today.</v>

2138
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:49.110
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking,</v>

2139
01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:50.080
<v Speaker 4>how am I going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

2140
01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:52.770
<v Speaker 4>If I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just be an angry person.</v>

2141
01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.050
<v Speaker 4>It would argue shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2142
01:30:55.190 --> 01:30:56.300
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see you</v>

2143
01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:01.320
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people could also argue that that's </v>

2144
01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.181
<v Speaker 3>apathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People could say that that's what's </v>

2145
01:31:03.181 --> 01:31:03.181
<v Speaker 3>wrong with this country is that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't care.</v>

2146
01:31:03.181 --> 01:31:06.870
<v Speaker 3>But I say that until someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledges the fact that this system </v>

2147
01:31:06.911 --> 01:31:11.911
<v Speaker 3>is broken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need a radical overhaul of the </v>

2148
01:31:11.911 --> 01:31:16.321
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A complete restructuring of the way we </v>

2149
01:31:16.321 --> 01:31:16.321
<v Speaker 3>do business in this country.</v>

2150
01:31:16.321 --> 01:31:20.800
<v Speaker 4>It's called moving to Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even moving to Canada because </v>

2151
01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:20.800
<v Speaker 4>they're corrupt too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a big fucking.</v>

2152
01:31:20.801 --> 01:31:21.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's</v>

2153
01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:23.120
<v Speaker 3>a big scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Minister of Finance,</v>

2154
01:31:23.121 --> 01:31:25.280
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was involved in a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>scandal in Canada.</v>

2155
01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.740
<v Speaker 3>People are corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's human beings.</v>

2156
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:31.400
<v Speaker 3>People are less corrupt in places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are less ambitious like Canada,</v>

2157
01:31:31.401 --> 01:31:33.140
<v Speaker 3>where people are more laid back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendlier,</v>

2158
01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things that's cool</v>

2159
01:31:34.581 --> 01:31:36.110
<v Speaker 3>about Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are just like,</v>

2160
01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:38.810
<v Speaker 3>they're less crazy up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're a little cooler,</v>

2161
01:31:38.811 --> 01:31:40.280
<v Speaker 3>a little calmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2162
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:43.460
<v Speaker 3>I think that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2163
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:48.490
<v Speaker 3>you could waste your whole life trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand the system and be a part </v>

2164
01:31:48.490 --> 01:31:50.930
<v Speaker 3>of it and argue and go to court and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>will become your everything.</v>

2165
01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:56.290
<v Speaker 3>And it's a system that we're born into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're born into this system that we did </v>

2166
01:31:56.290 --> 01:32:00.791
<v Speaker 3>not choose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have no control of and it's so </v>

2167
01:32:00.791 --> 01:32:00.791
<v Speaker 3>comprehensive</v>

2168
01:32:00.791 --> 01:32:05.310
<v Speaker 5>and so fucking intertwined that just to </v>
<v Speaker 5>study a single branch of it would take </v>

2169
01:32:06.281 --> 01:32:09.730
<v Speaker 5>up all of your time if you just wanted </v>
<v Speaker 5>to understand the stock market.</v>

2170
01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:14.410
<v Speaker 5>That shit would take up every fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>hour of every day of your life.</v>

2171
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:19.470
<v Speaker 5>Just trying to figure out how all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit worked and even then look at that </v>

2172
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:19.470
<v Speaker 5>fucking guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2173
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:20.500
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Bernie made off.</v>

2174
01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:25.501
<v Speaker 5>Motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy was ripping off people who </v>

2175
01:32:25.501 --> 01:32:25.501
<v Speaker 5>understood the business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That kind of ripped off everybody.</v>

2176
01:32:25.501 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 5>He ripped off millionaires and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He ripped off fucking Steven Spielberg,</v>

2177
01:32:29.201 --> 01:32:34.201
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he ripped off all these like really big </v>

<v Speaker 5>So that means nobody knows how it works.</v>

2179
01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:39.630
<v Speaker 5>Nobody understands that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine if your whole life is </v>

2180
01:32:39.630 --> 01:32:43.651
<v Speaker 5>dedicated to studying the stock market?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're supposed expert people ask you </v>

2181
01:32:43.651 --> 01:32:44.140
<v Speaker 5>for advice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyone you got fucked.</v>

2182
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:50.120
<v Speaker 5>You could say God damn con game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody understands it.</v>

2183
01:32:50.210 --> 01:32:52.310
<v Speaker 5>Fuck politics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not politics.</v>

2184
01:32:52.311 --> 01:32:54.320
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about now we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the whole system.</v>

2185
01:32:54.650 --> 01:32:57.110
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about everything and we're</v>

2186
01:32:57.111 --> 01:32:59.030
<v Speaker 5>talking about this attitude of fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>politics,</v>

2187
01:32:59.031 --> 01:33:02.280
<v Speaker 5>just like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what can be done?</v>

2188
01:33:02.490 --> 01:33:03.990
<v Speaker 5>That's the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

2189
01:33:03.991 --> 01:33:06.720
<v Speaker 5>what can be done to make the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>better?</v>

2190
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:09.950
<v Speaker 5>If you had any say in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2191
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:14.990
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out what direction we </v>
<v Speaker 5>could go to make everything easier for </v>

2192
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:14.990
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you do?</v>

2193
01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:19.920
<v Speaker 4>Have everything be a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make a lot more sense.</v>

2194
01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:23.910
<v Speaker 4>Because right now everything from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>schools taxing.</v>

2195
01:33:23.911 --> 01:33:27.510
<v Speaker 4>Do you know everything about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government makes no sense to the average</v>

2196
01:33:27.511 --> 01:33:30.090
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if they can have like a website,</v>

2197
01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.000
<v Speaker 4>you have to go to everyday and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay guys,</v>

2198
01:33:33.001 --> 01:33:36.690
<v Speaker 4>today's topic of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that slavery's legal?</v>

2199
01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:37.470
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2200
01:33:37.650 --> 01:33:39.240
<v Speaker 4>And then have the whole country vote </v>
<v Speaker 4>right there.</v>

2201
01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:42.330
<v Speaker 4>Make it super planned out and easy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>make it something like that.</v>

2202
01:33:42.331 --> 01:33:44.850
<v Speaker 4>Because right now no one gives a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on on,</v>

2203
01:33:44.851 --> 01:33:46.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you started talking about it</v>

2204
01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:51.360
<v Speaker 5>occasion and money and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you get into really complex </v>

2205
01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.351
<v Speaker 5>subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that simple as like having </v>

2206
01:33:55.351 --> 01:33:55.351
<v Speaker 5>people vote because then he runs the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same issue,</v>

2207
01:33:55.351 --> 01:33:56.680
<v Speaker 5>like people just put out propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2208
01:33:56.681 --> 01:34:00.130
<v Speaker 5>if slavery is not legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that means the Iraqis will attack us and</v>

2209
01:34:00.131 --> 01:34:03.510
<v Speaker 5>they'll rape your baby and next thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know slavery's legal again.</v>

2210
01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2211
01:34:05.991 --> 01:34:10.991
<v Speaker 4>but it shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be a vote though system </v>

2212
01:34:10.991 --> 01:34:11.990
<v Speaker 4>because right now it's like no one gives</v>
<v Speaker 4>them online.</v>

2213
01:34:12.090 --> 01:34:17.090
<v Speaker 5>Like if there's a vote online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not you should be killed </v>

2214
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.090
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right now,</v>

2215
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:20.910
<v Speaker 5>if people watch this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe 60 percent of the people would </v>

2216
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.910
<v Speaker 5>want you to.</v>

2217
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Obviously that's how crazy they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that.</v>

2218
01:34:22.710 --> 01:34:26.040
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is like allow penciled out of the way</v>

2219
01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:28.650
<v Speaker 4>all this shit's all broken anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't fix it.</v>

2220
01:34:28.651 --> 01:34:33.651
<v Speaker 4>No matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me read bad things about fucking any of </v>

2221
01:34:33.651 --> 01:34:36.471
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen the way it's going </v>

2222
01:34:36.471 --> 01:34:39.581
<v Speaker 4>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just called yourself by your Internet </v>

2223
01:34:39.581 --> 01:34:39.581
<v Speaker 4>name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2224
01:34:39.581 --> 01:34:39.581
<v Speaker 4>That's what that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From that,</v>

2225
01:34:39.581 --> 01:34:39.870
<v Speaker 4>from that thread,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's.</v>

2226
01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:43.170
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was calling me and I get third</v>
<v Speaker 4>person cares about a red band.</v>

2227
01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.360
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Raymond was designed for?</v>

2228
01:34:45.361 --> 01:34:50.361
<v Speaker 4>Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 4>computers and cats and you know I agree </v>

2229
01:34:50.361 --> 01:34:52.641
<v Speaker 4>completely because who the fuck cares?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't change anything and even if I </v>

2230
01:34:52.641 --> 01:34:54.810
<v Speaker 4>could one person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to devote my life to see if</v>

2231
01:34:54.811 --> 01:34:56.640
<v Speaker 4>I could or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck about that.</v>

2232
01:34:56.641 --> 01:34:58.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like baseball and it</v>

2233
01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:03.060
<v Speaker 5>was a real problem is it does take away </v>
<v Speaker 5>from everything that you enjoy and </v>

2234
01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:03.060
<v Speaker 5>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2235
01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:07.310
<v Speaker 5>you have to fight for your rights really</v>
<v Speaker 5>to you just have your rights.</v>

2236
01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:10.310
<v Speaker 5>That's the real God damn problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is that I have to think</v>

2237
01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:12.710
<v Speaker 5>about this fucked up system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not all that.</v>

2238
01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:16.160
<v Speaker 5>It's so broken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to keep an eye on it 24 hours a</v>

2239
01:35:16.161 --> 01:35:21.161
<v Speaker 5>day because people are just stealing and</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting us into wars and making terrible</v>

2240
01:35:21.171 --> 01:35:26.171
<v Speaker 5>decisions and they'll blame it on all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these troubles that are happening in </v>

2241
01:35:26.171 --> 01:35:29.891
<v Speaker 5>other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you start fucking reading into </v>

2242
01:35:29.891 --> 01:35:29.891
<v Speaker 5>it and you find out the shit that we do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that causes all these troubles,</v>

2243
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:31.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God damn.</v>

2244
01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:32.690
<v Speaker 5>No wonder why everybody fucking hates </v>
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

2245
01:35:32.691 --> 01:35:34.340
<v Speaker 5>We got our dirty little fingers in </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>

2246
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:35.540
<v Speaker 5>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not me.</v>

2247
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:40.600
<v Speaker 5>It's not me that has my dirty little </v>
<v Speaker 5>fingers in Afghanistan and Iraq and you </v>

2248
01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:44.051
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and fucking all sorts of shit that goes </v>

2249
01:35:44.051 --> 01:35:44.051
<v Speaker 5>on in third world countries and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 5>you either.</v>

2250
01:35:44.051 --> 01:35:47.890
<v Speaker 5>You should be able to fucking pursue </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you want to do and the idea that </v>

2251
01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:48.140
<v Speaker 5>you have to go over there and kill some </v>
<v Speaker 5>people to do that.</v>

2252
01:35:48.141 --> 01:35:50.780
<v Speaker 5>It's just damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In 2010,</v>

2253
01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:54.710
<v Speaker 5>we pretend like you go to Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when we went to Australia recently,</v>

2254
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:57.740
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in Australia are so fucking cool.</v>

2255
01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:01.910
<v Speaker 5>They're so fun to be around such a </v>
<v Speaker 5>friendly culture.</v>

2256
01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:04.430
<v Speaker 5>What if we decided to go to war with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Australia?</v>

2257
01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:09.431
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would that be all a sudden we're </v>

2258
01:36:09.431 --> 01:36:10.991
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be tricked into believing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have a problem with this </v>

2259
01:36:10.991 --> 01:36:11.450
<v Speaker 5>continent that we'd never been probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened in our lifetime.</v>

2260
01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:16.660
<v Speaker 5>If it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's because we're going to war </v>

2261
01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:16.660
<v Speaker 5>together as a group against some other </v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfuckers.</v>

2262
01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:21.071
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's really the only reason why we're </v>

2263
01:36:21.071 --> 01:36:22.511
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because we've decided to band up and go </v>

2264
01:36:22.511 --> 01:36:22.790
<v Speaker 5>jack these fools and take their shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2265
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:24.740
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing that you know,</v>

2266
01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:25.520
<v Speaker 5>our system.</v>

2267
01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:30.820
<v Speaker 5>There's no other system though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you get 300 million people </v>

2268
01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:30.820
<v Speaker 5>in place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

2269
01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:35.441
<v Speaker 5>There's no other model of how to run a </v>
<v Speaker 5>300 million person empire and to do it </v>

2270
01:36:35.441 --> 01:36:38.030
<v Speaker 5>correctly where people think it's fair </v>
<v Speaker 5>because people are just.</v>

2271
01:36:38.190 --> 01:36:43.190
<v Speaker 5>It's part of life is an intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 5>test and part of the intelligence test </v>

2272
01:36:43.190 --> 01:36:45.290
<v Speaker 5>is how susceptible are you to </v>
<v Speaker 5>manipulation.</v>

2273
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.420
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Literally it's like a game.</v>

2274
01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:50.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's people like these </v>
<v Speaker 5>evangelists that you see,</v>

2275
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:51.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at 3:00</v>

2276
01:36:51.381 --> 01:36:56.381
<v Speaker 5>in the morning that are fucking talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>a certain cadence and especially that </v>

2277
01:36:56.381 --> 01:36:56.840
<v Speaker 5>black guy with a hot dog rolls in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>back of his neck.</v>

2278
01:36:56.841 --> 01:37:01.841
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy I'm talking about that </v>

2279
01:37:01.841 --> 01:37:01.841
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker is always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2280
01:37:01.841 --> 01:37:05.920
<v Speaker 5>spouting out some Bible Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's doing it so charismatic and </v>

2281
01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.831
<v Speaker 5>he's sweating like a pig and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the audience is going bananas and </v>

2282
01:37:08.831 --> 01:37:08.831
<v Speaker 5>it's an intelligence test.</v>

2283
01:37:08.831 --> 01:37:13.540
<v Speaker 5>Intelligence test is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you believe this guy is so confident </v>

2284
01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.690
<v Speaker 5>and speaking so clearly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you believe what he's saying?</v>

2285
01:37:14.691 --> 01:37:16.340
<v Speaker 5>Because if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a dumb ass.</v>

2286
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:21.550
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just tricking you by being so </v>

2287
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.650
<v Speaker 5>confident in what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what it really is.</v>

2288
01:37:21.651 --> 01:37:26.651
<v Speaker 5>It's like this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole world is like a gigantic </v>

2289
01:37:26.651 --> 01:37:29.651

<v Speaker 5>highest level people are failing left </v>

2290
01:37:29.651 --> 01:37:29.651
<v Speaker 5>and right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

01:37:30.121 --> 01:37:30.530
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2293
01:37:30.531 --> 01:37:32.370
<v Speaker 5>the Republicans want to control the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house and like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You're talking about nonsense.</v>

2296
01:37:37.461 --> 01:37:40.340
<v Speaker 5>If everybody just stepped back and said </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is all nonsense,</v>

01:37:40.341 --> 01:37:42.620
<v Speaker 5>this whole thing sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop.</v>

<v Speaker 5>with windows 95.</v>

2299
01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.810
<v Speaker 5>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Windows 95 sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need some new shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>2,000,</v>

2303
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 5>whereas Vista,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas windows seven,</v>

2304
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.350

<v Speaker 3>Wes knows me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those dark dark time in American </v>

2306
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:02.440
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2307
01:38:02.441 --> 01:38:05.560
<v Speaker 3>we need a better operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is we don't,</v>

2308
01:38:05.561 --> 01:38:08.820
<v Speaker 3>we just keep patching up the same stupid</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking system we've always had.</v>

2309
01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:11.610
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you just sit back?</v>

2310
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:13.070
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't move because you moved.</v>

2311
01:38:13.071 --> 01:38:14.930
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be under control of </v>
<v Speaker 3>some other mothers.</v>

2312
01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:20.820
<v Speaker 4>I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you have a neighbor's dog </v>

2313
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:20.820
<v Speaker 4>that's barking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2314
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:22.140
<v Speaker 4>you can either sit there and deal with </v>
<v Speaker 4>it for as long,</v>

2315
01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:25.320
<v Speaker 4>but once it gets too bad you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something about it.</v>

2316
01:38:25.321 --> 01:38:30.321
<v Speaker 4>And so that's how I feel about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I still wake up and everything's </v>

2317
01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:33.921
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing's really affecting me on an </v>

2318
01:38:33.921 --> 01:38:34.650
<v Speaker 4>everyday basis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to care about it,</v>

2319
01:38:34.651 --> 01:38:37.410
<v Speaker 4>then I'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if something crazy happens,</v>

2320
01:38:37.470 --> 01:38:39.780
<v Speaker 4>like they decided to do something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to affect me,</v>

2321
01:38:39.781 --> 01:38:40.950
<v Speaker 4>then I'll just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2322
01:38:40.951 --> 01:38:45.951
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll move on because I don't give a </v>

2323
01:38:45.951 --> 01:38:45.951
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not like United States or for,</v>

2324
01:38:45.951 --> 01:38:46.050
<v Speaker 4>for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

2325
01:38:46.051 --> 01:38:47.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm sure</v>

2326
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:52.820

<v Speaker 3>move around a bunch of times in this </v>

2327
01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:53.710
<v Speaker 3>country you realize the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have one mentality and then when</v>

2328
01:38:53.711 --> 01:38:56.000
<v Speaker 3>you move or when you travel to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>places,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you'd have,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do it.</v>

2338
01:39:14.290 --> 01:39:15.610
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to wear sunscreen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2339
01:39:15.611 --> 01:39:17.740
<v Speaker 3>They get no ozone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Layer it up there to.</v>

2340
01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Everybody gets jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's skin cancer,</v>

2341
01:39:20.021 --> 01:39:25.021
<v Speaker 3>less ramp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have these big ads on billboards </v>

2342
01:39:25.021 --> 01:39:25.021

<v Speaker 3>Cancer is everywhere.</v>

2343
01:39:25.021 --> 01:39:27.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But do the people are friendly though.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know the fucking,</v>

2345
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:31.180
<v Speaker 3>the coastlines.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It has no problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2347
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:39.440
<v Speaker 3>The idea that this one fucking place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the from one ocean to another </v>

2348
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.320
<v Speaker 3>ocean that's like so 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

2349
01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:46.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're fighting for our land like </v>

2350
01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in America,</v>

2351
01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:49.970
<v Speaker 3>to think that where they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're,</v>

2352
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:53.800
<v Speaker 3>you're a citizen in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are just like riding in the balls of</v>

2353
01:39:53.801 --> 01:39:55.480
<v Speaker 3>the Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking the world.</v>

2354
01:39:55.670 --> 01:39:57.910
<v Speaker 3>You're just a part of this gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

2355
01:39:57.911 --> 01:40:00.010
<v Speaker 3>It's just bone in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2356
01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:04.900
<v Speaker 3>two planes come over here and smash into</v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings and we lose our marbles and we</v>

2357
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:09.990
<v Speaker 3>wind up killing a million civilians in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq and justifying it that we're </v>

2358
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:11.200
<v Speaker 3>keeping ourselves safe over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking nuts,</v>

2359
01:40:11.201 --> 01:40:12.400
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the answer?</v>

2360
01:40:12.401 --> 01:40:13.960
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the answer?</v>

2361
01:40:14.110 --> 01:40:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Internet people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the answer?</v>

2362
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:18.040
<v Speaker 3>Twitter people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's No God damn answer.</v>

2363
01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:21.550
<v Speaker 3>There is no god Damn fucking answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>

2364
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:26.780
<v Speaker 4>You lose your marbles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't buy new ones because they </v>

2365
01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:26.780
<v Speaker 4>don't make them anymore.</v>

2366
01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The marble industries.</v>

2367
01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:27.830
<v Speaker 3>We're at A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're at a businessman.</v>

2368
01:40:31.630 --> 01:40:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty soon.</v>

2369
01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:34.000
<v Speaker 4>I think it's almost going to be like how</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet,</v>

2370
01:40:34.110 --> 01:40:39.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like in the old days I wasn't </v>

2371
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:40.660
<v Speaker 4>talking to people from England every day</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Australia and that kind of broke that</v>

2372
01:40:40.661 --> 01:40:45.661
<v Speaker 4>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in the future there's not gonna </v>

2373
01:40:45.661 --> 01:40:45.661
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2374
01:40:45.661 --> 01:40:46.060
<v Speaker 4>it's religion kind of fizzes out fizzles</v>
<v Speaker 4>out a little bit more.</v>

2375
01:40:46.150 --> 01:40:51.150
<v Speaker 4>I think even just countries are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fizzle out more because we're probably </v>

2376
01:40:51.150 --> 01:40:52.300
<v Speaker 4>going to be just teleport into Japan </v>
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>

2377
01:40:52.301 --> 01:40:52.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2378
01:40:52.930 --> 01:40:53.830
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every go to Japan,</v>

2379
01:40:53.831 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 4>I'll be</v>

2380
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.800
<v Speaker 3>right back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely dissolved.</v>

2381
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:58.870
<v Speaker 3>And the only thing that keeps us in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

2382
01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:03.490
<v Speaker 3>this one idea is travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another difficult to get in planes.</v>

2383
01:41:03.491 --> 01:41:08.491
<v Speaker 3>Then when you land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be screened for what's the </v>

2384
01:41:08.491 --> 01:41:08.491
<v Speaker 3>next plan plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plan.</v>

2385
01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:13.410
<v Speaker 3>It's probably going to be sending our </v>
<v Speaker 3>brainwaves to another body in Japan that</v>

2386
01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:17.620
<v Speaker 3>we have like a backup body and if we get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a position or we talked about before,</v>

2387
01:41:17.621 --> 01:41:22.621
<v Speaker 3>like we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like twitter and facebook and this </v>

2388
01:41:22.621 --> 01:41:22.621
<v Speaker 3>connectivity that people share right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2389
01:41:22.621 --> 01:41:24.940
<v Speaker 3>it's like we're connected so much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>now than we've ever been before.</v>

2390
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:29.890
<v Speaker 3>If we really do get to a place where no </v>
<v Speaker 3>secrets will exist,</v>

2391
01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:34.920
<v Speaker 3>where everyone will know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be able to read each other's mind </v>

2392
01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:34.920
<v Speaker 3>will be able to access each other's </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

2393
01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the only way we'll ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>really have like a real government will </v>

2394
01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:44.430
<v Speaker 3>really realized that we really can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit things that we used to have to </v>

2395
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:44.430
<v Speaker 3>come clean about.</v>

2396
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:48.960
<v Speaker 3>The fact that we live in a dictatorship </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's dressed up as a democracy where </v>

2397
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.840
<v Speaker 3>these gigantic corporations are making </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars because we just have</v>

2398
01:41:52.841 --> 01:41:57.841
<v Speaker 3>to just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just accept the fact that we're under </v>

2399
01:41:57.841 --> 01:41:58.080
<v Speaker 3>their rule the same way they accepted </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact when they lived,</v>

2400
01:41:58.081 --> 01:42:03.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in England they were under the rule of </v>

2401
01:42:03.081 --> 01:42:04.711
<v Speaker 3>the king and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these different countries that </v>

2402
01:42:04.711 --> 01:42:04.711
<v Speaker 3>are controlled by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2403
01:42:04.711 --> 01:42:08.280
<v Speaker 3>by monarchs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to accept that it's clean and </v>

2404
01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:11.431
<v Speaker 3>then they know what the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in Thailand there's a Goddamn Qing </v>

2405
01:42:11.431 --> 01:42:11.431
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

2406
01:42:11.431 --> 01:42:12.140
<v Speaker 3>There's a king and you got to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>

2407
01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:17.160
<v Speaker 3>You can't talk shit about them and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's either that or we realize we can't </v>

2408
01:42:17.501 --> 01:42:22.501
<v Speaker 3>do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We realized we can't live like this </v>

2409
01:42:22.501 --> 01:42:22.501
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the only thing that's gonna</v>

2410
01:42:22.501 --> 01:42:22.600
<v Speaker 3>save us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this technology,</v>

2411
01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:28.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it'll get the people who are </v>

2412
01:42:28.230 --> 01:42:30.391
<v Speaker 3>actually running things to realize how </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous it is when everybody knows </v>

2413
01:42:30.391 --> 01:42:30.391
<v Speaker 3>they're bullshit.</v>

2414
01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking.</v>

2415
01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:33.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a tricky situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2416
01:42:34.770 --> 01:42:39.770
<v Speaker 3>student,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are completely headed towards an age </v>

2417
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:42.600
<v Speaker 3>for lies and deception will fade away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet we will never understand all of </v>

2418
01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:42.910
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what we were just talking</v>

2419
01:42:42.911 --> 01:42:44.770
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's contradictory.</v>

2420
01:42:44.771 --> 01:42:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2421
01:42:45.701 --> 01:42:47.200
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're just talking about what's,</v>

2422
01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:52.230
<v Speaker 3>what's here right now and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what may or may not be possible in the </v>

2423
01:42:52.230 --> 01:42:52.230
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2424
01:42:52.230 --> 01:42:55.150
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we're gonna get to an age </v>
<v Speaker 3>where everything is connected.</v>

2425
01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:57.430
<v Speaker 3>That really is speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2426
01:42:57.431 --> 01:42:59.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know if we're ever going</v>

2427
01:42:59.281 --> 01:43:04.281
<v Speaker 3>to get that far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know if we're going to get hit </v>

2428
01:43:04.281 --> 01:43:05.881
<v Speaker 3>by a gigantic meter or fucking polarized</v>
<v Speaker 3>caps or shift or when you look at the </v>

2429
01:43:05.881 --> 01:43:07.100
<v Speaker 3>history of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows what the hell's going</v>

2430
01:43:07.101 --> 01:43:07.840
<v Speaker 3>to happen to us?</v>

2431
01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always some new shit going down.</v>

2432
01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what the nuttiest thing about,</v>

2433
01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:16.780
<v Speaker 3>about like I was watching these solar </v>
<v Speaker 3>system documentaries today,</v>

2434
01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:20.770
<v Speaker 3>the nuttiest thing is how many different</v>
<v Speaker 3>planets had been hit by planets.</v>

2435
01:43:21.250 --> 01:43:22.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they were.</v>

2436
01:43:22.281 --> 01:43:27.281
<v Speaker 3>There was a thing on uranus about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they recognize those rings around your </v>

2437
01:43:27.281 --> 01:43:30.791
<v Speaker 3>anus and they believed it was some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a collision and they were talking </v>

2438
01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:33.751
<v Speaker 3>about moons colliding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then eventually your ransom Williams </v>

2439
01:43:33.751 --> 01:43:33.751
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're real close to each other.</v>

2440
01:43:33.751 --> 01:43:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Eventually in a slam I knew each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2441
01:43:36.110 --> 01:43:41.110
<v Speaker 3>damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if we realize that earth was </v>

2442
01:43:41.110 --> 01:43:44.971
<v Speaker 3>getting hit by a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like 100 years away if we saw </v>

2443
01:43:44.971 --> 01:43:44.971
<v Speaker 3>planners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2444
01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:47.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean how long would it take for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet to hit us?</v>

2445
01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:51.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I think they were saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that your readiness is a year,</v>

2446
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:53.660
<v Speaker 3>like a year and your readiness is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of years.</v>

2447
01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 160.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it was.</v>

2448
01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.490
<v Speaker 3>It was a bunch of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>

2449
01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Their winter alone was like 60 plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2450
01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.850
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

2451
01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.220
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2452
01:44:04.221 --> 01:44:09.221
<v Speaker 3>that's a long ass time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many years would be able to </v>

2453
01:44:09.221 --> 01:44:09.320
<v Speaker 3>recognize like if a plant was headed our</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

2454
01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 3>like if there was an inter inter solar </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

2455
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:15.850
<v Speaker 3>intruder a got like a plant that's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

2456
01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.410
<v Speaker 2>the solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming,</v>

2457
01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:22.580
<v Speaker 2>it would be faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like it would just happen </v>

2458
01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:23.060
<v Speaker 2>faster for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it probably isn't,</v>

2459
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:28.450
<v Speaker 2>but why would it seemed like that if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes a year for the earth to go around </v>

2460
01:44:28.450 --> 01:44:28.450
<v Speaker 2>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2461
01:44:28.450 --> 01:44:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was not what the whole deal.</v>

2462
01:44:29.841 --> 01:44:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess spins like asteroids.</v>

2463
01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:35.230
<v Speaker 2>It goes around the sun and heat</v>

2464
01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:37.200
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2465
01:44:37.650 --> 01:44:40.650
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty God damn close and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes us a year to go around.</v>

2466
01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.870
<v Speaker 3>If some shit was coming in from another </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

2467
01:44:42.871 --> 01:44:44.210
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't come that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it.</v>

2468
01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Unless we're moving towards it as it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving towards us.</v>

2469
01:44:47.250 --> 01:44:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is that's happened that </v>

2470
01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:54.981
<v Speaker 3>literally has happened to Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There used to be earth one which was </v>

2471
01:44:54.981 --> 01:44:58.011
<v Speaker 3>just a different planet and then it got </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit by a planet and that created the </v>

2472
01:44:58.011 --> 01:44:58.530
<v Speaker 3>moon fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2473
01:44:59.490 --> 01:45:02.460
<v Speaker 3>We that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would end all the bullshit.</v>

2474
01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.220
<v Speaker 3>All the tiger woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the Jesse James,</v>

2475
01:45:05.221 --> 01:45:08.980
<v Speaker 3>all the fucking healthcare and tea </v>
<v Speaker 3>baggers and you know,</v>

2476
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:12.330
<v Speaker 3>rush limbaugh and Glenn back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that Shit would just stop.</v>

2477
01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:16.890
<v Speaker 3>If we saw a giant planet in this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that got a little bigger every day,</v>

2478
01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:20.520
<v Speaker 3>whole Lee fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine</v>

2479
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:25.790
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably be pretty cool if it wasn't </v>

2480
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:26.050
<v Speaker 2>going to hit in your lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it probably be pretty sweet,</v>

2481
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:29.010
<v Speaker 2>like look at the death moon comment </v>
<v Speaker 2>section to be used.</v>

2482
01:45:29.370 --> 01:45:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Just die of heart attacks and then other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would just go raping and </v>

2483
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:38.271
<v Speaker 2>pillaging and murdering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a bunch of different </v>

2484
01:45:38.271 --> 01:45:41.451
<v Speaker 2>things would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be people that would live like </v>

2485
01:45:41.451 --> 01:45:43.820
<v Speaker 2>just savages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would just commit all sorts of </v>

2486
01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:46.140
<v Speaker 2>incredible atrocities and steal and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of other shit and then there'd</v>

2487
01:45:46.141 --> 01:45:47.910
<v Speaker 2>be people that would just become total </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippies.</v>

2488
01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Just have orgies and probably what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to trade route.</v>

2489
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really you think so?</v>

2490
01:45:53.601 --> 01:45:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Some people would probably be like nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 times a million.</v>

2491
01:45:55.980 --> 01:46:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Just being sad and probably be so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>specials on tv about it.</v>

2492
01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Song religion would pick up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look motherfucker,</v>

2493
01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:04.970
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

2494
01:46:05.290 --> 01:46:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Figure out some passage in the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 3>that related to this and that they.</v>

2495
01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:12.610
<v Speaker 3>They figured out a way to to to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to connect the two of them together.</v>

2496
01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.270
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>

2497
01:46:13.271 --> 01:46:15.870
<v Speaker 3>that would be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be the.</v>

2498
01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:17.500
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so possible.</v>

2499
01:46:17.770 --> 01:46:20.320
<v Speaker 3>That's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happened in other solar systems.</v>

2500
01:46:20.321 --> 01:46:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2501
01:46:22.091 --> 01:46:25.300
<v Speaker 3>it can happen in our lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be fucking bonkers,</v>

2502
01:46:25.301 --> 01:46:27.850
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we saw like it was 10 years away,</v>

2503
01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:33.330
<v Speaker 3>like we have a real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would they even tell us there would be </v>

2504
01:46:33.330 --> 01:46:34.480
<v Speaker 3>rumors on the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they would tell us.</v>

2505
01:46:34.481 --> 01:46:35.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2506
01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.780
<v Speaker 3>What are the questions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll go to this bridge.</v>

2507
01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I think my cat just took a shit in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I might smell her last scratching.</v>

2508
01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:48.010
<v Speaker 3>But you're a cat man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

2509
01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mayhem.</v>

2510
01:46:57.041 --> 01:46:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Miller 12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say Joe was being a Dick,</v>

2511
01:46:59.321 --> 01:47:04.321
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you it's distracting to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it keeps me from able to do in this </v>

2512
01:47:04.321 --> 01:47:04.321
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2513
01:47:04.321 --> 01:47:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I asked him to not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're being a dick.</v>

2514
01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I wasted my question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And religious bullshit.</v>

2515
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Marbles are not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2516
01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:15.820
<v Speaker 1>The marvel world is still huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

2517
01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go with the questions.</v>

2518
01:47:19.651 --> 01:47:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Here were the best substitute for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current monetary system.</v>

2519
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:26.590
<v Speaker 1>This dude wants to know who the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows,</v>

2520
01:47:26.591 --> 01:47:26.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2521
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:32.910
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can have shit out </v>

2522
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:35.501
<v Speaker 3>there and the fucking numbers in </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers that can't.</v>

2523
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:37.610
<v Speaker 3>It's got to represent something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2524
01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:40.700
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem with money is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really represent anything,</v>

2525
01:47:41.150 --> 01:47:46.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of represents more ideas and </v>

2526
01:47:46.150 --> 01:47:46.150
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like one piece of gold,</v>

2527
01:47:46.150 --> 01:47:47.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is $1 and you know,</v>

2528
01:47:47.841 --> 01:47:51.380
<v Speaker 3>and that piece of gold was sitting in an</v>
<v Speaker 3>account somewhere and you can go,</v>

2529
01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:52.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cashier,</v>

2530
01:47:52.250 --> 01:47:54.350
<v Speaker 3>$100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion for 100 pieces of gold,</v>

2531
01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2532
01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:58.460
<v Speaker 3>it has to mean something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have it.</v>

2533
01:47:58.461 --> 01:48:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Just all numbers in computers because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people will just can fuck you.</v>

2534
01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:04.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you've been going through,</v>

2535
01:48:04.221 --> 01:48:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much you want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

2536
01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:08.420
<v Speaker 3>but you've been going through some </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit with the irs where they,</v>

2537
01:48:08.421 --> 01:48:13.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they audit you and fuck with you and go </v>

2538
01:48:13.421 --> 01:48:17.060
<v Speaker 3>into numbers and like storing numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how much numbers did you put on this</v>

2539
01:48:17.061 --> 01:48:20.360
<v Speaker 3>and how many numbers went to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And politics to me</v>

2540
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:24.320
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brain does not care about any of that</v>

2541
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:29.530
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how I've always been like </v>

2542
01:48:29.530 --> 01:48:29.530
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that I'm forced to do almost,</v>

2543
01:48:29.530 --> 01:48:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I almost don't care about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2544
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's sort of one of the reasons </v>

2545
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.030
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2546
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.550
<v Speaker 1>people sort of become artistic in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

2547
01:48:37.810 --> 01:48:42.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why people </v>

2548
01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:42.810
<v Speaker 1>would call artistic is because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2549
01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:42.810
<v Speaker 1>you're</v>

2550
01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:44.400
<v Speaker 3>fighting against a bunch of shit you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like and you,</v>

2551
01:48:44.410 --> 01:48:49.410
<v Speaker 3>you go against the grain and you wind up</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something that's totally </v>

2552
01:48:49.410 --> 01:48:49.410
<v Speaker 3>unconventional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2553
01:48:49.410 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 3>that's how people come and positions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians and artists and stuff on the </v>

2554
01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:55.240
<v Speaker 3>side street path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2555
01:48:55.241 --> 01:49:00.241
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's so weird when like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian enters into the world of </v>

2556
01:49:00.241 --> 01:49:02.050
<v Speaker 3>politics or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Al Franken.</v>

2557
01:49:02.051 --> 01:49:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Franken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2558
01:49:02.891 --> 01:49:07.891
<v Speaker 3>That's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that dude is like a serious </v>

2559
01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:07.891
<v Speaker 3>historian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2560
01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:08.900
<v Speaker 3>like that seems like it's sort of like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>project for him.</v>

2561
01:49:08.901 --> 01:49:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Like he really knows a lot of shit.</v>

2562
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:14.040
<v Speaker 1>What about our kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2563
01:49:14.041 --> 01:49:15.120
<v Speaker 1>What about our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

2564
01:49:15.150 --> 01:49:18.140
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going to happen?</v>

2565
01:49:18.170 --> 01:49:19.130
<v Speaker 1>No one knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2566
01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:23.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange world.</v>

2567
01:49:23.610 --> 01:49:25.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have kids,</v>

2568
01:49:25.011 --> 01:49:30.011
<v Speaker 1>you start wondering like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is this little person going to be </v>

2569
01:49:30.011 --> 01:49:30.011
<v Speaker 1>survive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they're gonna?</v>

2570
01:49:30.011 --> 01:49:30.680
<v Speaker 1>How are they going to be happy?</v>

2571

<v Speaker 3>This crazy world and it gets nuttier and</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuttier and more goddamn earthquakes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake in Baja,</v>

2573
01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Mexico a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big One in Indonesia today.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have an earthquake's everywhere.</v>

2575
01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:42.600

2576
01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:43.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2577
01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>

2578
01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Whoever opened up the treasure chest </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Indiana,</v>

2579
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>raiders of the lost</v>

2580
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Ark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2581
01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:50.370
<v Speaker 2>it seems like some fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't</v>

2582
01:49:51.170 --> 01:49:56.170
<v Speaker 3>weird how many people want to think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because of like a US government </v>

2583
01:49:56.170 --> 01:49:57.710
<v Speaker 3>experiments that they're creating </v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes.</v>

2584
01:49:57.850 --> 01:49:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Like how nutty is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How it is.</v>

2585
01:49:59.661 --> 01:50:01.400
<v Speaker 3>That idea that the US government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2586
01:50:01.401 --> 01:50:06.401
<v Speaker 3>I know that we need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to just start causing </v>

2587
01:50:06.401 --> 01:50:06.401
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>

2588
01:50:06.401 --> 01:50:06.520
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2589
01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:08.950
<v Speaker 3>it's hilarious how many people want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe nobody.</v>

2590
01:50:08.951 --> 01:50:13.951
<v Speaker 3>Shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to anything that's </v>

2591
01:50:13.951 --> 01:50:13.951
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always want to find someone,</v>

2592
01:50:13.951 --> 01:50:17.150
<v Speaker 3>some human who's pulling the strings in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some gigantic diabolical scheme,</v>

2593
01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:22.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a diabolical scheme with an </v>

2594
01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 3>earthquake machine that just pointing at</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all these third world countries and </v>

2595
01:50:24.970 --> 01:50:25.670
<v Speaker 3>just fucking people up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how hilarious is that?</v>

2596
01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:27.340
<v Speaker 3>What a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a,</v>

2597
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:28.940
<v Speaker 3>a ass way to look at the world.</v>

2598
01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:31.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's what's happening.</v>

2599
01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that the earth is getting very </v>
<v Speaker 3>pissed off at us.</v>

2600
01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:36.760
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2601
01:50:36.810 --> 01:50:38.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

2602
01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:39.710
<v Speaker 3>it's about time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's shaken us off.</v>

2603
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really consciously,</v>

2604
01:50:42.111 --> 01:50:44.270
<v Speaker 3>but I think surely like this just </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

2605
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:45.190
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2606
01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:50.200
<v Speaker 3>look at what's going on in the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's creators all over the moon and </v>

2607
01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:50.200
<v Speaker 3>that nobody ever did anything bad on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moon.</v>

2608
01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.220
<v Speaker 3>The moon is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another little planet.</v>

2609
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Volcanoes erupt all over the world.</v>

2610
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:56.640
<v Speaker 3>Earthquakes happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2611
01:50:56.690 --> 01:51:00.380
<v Speaker 3>the topography of lifeless planets </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly changes.</v>

2612
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:01.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

2613
01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:03.110
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it</v>

2614
01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:07.370
<v Speaker 2>that we're having more earthquakes right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now or is just that we have twitter?</v>

2615
01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.720
<v Speaker 3>It could be that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be that.</v>

2616
01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know,</v>

2617
01:51:10.651 --> 01:51:15.651
<v Speaker 3>to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I know is what I'm hearing that I'm </v>

2618
01:51:15.651 --> 01:51:16.110
<v Speaker 3>hearing about them more than I ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard about them before,</v>

2619
01:51:16.111 --> 01:51:18.750
<v Speaker 3>but I've not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done looked at it at all.</v>

2620
01:51:18.810 --> 01:51:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I've done no research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does seem like we're hearing about it</v>

2621
01:51:22.411 --> 01:51:24.090
<v Speaker 3>way more than we ever heard about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2622
01:51:24.130 --> 01:51:29.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We also more information pumped through </v>

2623
01:51:29.130 --> 01:51:29.340
<v Speaker 3>our eyeballs every day we've ever had in</v>
<v Speaker 3>our life.</v>

2624
01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2625
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Ten years ago I would only have found </v>
<v Speaker 2>out on my laser disk player.</v>

2626
01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2627
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2628
01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:42.380
<v Speaker 3>you would have found out 10 years ago if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really big newspaper people will </v>

2629
01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:46.041
<v Speaker 3>be paid below up my pager.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found a page of the other day that I </v>

2630
01:51:46.041 --> 01:51:47.310
<v Speaker 3>used to have that my dog had bitten </v>
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>

2631
01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:49.560
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Jack Solaris.</v>

2632
01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man,</v>

2633
01:51:51.930 --> 01:51:53.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got no answers to that.</v>

2634
01:51:53.431 --> 01:51:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2635
01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:56.370
<v Speaker 3>it's happening more or just more </v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

2636
01:51:56.371 --> 01:51:58.560
<v Speaker 3>but there's definitely more information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

2637
01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:03.620
<v Speaker 3>That's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not the earthquakes are </v>

2638
01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:04.220
<v Speaker 3>happening more just seems like they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2639
01:52:04.530 --> 01:52:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm about to lose a shitload of viewers.</v>

2640
01:52:09.501 --> 01:52:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Last starts when you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're about two hours anyway,</v>

2641
01:52:12.650 --> 01:52:14.450
<v Speaker 3>and that's why the way we like to end </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2642
01:52:14.451 --> 01:52:16.970
<v Speaker 3>so we'll have one more topic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to end it well,</v>

2643
01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.070
<v Speaker 3>and then we'll close it off.</v>

2644
01:52:24.690 --> 01:52:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Is it weird that you're so into </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies,</v>

2645
01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:29.260
<v Speaker 3>but hate movies that have a twist </v>
<v Speaker 3>ending?</v>

2646
01:52:29.410 --> 01:52:34.410
<v Speaker 3>I hate movies that have a twist ending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love fucking movies with good twisty </v>

2647
01:52:34.410 --> 01:52:38.521
<v Speaker 3>ending that I didn't see comment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I don't like is when movies faked </v>

2648
01:52:38.521 --> 01:52:38.570
<v Speaker 3>me out and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2649
01:52:38.571 --> 01:52:43.571
<v Speaker 3>it was just a dream that drives me </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonkers and I'm not really into </v>

2650
01:52:43.571 --> 01:52:44.780
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm into the real concern there.</v>

2651
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Real things that people have conspired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Enron and you know,</v>

2652
01:52:48.771 --> 01:52:53.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the whole term </v>

2653
01:52:53.771 --> 01:52:55.511
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theory is you bring it up </v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone saw talks about conspiracy </v>

2654
01:52:55.511 --> 01:52:56.690
<v Speaker 3>theories and they bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the automatically.</v>

2655
01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:01.720
<v Speaker 3>You any rational person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any thinking person does not want to be </v>

2656
01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.471
<v Speaker 3>associated with conspiracy theories </v>
<v Speaker 3>because conspiracy theories make you </v>

2657
01:53:05.471 --> 01:53:07.370
<v Speaker 3>seem like a loon conspiracy theories the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way it's been labeled make,</v>

2658
01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:12.400
<v Speaker 3>make it seem like you're a silly </v>
<v Speaker 3>frivolous person that you believe in </v>

2659
01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:12.400
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2660
01:53:12.850 --> 01:53:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2661
01:53:13.361 --> 01:53:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I think if you just tag it with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theory name,</v>

2662
01:53:16.811 --> 01:53:21.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you don't believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies,</v>

2663
01:53:21.221 --> 01:53:26.221
<v Speaker 2>but you think that's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach to an idea or something like </v>

2664
01:53:26.221 --> 01:53:29.610
<v Speaker 2>like people that just think nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 2>11 was done by our own government and </v>

2665
01:53:29.610 --> 01:53:30.250
<v Speaker 2>they don't think anything else in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

2666
01:53:30.251 --> 01:53:31.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a sick way.</v>

2667
01:53:31.301 --> 01:53:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I think of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2668
01:53:32.381 --> 01:53:35.100
<v Speaker 2>you should never put all your eggs in </v>
<v Speaker 2>one basket type</v>

2669
01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:37.790
<v Speaker 3>that putting all your eggs in one basket</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a real problem.</v>

2670
01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:39.960
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about that before with our </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>

2671
01:53:39.961 --> 01:53:41.580
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with certain subjects.</v>

2672
01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:45.690
<v Speaker 3>People love for there to be mysteries </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can unsolved.</v>

2673
01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:49.410
<v Speaker 3>They love for there to be some hidden </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that they can unsolved,</v>

2674
01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.690
<v Speaker 3>whether it's about nine slash 11 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>about anything,</v>

2675
01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:55.150
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2676
01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.150
<v Speaker 3>unless you like really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2677
01:53:57.151 --> 01:54:02.151
<v Speaker 3>really researched shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people were just talking out their </v>

2678
01:54:02.151 --> 01:54:02.970
<v Speaker 3>ass when it comes to subjects and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do start researching shit,</v>

2679
01:54:03.150 --> 01:54:08.150
<v Speaker 3>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you can't just blanketly discount </v>

2680
01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:13.580
<v Speaker 3>or discredit all conspiracy theories </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because it seems like a ridiculous </v>

2681
01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:14.100
<v Speaker 3>thing because a lot of them are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

2682
01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.440
<v Speaker 3>The Gulf of Tonkin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking operation.</v>

2683
01:54:16.441 --> 01:54:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Northwoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of different shit that the</v>

2684
01:54:18.781 --> 01:54:21.510
<v Speaker 3>government has done and different </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies have done.</v>

2685
01:54:21.511 --> 01:54:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Cigarette companies have conspired to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2686
01:54:23.671 --> 01:54:28.671
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hide the facts about tobacco and to </v>

2687
01:54:28.671 --> 01:54:29.250
<v Speaker 3>make sure that people keep smoking them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people were addicted.</v>

2688
01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.650
<v Speaker 3>This motherfucker's hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>line and sinker with the cigarettes.</v>

2689
01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:34.230
<v Speaker 3>You're locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many smoke today?</v>

2690
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that drive you bonkers?</v>

2691
01:54:37.610 --> 01:54:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's relaxing when I smoke a </v>

2692
01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:42.610
<v Speaker 2>cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't worry about it.</v>

2693
01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Every time I smoked a cigarette and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ellipse caught on fire,</v>

2694
01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:45.220
<v Speaker 2>then I would hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2695
01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.850
<v Speaker 2>what about like our friend that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>

2696
01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:48.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

2697
01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about your body just given out </v>
<v Speaker 2>on you and that doesn't drive me now.</v>

2698
01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Well I think it does to a point </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

2699
01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.370
<v Speaker 2>But I also think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2700
01:54:55.371 --> 01:54:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I might have skin cancer right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know about it.</v>

2701
01:54:59.511 --> 01:55:04.511
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just either think about death all </v>

2702
01:55:04.511 --> 01:55:04.511
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you done?</v>

2703
01:55:04.511 --> 01:55:08.860
<v Speaker 2>So the red band approach is just to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>life capital might be a happy person,</v>

2704
01:55:09.111 --> 01:55:14.111
<v Speaker 2>but everybody else fight your wars and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do battle and then everyone else that </v>

2705
01:55:14.111 --> 01:55:16.260
<v Speaker 2>find out that everyone's stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever</v>

2706
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:18.930
<v Speaker 3>worry about your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your think rather about not worried,</v>

2707
01:55:18.931 --> 01:55:22.710
<v Speaker 3>but do you ever consider your position </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this world or do you just try to just</v>

2708
01:55:22.711 --> 01:55:22.920
<v Speaker 3>live?</v>

2709
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:25.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about anything like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

2710
01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Don't think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about my happiness and that </v>

2711
01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:32.060
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty much what I think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that I am.</v>

2712
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy and people are happy around </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2713
01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I just wind to be happy person and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want my friends to be happy,</v>

2714
01:55:39.590 --> 01:55:44.590
<v Speaker 2>but I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I care about any thing else about </v>

2715
01:55:44.590 --> 01:55:44.590
<v Speaker 2>like fucking or anything like</v>

2716
01:55:44.590 --> 01:55:44.680
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try not to.</v>

2717
01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:49.740
<v Speaker 3>So when the storm troopers come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to pack a bag and run </v>

2718
01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:49.740
<v Speaker 3>to the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

2719
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:52.950
<v Speaker 3>Give a fuck about borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They grow in joke.</v>

2720
01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:55.320
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because people can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2721
01:55:55.330 --> 01:55:57.720
<v Speaker 3>you can criticize that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say that's apathy,</v>

2722
01:55:57.870 --> 01:56:02.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this discussion that we had on the </v>

2723
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.870
<v Speaker 3>board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that they're right.</v>

2724
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:03.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at a certain point in time it is</v>

2725
01:56:03.751 --> 01:56:06.510
<v Speaker 3>a foolish notion to try to control a </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt system.</v>

2726
01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:08.730
<v Speaker 3>It's a foolish notion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

2727
01:56:08.731 --> 01:56:11.520
<v Speaker 3>I could see both sides of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see people saying,</v>

2728
01:56:11.521 --> 01:56:12.780
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everybody thought that way,</v>

2729
01:56:12.781 --> 01:56:14.100
<v Speaker 3>there'd be no government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be,</v>

2730
01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:15.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is bullshit.</v>

2731
01:56:15.241 --> 01:56:16.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to fucking stand up.</v>

2732
01:56:16.561 --> 01:56:19.050
<v Speaker 3>I could see that argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could also see her respond.</v>

2733
01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.070
<v Speaker 3>I see your argument.</v>

2734
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:21.910
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2735
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:25.080
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people are already has </v>
<v Speaker 3>that same argument.</v>

2736
01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:26.430
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do I care?</v>

2737
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:28.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna affect me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I care?</v>

2738
01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:33.420
<v Speaker 3>And in a certain way it really doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a certain way it does like social</v>

2739
01:56:33.421 --> 01:56:34.470
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

2740
01:56:34.471 --> 01:56:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Obama not going after the medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

2741
01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:38.760
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes a big difference to me.</v>

2742
01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:40.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's big to me.</v>

2743
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Real estate issues like legalizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>medical marijuana in the state of </v>

2744
01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:50.061
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something worth fucking voting </v>

2745
01:56:50.061 --> 01:56:50.061
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a huge thing.</v>

2746
01:56:50.061 --> 01:56:53.160
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real issue that got resolved </v>

2747
01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.401
<v Speaker 3>and it changed a lot of people's lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it changed the whole climate of </v>

2748
01:56:55.401 --> 01:56:56.490
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are way more relaxed.</v>

2749
01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:58.490
<v Speaker 3>People are way chiller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2750
01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.540
<v Speaker 3>the access to weed is through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2751
01:57:00.541 --> 01:57:03.870
<v Speaker 3>there's never been more access to in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country ever than right now.</v>

2752
01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:06.960
<v Speaker 3>That's a real issue that was resolved by</v>
<v Speaker 3>voting.</v>

2753
01:57:07.170 --> 01:57:12.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like state voting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>voting on state issues like that where </v>

2754
01:57:12.170 --> 01:57:13.050
<v Speaker 3>you can actually pick the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's real shit.</v>

2755
01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:16.500
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Local politics seem to be real,</v>

2756
01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:21.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the reason why California is so </v>

2757
01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:21.920
<v Speaker 3>in depth.</v>
