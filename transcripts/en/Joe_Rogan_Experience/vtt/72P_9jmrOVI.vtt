<v Speaker 2>Experience Joe Rogan podcast all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 2>a very special episode podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsorship free,</v>

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Mckenna and Josh Twickenham.</v>

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Josh is from the Ethno Ethno Botanical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stewardship Council,</v>

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.190
<v Speaker 1>one of the founders of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what exactly does that mean for </v>

11
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.451
<v Speaker 1>folks who have no idea what ethno </v>
<v Speaker 1>botanical or stewardship means?</v>

12
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people struggle with counsel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you're counseling people </v>

13
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>and ethno botanical stewardship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>imagine bringing that up at a party.</v>

15
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ESC is dedicated to transforming </v>

16
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 3>lives through assuring the safety and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainability of traditional plants.</v>

17
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 3>So that means a trans transforming </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's lives through experiences with </v>

18
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:12.121
<v Speaker 3>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also means the sustainability of </v>

19
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 3>plants and the safety in their use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're starting with Iowasca and uh,</v>

20
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 3>it bogus.</v>

21
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>

22
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.350
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't start with like ferns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't get excited about a,</v>

23
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get eucalyptus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People really want to get fired up about</v>

24
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Iowaska,</v>

25
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>anything involving tryptamines for folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>who've experienced it,</v>

26
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>it's something worth saving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

27
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>You guys find it odd that in this day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and age,</v>

28
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:41.161
<v Speaker 1>in 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person who you would go up </v>

29
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>to to try to discuss these issues with </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have no idea what you were talking</v>

30
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

31
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think over the last few years that's </v>

32
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.771
<v Speaker 1>kind of changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A IOWASCA is emerging into mass </v>

33
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>

34
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago,</v>

35
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>if you approach the average person on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the street and you've said Iowasca,</v>

36
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.280
<v Speaker 1>they'd look at you like you had a speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>impediment or select,</v>

37
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>but chances are people would recognize </v>
<v Speaker 1>it now and not in necessarily know what </v>

38
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:18.201
<v Speaker 1>it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily have a negative or a </v>

39
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:20.901
<v Speaker 1>positive view of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the meme is out there and I think </v>

40
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:25.371
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately it's most certainly a good </v>

41
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:25.371
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

42
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>That means it's certainly out there with</v>
<v Speaker 1>young folks.</v>

43
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>But with folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm 46 of folks my age and older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets a little sketch,</v>

45
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

46
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

47
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks who already have mortgages and </v>

48
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>families?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones that's very difficult</v>

49
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>to get them to even consider what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

50
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.100
<v Speaker 3>You'd be surprised the ESC has sent out </v>
<v Speaker 3>a call for experts and we've been until </v>

51
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.010
<v Speaker 3>infiltrated by the mainstream people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that do evaluation work for the World </v>

52
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Bank and USA id.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're interested in Iowasca.</v>

53
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:02.571
<v Speaker 3>People are going down to south to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these transformative experiences to sit </v>

54
00:03:02.571 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 3>in ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of underground activity in</v>

55
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 3>the US as well in Europe where it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>legal,</v>

56
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:13.711
<v Speaker 3>but in South America and Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca is protected as national </v>

57
00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:13.711
<v Speaker 3>patrimony.</v>

58
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.180
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.270
<v Speaker 4>So beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever worry that you're being </v>

60
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.700
<v Speaker 4>infiltrated by government agents who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

61
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.380
<v Speaker 3>who would want that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

62
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing anything illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're working in countries where Iowa </v>

63
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 3>Ska is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been used for hundreds of years </v>

64
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.221
<v Speaker 3>traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're looking at increasing the </v>

65
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:38.450
<v Speaker 3>safety of it so that we're creating a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of self regulatory model.</v>

66
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 3>So that we can take that model to places</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's illegal and say this is a </v>

67
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.200
<v Speaker 3>totally safe medicine if you do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

68
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.400
<v Speaker 3>People with certain medical conditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't take Iowasca,</v>

69
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done with a skilled curandero or shaman </v>

70
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.210
<v Speaker 3>in the right setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can,</v>

71
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 3>it can be helpful for all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological issues or ptsd or </v>

72
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 3>depression and just give people a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective on their lives.</v>

73
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 4>Most certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

74
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:11.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm completely joking around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I was saying when I was like,</v>

75
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hasn't happened with marijuana </v>

76
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 4>marijuana is they're still fighting it </v>
<v Speaker 4>tooth and nail despite all the evidence </v>

77
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.960
<v Speaker 4>that it's not just beneficial but </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably prevents a lot of cancers and </v>

78
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.731
<v Speaker 4>does a lot of fantastic work with ptsd </v>
<v Speaker 4>and with anxiety and all sorts of </v>

79
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 4>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>medical issues,</v>

80
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:36.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interocular pressure for people with </v>

81
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:36.601
<v Speaker 4>Glaucoma and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and on and on.</v>

82
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 4>People with aids that are having a hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>time keeping their appetite up.</v>

83
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 4>Cancer patients,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's still,</v>

84
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.340
<v Speaker 4>they fight it tooth and claw and Iowasca</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a completely different barrel of </v>

85
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.211
<v Speaker 4>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>WASC is coming at this through the back </v>

86
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:54.381
<v Speaker 4>door and I mean it's interesting that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>has gained recognition over time to the </v>

87
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 4>extent that it does and to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>extent I would say it's,</v>

88
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Josh,</v>

89
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 4>people like Josh and me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we say we work for the plants,</v>

90
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

91
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 4>And ios has got its own agenda </v>
<v Speaker 4>interestingly,</v>

92
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:15.451
<v Speaker 4>and people go down to South America and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have these experiences that are </v>

93
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:20.071
<v Speaker 4>regulatory and self transforming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but often they come back with an </v>

94
00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:24.991
<v Speaker 4>enhanced ecological consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>enhanced awareness of the connection </v>

95
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 4>between humanity and nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that nature is threatened.</v>

96
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.590
<v Speaker 4>And I think if Iowasca is sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>messenger from the community of species </v>

97
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.150
<v Speaker 4>that's trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

98
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 4>tell the the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these monkeys to wake up,</v>

99
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 4>you clowns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

100
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.270
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

101
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 4>we're coming down to the wire it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in a crisis here.</v>

102
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:49.951
<v Speaker 4>You've got to really understand where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you fit into nature and do what can be </v>

103
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 4>done in the ever shrinking time that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

104
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.910
<v Speaker 4>So people come back with this renewed </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of awareness of the </v>

105
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 4>interconnectedness of life and that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a role in this.</v>

106
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.950
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we primates and we have to really </v>

107
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.741
<v Speaker 4>understand what our role is as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as stewards of nature rather than </v>

108
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.050
<v Speaker 4>exploiters of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was,</v>

109
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the message that delivers to many</v>

110
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:21.220
<v Speaker 4>people and unexpectedly they may not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>going there to,</v>

111
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

112
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 4>to experience that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's what they come away with.</v>

113
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.750
<v Speaker 4>From your work and from your brothers </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

114
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

115
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.930
<v Speaker 1>what I got a that I'd never considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>before was that psychedelics in,</v>

116
00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:41.101
<v Speaker 1>in various forms may very well be </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for why we are human beings </v>

117
00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:46.591
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our separation from them might be </v>

118
00:06:46.591 --> 00:06:50.041
<v Speaker 1>the whole reason why we're so haywire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why we're missing a crucial ingredient </v>

119
00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:53.770
<v Speaker 1>involved in the creation of cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought in the first place.</v>

120
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:58.771
<v Speaker 1>The creation of this ability to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and communicate our ideas and </v>

121
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.950
<v Speaker 1>really become a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we were separated from the </v>

122
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.691
<v Speaker 1>mother and left to our own devices and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our wild animal instincts sort of</v>

123
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:15.391
<v Speaker 1>take over and our animal instincts sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of don't coexist peacefully in this </v>

124
00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:19.930
<v Speaker 1>weird world that we've created as human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

125
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.290
<v Speaker 1>And then we create chaos because of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we can't see what we're doing.</v>

126
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IOWASCA allows you to see what you're</v>

127
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.160
<v Speaker 4>IOWASCA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

128
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 4>I asked her refocuses the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding.</v>

129
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.530
<v Speaker 4>I think of the relationship that we have</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have to nature.</v>

130
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.550
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

131
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 4>if you believe in plant intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are different ways of </v>

132
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.720
<v Speaker 4>looking at plant intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

133
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting how often people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

134
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.350
<v Speaker 4>they come out with this renewed </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding and I think that's,</v>

135
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.630
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

136
00:07:51.631 --> 00:07:56.631
<v Speaker 4>a desperate to call on the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>community of species and Ios has been </v>

137
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.940
<v Speaker 4>delegated to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to kind of lead that conversation.</v>

138
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating that Iowasca is the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been in the forefront when </v>

139
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms are so damn easy to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

140
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean anyone can essentially get ahold </v>
<v Speaker 1>of some spores and start cooking them in</v>

141
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:17.741
<v Speaker 1>your basement like really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas IOWASCA is probably the most </v>

142
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:22.721
<v Speaker 1>complex common atory beverage that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know of as far as like psychedelic </v>

143
00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:27.371
<v Speaker 1>bruise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one that requires the most </v>

144
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one that requires the most care</v>

145
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:32.561
<v Speaker 1>and creating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's easier to extract DMT and than </v>

146
00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:37.301
<v Speaker 1>it is to create iom and get all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants and brew it together and know </v>

147
00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>someone who really knows what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

148
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:41.720
<v Speaker 1>how to cook up a good batch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that that's the one.</v>

149
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has its.</v>

150
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.540
<v Speaker 4>I think it's because it is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

151
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

152
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's escaped from its home in the Amazon</v>

153
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 4>and that's the area on the planet with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the greatest bio diversity and all that.</v>

154
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 4>But it's got all those associations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

155
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 4>people regard it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean mushrooms are also important,</v>

156
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 4>but they just don't seem to carry that </v>
<v Speaker 4>same.</v>

157
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Emotional kick Iowasca gives the one </v>

158
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 4>right now that's getting all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention,</v>

159
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

160
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.780
<v Speaker 4>and it's quintessentially a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms aren't plants,</v>

161
00:09:20.781 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 4>so maybe that's part of the disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

162
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:28.731
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these things in indigenous </v>

163
00:09:28.731 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 4>cultures are regarded as plant teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

164
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.480
<v Speaker 4>and as you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it comes down to trip to being </v>

165
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.120
<v Speaker 4>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

166
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:42.170
<v Speaker 4>our brains for some reason are </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionarily prime to react to </v>

167
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 4>tryptamines.</v>

168
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have these tryptamine detectors for </v>

169
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 4>some reason and I think it's partly that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can,</v>

170
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.510
<v Speaker 4>so that we can receive and interpret </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're trying to tell us and what </v>

171
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:02.451
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to tell us is there's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>much time left and we have to really,</v>

172
00:10:02.591 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 4>really understand our relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>

173
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 4>We have to realize that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>separate from nature.</v>

174
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to overcome at least 2000 </v>

175
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 4>years of Judaeo Christian history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

176
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

177
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 4>those traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're 10.</v>

178
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 4>Their whole agenda in a certain sense is</v>
<v Speaker 4>to devalue nature.</v>

179
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature is something that we own.</v>

180
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 4>It's there for us to exploit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's up there for us to rape.</v>

181
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're busy doing that because,</v>

182
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

183
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 4>my problem with those religions is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>focus is always on the afterlife.</v>

184
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 4>So it tends to make you devalue this </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

185
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:41.210
<v Speaker 4>It makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

186
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

187
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it teaches people to devalue nature,</v>

188
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:49.101
<v Speaker 4>to devalue their bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to devalue personal experience,</v>

189
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these things.</v>

190
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 4>And that leads to the very out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance situation that we have going.</v>

191
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

192
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:03.651
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's disturbing to me is that we're </v>

193
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:04.680
<v Speaker 4>all part of this circle of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the converted.</v>

194
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:05.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

195
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.110
<v Speaker 4>we got the memo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

196
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.070
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the meme is spreading,</v>

197
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 4>the memo is spreading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not sure it's fast enough.</v>

198
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that it's possible that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human race is essentially cramming?</v>

199
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:24.130
<v Speaker 1>You know how when you're about to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>test and you put it off till the last </v>

200
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.370
<v Speaker 1>minute and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day before you're like,</v>

201
00:11:25.371 --> 00:11:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta deal with this.</v>

202
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.200
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd go bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd taken adderall.</v>

203
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:32.930
<v Speaker 1>You filed through books until your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to explode.</v>

204
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.720
<v Speaker 1>That is a characteristic that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common for people that want to </v>

205
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.690
<v Speaker 1>attack a project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially an important project.</v>

206
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:47.130
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like we have this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it has to be completely </v>

207
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.660
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming where it can't be ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we go into it full throttle.</v>

208
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that the human race is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that maybe part of our self </v>

209
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.901
<v Speaker 1>destructive tendencies are actually us </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing that we're fucking up and </v>

210
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:06.390
<v Speaker 1>going into it more chaotically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more materialistically,</v>

211
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 1>more shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more nonsense,</v>

212
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:11.380
<v Speaker 1>more Kim Carr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dash in more American idol,</v>

213
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:16.381
<v Speaker 1>more horse shit just to get you to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where you get so sick of it,</v>

214
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.880
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

215
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you puke it up and then move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

216
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're in the middle of an ecological</v>

217
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 3>crisis and time is running out and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly are cramming.</v>

218
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're destroying the Amazon.</v>

219
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:32.510
<v Speaker 3>We're destroying the climate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're destroying</v>

220
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.040
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're destroying the air.</v>

221
00:12:34.041 --> 00:12:36.230
<v Speaker 1>We're destroying everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get our greasy little hands on,</v>

222
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.540
<v Speaker 3>and this is the first time in the 500 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of European colonization of the </v>

223
00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:47.451
<v Speaker 3>Americas that there's a kind of reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a reverse sort of message coming from </v>

224
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.480
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are going there not to convert,</v>

225
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.530
<v Speaker 3>but to be converted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to learn to learn the traditions and the</v>

226
00:12:55.531 --> 00:13:00.531
<v Speaker 3>indigenous people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety five percent of their population </v>

227
00:13:00.531 --> 00:13:03.140
<v Speaker 3>was wiped out by viruses or wars or </v>
<v Speaker 3>plagues.</v>

228
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.090
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now we have this opportunity to come</v>

229
00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:11.091
<v Speaker 3>back from the brink and work with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca that grows in the canopy of the </v>

230
00:13:11.371 --> 00:13:15.000
<v Speaker 3>rain forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have Iowasca without the trees</v>

231
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:20.270
<v Speaker 3>and it's so it's an alternative to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mining and oil exploitation and there's </v>

232
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.760
<v Speaker 3>money to be made in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think coming back to cannabis,</v>

233
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
<v Speaker 3>the reason the dialogue is starting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change is because governments are </v>

234
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.730
<v Speaker 3>realizing there's a lot of money to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>

235
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Taxation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a solution to budget crises.</v>

236
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the same with Iowaska tourism.</v>

237
00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:42.291
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to say tourism because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are legitimately seeking a </v>

238
00:13:42.291 --> 00:13:46.821
<v Speaker 3>spiritual experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people just want to go have an </v>

239
00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:46.821
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

240
00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 4>assuming wrong with the word tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I know what you're saying.</v>

241
00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 4>Like the frivolous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it does.</v>

242
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.840
<v Speaker 4>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

243
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.120
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I asked it,</v>

244
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:56.990
<v Speaker 4>tourism is a beautiful way or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pilgrimage.</v>

245
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Yaps is [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that tourism is a,</v>

246
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 4>is a phase in our relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Iowasca.</v>

247
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:08.710
<v Speaker 4>I think that I think that potentially if</v>
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't,</v>

248
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I view is going on now is kind of a</v>

249
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.790
<v Speaker 4>rough period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what is really being played out here</v>

250
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.530
<v Speaker 4>is the co-evolutionary relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 4>these plants that have gone on,</v>

251
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.060
<v Speaker 4>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever since we became cognitive beans.</v>

252
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:30.061
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the plants that triggered that </v>

253
00:14:30.061 --> 00:14:30.630
<v Speaker 4>and now and that conversation is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and that,</v>

254
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.640
<v Speaker 4>but now the conversation has gone to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>new level where Iowasca before was kind </v>

255
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

256
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:38.770
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

257
00:14:38.771 --> 00:14:43.771
<v Speaker 4>it was under the stewardship of </v>
<v Speaker 4>indigenous people confined to the </v>

258
00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:43.771
<v Speaker 4>Amazon.</v>

259
00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:46.180
<v Speaker 4>Now it's circling the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think this is partly,</v>

260
00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:51.181
<v Speaker 4>this is what plants do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like to spread and they're </v>

261
00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 4>spreading out into different cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the plant itself is now,</v>

262
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if the Amazon is destroyed,</v>

263
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 4>which it may well be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ask is not going to be destroyed.</v>

264
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 4>It's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's already escaped.</v>

265
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.780
<v Speaker 4>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

266
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 4>hopefully we can arrest this process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

267
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're seeing is,</v>

268
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.130
<v Speaker 4>has always been a evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship where,</v>

269
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at some time,</v>

270
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.900
<v Speaker 4>some points it's more quieter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's underground,</v>

271
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:21.530
<v Speaker 4>but at some point says as the crisis </v>
<v Speaker 4>deepens,</v>

272
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 4>it's becoming more and more public in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

273
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.910
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

274
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:28.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what you see going on,</v>

275
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:28.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

276
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.170
<v Speaker 4>and potentially I think that Iowaska,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

277
00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:38.171
<v Speaker 4>we're now discovering that it's good for</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many things,</v>

278
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>therapeutically for addictions,</v>

279
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:44.510
<v Speaker 4>for depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for ptsd and that sort of thing.</v>

280
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:49.510
<v Speaker 4>And that's all to the good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we shouldn't make the mistake of </v>

281
00:15:50.331 --> 00:15:53.540
<v Speaker 4>thinking Iowasca is only for sick </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

282
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

283
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:59.321
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all wounded and we all need to </v>

284
00:15:59.321 --> 00:16:00.680
<v Speaker 4>understand something about our </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship to nature,</v>

285
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:06.340
<v Speaker 4>potentially the paradigms that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>emerging in Ios get tourism or these </v>

286
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.870
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

287
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 4>these eyewash gets centered spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 4>communities in the states.</v>

288
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Potentially this has the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

289
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 4>this may transform mental health care in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this country.</v>

290
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:24.341
<v Speaker 4>It may transform psychiatry and from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it might transform medicine and it </v>

291
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:30.011
<v Speaker 4>might actually transform all these other</v>
<v Speaker 4>institutions that we have to deal with </v>

292
00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:34.361
<v Speaker 4>whose values have become twisted over </v>
<v Speaker 4>2000 years of,</v>

293
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.510
<v Speaker 4>of bullshit and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and indoctrination.</v>

294
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

295
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 4>these institutions are not going away </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're fine.</v>

296
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:48.340
<v Speaker 4>They just need to rediscover a moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimension to the consequences of their </v>

297
00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:51.320
<v Speaker 4>action,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that makes any sense.</v>

298
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

299
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:57.570
<v Speaker 4>our cleverness far exceeds our wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a problem.</v>

300
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:03.731
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem we've got to become </v>
<v Speaker 4>wise and when we couple that with our </v>

301
00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:10.211
<v Speaker 4>ingenuity and our cleverness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>them will be on the way toward saving </v>

302
00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:11.840
<v Speaker 4>the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saving ourselves.</v>

303
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I think there's also this growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of all the factors that </v>

304
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:21.601
<v Speaker 1>encompass a healthy person and how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them have to do with your conception </v>

305
00:17:21.601 --> 00:17:23.830
<v Speaker 1>of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of them have to do with the way</v>

306
00:17:23.831 --> 00:17:26.830
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of them have to do with how you</v>

307
00:17:26.831 --> 00:17:29.890
<v Speaker 1>view your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you view your environment as hostile,</v>

308
00:17:29.891 --> 00:17:32.410
<v Speaker 1>stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antagonizing,</v>

309
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.820
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative place,</v>

310
00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:38.020
<v Speaker 1>you'll get sicker and your body fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know what to do.</v>

311
00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:43.021
<v Speaker 1>It's fighting it constantly and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a battle and you're all </v>

312
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:45.970
<v Speaker 1>stressed out and you're susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things and they're in.</v>

313
00:17:45.971 --> 00:17:50.971
<v Speaker 1>In that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a direct physical between </v>

314
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:55.401
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences and improved </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and that's something that people </v>

315
00:17:55.401 --> 00:18:00.380
<v Speaker 1>really need to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think once that catches route,</v>

316
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.450
<v Speaker 1>once people grasp that concept and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the incredible pressure,</v>

317
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:08.320
<v Speaker 1>alleviating alleviating properties like </v>
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>

318
00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I can remember one of the first times I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever did DMT,</v>

319
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

320
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day afterwards,</v>

321
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.210
<v Speaker 1>like I had this completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of the world that I had to sort of </v>

322
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:25.161
<v Speaker 1>apply now all these other and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out like do all these,</v>

323
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:31.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these factors that I've considered as </v>

324
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.131
<v Speaker 1>being important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of them am I going to throw </v>

325
00:18:34.131 --> 00:18:34.131
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

326
00:18:34.131 --> 00:18:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Like the way I described it as like my </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer rebooted and now only has one </v>

327
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:42.231
<v Speaker 1>folder on the desktop and that folder is</v>
<v Speaker 1>labeled my old bullshit and so now I </v>

328
00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:43.950
<v Speaker 1>have to open this folder and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

329
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:45.990
<v Speaker 1>how much of this is valid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jesus,</v>

330
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:48.900
<v Speaker 1>this is my whole thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my whole mind.</v>

331
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.230
<v Speaker 1>This is how I interface with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately some of it made its way </v>

332
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.660
<v Speaker 1>back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:59.661
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to do another trip a few months </v>

334
00:18:59.661 --> 00:19:01.640
<v Speaker 1>later and then I threw out more of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a sort of a,</v>

335
00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deliberate process of reevaluation.</v>

336
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't reject it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All</v>

337
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.570
<v Speaker 4>good stuff in that folder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think what the DMT experience,</v>

338
00:19:10.571 --> 00:19:13.510
<v Speaker 4>the psychedelic experience does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

339
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 4>that's partly what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like your analogy of the folder </v>

340
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.600
<v Speaker 4>because now you're looking at the folder</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the desktop.</v>

341
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.950
<v Speaker 4>You're outside the folder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

342
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 4>so it's liberated you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were imprisoned in the folder </v>

343
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.211
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you can look at it from the outside </v>

344
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:30.211
<v Speaker 4>and you can go through and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

345
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:30.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>delete,</v>

346
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:30.700
<v Speaker 4>delete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>delete,</v>

347
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.660
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is good.</v>

348
00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Let's keep this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

349
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.500
<v Speaker 4>let's integrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

350
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

351
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:41.490
<v Speaker 4>ultimately this is a process of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>personal cleansing both physically and </v>

352
00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:47.581
<v Speaker 4>emotionally and psychologically and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>encounters with these things,</v>

353
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.800
<v Speaker 4>but also cultural cleansing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

354
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>

355
00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.090
<v Speaker 4>there good memes out there and there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>good things going on,</v>

356
00:19:55.091 --> 00:19:56.210
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

357
00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.870
<v Speaker 4>there's so much noise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much bullshit.</v>

358
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to sort out what's worth </v>
<v Speaker 4>preserving and what needs to be </v>

359
00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.340
<v Speaker 4>dispensed with.</v>

360
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I think we're also kind of trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird world of our creations as far</v>

361
00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:15.070
<v Speaker 1>as technology as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that technology,</v>

362
00:20:15.071 --> 00:20:20.071
<v Speaker 1>just like corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like anything that sort of becomes </v>

363
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:23.570
<v Speaker 1>a force that's constantly growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a,</v>

364
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.950
<v Speaker 1>it has a certain self preservation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a aspect to it,</v>

365
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.160
<v Speaker 1>and I think that we're completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to the idea of constant </v>

366
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.571
<v Speaker 1>innovation and constantly improving </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and that also is completely </v>

367
00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:40.441
<v Speaker 1>connected us to materialism because </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialism is the real driving force </v>

368
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:43.150
<v Speaker 1>behind constant innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we all just looked at our laptops and</v>

369
00:20:43.151 --> 00:20:43.990
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good,</v>

370
00:20:43.991 --> 00:20:46.930
<v Speaker 1>are you good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no need to call apple right now.</v>

371
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are fucking great.</v>

372
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Stop right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

373
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 1>You literally don't need to improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet speed.</v>

374
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to improve the laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's wonderful.</v>

375
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's stop all this and let's move on to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

376
00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what everybody wants.</v>

377
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants the newest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>latest,</v>

378
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 1>greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fastest dual video processor.</v>

379
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I want to screen that roles and folds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

380
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.510
<v Speaker 4>But that's part of the trap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

381
00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:17.100
<v Speaker 4>This idea that we have to keep upgrading</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the iphone 10 or whatever.</v>

382
00:21:17.101 --> 00:21:20.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these tools work and there and it in the</v>

383
00:21:20.311 --> 00:21:21.800
<v Speaker 4>proper way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

384
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.440
<v Speaker 4>they can be tremendously important for </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>

385
00:21:25.441 --> 00:21:29.130
<v Speaker 4>evolution and transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the psychedelics are,</v>

386
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:34.220
<v Speaker 4>they're just tools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are kind of technology and like I </v>

387
00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.511
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>often to my classes and they'll </v>

388
00:21:38.511 --> 00:21:39.750
<v Speaker 4>elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Technology in itself is neither good nor</v>

389
00:21:39.751 --> 00:21:41.670
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drugs are neither good nor bad.</v>

390
00:21:41.671 --> 00:21:44.280
<v Speaker 4>These technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all about how you apply them.</v>

391
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.430
<v Speaker 4>That's where the moral dimension comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

392
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.760
<v Speaker 4>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

393
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.700
<v Speaker 4>you can use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can misuse technology,</v>

394
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.380
<v Speaker 4>internet technology to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

395
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.280
<v Speaker 4>propagate whatever the Kardashians are </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing lately over the Internet.</v>

396
00:21:59.281 --> 00:22:01.590
<v Speaker 4>But you can also change hearts and minds</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

397
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.410
<v Speaker 4>with those tools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like for example,</v>

398
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>mandate is to plug this thing.</v>

401
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 4>But it's important.</v>

<v Speaker 4>live streaming and streaming and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

420
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.120
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a stealth advertisement </v>
<v Speaker 4>for my new product coming out,</v>

421
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.300
<v Speaker 4>which is the Dennis Mckenna bobblehead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in this trailer and I looked like I </v>

422
00:23:21.361 --> 00:23:23.530
<v Speaker 4>have a movement disorder or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then,</v>

<v Speaker 5>movement disorder?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

428
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.840
<v Speaker 5>I know we're playing it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You'll see what I mean.</v>

430
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:40.510
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just looked at it this morning and I </v>

431
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.761
<v Speaker 5>thought actually this bubble hand ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's going on here?</v>

432
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.590

<v Speaker 5>I'm just bouncing Hamilton.</v>

433
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.600
<v Speaker 5>Maurice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how high was the person who made this </v>

434
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 5>pretty high?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty high.</v>

435
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.080
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just made it last night.</v>

436
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 5>I looked at it this morning and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seriously,</v>

437
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.400
<v Speaker 5>she really liked this to be on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole page.</v>

438
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.500
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

439
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 5>the important thing is get past the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

440
00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.620
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trailer and you can,</v>

441
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.660
<v Speaker 5>you can sign up for this symposium,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is these guys,</v>

442
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:19.160
<v Speaker 5>these young fellows of NAM pursed are </v>
<v Speaker 5>really enthusiastic and good,</v>

443
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:24.340
<v Speaker 5>good people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want this conference to have an </v>

444
00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:24.340
<v Speaker 5>impact and I think it will.</v>

445
00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Amherst is one of the few places in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts I consider living.</v>

446
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I got familiar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

447
00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

448
00:24:31.681 --> 00:24:36.681
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an ex girlfriend who moved out </v>

449
00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:36.681
<v Speaker 1>there when I was in high school and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to go out there and visit her.</v>

450
00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

451
00:24:36.721 --> 00:24:37.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking,</v>

452
00:24:37.891 --> 00:24:42.891
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like a totally different world </v>

453
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:44.991
<v Speaker 1>out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all like birkenstock wearing </v>

454
00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:46.120
<v Speaker 1>strange hippie openminded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

455
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a strange place in the middle of</v>

456
00:24:50.191 --> 00:24:54.120
<v Speaker 1>western Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western Massachusetts is a strange place</v>

457
00:24:54.121 --> 00:24:56.890
<v Speaker 1>in and of itself because you have Boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>w,</v>

458
00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.140
<v Speaker 1>which is a very big city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very educated,</v>

459
00:25:01.141 --> 00:25:03.150
<v Speaker 1>more colleges per capita than anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

460
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.340
<v Speaker 1>but then as you get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts,</v>

461
00:25:05.341 --> 00:25:10.341
<v Speaker 1>you might as well be in Kentucky for </v>
<v Speaker 1>about an hour and 20 minutes and then </v>

462
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:14.421
<v Speaker 1>you get to this weird oasis where like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the the woods part and then you know,</v>

463
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 1>you have this strange place in amherst </v>
<v Speaker 1>was really highly educated and open </v>

464
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.870
<v Speaker 1>minded liberal community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

465
00:25:21.871 --> 00:25:26.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I've ever been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm looking forward to this </v>

466
00:25:26.871 --> 00:25:26.871
<v Speaker 1>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did enjoy it.</v>

467
00:25:26.871 --> 00:25:27.280
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

468
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.540
<v Speaker 1>it really is the perfect place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very much like a very small Austin </v>

469
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.400
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of of Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with no music,</v>

470
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.810
<v Speaker 1>not as much music.</v>

471
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 3>The guys organizing the conference </v>
<v Speaker 3>really are working with the plants and </v>

472
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.310
<v Speaker 3>for the plants and you don't have to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>there to participate.</v>

473
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.690
<v Speaker 3>The the beauty beauty is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this live sign up for 10 bucks.</v>

474
00:25:48.691 --> 00:25:53.691
<v Speaker 3>You get a screening of neurons to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nirvana a great film and access to all </v>

475
00:25:54.541 --> 00:25:56.810
<v Speaker 3>the presenters and interview.</v>

476
00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.460
<v Speaker 4>Have you interviewed or shown neurons to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nirvana on your.</v>

477
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.310
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>

478
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from a technical point of view,</v>

479
00:26:05.381 --> 00:26:10.381
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can criticize it from that point of </v>

480
00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:13.831
<v Speaker 4>view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as an educational tool for </v>

481
00:26:13.831 --> 00:26:16.501
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is really an interesting </v>

482
00:26:16.501 --> 00:26:19.740
<v Speaker 4>movie and it's the kind of thing you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit down with your parents and watch and</v>

483
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:26.070
<v Speaker 4>they will come away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe some of their assumptions will be </v>

484
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.070
<v Speaker 4>shaken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

485
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very good educational tool for,</v>

486
00:26:28.451 --> 00:26:33.451
<v Speaker 4>under the subtitle is understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic medicines and it's </v>

487
00:26:33.451 --> 00:26:34.180
<v Speaker 4>entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>

488
00:26:34.181 --> 00:26:39.181
<v Speaker 4>And it's a kind of a review of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting edge research on a,</v>

489
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.210
<v Speaker 4>bout four or five psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mtma,</v>

490
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.330
<v Speaker 4>Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms,</v>

491
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:47.420
<v Speaker 4>Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

492
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 4>and where the state of the art research </v>
<v Speaker 4>is on that.</v>

493
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 4>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

494
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 4>these chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

495
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 4>what we need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as we were talking about before,</v>

496
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:02.721
<v Speaker 4>we need to change hearts and minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's a Cliche,</v>

497
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:08.180
<v Speaker 4>but these chemicals under the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances are actually a way to do </v>

498
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And coupled with that is education.</v>

499
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.920
<v Speaker 4>Education is so important and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of the vision of these gentlemen,</v>

500
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.320
<v Speaker 4>Brett Green and the and his colleagues </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

501
00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>symposia like this are an important </v>

502
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.260
<v Speaker 4>component of this because it's a way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting the information out and the more</v>

503
00:27:28.261 --> 00:27:32.700
<v Speaker 4>people that can be gotten out to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the faster the change can be.</v>

504
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Can Be implemented.</v>

505
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

506
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:39.830
<v Speaker 1>The change hearts and minds is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting cliche because we've heard </v>

507
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.800
<v Speaker 1>it so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like we've heard Wolf Wolf,</v>

508
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's wolves,</v>

509
00:27:41.811 --> 00:27:43.440
<v Speaker 1>there's wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

510
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:45.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

511
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:50.870
<v Speaker 1>The first time I did any psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first major one besides Mtma was </v>

512
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:54.180
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and then that was my first </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience like,</v>

513
00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:56.050
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a wolf like this is.</v>

514
00:27:56.051 --> 00:28:01.051
<v Speaker 1>This is a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't something that you have to </v>

515
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 1>believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that's unavoidable,</v>

516
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter if you believe in it.</v>

517
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't care if a parent for it to,</v>

518
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be.</v>

519
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can be.</v>

520
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.870
<v Speaker 1>The best you can be prepared for is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give up.</v>

521
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fight it.</v>

522
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Being prepared for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a few yoga classes,</v>

523
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:22.620
<v Speaker 1>know what it's like to be uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep breathing and then just then do</v>

524
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:24.660
<v Speaker 1>it and then listen to it.</v>

525
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Surrender to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The message is there.</v>

526
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will.</v>

527
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:33.100
<v Speaker 1>You said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very controversial but oddly </v>

528
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.111
<v Speaker 1>fascinating thing that plants are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why we are human beings today.</v>

529
00:28:36.391 --> 00:28:41.391
<v Speaker 1>Why in these plant medicines and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>these psychedelic compounds,</v>

530
00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:47.220
<v Speaker 1>w why is that so controversial?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that to be incredibly amazing.</v>

531
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.930
<v Speaker 1>When I talked to really intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and I bring that idea up and they</v>

532
00:28:51.931 --> 00:28:56.931
<v Speaker 1>dismiss it like almost instantaneously </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't understand why because I get</v>

533
00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:04.701
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're connecting the idea of a </v>

534
00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:04.701
<v Speaker 1>drug to a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that,</v>

535
00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:09.620
<v Speaker 1>but when you want to talk about powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>influences on cognitive thought,</v>

536
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:14.990
<v Speaker 1>is there any more powerful influences on</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive thought than a psychedelic </v>

537
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 1>drug?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there is.</v>

538
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I think I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why that wouldn't be </v>

539
00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:20.880
<v Speaker 1>immediately considered at the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>list,</v>

540
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.460
<v Speaker 1>top of the short list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

541
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.750
<v Speaker 1>It's Harrison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

542
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.390
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an unconventional idea.</v>

543
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at,</v>

544
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we as a species,</v>

545
00:29:31.081 --> 00:29:36.081
<v Speaker 4>we evolved in the rain forest initially </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we evolved in an environment of </v>

546
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 4>incredible chemical diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

547
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.520
<v Speaker 4>and it's absurd to assume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

548
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:50.580
<v Speaker 4>and the reason they're such chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity in the plant kingdom is that </v>

549
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.560
<v Speaker 4>they're great chemists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

550
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.610
<v Speaker 4>and they make all these chemicals for </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever purposes.</v>

551
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.780
<v Speaker 4>That's how plants mediate their </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with their environment,</v>

552
00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

553
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 4>they substitute biosynthesis for </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

554
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 4>This is what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a cliche.</v>

555
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 4>They can't react to their environment </v>
<v Speaker 4>through behavior.</v>

556
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 4>They can't run away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't fight.</v>

557
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 4>They fight through chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At,</v>

558
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 4>on the other side of that coin is we are</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical systems.</v>

559
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate to break it to you folks,</v>

560
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 4>but we're made of drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

561
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.550
<v Speaker 4>That's why drugs work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're biochemical engines.</v>

562
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 4>Our brains are biochemical engines that </v>
<v Speaker 4>run on neurotransmitters.</v>

563
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.710
<v Speaker 4>These plant compounds are our </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmitters essentially.</v>

564
00:30:32.711 --> 00:30:34.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

565
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.240
<v Speaker 4>they were in plants a long time before </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were in our brains before they was </v>

566
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.560
<v Speaker 4>even complex brains of fte utilize these</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and are,</v>

567
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the course of evolution,</v>

568
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 4>we internalize these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have adapted them to our own,</v>

569
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:52.381
<v Speaker 4>like internal signaling processes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now we have the,</v>

570
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the neurological tools if you will,</v>

571
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.970
<v Speaker 4>to talk to the plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

572
00:30:57.971 --> 00:31:02.971
<v Speaker 4>they've always been talking to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we can actually have a conversation </v>

573
00:31:02.971 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 4>and the ca you get into the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the conversation is,</v>

574
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

575
00:31:06.441 --> 00:31:09.010
<v Speaker 4>you monkeys need to move to the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>

576
00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:14.011
<v Speaker 4>You need to get more conscious of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>place in nature,</v>

577
00:31:14.321 --> 00:31:19.321
<v Speaker 4>our place in nature as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A realize that we're not separate from </v>

578
00:31:19.321 --> 00:31:19.321
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

579
00:31:19.321 --> 00:31:21.760
<v Speaker 4>We're part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if it goes down,</v>

580
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.990
<v Speaker 4>we go down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

581
00:31:22.991 --> 00:31:25.420
<v Speaker 4>there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no escape.</v>

582
00:31:25.421 --> 00:31:29.740
<v Speaker 4>There's no ticket out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not yet see any way and,</v>

583
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:34.741
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the plants or the tools to </v>

584
00:31:34.741 --> 00:31:34.741
<v Speaker 4>understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

585
00:31:34.741 --> 00:31:37.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's good scientific studies now that</v>

586
00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 4>show that silicide button,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the one that's been studied,</v>

587
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:46.380
<v Speaker 4>can reliably induce a state that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>might call a mystical experience.</v>

588
00:31:47.651 --> 00:31:50.440
<v Speaker 4>I prefer to call it a transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

589
00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:51.840
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

590
00:31:51.841 --> 00:31:56.220
<v Speaker 4>the nugget of the experience that it can</v>
<v Speaker 4>elicit other,</v>

591
00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:00.030
<v Speaker 4>the right experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an understanding of a,</v>

592
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.080
<v Speaker 4>we are all one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

593
00:32:02.081 --> 00:32:05.110
<v Speaker 4>we're not separate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the core of the,</v>

594
00:32:05.111 --> 00:32:10.111
<v Speaker 4>I think the mystical insight that </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic spring about why should our </v>

595
00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:14.821
<v Speaker 4>brains even have evolve to have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of experience if it's not a way of,</v>

596
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of a,</v>

597
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:22.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

598
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.260
<v Speaker 4>being able to initiate that conversation</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

599
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the rest of species.</v>

600
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're counting on us,</v>

601
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:35.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because never before we've civilization </v>

602
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:38.410
<v Speaker 4>and humanity is impacted nature and </v>
<v Speaker 4>adverse ways.</v>

603
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.260
<v Speaker 4>As long as we've been around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as we've had fire,</v>

604
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fire back in the Paleolithic and even </v>

605
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.820
<v Speaker 4>earlier was a tremendously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not necessarily destructive force,</v>

606
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.700
<v Speaker 4>but it was a transformative force on </v>
<v Speaker 4>ecosystems.</v>

607
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.540
<v Speaker 4>We didn't particularly use it in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious way.</v>

608
00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 4>We we used it in a way that that served </v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

609
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:05.170
<v Speaker 4>our purposes a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now with 7 billion people on the </v>

610
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:10.541
<v Speaker 4>earth and counting and technologies that</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one ever imagined that we'd have at </v>

611
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 4>our fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we do now really matters.</v>

612
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we,</v>

613
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.950
<v Speaker 4>because before that nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the homeostatic mechanisms that tended </v>

614
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 4>to take nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep nature in balance,</v>

615
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:30.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could cause tremendous ecological </v>

616
00:33:30.011 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 4>destruction and nature with eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

617
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:33.980
<v Speaker 4>that would fade away in nature would </v>
<v Speaker 4>come back into balance.</v>

618
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:38.900
<v Speaker 4>Now we're actually in danger of </v>
<v Speaker 4>permanently screwing up those mechanisms</v>

619
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:43.880
<v Speaker 4>so we actually have to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciously intervene or be conscious of</v>

620
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:48.881
<v Speaker 4>what we're doing because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of what we do are just so </v>

621
00:33:48.881 --> 00:33:49.730
<v Speaker 4>much greater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make.</v>

622
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it absolutely does.</v>

623
00:33:51.661 --> 00:33:56.661
<v Speaker 1>It absolutely does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's another thing that we </v>

624
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:59.001
<v Speaker 1>need to put into perspective is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively short amount of time that </v>

625
00:33:59.041 --> 00:34:04.041
<v Speaker 1>human beings have had access to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that we have today and the,</v>

626
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible effects of propaganda and </v>

627
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.370
<v Speaker 1>how long propaganda can stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

628
00:34:11.371 --> 00:34:15.840
<v Speaker 1>when we're talking about just the just </v>
<v Speaker 1>say no era of the eighties,</v>

629
00:34:15.841 --> 00:34:20.841
<v Speaker 1>the Nancy Reagan nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had Dr Carl Hart on recently who's a </v>

630
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:22.970
<v Speaker 1>brilliant dive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You aware of his work,</v>

631
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.990
<v Speaker 1>amazing work on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

632
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.170
<v Speaker 1>addiction and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

633
00:34:26.171 --> 00:34:31.171
<v Speaker 1>and sort of educating people about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual real reactions that the human </v>

634
00:34:31.171 --> 00:34:35.691
<v Speaker 1>body has to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what he's talking about it was </v>

635
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:37.650
<v Speaker 1>really interesting is like there has </v>
<v Speaker 1>never been a drug free society,</v>

636
00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.340
<v Speaker 1>nor would you want one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

637
00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:40.950
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

638
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:46.160
<v Speaker 1>this idea is so stupid that it's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammered into us this impossible ideal.</v>

639
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because of the ability to </v>

640
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:53.970
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ironic that,</v>

641
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

642
00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.440
<v Speaker 1>the ability to communicate through mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of people is so recent within </v>

643
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.400
<v Speaker 1>the last few hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years,</v>

644
00:35:02.401 --> 00:35:06.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's been that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact of these things,</v>

645
00:35:06.661 --> 00:35:10.170
<v Speaker 1>although in our incredibly small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finite lives,</v>

646
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.320
<v Speaker 1>seems like forever is a comparatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little tiny blip on the radar </v>

647
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:20.590
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we've had this sort of cultural </v>

648
00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.671
<v Speaker 1>hiccup where we lost the script and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet seems to be what's resetting </v>

649
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information.</v>

650
00:35:26.281 --> 00:35:28.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>why marijuana,</v>

651
00:35:28.711 --> 00:35:32.070
<v Speaker 1>besides the financial reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my marijuana has gained so much steam.</v>

652
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.150
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

653
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.600
<v Speaker 1>just the sheer overwhelming avalanche of</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

654
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.870
<v Speaker 1>the of desks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ld 50 rate of 1500 pounds in 15 </v>

655
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.550
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just the sheer absurdity of what it</v>

656
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:47.340
<v Speaker 1>takes to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the stats that come in.</v>

657
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times can you see someone </v>

658
00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:52.460
<v Speaker 1>posted with the numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People die by cigarettes,</v>

659
00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:52.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

660
00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.510
<v Speaker 1>People don't buy prescription drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers of people don't buy alcohol,</v>

661
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:59.511
<v Speaker 1>the number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just start looking at that and </v>

662
00:35:59.511 --> 00:35:59.511
<v Speaker 1>then marijuana gets to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

663
00:35:59.511 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>

664
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over and over and over and over </v>

665
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:04.800
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's resetting.</v>

666
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.300
<v Speaker 1>This is strange propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to people that have been alive </v>

667
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's indoctrination.</v>

668
00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:12.150
<v Speaker 1>It's and how we've come to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

669
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:17.330
<v Speaker 4>but the message is penetrating now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is now with all that cultural baggage</v>

670
00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 4>that that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that marijuana is loaded down with.</v>

671
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:25.851
<v Speaker 4>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real message is coming through when </v>

672
00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:28.851
<v Speaker 4>people are exactly like you say </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning to wake up to it and compared </v>

673
00:36:28.851 --> 00:36:31.950
<v Speaker 4>to all the other recreational drugs that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we accept,</v>

674
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 4>this one is benign and beneficial.</v>

675
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:39.200
<v Speaker 1>I've said that I think that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future when people look back on this age</v>

676
00:36:39.201 --> 00:36:41.690
<v Speaker 1>where people were being arrested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison for marijuana,</v>

677
00:36:41.691 --> 00:36:46.691
<v Speaker 1>they're going to look back at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way they used to look at at killing </v>

678
00:36:46.691 --> 00:36:46.691
<v Speaker 1>witches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

679
00:36:46.691 --> 00:36:48.050
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really that ridiculous.</v>

680
00:36:48.051 --> 00:36:48.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so.</v>

681
00:36:48.761 --> 00:36:53.761
<v Speaker 1>It's such a a black mark on our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our silly society and just an indication</v>

682
00:36:55.641 --> 00:36:57.440
<v Speaker 1>of how disconnected we are.</v>

683
00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.610
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this concept of a drug free society,</v>

684
00:37:00.611 --> 00:37:05.611
<v Speaker 4>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is totally absurd because you know </v>

685
00:37:05.611 --> 00:37:06.510
<v Speaker 4>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're made of drugs.</v>

686
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.420
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are drugs and uh,</v>

687
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

688
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:16.070
<v Speaker 4>our brains run on neurotransmitters and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they're endogenously produced </v>

689
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:16.750
<v Speaker 4>and we know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

690
00:37:16.751 --> 00:37:21.751
<v Speaker 4>that dmt is an endogenous </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmitter and that's a whole </v>

691
00:37:21.751 --> 00:37:26.340
<v Speaker 4>fascinating area of neuroscience now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>potential functions for Dmt,</v>

692
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

693
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 4>are being found.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know it's been there for a long time.</v>

694
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.070
<v Speaker 4>We've known it's endogenous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not so clear what the hell it's</v>

695
00:37:35.071 --> 00:37:40.071
<v Speaker 4>doing in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we're beginning to get some </v>

696
00:37:40.071 --> 00:37:40.071
<v Speaker 4>indications that it really does have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>function,</v>

697
00:37:40.071 --> 00:37:45.021
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in places that you wouldn't expect </v>

698
00:37:45.021 --> 00:37:45.630
<v Speaker 4>modulating the immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example.</v>

699
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.990
<v Speaker 4>All this stuff is emerging so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

700
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean by any measure,</v>

701
00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 4>these internal chemicals are drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just happened to be drugs that we </v>

702
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:01.161
<v Speaker 4>make ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't buy them from the local pot </v>

703
00:38:01.161 --> 00:38:01.161
<v Speaker 4>dealer or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

704
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the perceptions are,</v>

705
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.880
<v Speaker 4>are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

706
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:06.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

707
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

708
00:38:07.581 --> 00:38:08.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

709
00:38:08.721 --> 00:38:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I attribute the Internet and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the workload that uh,</v>

710
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.700
<v Speaker 1>rick strassman has done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been pretty fascinating as well.</v>

711
00:38:14.701 --> 00:38:19.701
<v Speaker 1>And the most recent work showing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>DMT is actually produced in the pineal </v>

712
00:38:19.701 --> 00:38:21.830
<v Speaker 1>gland of of live rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was always,</v>

713
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:27.250
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though everyone knew dmt was a </v>

714
00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:31.480
<v Speaker 1>endogenous neurotransmitter and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings absolutely produced in the </v>

715
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:31.790
<v Speaker 1>liver and the lungs and different parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the body.</v>

716
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.280
<v Speaker 1>The pineal gland has always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately incredibly fascinating </v>

717
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.610
<v Speaker 1>because it literally is that third eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seed of the soul,</v>

718
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
<v Speaker 1>and there was so much resistance to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that this mystical chemical is </v>

719
00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:52.261
<v Speaker 1>actually produced by the third eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw online like all this battling </v>

720
00:38:53.051 --> 00:38:54.760
<v Speaker 1>back and forth of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

721
00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 1>it's only anecdotal evidence that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced by now.</v>

722
00:38:57.101 --> 00:39:00.470
<v Speaker 1>There's actual physical evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's know it's there.</v>

723
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:05.570
<v Speaker 4>We knew it had to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the enzymes to make it all the </v>

724
00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:09.600
<v Speaker 4>precursors to make it were there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody had actually nailed it down.</v>

725
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:14.550
<v Speaker 4>Now they've nailed it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's progress.</v>

726
00:39:14.551 --> 00:39:15.270
<v Speaker 4>That's a step.</v>

727
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:16.480
<v Speaker 1>But that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

728
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:21.481
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resistance to the idea was very </v>

729
00:39:21.481 --> 00:39:21.481
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>

730
00:39:21.481 --> 00:39:24.430
<v Speaker 1>why would anybody care whether or not it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was pretty.</v>

731
00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean the body makes it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it such an issue that the </v>

732
00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:30.360
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>

733
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:35.660
<v Speaker 1>It is because that sort of opens up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door to eastern mysticism to all that </v>

734
00:39:36.511 --> 00:39:41.100
<v Speaker 1>traditional religious art that showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the glowing third eye and you know,</v>

735
00:39:41.101 --> 00:39:46.101
<v Speaker 1>all these peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened beings with a lit third </v>

736
00:39:46.101 --> 00:39:47.520
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of that is like,</v>

737
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.420
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably knew something like,</v>

738
00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to it.</v>

739
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.480
<v Speaker 1>They did know a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

740
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.660
<v Speaker 1>they knew quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

741
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Because the other thing is the Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 1>artwork that so clearly resembles the </v>

742
00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:05.331
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland and the actual cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>section of the human brain and there's.</v>

743
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:08.220
<v Speaker 1>There's so much of that in ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations,</v>

744
00:40:08.221 --> 00:40:13.221
<v Speaker 1>in ancient cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you really try to piece </v>

745
00:40:13.221 --> 00:40:13.230
<v Speaker 1>together like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did we lose all this?</v>

746
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Like what have we figured that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

747
00:40:16.381 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 1>when did all that sort of slip away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets lost.</v>

748
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:20.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously it's not lost.</v>

749
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.730
<v Speaker 4>We're now rediscovering it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>

750
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.020
<v Speaker 4>it was esoteric,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

751
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:29.190
<v Speaker 4>it was esoteric knowledge for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

752
00:40:29.191 --> 00:40:34.191
<v Speaker 4>Now it's becoming less esoteric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More people are becoming aware of what </v>

753
00:40:34.831 --> 00:40:39.831
<v Speaker 4>the ancients knew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the visionaries of the mystics </v>

754
00:40:39.831 --> 00:40:41.850
<v Speaker 4>always knew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is no longer hidden knowledge,</v>

755
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's becoming more accessible and that's</v>

756
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:50.780
<v Speaker 4>partly the effect of the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>partly the effect of a lot of very smart</v>

757
00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:54.080
<v Speaker 4>people obsessing over this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

758
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.780
<v Speaker 4>and sharing what they're finding out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

759
00:40:57.781 --> 00:40:59.010
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

760
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:04.040
<v Speaker 4>part of the general raising of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness in this area that's going </v>

761
00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:04.350
<v Speaker 4>on now.</v>

762
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Amber Lyon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a,</v>

763
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.200
<v Speaker 1>she was a reporter for CNN and a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost their faith in mainstream news when</v>

764
00:41:12.891 --> 00:41:17.891
<v Speaker 1>she did a piece on Bahrain and it got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>redacted and edited and turned into like</v>

765
00:41:18.051 --> 00:41:19.570
<v Speaker 1>a tourist piece and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.470
<v Speaker 1>she left CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this huge thing.</v>

767
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.990
<v Speaker 1>She was really like trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do with their life.</v>

768
00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

769
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I suggested psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she goes down to Peru,</v>

770
00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.770
<v Speaker 1>takes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just jumps on a plane,</v>

771
00:41:30.771 --> 00:41:32.990
<v Speaker 1>like literally grabs what clothes she </v>
<v Speaker 1>had in her,</v>

772
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.450
<v Speaker 1>jumps on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to Peru,</v>

773
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:40.570
<v Speaker 1>take seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A long Iowasca trips completely changes </v>

774
00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:42.110
<v Speaker 1>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes on a year round journey,</v>

775
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:47.410
<v Speaker 1>your long journey to discover various </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic medicines and in different </v>

776
00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:49.580
<v Speaker 1>indigenous cultures goes to Thailand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>does mushrooms,</v>

777
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 1>goes to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just does all that.</v>

778
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Now she's writing or making this website</v>
<v Speaker 1>called reset me.</v>

779
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 1>She's dedicated her life to psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 1>within one year,</v>

780
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.990
<v Speaker 1>one crazy transformative trip and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like her and people like you and </v>

781
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:11.531
<v Speaker 1>people like you that are putting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>information out and starting this sort </v>

782
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:17.231
<v Speaker 1>of like undeniable tide is shifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is undeniable shifting,</v>

783
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:17.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

784
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelics and neurotransmitters aside</v>

785
00:42:21.271 --> 00:42:26.271
<v Speaker 3>because people expect something big when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take these things and people are </v>

786
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:31.520
<v Speaker 3>rightly a little apprehensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it will change your life if you </v>

787
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.480
<v Speaker 3>take these plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to have a transformative</v>

788
00:42:33.481 --> 00:42:36.720
<v Speaker 3>experience with plants and you're leery </v>
<v Speaker 3>of psychedelics,</v>

789
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.800
<v Speaker 3>try going on a an all plant based diet </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a little while.</v>

790
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Change your intestinal bacteria and way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll.</v>

791
00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.490
<v Speaker 3>You'll have this sense of levity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lightness.</v>

792
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.790
<v Speaker 3>It will change the way you think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

793
00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:56.060
<v Speaker 3>not as quickly as a psychedelic plant </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience and it takes discipline or </v>

794
00:42:56.191 --> 00:42:57.990
<v Speaker 3>try a fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

795
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.860
<v Speaker 3>there are ways to have these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these transformative experiences without</v>

796
00:43:01.861 --> 00:43:03.600
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without plants,</v>

797
00:43:03.601 --> 00:43:04.260
<v Speaker 3>but it's just</v>

798
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:09.630
<v Speaker 1>the only transformative experience that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever experienced from dealing with </v>

799
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.771
<v Speaker 1>people that have gone in a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming their life in a completely </v>

800
00:43:13.771 --> 00:43:17.161
<v Speaker 1>plant based diet is they can never shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck up about the fact that they're </v>

801
00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:17.161
<v Speaker 1>on a plant based.</v>

802
00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.760
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to,</v>

803
00:43:18.761 --> 00:43:23.761
<v Speaker 6>you over the head with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a hard lifestyle to maintain.</v>

804
00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

805
00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 6>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in light of,</v>

806
00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:27.990
<v Speaker 6>of the</v>

807
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 1>new information that's been discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the past decade or so about the </v>

808
00:43:34.291 --> 00:43:37.440
<v Speaker 1>intelligence of plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about plants' ability to calculate their</v>

809
00:43:37.441 --> 00:43:39.060
<v Speaker 1>ability to recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

810
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even a memory,</v>

811
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:43.210
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

812
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.380
<v Speaker 1>their ability to recognize dangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to adapt.</v>

813
00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:51.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a consciousness in plants that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is undeniable and I think very </v>

814
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.290
<v Speaker 1>misunderstood or not understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a word,</v>

815
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.360
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're ignorant to it.</v>

816
00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the problems that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have with people that push the plant </v>

817
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:03.030
<v Speaker 1>based diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think.</v>

818
00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I think life eats life and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>always has.</v>

819
00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

820
00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 1>you can get to the very bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Karma chain where you're,</v>

821
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:17.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fun guy and you're living off </v>

822
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.431
<v Speaker 1>of poop and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically things that things are thrown </v>

823
00:44:19.431 --> 00:44:20.460
<v Speaker 1>away or you can be a tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

824
00:44:20.461 --> 00:44:24.120
<v Speaker 1>and they're all beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole system is crazy and beautiful.</v>

825
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.980
<v Speaker 1>And the only reason why we exist at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a fucking star had a die.</v>

826
00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.780
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is death.</v>

827
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:36.650
<v Speaker 1>But we're so obsessed with this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating only plants or you know,</v>

828
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:40.710
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being on a plant based Diet connects you</v>

829
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:45.711
<v Speaker 1>more to nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've become a hunter over the last year </v>

830
00:44:45.711 --> 00:44:46.200
<v Speaker 1>and a half and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't disagree more.</v>

831
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:51.710
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons being is that hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very psychedelic experience and </v>

832
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.340
<v Speaker 1>weird way that I never would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed.</v>

833
00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I ever went deer hunting </v>

834
00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:58.860
<v Speaker 1>and shot a deer and then wound up eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

835
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:03.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird connection that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>with nature and with that animal.</v>

836
00:45:03.361 --> 00:45:08.361
<v Speaker 1>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you do it and what's </v>

837
00:45:08.361 --> 00:45:10.710
<v Speaker 1>termed a fair chase environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go out into the actual woods,</v>

838
00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 1>you deal with an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely,</v>

839
00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:17.541
<v Speaker 1>that animal right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never even seen a human being before </v>

840
00:45:17.541 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I shot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're eating it.</v>

841
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 1>That deer had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

842
00:45:19.771 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 1>They're not the alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alien,</v>

843
00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.800
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker he's talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that there's,</v>

844
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.500
<v Speaker 1>there's life in everything and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely some form of a consciousness</v>

845
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:36.890
<v Speaker 1>in all life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

846
00:45:36.891 --> 00:45:37.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

847
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.780
<v Speaker 4>and I think brains are overrated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

848
00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.640
<v Speaker 4>nervous systems are overrated in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain sense.</v>

849
00:45:42.641 --> 00:45:43.300
<v Speaker 4>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

850
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.340
<v Speaker 4>how could a plant be intelligent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

851
00:45:45.341 --> 00:45:47.830
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have a nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have a brain,</v>

852
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:53.400
<v Speaker 4>but it clearly displays intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>

853
00:45:53.441 --> 00:45:57.490
<v Speaker 4>speaking of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking of your hunting and experience,</v>

854
00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the author Michael Pollan,</v>

855
00:45:59.621 --> 00:46:00.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

856
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.090
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a great essay and I think the New</v>

857
00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.850
<v Speaker 4>Yorker recently about plants </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>

858
00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.460
<v Speaker 4>that if you haven't read it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's worth reading.</v>

859
00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:15.340
<v Speaker 4>But I also love his chapter in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Omnivore's dilemma,</v>

860
00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.420
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

861
00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.350
<v Speaker 4>which is subtitled the natural history </v>
<v Speaker 4>of four meals.</v>

862
00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.920
<v Speaker 4>And one of the meals is a meat meal </v>
<v Speaker 4>where he,</v>

863
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.570
<v Speaker 4>where he wants to create a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he wants to do it.</v>

864
00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.780
<v Speaker 4>He wants to put himself in the shoes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>100 gatherer,</v>

865
00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:38.620
<v Speaker 4>so he wants to gather all wild foods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plant foods,</v>

866
00:46:38.621 --> 00:46:41.830
<v Speaker 4>obviously mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pine nuts and this sort of thing.</v>

867
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:46.780
<v Speaker 4>But he also wants to hunt down a bore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

868
00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:50.170
<v Speaker 4>and kill it and strip it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>skin it,</v>

869
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.950
<v Speaker 4>cut it up and eat it and have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

870
00:46:53.951 --> 00:46:58.951
<v Speaker 4>And I think that what you say is totally</v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimate if you're gonna eat meat,</v>

871
00:46:59.291 --> 00:47:04.291
<v Speaker 4>it's important that people realize where</v>
<v Speaker 4>that an animal died so that you could </v>

872
00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:08.761
<v Speaker 4>have that meal and native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>indigenous people have always recognized</v>

873
00:47:10.541 --> 00:47:13.120
<v Speaker 4>this because they are up against it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

874
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll always think the animal for what</v>

875
00:47:16.421 --> 00:47:17.130
<v Speaker 4>their kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aiden.</v>

876
00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:18.190
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

877
00:47:18.191 --> 00:47:23.191
<v Speaker 4>that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's something that we should try </v>

878
00:47:23.191 --> 00:47:24.530
<v Speaker 4>to integrate into everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why not thank the plants too.</v>

879
00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.470
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>

880
00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:30.570
<v Speaker 4>thank everything we wouldn't be here if </v>
<v Speaker 4>we weren't sustained this web of life.</v>

881
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 4>So why are we being so disrespectful to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

882
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's the crux of the question,</v>

883
00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:38.510
<v Speaker 4>will we</v>

884
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 1>can't really feel what we're doing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this earth in and we,</v>

885
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:47.150
<v Speaker 1>we have this diffusion of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing got me to the grocery store and </v>

886
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:51.111
<v Speaker 1>wrapped in plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no notion where it actually </v>

887
00:47:51.111 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Speaker 1>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

888
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I've made a commitment this year to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely off of a game.</v>

889
00:47:55.511 --> 00:47:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Meat of wild game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all wild to nothing that,</v>

890
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no pendant animals.</v>

891
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:06.301
<v Speaker 1>They just wind up shooting the hand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you guys about before the </v>

892
00:48:06.301 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 1>show smoking ham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pig.</v>

893
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:11.641
<v Speaker 1>I killed a on this ranch to hone ranch </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they actually have to have hunters </v>

894
00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:17.110
<v Speaker 1>come in because these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are invasive species,</v>

895
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:20.110
<v Speaker 1>these wild pigs and they will destroy </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

896
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 1>They deer fawns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grounding a ground nesting birds.</v>

897
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:26.380
<v Speaker 1>They eat their eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

898
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:31.470
<v Speaker 1>they're unbelievably devastating to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments that they,</v>

899
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't naturally a part of.</v>

900
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:38.370
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a role for us as stewards of </v>

901
00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:38.910
<v Speaker 4>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

902
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 4>these wild boar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir,</v>

903
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.850
<v Speaker 4>unless you say they're devastating </v>
<v Speaker 4>ecosystems.</v>

904
00:48:42.851 --> 00:48:45.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Hawaii,</v>

905
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:50.320
<v Speaker 4>this is their biggest problem and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>destroying ecosystems in Hawaii.</v>

906
00:48:50.321 --> 00:48:52.810
<v Speaker 4>So there is a role for us to step in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

907
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:53.830
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

908
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:58.860
<v Speaker 4>we're going to kind of exert some </v>
<v Speaker 4>control here and control that population</v>

909
00:48:58.931 --> 00:49:02.920
<v Speaker 4>because they didn't originate in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are invasive species,</v>

910
00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:07.921
<v Speaker 4>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from your agents need for some </v>

911
00:49:07.921 --> 00:49:07.921
<v Speaker 4>regulation.</v>

912
00:49:07.921 --> 00:49:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue right now in San Jose,</v>

913
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.830
<v Speaker 1>San Jose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've started to make,</v>

914
00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.090
<v Speaker 1>make their way into suburbs and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying people's lawns and uh,</v>

915
00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

916
00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.630
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have children.</v>

917
00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Do you fucking shit.</v>

918
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

919
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

920
00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:27.280
<v Speaker 1>it is a weird connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The connection that,</v>

921
00:49:27.281 --> 00:49:28.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have to,</v>

922
00:49:28.721 --> 00:49:29.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

923
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:34.440
<v Speaker 1>to life itself and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our thoughts when we talk about native </v>

924
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:39.211
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost immediately we think of the </v>

925
00:49:39.211 --> 00:49:42.490
<v Speaker 1>spiritual connection that native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans had to the land,</v>

926
00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:47.491
<v Speaker 1>the deep respect that they had for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals that they killed in the fact </v>

927
00:49:47.491 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 1>that they would use every single piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that animal.</v>

928
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:53.270
<v Speaker 1>They'd use the hide to make the a roof </v>
<v Speaker 1>or close they would use Sydney,</v>

929
00:49:53.271 --> 00:49:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>

930
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.040
<v Speaker 1>for strings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their bows and arrows.</v>

931
00:49:57.041 --> 00:49:59.680
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally used every part tooth,</v>

932
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:01.330
<v Speaker 1>bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nail flesh.</v>

933
00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:04.240
<v Speaker 1>They ate them and they worship these </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

934
00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

935
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:11.040
<v Speaker 1>it was a deep respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an inexorable part of the </v>

936
00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:14.430
<v Speaker 1>relationship to nature itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

937
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:20.030
<v Speaker 3>I really hear you on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in the woods of Michigan mile </v>

938
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:23.820
<v Speaker 3>outside of a town of 150 people and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle is a hunter and a taxidermist,</v>

939
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:29.090
<v Speaker 3>but hunting for him as a spiritual quest</v>
<v Speaker 3>and experience and you feel the pain of </v>

940
00:50:29.511 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 3>the animal you kill and utilizing all </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of it.</v>

941
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not opposed to eating meat by any </v>

942
00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.751
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that an Alpine plant </v>

943
00:50:40.751 --> 00:50:42.440
<v Speaker 3>diet when when you do it properly can </v>
<v Speaker 3>transform consciousness.</v>

944
00:50:42.441 --> 00:50:44.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a strange thing,</v>

945
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:47.720
<v Speaker 3>but going on an all meat diet and eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>that conscious,</v>

946
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:50.590
<v Speaker 3>conscious eating can change conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious,</v>

947
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:52.560
<v Speaker 3>subconscious everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

948
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.830
<v Speaker 3>Every design of institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

949
00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.080
<v Speaker 3>of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our experiences.</v>

950
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people,</v>

951
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.070
<v Speaker 1>when you were talking about earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>about brains being overrated,</v>

952
00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:10.550
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been inescapable for me over the </v>

953
00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 1>last few years or so is this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the caterpillars that are giving </v>

954
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.651
<v Speaker 1>birth to the moth and that our whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>screwy system and our whole,</v>

955
00:51:22.981 --> 00:51:27.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are issues with ego problems and </v>

956
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:30.171
<v Speaker 1>materialism might be because we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a transitionary stage to this </v>

957
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:36.080
<v Speaker 1>symbiotic relationship that we have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and then we're going to give </v>

958
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.770
<v Speaker 1>birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some artificial thing that </v>

959
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:41.160
<v Speaker 1>doesn't carry the burdens of natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection that doesn't carry the burdens</v>

960
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:46.400
<v Speaker 1>of primitive instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the needs or survive all these animal </v>

961
00:51:46.651 --> 00:51:50.370
<v Speaker 1>reward systems that were built into us </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the time that we were monkeys.</v>

962
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:52.870
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps it doesn't sound like a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice existence.</v>

963
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Sound like a nice existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not sure about that.</v>

964
00:51:58.501 --> 00:52:01.260
<v Speaker 1>This is why bounce it around because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

965
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea is that,</v>

966
00:52:06.331 --> 00:52:07.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not a person,</v>

967
00:52:07.471 --> 00:52:11.220
<v Speaker 1>well I'm fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is that the ego hanging onto that?</v>

968
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it is some sort of hyper intelligent </v>

969
00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:20.700
<v Speaker 1>artificial life that's capable of living</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>

970
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:25.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely self sustaining existence </v>

971
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.371
<v Speaker 1>where you're totally solar powered all </v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage or any waste product whatsoever.</v>

972
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It's factored immediately into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation instead of put off like nuclear</v>

973
00:52:33.811 --> 00:52:36.060
<v Speaker 1>waste where they just dig a fucking hole</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Oh,</v>

974
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.030
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure that out later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's madness.</v>

975
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:44.031
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear waste issue is one of the </v>

976
00:52:44.031 --> 00:52:45.660
<v Speaker 1>most maddening and insane issues ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they take these things,</v>

977
00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:49.230
<v Speaker 1>they build holes and then they put it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then they seal it up.</v>

978
00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you look a little kid like,</v>

979
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:56.540
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like what a little kid would do </v>

980
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:56.540
<v Speaker 1>when they have to clean their room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lift up the carpet,</v>

981
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.230
<v Speaker 1>they sweep it under the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put the carpet down.</v>

982
00:52:58.231 --> 00:53:00.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a childish way of approaching an </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

983
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Instead of having a completely holistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to this,</v>

984
00:53:04.121 --> 00:53:05.520
<v Speaker 1>this thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

985
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.950
<v Speaker 1>are we going to build this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we are going to build this stuff,</v>

986
00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.750
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do about the toxic </v>
<v Speaker 1>waste?</v>

987
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's factor that in before we move</v>

988
00:53:11.791 --> 00:53:16.791
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then spend an extra few decades </v>

989
00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:19.551
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit and then maybe come up with a </v>

990
00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:20.610
<v Speaker 1>solution before you ever moved forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't do that.</v>

991
00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:25.730
<v Speaker 1>We have this weird thing that we just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of put it off and we child </v>

992
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 1>companies have quarterly</v>

993
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:31.430
<v Speaker 7>reporting requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If we just changed the financial </v>

994
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:34.581
<v Speaker 7>reporting structure just one year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a five year instead of this short term </v>

995
00:53:34.581 --> 00:53:36.810
<v Speaker 7>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well solar panels are cheaper.</v>

996
00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:42.680
<v Speaker 7>At least this is what has to be factored</v>
<v Speaker 7>into corporate planning,</v>

997
00:53:42.811 --> 00:53:47.811
<v Speaker 7>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because in the operations have gotten a </v>

998
00:53:47.811 --> 00:53:50.721
<v Speaker 7>free ride for too long because they'd </v>
<v Speaker 7>never pay the environmental consequences</v>

999
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:53.010
<v Speaker 7>of what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1000
00:53:53.011 --> 00:53:58.011
<v Speaker 7>And we have to change that where they </v>
<v Speaker 7>have to be held accountable and </v>

1001
00:53:58.011 --> 00:53:59.250
<v Speaker 7>responsible for the environmental </v>
<v Speaker 7>impact.</v>

1002
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 7>It's not just that you pay $200 for an </v>
<v Speaker 7>iphone,</v>

1003
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.520
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you pay $200 for an iphone,</v>

1004
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:10.550
<v Speaker 7>but it cost $2,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>to deal with the environmental impact of</v>

1005
00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:18.550
<v Speaker 7>the toxic waste.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That economic equation has got to </v>

1006
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:21.570
<v Speaker 7>change.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's one of the biggest challenges</v>

1007
00:54:21.571 --> 00:54:25.350
<v Speaker 7>because it's a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a huge challenge to capitalism.</v>

1008
00:54:25.351 --> 00:54:27.330
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's laying down the gauntlet and say,</v>

1009
00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:28.560
<v Speaker 7>look guys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1010
00:54:28.561 --> 00:54:30.480
<v Speaker 7>you can make money,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but let's make,</v>

1011
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:34.860
<v Speaker 7>let's look at the bottom line in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>realistic way and you're making all this</v>

1012
00:54:34.861 --> 00:54:39.861
<v Speaker 7>profit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but what are you costing the taxpayers </v>

1013
00:54:39.861 --> 00:54:42.840
<v Speaker 7>and the rest of society for your profit </v>
<v Speaker 7>making activities?</v>

1014
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.730
<v Speaker 7>How about a little payback here?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1015
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:47.120
<v Speaker 7>how about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1016
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:52.160
<v Speaker 7>some fun,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some way to compensate for the damage </v>

1017
00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.490
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that corporations do.</v>

1018
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:54.630
<v Speaker 7>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the,</v>

1019
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:57.420
<v Speaker 7>that's the biggest threat that I can see</v>
<v Speaker 7>right now.</v>

1020
00:54:57.450 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 7>The corporations want to own everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They want to corporatize everything.</v>

1021
00:55:01.981 --> 00:55:06.981
<v Speaker 7>And nature is just another commodity as </v>
<v Speaker 7>they see it to be owned and exploited.</v>

1022
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:13.340
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the perception that's got to </v>

1023
00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 7>change.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And maybe one way to do it this to,</v>

1024
00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.690
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1025
00:55:14.691 --> 00:55:19.691
<v Speaker 7>I think speaking of hearts and minds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think if you can get in there are </v>

1026
00:55:19.801 --> 00:55:22.560
<v Speaker 7>ethical capitalists out there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1027
00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:27.930
<v Speaker 7>chances are they're partly ethical </v>
<v Speaker 7>because they took psychedelics at some </v>

1028
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:28.580
<v Speaker 7>point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1029
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.200
<v Speaker 7>Steve Jobs and people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1030
00:55:31.201 --> 00:55:33.120
<v Speaker 7>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we could name others.</v>

1031
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:35.190
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1032
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:40.440
<v Speaker 7>psychedelics are teaching tools to help </v>
<v Speaker 7>people kind of understand their,</v>

1033
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:43.260
<v Speaker 7>their place,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their responsibilities,</v>

1034
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.270
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1035
00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.380
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have to,</v>

1036
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:47.700
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's part of this.</v>

1037
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:53.120
<v Speaker 7>It's not that we can't innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we just have to be realistic about the </v>

1038
00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:57.141
<v Speaker 7>impact that our actions are having.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We also have this issue with </v>

1039
00:55:57.141 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 7>incorporations having survival instincts</v>
<v Speaker 7>and corporations.</v>

1040
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:02.940
<v Speaker 7>This unlimited growth paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is impossible,</v>

1041
00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:08.050
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like what we're talking about with like </v>

1042
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:08.050
<v Speaker 7>laptops that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can we just stop right here?</v>

1043
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:08.520
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can't.</v>

1044
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:11.820
<v Speaker 7>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And we also can't stop as far as profit.</v>

1045
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:16.950
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we made this much this quarter and this </v>

1046
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.950
<v Speaker 7>quarter we showed a 25 percent growth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Excellent.</v>

1047
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:21.141
<v Speaker 7>Let's keep moving on by 2075,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we should have all the money in the </v>

1048
00:56:21.141 --> 00:56:21.141
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1049
00:56:21.141 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 7>that's really what every corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And isn't this</v>

1050
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.570
<v Speaker 1>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>

1051
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:27.390
<v Speaker 1>It's madness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1052
00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:28.840
<v Speaker 7>Got,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is it?</v>

1053
00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:33.841
<v Speaker 7>Ninety five percent of the wealth </v>
<v Speaker 7>concentrated in the one percent and the </v>

1054
00:56:33.841 --> 00:56:35.620
<v Speaker 7>rest of us are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1055
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:40.710
<v Speaker 7>the rest of us is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's quickly evolving into a third world</v>

1056
00:56:40.721 --> 00:56:42.500
<v Speaker 7>situation and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that,</v>

1057
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:47.640
<v Speaker 7>that is economic slavery in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean people do what they have to do </v>

1058
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:49.480
<v Speaker 7>because they don't have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Their,</v>

1059
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their economic activity,</v>

1060
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:56.130
<v Speaker 7>they're priorities are dictated by </v>
<v Speaker 7>corporations.</v>

1061
00:56:56.170 --> 00:57:01.170
<v Speaker 7>This idea that profit is the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 7>that a corporation should be concerned </v>

1062
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:05.290
<v Speaker 7>with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've got to evolve beyond that.</v>

1063
00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 7>Sustainability is more important.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1064
00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:15.570
<v Speaker 7>helping people's lives be better as more</v>
<v Speaker 7>important than profits.</v>

1065
00:57:15.731 --> 00:57:20.731
<v Speaker 7>I mean sure profits,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that should be down several notches </v>

1066
00:57:20.731 --> 00:57:21.540
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the,</v>

1067
00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.090
<v Speaker 7>on the totem pole in terms of what they </v>
<v Speaker 7>identify as</v>

1068
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be like food.</v>

1069
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I think profit should be like food in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't eat poison and that if </v>

1070
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:36.520
<v Speaker 1>you're eating something and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have all these calories.</v>

1071
00:57:36.521 --> 00:57:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1072
00:57:36.881 --> 00:57:38.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's fucking killing you,</v>

1073
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:40.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You understand that you can't eat this.</v>

1074
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 1>This is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't like this,</v>

1075
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:44.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's got a thousand calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1076
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I need calories to where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1077
00:57:45.241 --> 00:57:45.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1078
00:57:45.401 --> 00:57:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't need those calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's poison.</v>

1079
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:53.040
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and essentially the idea of profit is </v>

1080
00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.870
<v Speaker 1>profit overall and profit over humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1081
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:59.880
<v Speaker 1>the idea of financial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial gain over human suffering like</v>

1082
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another it balances out </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just like eating poison.</v>

1083
00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>

1084
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:11.350
<v Speaker 1>There should be no profit at all when </v>
<v Speaker 1>this human suffering.</v>

1085
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 1>It should be one of those things with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's factored in,</v>

1086
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:16.270
<v Speaker 1>oh we can't eat this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's poisoned for humanity,</v>

1087
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:16.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.060
<v Speaker 3>The corporation in the u s if it does </v>
<v Speaker 3>not maximize profit,</v>

1089
00:58:20.061 --> 00:58:22.790
<v Speaker 3>can be sued by its shareholders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the law.</v>

1090
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:26.390
<v Speaker 3>They have a legal responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 3>maximize profit.</v>

1091
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:31.670
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we have to change the laws that </v>

1092
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.670
<v Speaker 3>shareholders</v>

1093
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:35.780
<v Speaker 7>until the shareholders start demanding </v>
<v Speaker 7>that they actually act responsibly.</v>

1094
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:38.870
<v Speaker 7>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how that works,</v>

1095
00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:43.900
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if the shareholders achieve a higher </v>

1096
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.431
<v Speaker 7>level of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe they can influence the way the </v>

1097
00:58:48.431 --> 00:58:48.431
<v Speaker 7>corporate.</v>

1098
00:58:48.431 --> 00:58:51.850
<v Speaker 3>It was a NASA funded study looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse of civilizations and one of the</v>

1099
00:58:51.851 --> 00:58:56.851
<v Speaker 3>major factors is the discrepancy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth that the wealthy people are using</v>

1100
00:58:57.281 --> 00:59:02.281
<v Speaker 3>up the resources and they're insulated </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the effects and then it gets to a </v>

1101
00:59:02.281 --> 00:59:06.631
<v Speaker 3>point where the people making decisions </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't been thinking about the the the </v>

1102
00:59:06.631 --> 00:59:09.700
<v Speaker 3>consequences and the alternatives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1103
00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:11.860
<v Speaker 3>It's something's gotta change.</v>

1104
00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

1105
00:59:13.161 --> 00:59:18.161
<v Speaker 1>That was a fascinating and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying report because this is not </v>

1106
00:59:18.161 --> 00:59:23.051
<v Speaker 1>someone with any financial interest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relaying this message is not something </v>

1107
00:59:23.051 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 1>that someone that's selling a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just looking at all the data and</v>

1108
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:27.770
<v Speaker 1>go and look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just follow these trends,</v>

1109
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:30.270
<v Speaker 1>this is where it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1110
00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:32.980
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no indication whatsoever that it's going</v>

1111
00:59:32.981 --> 00:59:34.420
<v Speaker 1>to slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1112
00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:37.640
<v Speaker 1>this is where we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure this out before we hit</v>

1113
00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:38.150
<v Speaker 1>this wall.</v>

1114
00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.320
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was an Undergrad,</v>

1115
00:59:40.321 --> 00:59:44.580
<v Speaker 3>I was in business school until I took </v>
<v Speaker 3>five grams of siliciden mushrooms.</v>

1116
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:49.581
<v Speaker 3>Today I grew in my dormitory closet at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the urging of Terence Mckenna's book.</v>

1117
00:59:49.751 --> 00:59:53.940
<v Speaker 3>See old generic method under buying </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

1118
00:59:53.941 --> 00:59:57.900
<v Speaker 3>One chart at a time of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Radical,</v>

1119
00:59:58.170 --> 01:00:03.170
<v Speaker 3>but I realized that I was fighting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>losing battle if I wasn't speaking the </v>

1120
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:07.521
<v Speaker 3>same language of making some profit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>appealing to people's business </v>

1121
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:08.020
<v Speaker 3>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1122
01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 3>It was a long process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to get out of this culture and </v>

1123
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:18.171
<v Speaker 3>ended up in China teaching English and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've spent most of the last 10 years in </v>

1124
01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:20.610
<v Speaker 3>China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a third Chinese now basically,</v>

1125
01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:25.790
<v Speaker 3>and I became comfortable analyzing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation I was in meeting people on </v>

1126
01:00:27.631 --> 01:00:32.631
<v Speaker 3>their level because I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing being in China teaches you is </v>

1127
01:00:32.631 --> 01:00:36.891
<v Speaker 3>to be constructive with people to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>at an issue from how they're thinking </v>

1128
01:00:36.931 --> 01:00:37.380
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1129
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 3>So I began that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that people don't want to lose </v>

1130
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:43.410
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a,</v>

1131
01:00:43.411 --> 01:00:48.411
<v Speaker 3>it's a top down culture so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the priorities of a leader </v>

1132
01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.880
<v Speaker 3>and they have some enlightened </v>
<v Speaker 3>interests.</v>

1133
01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:55.881
<v Speaker 3>They have their self interests as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you appeal to their better image of </v>

1134
01:00:55.881 --> 01:01:00.231
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's possible a win win situation </v>

1135
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:04.220
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think of myself now as a kind of </v>

1136
01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.580
<v Speaker 3>economic therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to corporations,</v>

1137
01:01:05.581 --> 01:01:08.850
<v Speaker 3>I talked to ngos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the campaigning organizations,</v>

1138
01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:12.150
<v Speaker 3>and I try to help people find a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

1139
01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:17.180
<v Speaker 3>what are the win win situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the last six years I've been working </v>

1140
01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.441
<v Speaker 3>with the global sustainability standards</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the forest stewardship council and </v>

1141
01:01:21.451 --> 01:01:26.451
<v Speaker 3>the Marine Stewardship Council and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ESC is modeled on these organizations </v>

1142
01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:31.020
<v Speaker 3>that you talk with enough stakeholders </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you build consensus through dialogue</v>

1143
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.440
<v Speaker 3>and you have a transparent process that </v>
<v Speaker 3>appeals to companies that appeals to </v>

1144
01:01:36.871 --> 01:01:40.500
<v Speaker 3>regulators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so take Mcdonald's for example,</v>

1145
01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:45.770
<v Speaker 3>they realized that they were catching </v>
<v Speaker 3>too much fish from the ocean and it </v>

1146
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:49.191
<v Speaker 3>wasn't sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they now all Mcdonald's fish </v>

1147
01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:50.670
<v Speaker 3>sandwiches are marine stewardship </v>
<v Speaker 3>council certified,</v>

1148
01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:55.970
<v Speaker 3>which means they can sell fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>sandwiches into eternity as long as the </v>

1149
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:57.240
<v Speaker 3>oceans are a viable for life.</v>

1150
01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Or Kimberly Clark was cutting down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rain forests and cutting down the </v>

1151
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.891
<v Speaker 3>arboreal forest in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now all of their paper products are </v>

1152
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:10.101
<v Speaker 3>going to be FSC certified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An FSC certifies 15 percent of the </v>

1153
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:14.571
<v Speaker 3>standing forest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that people have a fair </v>

1154
01:02:14.571 --> 01:02:14.820
<v Speaker 3>share.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This worship reserves,</v>

1155
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:19.170
<v Speaker 3>stewardship I think is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an important word.</v>

1156
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Gotten to be reintroduced</v>

1157
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:26.180
<v Speaker 4>into corporate thinking in corporate </v>
<v Speaker 4>planning as opposed to profits.</v>

1158
01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:30.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all have a stake in survival,</v>

1159
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:35.450
<v Speaker 4>not everybody has a stake in profits to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the shareholders have a stake in </v>

1160
01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:39.201
<v Speaker 4>profits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no profits if we don't </v>

1161
01:02:39.201 --> 01:02:40.950
<v Speaker 4>survive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this whole shooting match collapses.</v>

1162
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:45.100
<v Speaker 4>So the concept of stewardship and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that is,</v>

1163
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:50.190
<v Speaker 4>is really important to get that message </v>
<v Speaker 4>out and that's what people like Josh or </v>

1164
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:54.690
<v Speaker 4>trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think psychedelics have a role to </v>

1165
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:56.700
<v Speaker 4>play absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In educating,</v>

1166
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1167
01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting the,</v>

1168
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:03.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't,</v>

1169
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:08.870
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think before Iowasca gets integrated </v>

1170
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:12.630
<v Speaker 4>in this country in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1171
01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.590
<v Speaker 4>in therapy and in biomedicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not gonna happen,</v>

1172
01:03:16.591 --> 01:03:21.591
<v Speaker 4>but what you do see happening are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>centers that are growing up and right </v>

1173
01:03:21.591 --> 01:03:26.361
<v Speaker 4>now it's in South America and Josh and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ethno Botanical Stewardship Council are </v>

1174
01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:32.151
<v Speaker 4>trying to develop standards for these </v>
<v Speaker 4>organizations so that,</v>

1175
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're committed to a certain ethical,</v>

1176
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:40.190
<v Speaker 4>a set of standards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>safety and quality of their,</v>

1177
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 4>of their brew and so on.</v>

1178
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:47.120
<v Speaker 4>But I can envision a time not too far in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the future where if a person,</v>

1179
01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:53.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go to South America and if you </v>

1180
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.690
<v Speaker 4>have issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have sickness,</v>

1181
01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:56.700
<v Speaker 4>addiction or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could get treatment,</v>

1182
01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:01.110
<v Speaker 4>but even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can just get an education,</v>

1183
01:04:01.111 --> 01:04:03.780
<v Speaker 4>you can just get a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

1184
01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:08.970
<v Speaker 4>you can go there for purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>spiritual discovery and self discovery </v>

1185
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:11.970
<v Speaker 4>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you have that infrastructure,</v>

1186
01:04:11.971 --> 01:04:14.730
<v Speaker 4>which is growing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it partly becomes,</v>

1187
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to get people in positions of </v>

1188
01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.380
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>corporate ceos,</v>

1189
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:27.381
<v Speaker 4>other government leaders and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go and have these experience.</v>

1190
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.470
<v Speaker 4>That's the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1191
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:29.280
<v Speaker 4>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1192
01:04:29.281 --> 01:04:33.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can't hold them in a headlock</v>
<v Speaker 4>and force them to drink IOWASCA.</v>

1193
01:04:33.241 --> 01:04:34.350
<v Speaker 4>Although I'd like to</v>

1194
01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:39.860
<v Speaker 1>a catalyst for creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take your marketing team to South </v>

1195
01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.530
<v Speaker 1>America and have a ceremony together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebrand your company.</v>

1196
01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Increase your profits in the process and</v>

1197
01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>the benefits to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's people.</v>

1198
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:50.600
<v Speaker 1>That's where the economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the model comes in.</v>

1199
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>People have a negative reaction to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know this personally firsthand </v>

1200
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:55.800
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1201
01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I have a business on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a.com</v>

1202
01:04:58.341 --> 01:05:03.341
<v Speaker 1>is a company we sell exercise equipment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and supplements and healthy foods.</v>

1203
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:09.870
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways that on it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>created was a,</v>

1204
01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.000
<v Speaker 1>my partner Aubrey and I talking about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Aubrey going to South America,</v>

1205
01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>doing Iowasca and then having these </v>
<v Speaker 1>visions about his business.</v>

1206
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.220
<v Speaker 1>And when you talked about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was met with so much criticism.</v>

1207
01:05:23.231 --> 01:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>So many people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1208
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you're down there doing Iowasca thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about your business.</v>

1209
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so gross.</v>

1210
01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so based.</v>

1211
01:05:31.301 --> 01:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>That's so egocentric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1212
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>so the anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1213
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the message of the plant.</v>

1214
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>But it's creativity and creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It manifests itself in a million </v>

1215
01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:47.581
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is the idea of business equals </v>

1216
01:05:47.581 --> 01:05:51.780
<v Speaker 1>evil really has to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to get past that because we all </v>

1217
01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.080
<v Speaker 1>exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1218
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If some guy could fix your car,</v>

1219
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone can fix your,</v>

1220
01:05:56.441 --> 01:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1221
01:05:57.071 --> 01:06:00.610
<v Speaker 1>your refrigerator so you can store food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things are businesses</v>

1222
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.710
<v Speaker 7>not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you buy fair trade,</v>

1223
01:06:02.711 --> 01:06:07.330
<v Speaker 7>coffee promotes biodiversity and farmers</v>
<v Speaker 7>can send their kids to school,</v>

1224
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.010
<v Speaker 7>go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it is.</v>

1225
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:14.011
<v Speaker 7>It's when,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when it's possible to develop these </v>

1226
01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:15.630
<v Speaker 7>economic models.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I totally disagree with your,</v>

1227
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 7>your partners,</v>
<v Speaker 7>critics.</v>

1228
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:21.970
<v Speaker 7>Your partner is exactly right on and </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's okay.</v>

1229
01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:24.370
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with his background,</v>

1230
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:29.430
<v Speaker 7>I assume it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he goes to South America and he already </v>

1231
01:06:29.651 --> 01:06:31.390
<v Speaker 7>has the mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1232
01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:36.800
<v Speaker 7>Then Iowasca is a way to sort of flesh </v>
<v Speaker 7>out the vision if you were.</v>

1233
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.470
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

1234
01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:41.530
<v Speaker 7>he went there to learn something and boy</v>
<v Speaker 7>to Dillard's someplace.</v>

1235
01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:46.020
<v Speaker 7>Clearly he went through a bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 7>things about his life will,</v>

1236
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:50.830
<v Speaker 7>you've got to get the personal shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>clear family history,</v>

1237
01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:55.890
<v Speaker 7>open up that bullshit folder,</v>
<v Speaker 7>get hit over the head.</v>

1238
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:59.530
<v Speaker 7>None of us here has done that </v>
<v Speaker 7>completely.</v>

1239
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:02.150
<v Speaker 7>I mean at some point the process.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1240
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:03.490
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no doubt about it.</v>

1241
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.380
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1242
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:09.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a tank session scheduled for </v>

1243
01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>tonight on some little workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1244
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1245
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word ethical company or the </v>

1246
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.690
<v Speaker 1>expression ethical company I think is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a big one.</v>

1247
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:24.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of the psychedelic experience </v>

1248
01:07:25.031 --> 01:07:27.640
<v Speaker 1>for those who haven't experienced it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>for those who,</v>

1249
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dropped acid in college,</v>

1250
01:07:30.101 --> 01:07:35.101
<v Speaker 1>but I'm past that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a 401k in a mortgage and </v>

1251
01:07:35.101 --> 01:07:36.870
<v Speaker 1>college bills for my kids and I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of.</v>

1252
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.320
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that's an excuse for not wanting to </v>

1253
01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:43.320
<v Speaker 7>confront it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just,</v>

1254
01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.560
<v Speaker 7>that's just self self delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Really.</v>

1255
01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:46.910
<v Speaker 7>Nobody's ever passed.</v>

1256
01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:47.770
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one ever,</v>

1257
01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.950
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a human being and you have,</v>

1258
01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:54.570
<v Speaker 1>you're a constant sort of soup of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals,</v>

1259
01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.700
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline,</v>

1260
01:07:56.701 --> 01:08:01.701
<v Speaker 1>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things are going on </v>

1261
01:08:01.701 --> 01:08:03.571
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to maintain balances </v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep everything aligned and then </v>

1262
01:08:03.571 --> 01:08:05.460
<v Speaker 1>keep the pattern of thought in a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1263
01:08:05.461 --> 01:08:10.461
<v Speaker 1>So that maintains everything as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that to these people that are </v>

1264
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:12.600
<v Speaker 1>perpetrating a lot of the issues that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

1265
01:08:12.601 --> 01:08:17.601
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the head of bp or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes some guy wants to frack and </v>

1266
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you do that,</v>

1267
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>do this first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then let's talk,</v>

1268
01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like confronted with your own mortality </v>

1269
01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:27.760
<v Speaker 1>should almost be mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1270
01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>you should show that you went before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start fracking,</v>

1271
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:35.050
<v Speaker 1>you should show that you have a degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you understand the actual physical </v>

1272
01:08:35.541 --> 01:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>process of removing these chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should understand,</v>

1273
01:08:38.811 --> 01:08:43.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever energy extraction degrees you </v>

1274
01:08:43.811 --> 01:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>have to have in whatever science is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pertain to that,</v>

1275
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:47.870
<v Speaker 1>but you should also have psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>trips under your belt.</v>

1276
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1277
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1278
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seen your documentation.</v>

1279
01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>You've gone through your five grams and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you get out of that?</v>

1280
01:08:55.110 --> 01:09:00.110
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it should be one of those things </v>

1281
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.110
<v Speaker 1>where it's reviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1282
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't,</v>

1283
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:05.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've gotten off your list before </v>

1284
01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:10.091
<v Speaker 1>you proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be like a presidential </v>

1285
01:09:10.091 --> 01:09:10.820
<v Speaker 1>council for psychological fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

1286
01:09:10.821 --> 01:09:12.140
<v Speaker 1>they sit you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

1287
01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences on your resume.</v>

1288
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Ready the brain now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1289
01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:20.250
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opening up the fucking company that digs</v>

1290
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:22.670
<v Speaker 1>holes in the ground and you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any psychedelic experiences.</v>

1291
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:26.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a recipe for disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're missing a key component.</v>

1292
01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:31.601
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're missing this connection to the </v>

1293
01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:33.311
<v Speaker 1>mother Earth via some unfathomable bowl </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that literally is impossible </v>

1294
01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Speaker 1>to describe [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're missing that part.</v>

1295
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:40.400
<v Speaker 1>So go get that and then come back.</v>

1296
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:43.190
<v Speaker 7>Then we'll talk about your business.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1297
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:47.470
<v Speaker 7>Are People in the Department of Defense </v>
<v Speaker 7>or the veterans affairs that are dealing</v>

1298
01:09:47.471 --> 01:09:52.471
<v Speaker 7>with all these soldiers with PTSD?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Another important aspect of the </v>

1299
01:09:52.471 --> 01:09:53.620
<v Speaker 7>symposia.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Conferences,</v>

1300
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:58.870
<v Speaker 7>a new organization called Vet Veterans </v>
<v Speaker 7>for NPO genic therapy.</v>

1301
01:09:58.930 --> 01:09:59.650
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's great.</v>

1302
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:05.230
<v Speaker 7>Founders participated in the maps ptsd </v>
<v Speaker 7>study with MDA and they came away </v>

1303
01:10:06.371 --> 01:10:11.371
<v Speaker 7>feeling so much better and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 7>open this up to other veterans and </v>

1304
01:10:11.371 --> 01:10:14.791
<v Speaker 7>others suffering from Ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So a portion of the proceeds from the </v>

1305
01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:18.130
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] conference in the live,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the online live participation will.</v>

1306
01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:20.890
<v Speaker 7>We'll go to this organization and to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>ESC.</v>

1307
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.870
<v Speaker 7>That's spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a huge,</v>

1308
01:10:22.871 --> 01:10:27.871
<v Speaker 7>huge fan of maps.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've done Rick Doblin on the podcast </v>

1309
01:10:27.871 --> 01:10:28.900
<v Speaker 7>before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was just a fantastic guy and he,</v>

1310
01:10:28.901 --> 01:10:33.901
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just tweeted me something and I </v>

1311
01:10:33.901 --> 01:10:33.901
<v Speaker 7>retweeted it about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1312
01:10:33.901 --> 01:10:36.050
<v Speaker 7>they did a new study on autism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1313
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:41.070
<v Speaker 7>adult autism Mtma at assisted therapy </v>
<v Speaker 7>for social anxiety and autistic adults </v>

1314
01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:44.070
<v Speaker 7>and some amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>amazing dinner.</v>

1315
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.390
<v Speaker 7>Charlie Grove working.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was he working on that?</v>

1316
01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:51.570
<v Speaker 7>He's Charlie Grove who's a at Ucla.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's one of our heffter superstars,</v>

1317
01:10:52.751 --> 01:10:57.751
<v Speaker 7>if you will know his name so we can get </v>
<v Speaker 7>them on the poster or ob Charles Grope.</v>

1318
01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.740
<v Speaker 7>He's at Harbor Ucla.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's done a.</v>

1319
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:04.540
<v Speaker 7>he's done a silicide.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Been end of life study.</v>

1320
01:11:04.541 --> 01:11:09.541
<v Speaker 7>He's a member of the heffter board.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I may as well plug heffter here where </v>

1321
01:11:09.541 --> 01:11:13.290
<v Speaker 7>the sort of a small organization that </v>
<v Speaker 7>nobody knows about.</v>

1322
01:11:13.291 --> 01:11:14.490
<v Speaker 7>Heffter.org.</v>

1323
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:17.810
<v Speaker 4>A cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1324
01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:18.750
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>F E,</v>

1325
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:19.770
<v Speaker 4>h e f,</v>
<v Speaker 4>F,</v>

1326
01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:21.540
<v Speaker 4>t,</v>
<v Speaker 4>e r after,</v>

1327
01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.600
<v Speaker 4>but after it's a nonprofit and basically</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're committed to clinical development </v>

1328
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 4>and clinical protocols with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a psychedelic,</v>

1329
01:11:32.701 --> 01:11:37.701
<v Speaker 4>some of kind of staked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Silicide been in some ways the same way </v>

1330
01:11:37.701 --> 01:11:39.840
<v Speaker 4>that Mtma is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Map says things.</v>

1331
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:44.841
<v Speaker 4>Silicide business our thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we've got several really interesting</v>

1332
01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:50.260
<v Speaker 4>protocols.</v>
<v Speaker 4>FDA approved clinical studies right now </v>

1333
01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.781
<v Speaker 4>for end of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a existential anxiety at the end of </v>

1334
01:11:53.781 --> 01:11:53.781
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1335
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.820
<v Speaker 4>for exploring actually what you might </v>
<v Speaker 4>call experimental mysticism because a </v>

1336
01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:05.610
<v Speaker 4>psilocybin can reliably induce mystical </v>
<v Speaker 4>states.</v>

1337
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.910
<v Speaker 4>Roland griffiths work at Johns Hopkins </v>
<v Speaker 4>has shown this,</v>

1338
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:14.120
<v Speaker 4>so it's an actual tool for the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>time we're actually able to approach </v>

1339
01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.790
<v Speaker 4>transcendent states of mind in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlled clinical setting.</v>

1340
01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.900
<v Speaker 4>We can reliably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1341
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 4>induce these states and then study </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the brain doing when,</v>

1342
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:28.110
<v Speaker 4>when you're in a state of siliciden </v>
<v Speaker 4>induced mysticism.</v>

1343
01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:33.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's doing a lot of things similar to </v>

1344
01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:34.400
<v Speaker 4>the state of a mystical experience when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on the nat.</v>

1345
01:12:34.401 --> 01:12:35.070
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>

1346
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:36.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure that even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

1347
01:12:36.781 --> 01:12:41.781
<v Speaker 4>heffter.org,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the leading researchers in </v>

1348
01:12:41.781 --> 01:12:46.070
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic science right now are either</v>
<v Speaker 4>on our board are being funded by heffter</v>

1349
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:50.940
<v Speaker 4>and so we have funding and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>focusing on suicide,</v>

1350
01:12:50.941 --> 01:12:54.510
<v Speaker 4>but then we work closely with maps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maps gets all the attention,</v>

1351
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.880
<v Speaker 4>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are doing beautiful work,</v>

1352
01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:59.220
<v Speaker 4>but we're also doing effective </v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

1353
01:12:59.280 --> 01:12:59.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

1354
01:12:59.791 --> 01:13:04.791
<v Speaker 4>we'll certainly get some people to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm heffter h e f f t e r.org.org</v>

1355
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.540
<v Speaker 4>named after Arthur heffter actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's the.</v>

1356
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:14.930
<v Speaker 4>He was a 19th century scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first person to isolate masculine in</v>

1357
01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:20.151
<v Speaker 4>a pure form from pod and demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was the main ingredient of,</v>

1358
01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:25.690
<v Speaker 4>of payoti based on self experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was kind of exemplifies what we </v>

1359
01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:30.780
<v Speaker 4>like to identify with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1360
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.330
<v Speaker 4>good science driven by curiosity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethics and uh,</v>

1361
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:36.840
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good organization.</v>

1362
01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:41.930
<v Speaker 4>The silicide been connection to </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimethyltryptamine dimethyltryptamine </v>

1363
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:42.720
<v Speaker 4>being an endogenous chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a neurotransmitter,</v>

1364
01:13:42.721 --> 01:13:46.080
<v Speaker 4>and psilocybin being very close,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very close.</v>

1365
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:49.050
<v Speaker 4>What is the exact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what's the chemical?</v>

1366
01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 4>Was the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1367
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:55.100
<v Speaker 4>very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dimethyltryptamine is simply </v>

1368
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:58.610
<v Speaker 4>dimethyltryptamine a silicon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the active principle of </v>

1369
01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:04.671
<v Speaker 4>psilocybin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>PSILOCYBIN is converted to allison in </v>

1370
01:14:04.671 --> 01:14:08.091
<v Speaker 4>the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's what pharmacologists call a pro </v>

1371
01:14:08.091 --> 01:14:10.140
<v Speaker 4>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's converted by a very simple chemical</v>

1372
01:14:10.141 --> 01:14:11.950
<v Speaker 4>reaction to silverson.</v>

1373
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.560
<v Speaker 7>That's the one that actually interacts </v>
<v Speaker 7>with the receptors.</v>

1374
01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.920
<v Speaker 7>So silicon is chemically four hydroxy </v>
<v Speaker 7>dimethyltryptamine.</v>

1375
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:25.950
<v Speaker 7>So it differs with one trivial </v>
<v Speaker 7>substitution on the Indole ring.</v>

1376
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:31.711
<v Speaker 7>That oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that alcohol group at the top of the </v>

1377
01:14:31.711 --> 01:14:32.530
<v Speaker 7>Indole ring is what makes it sill a </v>
<v Speaker 7>sudden.</v>

1378
01:14:32.531 --> 01:14:37.531
<v Speaker 7>And not DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it makes all the difference </v>

1379
01:14:37.531 --> 01:14:40.441
<v Speaker 7>pharmacologically because silicon is </v>
<v Speaker 7>orally active and it doesn't require an </v>

1380
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:41.940
<v Speaker 7>Mao inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1381
01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:43.830
<v Speaker 7>and DMT does,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>

1382
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:47.020
<v Speaker 7>if you need,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the Iowasca secret,</v>

1383
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:52.110
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dmt plus Mao inhibitor makes the orally </v>

1384
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:56.230
<v Speaker 7>active preparation by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>DMT is not orally active,</v>

1385
01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:02.370
<v Speaker 7>so you have to take it perennially by </v>
<v Speaker 7>smoking it or indigenous people make </v>

1386
01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:04.140
<v Speaker 7>snuff out of it and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they get,</v>

1387
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:08.620
<v Speaker 7>get around that whole a detoxification </v>
<v Speaker 7>mechanism.</v>

1388
01:15:08.621 --> 01:15:13.621
<v Speaker 7>Your gut is full of his full of Mao </v>
<v Speaker 7>monetary amine oxidase and the reason </v>

1389
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:16.600
<v Speaker 7>it's full of monitoring the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's a,</v>

1390
01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:21.690
<v Speaker 7>it's a consequences of our evolution as </v>
<v Speaker 7>omnivores because plants are full of,</v>

1391
01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.350
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>means,</v>

1392
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:28.830
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most of them are toxic and you don't </v>

1393
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:28.830
<v Speaker 7>want those.</v>

1394
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:31.950
<v Speaker 7>You've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you have the detoxification </v>

1395
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:32.740
<v Speaker 7>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they had also works for dmt.</v>

1396
01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:37.741
<v Speaker 7>And for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can't be dining on dmt containing </v>

1397
01:15:37.741 --> 01:15:38.290
<v Speaker 7>plants all the time and wandering </v>
<v Speaker 7>around.</v>

1398
01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:43.291
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you do need to be able to function in </v>

1399
01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:43.291
<v Speaker 7>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1400
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:48.340
<v Speaker 7>your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your brother had a fascinating idea </v>

1401
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:48.340
<v Speaker 7>about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1402
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.830
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the idea of Panspermia in relationship </v>

1403
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:54.680
<v Speaker 7>to a suicide and suicide and being the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how did you,</v>

1404
01:15:54.690 --> 01:15:59.690
<v Speaker 7>what is the exact nomenclature again for</v>
<v Speaker 7>a high four hydroxy four hydroxy trip </v>

1405
01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:02.710
<v Speaker 7>dimethyltryptamine yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that silicide been,</v>

1406
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:04.750
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to get bogged down in </v>
<v Speaker 7>chemistry,</v>

1407
01:16:04.751 --> 01:16:08.110
<v Speaker 7>but Phil Psilocybin for the chemists </v>
<v Speaker 7>among you,</v>

1408
01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:13.111
<v Speaker 7>it's got a phosphoryl group and that </v>
<v Speaker 7>phosphoryl group is cleaved off and that</v>

1409
01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:14.840
<v Speaker 7>yields Cilla sin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sin.</v>

1410
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:17.690
<v Speaker 7>Sin Is four hydroxy die methyl trip to </v>
<v Speaker 7>me.</v>

1411
01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:22.700
<v Speaker 7>What is silicide been and silicide </v>
<v Speaker 7>business for phosphoryl dimethyl methyl </v>

1412
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:23.110
<v Speaker 7>trip to me.</v>

1413
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:27.730
<v Speaker 7>So it's got that phosphoryl group that </v>
<v Speaker 7>makes it stable,</v>

1414
01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:32.731
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's the form it's stored in the </v>

1415
01:16:32.731 --> 01:16:33.520
<v Speaker 7>mushroom and it can be quite stable for </v>
<v Speaker 7>a long time.</v>

1416
01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 7>Soon as you convert it to Siliciden,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's very unstable and it's a femoral,</v>

1417
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:42.990
<v Speaker 7>which is one reason why it's so easily </v>
<v Speaker 7>metabolized by human metabolism.</v>

1418
01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:47.500
<v Speaker 7>It's very compatible with human </v>
<v Speaker 7>metabolism,</v>

1419
01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:50.170
<v Speaker 7>which is a reason why it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1420
01:16:50.171 --> 01:16:55.171
<v Speaker 7>it's appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can give it to people who are quite </v>

1421
01:16:55.171 --> 01:16:55.171
<v Speaker 7>ill,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1422
01:16:55.171 --> 01:16:56.560
<v Speaker 7>in terminal states and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they can tolerate it's,</v>

1423
01:16:56.561 --> 01:17:01.561
<v Speaker 7>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it goes through a human organism like </v>

1424
01:17:01.561 --> 01:17:02.650
<v Speaker 7>ice water.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very easily handled.</v>

1425
01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:04.220
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1426
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:04.790
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1427
01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.840
<v Speaker 7>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we don't want to get to know down the </v>

1428
01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:09.840
<v Speaker 7>road.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't know.</v>

1429
01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:09.840
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's absolutely fascinating.</v>

1430
01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:09.840
<v Speaker 7>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1431
01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the idea</v>

1432
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:15.220
<v Speaker 1>that your brother was promoting was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this may have come from another planet </v>

1433
01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 1>and that what you might be eating when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating mushrooms is you're eating</v>

1434
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:22.451
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the weirdest thing about </v>

1435
01:17:22.451 --> 01:17:23.280
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms is that it feels like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you.</v>

1436
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:28.540
<v Speaker 7>We do have that impression.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This I thou dynamic that's set up and </v>

1437
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:34.940
<v Speaker 7>the content,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I guess not everybody has this,</v>

1438
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:35.650
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1439
01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Speaker 7>this feeling of this science fictiony </v>
<v Speaker 7>she cast to the experience,</v>

1440
01:17:40.221 --> 01:17:43.850
<v Speaker 7>but many people do and they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not all terence Mckenna fans.</v>

1441
01:17:43.851 --> 01:17:44.600
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

1442
01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:50.170
<v Speaker 7>if you follow the terence mckenna recipe</v>
<v Speaker 7>and eat five grams and the absolute </v>

1443
01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:52.310
<v Speaker 7>darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll be utterly convinced that they've</v>

1444
01:17:52.311 --> 01:17:57.311
<v Speaker 7>landed there here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And whether that's just an impression or</v>

1445
01:17:58.821 --> 01:18:00.040
<v Speaker 7>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1446
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.670
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some,</v>

1447
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:03.080
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think this is possibly something,</v>

1448
01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>built into the structure of our nervous </v>

1449
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:10.010
<v Speaker 7>system,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1450
01:18:10.011 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Speaker 7>and it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1451
01:18:11.151 --> 01:18:16.151
<v Speaker 7>we've always had this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this fascination with,</v>

1452
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.390
<v Speaker 7>with space,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with,</v>

1453
01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:21.120
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with,</v>

1454
01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.930
<v Speaker 7>with the external,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1455
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:23.500
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with the,</v>

1456
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:28.900
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this sort of longing to maybe return to </v>

1457
01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:30.410
<v Speaker 7>space.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe that's where we came from.</v>

1458
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:31.550
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1459
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.800
<v Speaker 7>but certainly in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in this,</v>

1460
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 7>in this a evolutionary process of </v>
<v Speaker 7>cognition,</v>

1461
01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:40.310
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which we credit the plants for.</v>

1462
01:18:40.311 --> 01:18:45.311
<v Speaker 7>If we want to buy into that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we credit the plants for bringing about </v>

1463
01:18:45.311 --> 01:18:47.210
<v Speaker 7>cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The ability to wonder,</v>

1464
01:18:47.211 --> 01:18:49.070
<v Speaker 7>the ability to speculate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1465
01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:52.970
<v Speaker 7>we can't wonder if very much,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're looking down at the ground all</v>

1466
01:18:52.971 --> 01:18:55.910
<v Speaker 7>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you got to look up when you look up,</v>

1467
01:18:55.911 --> 01:18:56.840
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1468
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:59.840
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's this whole universe out here.</v>

1469
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:02.930
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's our connection to that?</v>

1470
01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.100
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>

1471
01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:09.140
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've always had this intuition that </v>

1472
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:09.140
<v Speaker 7>there is a connection.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1473
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:09.140
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1474
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.690
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't go so far as to say,</v>

1475
01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.570
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people ridiculed the idea that mushrooms</v>

1476
01:19:14.571 --> 01:19:17.690
<v Speaker 7>might've come from outer space and so </v>
<v Speaker 7>on,</v>

1477
01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:21.110
<v Speaker 7>and I'm a surface,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it seems like a ridiculous idea,</v>

1478
01:19:21.111 --> 01:19:25.010
<v Speaker 7>but you look a little deeper and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 7>not so much,</v>

1479
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:30.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's certainly possible that spores are </v>

1480
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:31.610
<v Speaker 7>one of the hardest substances in nature </v>
<v Speaker 7>and they can survive.</v>

1481
01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:37.650
<v Speaker 7>They can survive in a vacuum and </v>
<v Speaker 7>radiation dense environments and they're</v>

1482
01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:38.800
<v Speaker 7>not effective.</v>

1483
01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Did the other thing that your brother </v>
<v Speaker 1>had mentioned was that it was so </v>

1484
01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:48.471
<v Speaker 1>different than other life forms on earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of its chemical makeup that he </v>

1485
01:19:49.861 --> 01:19:54.861
<v Speaker 1>thought that the four hydroxy or for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for phosphoryl yeah,</v>

1486
01:19:55.411 --> 01:19:56.780
<v Speaker 1>the four hydroxy form</v>

1487
01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:02.060
<v Speaker 7>floral,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a biosynthetic pathway is really only </v>

1488
01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:04.760
<v Speaker 7>found in this group of mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1489
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:08.180
<v Speaker 7>actually unrelated species.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1490
01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 7>He wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he wasn't a biochemist.</v>

1491
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:15.510
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean mushrooms are so clearly a part </v>

1492
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.320
<v Speaker 7>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1493
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:24.040
<v Speaker 7>earthly evolution that you can't really </v>
<v Speaker 7>say that they stand outside of it to.</v>

1494
01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.500
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we know that's true.</v>

1495
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:28.350
<v Speaker 7>I think if you want to make that </v>
<v Speaker 7>hypothesis,</v>

1496
01:20:28.351 --> 01:20:31.710
<v Speaker 7>you have to go further back and you have</v>
<v Speaker 7>to say,</v>

1497
01:20:31.711 --> 01:20:32.700
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1498
01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:37.350
<v Speaker 7>maybe a super civilization see did our </v>
<v Speaker 7>ecology at some point,</v>

1499
01:20:37.351 --> 01:20:42.351
<v Speaker 7>not with the genes to make a silly one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the genes to make tryptofan and now </v>

1500
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:49.550
<v Speaker 7>tryptofan all these silicon and </v>
<v Speaker 7>Serotonin and all these tryptamines come</v>

1501
01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:54.801
<v Speaker 7>from tryptofan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And tryptofan is one of those 20 amino </v>

1502
01:20:54.801 --> 01:20:59.151
<v Speaker 7>acids that make up proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So tryptofan is universally found in all</v>

1503
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:01.570
<v Speaker 7>organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1504
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.960
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's an essential,</v>

1505
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:05.550
<v Speaker 7>a molecule of life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1506
01:21:05.551 --> 01:21:10.551
<v Speaker 7>It's found in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But to trivial steps away from tryptofan</v>

1507
01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:15.681
<v Speaker 7>too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Trivial enzymatic modifications away </v>

1508
01:21:15.681 --> 01:21:16.620
<v Speaker 7>from tryptofan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You've got DMT.</v>

1509
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:19.140
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you remove the carboxyl group,</v>

1510
01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:22.440
<v Speaker 7>you stick a couple of methyl groups on </v>
<v Speaker 7>Tryptophan and there you are.</v>

1511
01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 7>You've got DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I've often thought,</v>

1512
01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:28.560
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe this is a sort of sub text,</v>

1513
01:21:28.561 --> 01:21:33.180
<v Speaker 7>sub message of nature saying just around</v>
<v Speaker 7>the corner,</v>

1514
01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.740
<v Speaker 7>just around the corner from Tryptofan </v>
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>

1515
01:21:37.741 --> 01:21:38.550
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1516
01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:42.120
<v Speaker 7>this compound that opens the door to </v>
<v Speaker 7>other dimensions,</v>

1517
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:44.260
<v Speaker 7>pay attention monkeys.</v>

1518
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating that trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defend converts to eventually converge </v>

1519
01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:51.710
<v Speaker 1>to Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is</v>

1520
01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:54.860
<v Speaker 7>Serotonin is just another trip to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1521
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:59.870
<v Speaker 7>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>chemically Serotonin is five hydroxy </v>

1522
01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:03.500
<v Speaker 7>tryptamine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Siliciden is four hydroxy die methyl </v>

1523
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.250
<v Speaker 7>trip to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Blue photo name,</v>

1524
01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:09.750
<v Speaker 7>another one of these hallucinogens is </v>
<v Speaker 7>five hydroxy methyl trip to me.</v>

1525
01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.360
<v Speaker 7>So they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1526
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:14.310
<v Speaker 7>very close to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You see the diagrams,</v>

1527
01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:16.230
<v Speaker 7>I'll hail.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There you are,</v>

1528
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:19.950
<v Speaker 7>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1529
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.500
<v Speaker 7>So you can see how,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how it works,</v>

1530
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 1>the idea that mushrooms come from outer </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

1531
01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:30.720
<v Speaker 1>it seems ridiculous to some folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is we were made out of </v>

1532
01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.281
<v Speaker 1>stars that everything comes from outer </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and I think that as we get further</v>

1533
01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:36.210
<v Speaker 1>along in our understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

1534
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is kind of fractal and there </v>

1535
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.331
<v Speaker 1>really is no separation between this </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet and other planets of the whole </v>

1536
01:22:44.331 --> 01:22:45.150
<v Speaker 1>thing is just one big soup.</v>

1537
01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.550
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>

1538
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1539
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:49.110
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>any,</v>

1540
01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:52.140
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>prebiotic environment,</v>

1541
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:57.310
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we don't know that much about exactly </v>

1542
01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:59.901
<v Speaker 7>how life evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we know that in certain situations </v>

1543
01:22:59.901 --> 01:23:03.150
<v Speaker 7>you've got to a buildup of organic </v>
<v Speaker 7>compounds and,</v>

1544
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:04.950
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>under the right,</v>

1545
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.200
<v Speaker 4>it just seems to be a property of </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

1546
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:12.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam's molecules fall together in such a</v>

1547
01:23:12.671 --> 01:23:15.640
<v Speaker 4>way that before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got living systems.</v>

1548
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You've brought this up twice and I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore it because he brought it up in </v>

1549
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:20.770
<v Speaker 1>the last podcast as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1550
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:25.330
<v Speaker 1>you are fascinated by the idea of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>being seated here by some intelligent </v>

1551
01:23:25.371 --> 01:23:26.480
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1552
01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Amber Lyon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1553
01:23:28.341 --> 01:23:30.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I discussed earlier,</v>

1554
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:35.830
<v Speaker 1>she had a vision of that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening on Iowasca and many other </v>

1555
01:23:36.741 --> 01:23:41.741
<v Speaker 1>people have as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's something that </v>

1556
01:23:41.741 --> 01:23:43.010
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a real possibility?</v>

1557
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1558
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a heavy one.</v>

1559
01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:51.220
<v Speaker 1>When you bring that one up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get thrown into that certain </v>

1560
01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:51.220
<v Speaker 1>category right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1561
01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Mckenna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking gotta.</v>

1562
01:23:51.831 --> 01:23:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Read my book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually in my book,</v>

1563
01:23:55.371 --> 01:23:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

1564
01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:56.860
<v Speaker 1>My book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1565
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:58.300
<v Speaker 1>the latest one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Old Lady.</v>

1566
01:23:58.310 --> 01:24:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Latest one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote the Brotherhood of the screaming</v>

1567
01:24:00.471 --> 01:24:01.250
<v Speaker 1>abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1568
01:24:01.251 --> 01:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the one you promoted last time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were on here,</v>

1569
01:24:02.961 --> 01:24:05.040
<v Speaker 1>which is excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which for that,</v>

1570
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:07.760
<v Speaker 1>that was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't bought it,</v>

1571
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:10.640
<v Speaker 1>please folks go by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really gave her that.</v>

1572
01:24:10.641 --> 01:24:11.990
<v Speaker 1>You really gave it a boost.</v>

1573
01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 4>But I actually talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk about this at some length about </v>

1574
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:21.350
<v Speaker 4>this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could this really be,</v>

1575
01:24:21.351 --> 01:24:22.880
<v Speaker 4>and I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1576
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:24.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1577
01:24:24.081 --> 01:24:27.530
<v Speaker 4>discuss it from the standpoint of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>critic of the idea.</v>

1578
01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:27.920
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1579
01:24:27.921 --> 01:24:29.780
<v Speaker 4>that's totally ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1580
01:24:29.781 --> 01:24:32.240
<v Speaker 4>how could that be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they just dismiss it.</v>

1581
01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.970
<v Speaker 4>I tried to go a little deeper intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

1582
01:24:34.971 --> 01:24:35.660
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

1583
01:24:35.661 --> 01:24:40.661
<v Speaker 4>let's step back from this a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you think about our existential </v>

1584
01:24:42.441 --> 01:24:47.270
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how unlikely it is that we are even here</v>

1585
01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.320
<v Speaker 4>that consciousness exists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this civilization exists.</v>

1586
01:24:51.321 --> 01:24:53.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1587
01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:54.460
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

1588
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:59.500
<v Speaker 4>from the standpoint of the improbables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're living in a very improbable </v>

1589
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.500
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1590
01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:01.670
<v Speaker 4>if we should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1591
01:25:01.671 --> 01:25:06.671
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that life is probably a </v>

1592
01:25:06.671 --> 01:25:11.260
<v Speaker 4>widespread in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think intelligence is rare and the</v>

1593
01:25:11.661 --> 01:25:15.950
<v Speaker 4>fact that we find ourselves in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>existential situation,</v>

1594
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:17.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we need to look,</v>

1595
01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.000
<v Speaker 4>take another look at this and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1596
01:25:20.001 --> 01:25:22.190
<v Speaker 4>maybe this is not such a crazy idea.</v>

1597
01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:23.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1598
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:25.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think that intelligence,</v>

1599
01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:26.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1600
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:29.030
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not the only ones.</v>

1601
01:25:29.031 --> 01:25:30.830
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1602
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:32.670
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1603
01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:35.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I generated into </v>
<v Speaker 4>incoherence here,</v>

1604
01:25:35.991 --> 01:25:40.991
<v Speaker 4>but I think that intelligence can have </v>
<v Speaker 4>an influence on the evolution of even </v>

1605
01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.290
<v Speaker 4>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1606
01:25:42.291 --> 01:25:46.250
<v Speaker 4>it's a force in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that mind is probably,</v>

1607
01:25:46.251 --> 01:25:47.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1608
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:48.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as primary,</v>

1609
01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:50.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1610
01:25:50.451 --> 01:25:54.800
<v Speaker 4>feature of reality as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the quantum foam.</v>

1611
01:25:54.801 --> 01:25:55.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may not,</v>

1612
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:58.460
<v Speaker 4>it may not even be separate from it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1613
01:25:58.461 --> 01:26:03.100
<v Speaker 4>So it's okay to say we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1614
01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1615
01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 4>one</v>

1616
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.600
<v Speaker 7>of the problems with science is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1617
01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:09.630
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it tends to be arrogant to,</v>

1618
01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:14.631
<v Speaker 7>tends to assume that it knows a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 7>than it knows.</v>

1619
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:20.050
<v Speaker 7>And we actually have a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have a very detailed understanding </v>

1620
01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:23.720
<v Speaker 7>scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of very small pieces of reality,</v>

1621
01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so there's a tendency to say,</v>

1622
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:29.090
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've got it all figured out.</v>

1623
01:26:29.091 --> 01:26:30.830
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you haven't got it figured out.</v>

1624
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:33.290
<v Speaker 7>You haven't got even a 10th of it </v>
<v Speaker 7>figured out,</v>

1625
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:38.860
<v Speaker 7>which is another useful a message that </v>
<v Speaker 7>Iowasca and other entheogens,</v>

1626
01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:43.020
<v Speaker 7>other psychedelics a reminded us of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1627
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:48.030
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Iowaska never fails to remind me and a </v>

1628
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:49.190
<v Speaker 7>lot of people remember you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh shit,</v>

1629
01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:52.250
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't know shit,</v>

1630
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:57.750
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so get off your high horse and be a </v>

1631
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:59.800
<v Speaker 7>little more humble and be open to </v>
<v Speaker 7>learning.</v>

1632
01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:05.220
<v Speaker 1>It's all right in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we go back and look at what we know </v>

1633
01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.930
<v Speaker 1>about human history and what they knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how we laugh at what they knew,</v>

1634
01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:12.730
<v Speaker 1>then we will go back to the time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought the world was flat,</v>

1635
01:27:12.731 --> 01:27:14.230
<v Speaker 1>back to the time where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1636
01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.320
<v Speaker 1>they were killing Bruno because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that the universe was infinite </v>

1637
01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:19.840
<v Speaker 1>back to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1638
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:22.780
<v Speaker 1>there's all these different things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like how to consensus.</v>

1639
01:27:22.781 --> 01:27:27.781
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were absolutely incorrect that we </v>

1640
01:27:27.781 --> 01:27:29.500
<v Speaker 1>go back then we were foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a blink of an eye ego,</v>

1641
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the message is</v>

1642
01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:36.670
<v Speaker 7>be aware of what everybody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Beware of cultural consensus,</v>

1643
01:27:36.991 --> 01:27:40.230
<v Speaker 7>because chances are in 100 years what we</v>
<v Speaker 7>thought we knew,</v>

1644
01:27:40.231 --> 01:27:42.390
<v Speaker 7>we'll just be seen in that light.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1645
01:27:42.391 --> 01:27:44.070
<v Speaker 7>we were so stupid back then.</v>

1646
01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also one of those things too,</v>

1647
01:27:46.631 --> 01:27:50.550
<v Speaker 1>when you're discussing aliens be </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing the possibility of a,</v>

1648
01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:53.560
<v Speaker 1>an alien life form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to think it's preposterous,</v>

1649
01:27:53.561 --> 01:27:56.890
<v Speaker 1>but we're preposterous if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't exist,</v>

1650
01:27:57.250 --> 01:28:02.250
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most ridiculous thing ever right </v>

1651
01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:06.480
<v Speaker 1>behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead people that were locked in a cage </v>

1652
01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.120
<v Speaker 1>and I honored them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This photos behind me of Jimmy Hendrix </v>

1653
01:28:09.521 --> 01:28:12.250
<v Speaker 1>and the Elvis actually apparently wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really a,</v>

1654
01:28:12.251 --> 01:28:13.480
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mugshot.</v>

1655
01:28:13.481 --> 01:28:16.240
<v Speaker 1>He was just a law enforcement not </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to get his picture,</v>

1656
01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.240
<v Speaker 1>which is even more ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved the fact that people got locked</v>

1657
01:28:19.241 --> 01:28:24.241
<v Speaker 1>into cages so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to get a fake picture of him </v>

1658
01:28:24.241 --> 01:28:25.480
<v Speaker 1>locked in a cage is most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was high as fuck on pills,</v>

1659
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went to the Nixon to be a drug </v>

1660
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:30.910
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1661
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:32.290
<v Speaker 1>And then this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosa parks,</v>

1662
01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:37.410
<v Speaker 1>she got arrested because she had too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much melanin in our skin to sit in a </v>

1663
01:28:37.481 --> 01:28:40.510
<v Speaker 1>certain spot on a moving piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transportation.</v>

1664
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And then she was celebrated as a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1665
01:28:42.281 --> 01:28:44.020
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1666
01:28:44.370 --> 01:28:46.220
<v Speaker 1>So totally why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1667
01:28:46.410 --> 01:28:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that we exist at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would we deny the idea that </v>

1668
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:53.440
<v Speaker 1>something else far more advanced than us</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists somewhere else?</v>

1669
01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:56.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no different than us looking at,</v>

1670
01:28:56.380 --> 01:29:01.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we find primates using tools and </v>

1671
01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:01.380
<v Speaker 1>evidence of using tools without any </v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

1672
01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Like they just figured it out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on their own to get inside of and </v>

1673
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.270
<v Speaker 1>hills and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fascinated by amazing.</v>

1674
01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Look what we've discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1675
01:29:09.241 --> 01:29:10.020
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1676
01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:13.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like compare us to something else.</v>

1677
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:15.120
<v Speaker 1>They would probably look at us the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1678
01:29:15.121 --> 01:29:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Look at these dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1679
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:18.390
<v Speaker 1>they're worshiping people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked in cages.</v>

1680
01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a hero because you're sitting in </v>

1681
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:24.540
<v Speaker 1>a different spot.</v>

1682
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:24.540
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're.</v>

1683
01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:27.120
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're observing experiment of some sort.</v>

1684
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:28.470
<v Speaker 7>And whether,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1685
01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:30.170
<v Speaker 7>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1686
01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:35.360
<v Speaker 7>some civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some super civilization as genetically </v>

1687
01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:39.651
<v Speaker 7>engineered this whole ecosystem and </v>
<v Speaker 7>create a trip to fan and see did it into</v>

1688
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.040
<v Speaker 7>the ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 7>knowing that over the course of </v>

1689
01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.711
<v Speaker 7>evolutionary time it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>develop things like siliciden and </v>

1690
01:29:48.711 --> 01:29:51.390
<v Speaker 7>Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's almost as though the civilization,</v>

1691
01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:56.391
<v Speaker 7>this hypothetical civilization wanted </v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody to talk to and in order to do </v>

1692
01:29:56.581 --> 01:29:59.820
<v Speaker 7>that it had to invent as primates,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1693
01:29:59.821 --> 01:30:04.821
<v Speaker 7>and it had to get us talking first to </v>
<v Speaker 7>our plants and maybe eventually we'll </v>

1694
01:30:04.821 --> 01:30:07.440
<v Speaker 7>get a chance to talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whoever they are,</v>

1695
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:09.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or maybe they're already here.</v>

1696
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:14.750
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there are a lot of people say they're </v>

1697
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.750
<v Speaker 7>already here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1698
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.750
<v Speaker 7>and I,</v>

1699
01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:15.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1700
01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other problem is there's so many </v>

1701
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:22.731
<v Speaker 1>people that are full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that is the area where flakiness is</v>

1702
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:27.950
<v Speaker 1>flourishes hugely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this Saifai show,</v>

1703
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:33.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we stopped doing it for and they </v>

1704
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:36.621
<v Speaker 1>wanted to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't want to do it anymore </v>

1705
01:30:36.621 --> 01:30:37.980
<v Speaker 1>because I got tired of talking to liars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't handle it anymore.</v>

1706
01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:43.160
<v Speaker 1>We interviewed bigfoot Pete Boone Ufo </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and some of them are well </v>

1707
01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.760
<v Speaker 1>intentioned folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a lot of liars.</v>

1708
01:30:44.761 --> 01:30:45.950
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

1709
01:30:46.130 --> 01:30:50.520
<v Speaker 1>There was a psychological issue and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can clearly see it because when you have</v>

1710
01:30:50.521 --> 01:30:53.520
<v Speaker 1>a podcast with someone and he sit down </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone for three hours,</v>

1711
01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.720
<v Speaker 1>you can bullshit someone for a seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute interview on a news show,</v>

1712
01:30:57.870 --> 01:31:00.990
<v Speaker 1>but you can't bullshit someone for three</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours after three hours.</v>

1713
01:31:00.991 --> 01:31:05.991
<v Speaker 1>Weird things start to show up like weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns or will you just can't keep </v>

1714
01:31:06.091 --> 01:31:06.330
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1715
01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Can't keep the rhythm up so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you could do multiple </v>

1716
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:11.980
<v Speaker 1>podcasts like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1717
01:31:12.090 --> 01:31:13.380
<v Speaker 1>crack you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After two or three,</v>

1718
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll find you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be very clever,</v>

1719
01:31:15.301 --> 01:31:18.720
<v Speaker 1>but after two or three little things get</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed and you're like,</v>

1720
01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:23.820
<v Speaker 1>hm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we reveal the basis to keep the rhythm </v>

1721
01:31:26.461 --> 01:31:27.210
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1722
01:31:27.211 --> 01:31:29.820
<v Speaker 1>it's just after a while if you're full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Shit,</v>

1723
01:31:29.821 --> 01:31:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also to yourself,</v>

1724
01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:36.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that I've found is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people that are constantly </v>

1725
01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:40.491
<v Speaker 1>deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also internally deceptive and </v>

1726
01:31:40.491 --> 01:31:43.790
<v Speaker 1>that that manifests itself in weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they say that they don't </v>

1727
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:44.850
<v Speaker 1>even realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bizarre because they,</v>

1728
01:31:45.370 --> 01:31:50.370
<v Speaker 1>they're also easier to trick themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because I think they lose their </v>

1729
01:31:50.461 --> 01:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>ability to really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1730
01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.660
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see things objective,</v>

1731
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:59.530
<v Speaker 7>falsifiable facts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>things that you can prove that that's or</v>

1732
01:31:59.531 --> 01:31:59.920
<v Speaker 7>not</v>

1733
01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:04.690
<v Speaker 3>the scientific method is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of this theoretical conversation</v>

1734
01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:09.691
<v Speaker 3>is nice about whether we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have the imprints of other </v>

1735
01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:11.500
<v Speaker 3>civilizations in our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our ecosystem.</v>

1736
01:32:11.501 --> 01:32:16.501
<v Speaker 3>But the fact is we have an ecosystem and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have maybe we delude ourselves that </v>

1737
01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:21.541
<v Speaker 3>we have some control over its evolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a stewardship of it,</v>

1738
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.720
<v Speaker 3>but we certainly have this opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1739
01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:27.700
<v Speaker 3>to either destroy the planet or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or preserve it</v>

1740
01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:32.840
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We certainly have an effect and we're </v>

1741
01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:33.570
<v Speaker 1>certainly conscious in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form of that effect.</v>

1742
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:36.360
<v Speaker 1>And when you extrapolate that to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000</v>

1743
01:32:36.361 --> 01:32:39.420
<v Speaker 1>million years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the civilization or something similar</v>

1744
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:41.940
<v Speaker 1>survives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you got to think that it's going to</v>

1745
01:32:41.941 --> 01:32:44.500
<v Speaker 1>be something like an alien invasion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1746
01:32:44.501 --> 01:32:45.010
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1747
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:50.030
<v Speaker 1>we really will be like that thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to see the universe if we </v>

1748
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:52.040
<v Speaker 1>recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're being,</v>

1749
01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:55.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're an intelligent being and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that a star is a out we did,</v>

1750
01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:57.720
<v Speaker 1>a star is only good to support life for </v>
<v Speaker 1>another billion years.</v>

1751
01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:03.180
<v Speaker 1>That's not a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really stop and think about how </v>

1752
01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:07.581
<v Speaker 1>long time has existed on earth and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were an intelligent species that </v>

1753
01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:08.760
<v Speaker 1>lived 100 million years from now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1754
01:33:08.761 --> 01:33:09.450
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1755
01:33:09.451 --> 01:33:14.451
<v Speaker 1>we only have nine more of these to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have nine more of these 100 million </v>

1756
01:33:14.451 --> 01:33:18.261
<v Speaker 1>cycles and then we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the Sun Burns out and there's no </v>

1757
01:33:18.261 --> 01:33:19.110
<v Speaker 1>life here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gotta get moving.</v>

1758
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1759
01:33:19.730 --> 01:33:22.240
<v Speaker 7>we stuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1760
01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:27.320
<v Speaker 7>that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've often thought that these </v>

1761
01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:30.440
<v Speaker 7>cosmological models,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think we got more than a billion </v>

1762
01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:33.711
<v Speaker 7>years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The cosmological models say 10 to a </v>

1763
01:33:33.711 --> 01:33:34.660
<v Speaker 7>hundred billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe a trillion years</v>

1764
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.850
<v Speaker 1>with the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1765
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:38.650
<v Speaker 7>Hold the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1766
01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.420
<v Speaker 7>the sun doesn't have our planet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a support line.</v>

1767
01:33:41.421 --> 01:33:46.150
<v Speaker 7>It's got maybe 4 billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if we haven't figured out how to get</v>

1768
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:50.080
<v Speaker 7>out by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're not paying attention,</v>

1769
01:33:50.081 --> 01:33:52.660
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but getting these costumes or Gideon,</v>

1770
01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:54.160
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or Gideon,</v>

1771
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.740
<v Speaker 7>that's a very important point that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1772
01:33:56.741 --> 01:33:57.330
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1773
01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.360
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been told on psychedelics many </v>

1774
01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.000
<v Speaker 7>times the only way out is to go in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

1775
01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.170
<v Speaker 7>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1776
01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.870
<v Speaker 7>these cosmological models,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you look at them,</v>

1777
01:34:07.930 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 7>which are kind of dreary and depressing </v>
<v Speaker 7>when you think about it,</v>

1778
01:34:11.741 --> 01:34:16.741
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just now the current model is just </v>

1779
01:34:16.741 --> 01:34:18.850
<v Speaker 7>endless expansion and not only expansion</v>
<v Speaker 7>but accelerated expansion.</v>

1780
01:34:18.851 --> 01:34:22.300
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about the heat death of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the universe and you know,</v>

1781
01:34:22.301 --> 01:34:24.700
<v Speaker 7>not very much interested in is going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>happen.</v>

1782
01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:30.420
<v Speaker 7>But the key factor that these models do </v>
<v Speaker 7>not a do not integrate into their </v>

1783
01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:35.990
<v Speaker 7>planning his mind and consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>

1784
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:38.440
<v Speaker 7>And that makes all the difference that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1785
01:34:38.441 --> 01:34:42.400
<v Speaker 7>if you look far enough ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's gonna affect the way the cosmos.</v>

1786
01:34:42.401 --> 01:34:45.190
<v Speaker 7>He falls and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1787
01:34:45.191 --> 01:34:50.191
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they don't take that into account </v>

1788
01:34:50.191 --> 01:34:50.350
<v Speaker 7>and it's impossible to really know what </v>
<v Speaker 7>the effects of it is.</v>

1789
01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:53.020
<v Speaker 7>But I don't buy the fact that it's all </v>
<v Speaker 7>going.</v>

1790
01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:58.021
<v Speaker 7>It just kind of Peter out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And finally the last flicker is going to</v>

1791
01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:03.611
<v Speaker 7>go out and it's just darkness and cold.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't by that I mean surely there's </v>

1792
01:35:05.511 --> 01:35:07.230
<v Speaker 7>gotta be more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1793
01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:11.210
<v Speaker 7>the trip might be what we're missing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Our emr trip may be.</v>

1794
01:35:11.211 --> 01:35:12.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

1795
01:35:12.051 --> 01:35:17.051
<v Speaker 7>I mean if you look at quantum models and</v>
<v Speaker 7>we know there's know three dimensions of</v>

1796
01:35:17.151 --> 01:35:20.330
<v Speaker 7>space and one of time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then there's the,</v>

1797
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:25.360
<v Speaker 7>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the six or eight other dimensions that </v>

1798
01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.480
<v Speaker 7>are all folded in and you don't see </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1799
01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:29.630
<v Speaker 7>but what's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's it?</v>

1800
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.080
<v Speaker 1>But that's the feeling that you get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimethyltryptamine is that you've </v>

1801
01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.110
<v Speaker 1>entered into a new area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new space,</v>

1802
01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:41.440
<v Speaker 1>and that space is somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabited with something that's </v>

1803
01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:45.731
<v Speaker 1>communicating in some nonverbal forum </v>
<v Speaker 1>that reaches you as intent.</v>

1804
01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:51.010
<v Speaker 1>It reaches you like content and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be where consciousness is </v>

1805
01:35:51.010 --> 01:35:53.510
<v Speaker 1>headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we free ourselves from this sort of</v>

1806
01:35:53.511 --> 01:35:55.490
<v Speaker 1>carbon based shell that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1807
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:58.820
<v Speaker 1>we're clinging to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might figure that out.</v>

1808
01:35:58.821 --> 01:35:59.470
<v Speaker 1>That like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1809
01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:00.010
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1810
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:05.110
<v Speaker 1>we're at a rest stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't realize that we could drive </v>

1811
01:36:05.110 --> 01:36:08.030
<v Speaker 1>just a couple miles down the road and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the fucking yellowstone national</v>

1812
01:36:08.031 --> 01:36:08.390
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>

1813
01:36:08.710 --> 01:36:10.600
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we got that,</v>

1814
01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:15.780
<v Speaker 7>the rest stop.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We thought that that's where we were </v>

1815
01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.240
<v Speaker 7>eating shitty food and breathing trucker</v>
<v Speaker 7>farts and we saw there was,</v>

1816
01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:22.490
<v Speaker 7>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we just had to just figure it out.</v>

1817
01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:23.960
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>

1818
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:26.840
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't dismiss that possibility.</v>

1819
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:31.990
<v Speaker 7>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this I vow relationship and that we say </v>

1820
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.270
<v Speaker 7>that again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I vow.</v>

1821
01:36:32.271 --> 01:36:37.271
<v Speaker 7>I vow this thing that mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 7>other psychedelics for their specialty </v>

1822
01:36:37.271 --> 01:36:39.980
<v Speaker 7>mushrooms seep to set up this dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 7>situation.</v>

1823
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.080
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you're getting this information,</v>

1824
01:36:42.081 --> 01:36:45.020
<v Speaker 7>but it's very hard to evaluate whether </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

1825
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:47.840
<v Speaker 7>whether it's bullshit or whether there's</v>
<v Speaker 7>something to it.</v>

1826
01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:52.900
<v Speaker 7>My,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my brother used to play games with the </v>

1827
01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:52.900
<v Speaker 7>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1828
01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.700
<v Speaker 7>what he would take them at these high </v>
<v Speaker 7>doses alone and say,</v>

1829
01:36:55.701 --> 01:36:57.230
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do I know that?</v>

1830
01:36:57.231 --> 01:37:02.231
<v Speaker 7>What you're telling me is real,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tell me something I cannot possibly </v>

1831
01:37:02.231 --> 01:37:03.230
<v Speaker 7>know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

1832
01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:08.320
<v Speaker 7>And they would never,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they would never cough it up because it </v>

1833
01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:08.320
<v Speaker 7>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>

1834
01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.260
<v Speaker 7>But it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>

1835
01:37:09.261 --> 01:37:14.261
<v Speaker 7>I want the blueprints to the star ship </v>
<v Speaker 7>now download the blueprints.</v>

1836
01:37:15.021 --> 01:37:18.890
<v Speaker 7>Now I don't believe that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you are what you say you are.</v>

1837
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:21.320
<v Speaker 7>And they're very invasive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1838
01:37:21.321 --> 01:37:23.690
<v Speaker 7>they'd never give you that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing.</v>

1839
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:26.560
<v Speaker 7>But they.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1840
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:28.520
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1841
01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I have this thought on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people who've heard this podcast,</v>

1842
01:37:32.141 --> 01:37:33.730
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to repeat myself.</v>

1843
01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:38.290
<v Speaker 1>I have this idea that we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1844
01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.960
<v Speaker 1>this dismissal of psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

1845
01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:44.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as hallucination and hallucination being</v>

1846
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:49.950
<v Speaker 1>frivolous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my thought is that if you absorb </v>

1847
01:37:50.351 --> 01:37:55.351
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a psychedelic compound and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this intense moment where you do </v>

1848
01:37:55.771 --> 01:38:00.550
<v Speaker 1>pass into another dimension and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet with pure love and the,</v>

1849
01:38:00.551 --> 01:38:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1850
01:38:00.871 --> 01:38:05.871
<v Speaker 1>the very wiring of the universe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to you and you get to see the </v>

1851
01:38:07.021 --> 01:38:10.530
<v Speaker 1>fractal nature of reality and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly profound for them.</v>

1852
01:38:10.531 --> 01:38:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And that is what you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing.</v>

1853
01:38:12.450 --> 01:38:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Or if it's just your imagination and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go there and it's all in your mind,</v>

1854
01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:22.860
<v Speaker 1>but you have the exact same experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still the same,</v>

1855
01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.600
<v Speaker 1>like this idea that everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>real has to be.</v>

1856
01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.940
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to take a tape </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure and touch it,</v>

1857
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:35.090
<v Speaker 1>that you have to be able to put it on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale that you have to be able to </v>

1858
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:37.731
<v Speaker 1>quantify the ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well it's made out of aluminum and </v>

1859
01:38:37.731 --> 01:38:38.700
<v Speaker 1>this is glass and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the keyboard is plastic that,</v>

1860
01:38:38.701 --> 01:38:40.350
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know a laptop's real.</v>

1861
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:40.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1862
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:43.190
<v Speaker 7>but I'm here to tell you it's all </v>
<v Speaker 7>hallucination,</v>

1863
01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.180
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1864
01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.520
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we dwell in a hallucination.</v>

1865
01:38:46.670 --> 01:38:49.250
<v Speaker 7>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what the brain does,</v>

1866
01:38:49.251 --> 01:38:54.020
<v Speaker 7>is it creates a model of reality that is</v>
<v Speaker 7>that we live in.</v>

1867
01:38:54.021 --> 01:38:56.620
<v Speaker 7>We never experienced reality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1868
01:38:56.621 --> 01:39:01.621
<v Speaker 7>I mean we take it on faith really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that there's some external reality out </v>

1869
01:39:01.621 --> 01:39:05.231
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but everything comes to us through the </v>

1870
01:39:05.231 --> 01:39:07.841
<v Speaker 7>filter and is processed and extruded,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you will,</v>

1871
01:39:07.971 --> 01:39:12.140
<v Speaker 7>into a more or less comprehensible most </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the time,</v>

1872
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:16.550
<v Speaker 7>a model of reality and that's where we </v>
<v Speaker 7>live.</v>

1873
01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.580
<v Speaker 7>Reality is out there somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's unknowable,</v>

1874
01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.840
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we're getting signals through this </v>

1875
01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.611
<v Speaker 7>sensory neural interface and then the </v>
<v Speaker 7>brain is basically a processing a device</v>

1876
01:39:29.241 --> 01:39:34.241
<v Speaker 7>that takes that information,</v>
<v Speaker 7>combines it with internal associations </v>

1877
01:39:34.241 --> 01:39:38.591
<v Speaker 7>and everything and generates the </v>
<v Speaker 7>hallucination that you and I and </v>

1878
01:39:38.591 --> 01:39:40.370
<v Speaker 7>everybody else are living in at this </v>
<v Speaker 7>very moment.</v>

1879
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:45.370
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're all part of this constructed </v>

1880
01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:48.280
<v Speaker 7>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So people dismiss it as psychedelic </v>

1881
01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.610
<v Speaker 7>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hallucination,</v>

1882
01:39:49.611 --> 01:39:51.680
<v Speaker 7>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No it is,</v>

1883
01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:55.850
<v Speaker 7>but it's just another hallucination and </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's all hallucination.</v>

1884
01:39:55.910 --> 01:40:00.910
<v Speaker 7>It's all or at least interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 7>something personal interpretation and </v>

1885
01:40:01.130 --> 01:40:04.370
<v Speaker 7>personal interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the world physics.</v>

1886
01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.400
<v Speaker 7>We know enough through physics about </v>
<v Speaker 7>this supposedly external reality to know</v>

1887
01:40:09.441 --> 01:40:12.550
<v Speaker 7>that it doesn't look anything like what </v>
<v Speaker 7>we're experiencing,</v>

1888
01:40:12.970 --> 01:40:15.110
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's all buzzing the electrons,</v>

1889
01:40:15.111 --> 01:40:18.770
<v Speaker 7>most of it's empty space.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This table is not solid.</v>

1890
01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:23.120
<v Speaker 7>It's mostly empty space.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's soul energy and energy flexes.</v>

1891
01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:26.810
<v Speaker 7>We don't experience the world that way </v>
<v Speaker 7>most of the time.</v>

1892
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:30.800
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes on psychedelics we do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So maybe we're getting a,</v>

1893
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:34.880
<v Speaker 7>an actual peak into the way it's really </v>
<v Speaker 7>constructed that,</v>

1894
01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:35.620
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we get to,</v>

1895
01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.300
<v Speaker 7>we get to look at the circuit board and </v>
<v Speaker 7>turn it over temporarily and look at it,</v>

1896
01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:42.260
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is how it's wired.</v>

1897
01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:47.290
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is the reality generating machine </v>

1898
01:40:47.290 --> 01:40:49.850
<v Speaker 7>that you get to look at when you strip </v>
<v Speaker 7>away,</v>

1899
01:40:50.230 --> 01:40:51.290
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1900
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:52.070
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1901
01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 7>when you take the cover and look at the</v>

1902
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.960
<v Speaker 1>way it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1903
01:40:54.961 --> 01:40:56.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diagram is wired.</v>

1904
01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Then you get some insights into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then that's a useful thing because </v>

1905
01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:02.950
<v Speaker 1>then you can go back and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1906
01:41:02.951 --> 01:41:05.560
<v Speaker 1>none of this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not get carried away that,</v>

1907
01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:11.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is any more real than anything </v>

1908
01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:11.180
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be like the,</v>

1909
01:41:11.210 --> 01:41:14.950
<v Speaker 1>the information that's coming from folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>that study subatomic particles,</v>

1910
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:20.110
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that inflammation is one of the most </v>

1911
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:21.991
<v Speaker 1>undeniable pieces of information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is not what you think it </v>

1912
01:41:21.991 --> 01:41:22.280
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what you think.</v>

1913
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:27.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible for it to be what you </v>

1914
01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:27.390
<v Speaker 1>think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you study subatomic particles,</v>

1915
01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:30.340
<v Speaker 1>when you study things that can exist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>two places at the same time.</v>

1916
01:41:30.490 --> 01:41:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how they blink in and out of </v>

1917
01:41:35.490 --> 01:41:35.490
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean when they go away?</v>

1918
01:41:35.490 --> 01:41:40.200
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean to go away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go when they come back with the </v>

1919
01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.691
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying go away and they come </v>

1920
01:41:42.691 --> 01:41:42.691
<v Speaker 1>back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they here?</v>

1921
01:41:42.691 --> 01:41:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Are they not here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they are and they're not.</v>

1922
01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Well they move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1923
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:50.020
<v Speaker 1>But they also stand still at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time was like superposition.</v>

1924
01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had Dr Goswami,</v>

1925
01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.390
<v Speaker 1>he's a theoretical physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to explain super position to me</v>

1926
01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:57.100
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1927
01:41:57.101 --> 01:41:57.730
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1928
01:41:58.870 --> 01:42:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's still at the same time.</v>

1929
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1930
01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.170
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

1931
01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here you have physics,</v>

1932
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:13.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute sort of cutting edge </v>

1933
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:16.561
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that we've charged with </v>

1934
01:42:16.561 --> 01:42:16.960
<v Speaker 1>explaining the fundamental nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

1935
01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.610
<v Speaker 1>And you talked to these people and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds like the rates of schizophrenia,</v>

1936
01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:24.780
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like someone who's on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1937
01:42:24.850 --> 01:42:29.850
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't deem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like someone who may have the </v>

1938
01:42:29.850 --> 01:42:31.570
<v Speaker 1>mathematics and the measurements and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to back it up and say,</v>

1939
01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:32.440
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

1940
01:42:32.441 --> 01:42:37.441
<v Speaker 1>this is how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This what our math at our instruments </v>

1941
01:42:37.441 --> 01:42:41.281
<v Speaker 1>tell us if you want to trust that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we send a scout and the scout </v>

1942
01:42:42.491 --> 01:42:45.130
<v Speaker 1>went over the top of the hill and saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>the impossible.</v>

1943
01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And came back and go,</v>

1944
01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:47.470
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1945
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:50.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go over there.</v>

1946
01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:56.060
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a rainbow that talks to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1947
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1949
01:43:00.251 --> 01:43:03.190
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating because the,</v>

1950
01:43:03.191 --> 01:43:08.191
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the explanations of reality by these </v>

1951
01:43:08.191 --> 01:43:12.091
<v Speaker 1>physicists are in fact more bizarre than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experiences that are relayed by </v>

1952
01:43:12.971 --> 01:43:14.710
<v Speaker 1>people would take Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1953
01:43:14.711 --> 01:43:19.711
<v Speaker 1>Those are way more believable than </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles and superposition or the fact </v>

1954
01:43:19.711 --> 01:43:22.120
<v Speaker 1>that it's all empty space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving in a vibration.</v>

1955
01:43:22.121 --> 01:43:24.470
<v Speaker 1>And why do you know it's wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

1956
01:43:24.471 --> 01:43:27.290
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is would hear it and that's not.</v>

1957
01:43:27.291 --> 01:43:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I hit you over the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's gonna hurt.</v>

1958
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:30.580
<v Speaker 1>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no empty space there,</v>

1959
01:43:30.581 --> 01:43:31.480
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

1960
01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:33.120
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1961
01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:34.430
<v Speaker 1>That is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1962
01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all real.</v>

1963
01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything you experienced,</v>

1964
01:43:38.141 --> 01:43:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you can't dismiss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say it's not real.</v>

1965
01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:46.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just not necessarily the absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and I don't know if there is an </v>

1966
01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.770
<v Speaker 1>absolute reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you and I think that's also</v>

1967
01:43:47.771 --> 01:43:51.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the transformative parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experience,</v>

1968
01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:56.200
<v Speaker 1>that the experience itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformative because you're </v>

1969
01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.520
<v Speaker 1>experiencing it doesn't matter if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not real.</v>

1970
01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:01.760
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means nothing means nothing.</v>

1971
01:44:01.761 --> 01:44:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Not Real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are.</v>

1972
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>These are</v>

1973
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:06.760
<v Speaker 7>dualistic delusions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

1974
01:44:06.850 --> 01:44:09.010
<v Speaker 7>It's none of it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's all real.</v>

1975
01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:14.400
<v Speaker 1>So established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>established fact that when you get to </v>

1976
01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:16.510
<v Speaker 1>the lowest measurable portion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

1977
01:44:16.690 --> 01:44:20.050
<v Speaker 1>when you get to subatomic particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking magic.</v>

1978
01:44:20.230 --> 01:44:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we go from there and then let's look </v>

1979
01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:25.230
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1980
01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:25.990
<v Speaker 1>it's all in your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1981
01:44:25.991 --> 01:44:30.991
<v Speaker 1>let's look at what that means because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you see on this planet that a</v>

1982
01:44:31.541 --> 01:44:35.290
<v Speaker 1>human being has made has somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 1>other popped out of the imagination.</v>

1983
01:44:35.291 --> 01:44:40.291
<v Speaker 1>The imagination is a factory for </v>
<v Speaker 1>televisions and the Internet and </v>

1984
01:44:40.291 --> 01:44:40.700
<v Speaker 1>airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1985
01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Condoms and eyeglasses and laptops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the imagination is a motherfucker</v>

1986
01:44:47.230 --> 01:44:50.710
<v Speaker 1>and we have this idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination is this frivolous thing.</v>

1987
01:44:50.890 --> 01:44:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billy just sits in the field and </v>

1988
01:44:55.890 --> 01:44:56.530
<v Speaker 1>imagined what the world could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about your dig a ditch,</v>

1989
01:44:56.531 --> 01:44:58.720
<v Speaker 1>billy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about you go to work billy,</v>

1990
01:44:58.930 --> 01:45:03.930
<v Speaker 1>hammer some nails and be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull yourself up by your bootstraps and </v>

1991
01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:05.780
<v Speaker 1>stop crying because you're freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that everything's air.</v>

1992
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Everything is particles and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the whole thing.</v>

1993
01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.850
<v Speaker 7>Or are you sitting in a field and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>

1994
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:16.760
<v Speaker 7>you take LSD and you're steve jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you have all these fantasies except that</v>

1995
01:45:16.761 --> 01:45:21.761
<v Speaker 7>you actually make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You create the apple computer or </v>

1996
01:45:21.761 --> 01:45:25.981
<v Speaker 7>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that was a psychedelic vision and </v>

1997
01:45:25.981 --> 01:45:26.640
<v Speaker 7>was at the time and remained so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>

1998
01:45:26.710 --> 01:45:31.710
<v Speaker 7>this thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean this is the little psychedelic </v>

1999
01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:31.710
<v Speaker 7>toy of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2000
01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:33.850
<v Speaker 7>it's in my hand that it exists.</v>

2001
01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Will you ask it questions and it goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>online and it gives you the answer.</v>

2002
01:45:38.521 --> 01:45:43.110
<v Speaker 1>So the entire volume of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding and that subject,</v>

2003
01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:45.150
<v Speaker 1>the consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2004
01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:46.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where you were just explaining,</v>

2005
01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:51.420
<v Speaker 1>explaining what the chemical definition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of silicon is or the description of it.</v>

2006
01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.300
<v Speaker 1>You can find that out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go to you.</v>

2007
01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:55.490
<v Speaker 1>You're an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2008
01:45:55.491 --> 01:45:57.960
<v Speaker 1>you came to me with your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your education,</v>

2009
01:45:57.961 --> 01:46:01.170
<v Speaker 1>you explained it to me and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyone can do that.</v>

2010
01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:06.540
<v Speaker 7>My phone just tapped into the database.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2011
01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:11.640
<v Speaker 7>So that's some,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a threshold we've crossed in the </v>

2012
01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:17.820
<v Speaker 7>last decade or so where basically the </v>
<v Speaker 7>sum total of human knowledge is right </v>

2013
01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:22.621
<v Speaker 7>here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's incredible for </v>

2014
01:46:22.621 --> 01:46:23.590
<v Speaker 7>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for creative thinking.</v>

2015
01:46:23.591 --> 01:46:27.040
<v Speaker 7>All of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's something we've never had before.</v>

2016
01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:32.340
<v Speaker 7>That and the conductivity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The other thing is now there are 7 </v>

2017
01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:34.360
<v Speaker 7>billion people or something like that on</v>
<v Speaker 7>the planet.</v>

2018
01:46:34.361 --> 01:46:35.380
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2019
01:46:36.130 --> 01:46:40.870
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what the statistics are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but 4 billion of them have cell phones,</v>

2020
01:46:41.710 --> 01:46:43.330
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we've creating,</v>

2021
01:46:43.331 --> 01:46:45.120
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't all have smartphones,</v>

2022
01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 7>but they got some kind of a cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so they are tapped into this database </v>

2023
01:46:50.581 --> 01:46:54.340
<v Speaker 7>and that's making a big difference,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2024
01:46:54.490 --> 01:46:55.950
<v Speaker 7>in the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2025
01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.980
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>formerly disenfranchised populations </v>

2026
01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:00.980
<v Speaker 7>interact.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2027
01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:06.020
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're a fish farmer and you have some </v>

2028
01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:06.660
<v Speaker 7>fish to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can go on your cell phone and say,</v>

2029
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:07.290
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2030
01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:08.950
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I go to this village here,</v>

2031
01:47:08.951 --> 01:47:11.880
<v Speaker 7>I'll get a better price for that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a trivial thing.</v>

2032
01:47:11.881 --> 01:47:16.881
<v Speaker 7>But in fact that decision affects </v>
<v Speaker 7>commerce on a global scale if enough </v>

2033
01:47:17.071 --> 01:47:18.960
<v Speaker 7>people are tapped into that.</v>

2034
01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brother was obsessed with December </v>

2035
01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.901
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first 2012 being some sort of a </v>

2036
01:47:28.901 --> 01:47:29.780
<v Speaker 1>transformative moment in our history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2037
01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:34.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people were me included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we can put that one to rest,</v>

2038
01:47:34.101 --> 01:47:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we.</v>

2039
01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:41.500
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that I've been </v>

2040
01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:41.500
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2041
01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:41.500
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a specific day.</v>

2042
01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:45.700
<v Speaker 1>But if you really look at like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tipping point of technological </v>

2043
01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:49.040
<v Speaker 1>technology and our connectivity and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2044
01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:54.520
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's 2008 or 2012 when you're </v>

2045
01:47:55.161 --> 01:47:57.980
<v Speaker 1>looking at a thousand years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they talk about the renaissance,</v>

2046
01:47:58.180 --> 01:47:59.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they talk about,</v>

2047
01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:00.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2048
01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.270
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever great periods of,</v>

2049
01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:07.300
<v Speaker 1>of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever a very gigantic periods of </v>

2050
01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:11.471
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be one of the biggest </v>

2051
01:48:11.471 --> 01:48:11.471
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really,</v>

2052
01:48:11.471 --> 01:48:15.900
<v Speaker 1>really will boil down to these decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are these at least these few years.</v>

2053
01:48:16.730 --> 01:48:18.920
<v Speaker 7>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his error,</v>

2054
01:48:18.921 --> 01:48:22.950
<v Speaker 7>I thought as I was kind of a critic of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the timewave for exactly this I,</v>

2055
01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:25.760
<v Speaker 7>but for folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>explain what that means,</v>

2056
01:48:25.761 --> 01:48:30.761
<v Speaker 7>that's his,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his idea that he created a mathematical </v>

2057
01:48:30.761 --> 01:48:35.021
<v Speaker 7>model based on each thing that he </v>
<v Speaker 7>claimed a describe the structure of </v>

2058
01:48:35.021 --> 01:48:35.690
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2059
01:48:35.691 --> 01:48:40.691
<v Speaker 7>he postulated that time had to structure</v>
<v Speaker 7>and time had an end or at least history </v>

2060
01:48:40.851 --> 01:48:44.180
<v Speaker 7>had a damned and that that end was </v>
<v Speaker 7>December 20,</v>

2061
01:48:44.181 --> 01:48:45.940
<v Speaker 7>first 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there's a,</v>

2062
01:48:45.941 --> 01:48:49.130
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a linkages to the Mayan calendar which</v>

2063
01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:53.930
<v Speaker 7>supposedly said similar things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was,</v>

2064
01:48:54.410 --> 01:48:57.790
<v Speaker 7>it was a mistake to link it to a </v>
<v Speaker 7>particular day.</v>

2065
01:48:57.791 --> 01:49:02.791
<v Speaker 7>I think that's not the way that novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the idea was that this wave described </v>

2066
01:49:02.791 --> 01:49:06.730
<v Speaker 7>the way that novelty in grest into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>continuum.</v>

2067
01:49:06.731 --> 01:49:11.731
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that novelty ingressives in the </v>

2068
01:49:11.731 --> 01:49:14.521
<v Speaker 7>continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean everyday there's something new </v>

2069
01:49:14.521 --> 01:49:17.281
<v Speaker 7>under the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There is something that never happened </v>

2070
01:49:17.281 --> 01:49:17.590
<v Speaker 7>before in the history of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It happens,</v>

2071
01:49:17.890 --> 01:49:20.800
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't explode into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>continuum.</v>

2072
01:49:20.801 --> 01:49:23.220
<v Speaker 7>It more like it seeps into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>continuum.</v>

2073
01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:26.800
<v Speaker 7>But change does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2074
01:49:27.190 --> 01:49:30.610
<v Speaker 7>we're going through a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a period of tremendous change,</v>

2075
01:49:30.611 --> 01:49:35.611
<v Speaker 7>but it's not linked to a particular day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what I say is he was wrong as far as </v>

2076
01:49:36.191 --> 01:49:39.430
<v Speaker 7>the particulars were concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't December 20,</v>

2077
01:49:39.431 --> 01:49:44.020
<v Speaker 7>first 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he was totally right in terms of the</v>

2078
01:49:44.021 --> 01:49:49.021
<v Speaker 7>idea that novelty does increase and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>has increased and it's increased,</v>

2079
01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:53.200
<v Speaker 7>it's increasing them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's accelerating.</v>

2080
01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.590
<v Speaker 7>And all you have to do is look around,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2081
01:49:56.591 --> 01:49:58.330
<v Speaker 7>and he was clearly right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2082
01:49:58.331 --> 01:50:02.890
<v Speaker 7>if you look at where we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even from where we were 10 years ago and</v>

2083
01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:07.920
<v Speaker 7>even 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can any of us even remember what it was </v>

2084
01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:08.260
<v Speaker 7>like 20 years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2085
01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.570
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the world has completely transformed.</v>

2086
01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:13.750
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he was correct in that sense,</v>

2087
01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:14.300
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

2088
01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:15.340
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2089
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:16.660
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2090
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:21.870
<v Speaker 7>things are changing and well maybe in </v>
<v Speaker 7>just putting a date to it and giving </v>

2091
01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:26.041
<v Speaker 7>people something to focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he made the idea more tangible for some.</v>

2092
01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:29.410
<v Speaker 7>It made it more tangible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think it wasn't,</v>

2093
01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:34.440
<v Speaker 7>I think it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not necessarily a good strategy because </v>

2094
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:40.330
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it people were giving into the </v>

2095
01:50:40.330 --> 01:50:43.150
<v Speaker 7>temptation of focusing on that date and </v>
<v Speaker 7>it was either on that date,</v>

2096
01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:45.400
<v Speaker 7>either everything's going to collapse </v>
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>

2097
01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:49.090
<v Speaker 7>or we'll cross the threshold and </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything will be great.</v>

2098
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:50.780
<v Speaker 7>And it was kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2099
01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.100
<v Speaker 7>consciousness will be transformed and </v>
<v Speaker 7>won't be in this golden state.</v>

2100
01:50:54.101 --> 01:50:56.080
<v Speaker 7>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was kind of a,</v>

2101
01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:59.800
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for many people it was an excuse for not</v>

2102
01:51:00.130 --> 01:51:02.460
<v Speaker 7>taking responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it and,</v>

2103
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:07.270
<v Speaker 7>and just all we have to do is wait.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then it'll all workout.</v>

2104
01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:08.410
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2105
01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:12.730
<v Speaker 7>that's not taking responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've got to get cracking now.</v>

2106
01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:14.740
<v Speaker 7>We can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We can't wait.</v>

2107
01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:18.550
<v Speaker 7>So now that it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the message is the same.</v>

2108
01:51:18.551 --> 01:51:21.850
<v Speaker 7>We've got to get cracking and we can </v>
<v Speaker 7>relax.</v>

2109
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:24.580
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The aliens didn't land.</v>

2110
01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:28.000
<v Speaker 7>No wormholes appeared before our eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:51:28.570 --> 01:51:33.570
<v Speaker 7>None of that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't mean that things aren't </v>

2112
01:51:33.570 --> 01:51:34.210
<v Speaker 7>happening and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2113
01:51:34.330 --> 01:51:39.190
<v Speaker 7>to make things make change,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think happened quietly,</v>

2114
01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:40.930
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not noticed.</v>

2115
01:51:40.931 --> 01:51:45.931
<v Speaker 7>They're not tremendous with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with obvious exceptions like a global </v>

2116
01:51:47.621 --> 01:51:48.820
<v Speaker 7>asteroid impact.</v>

2117
01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:49.390
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

2118
01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.780
<v Speaker 7>that's abrupt and it's transforming,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no doubt.</v>

2119
01:51:52.781 --> 01:51:55.690
<v Speaker 7>But that only happens once every few </v>
<v Speaker 7>million years.</v>

2120
01:51:55.980 --> 01:52:00.980
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>events normally don't explode into </v>

2121
01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:00.980
<v Speaker 7>history that way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2122
01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:03.000
<v Speaker 7>tariffs used to talk about the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2123
01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:06.640
<v Speaker 7>the explode,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the first explosion of the atomic bomb,</v>

2124
01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:07.930
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2125
01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:10.300
<v Speaker 7>that was an abrupt event,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not really.</v>

2126
01:52:10.301 --> 01:52:10.720
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the.</v>

2127
01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:16.020
<v Speaker 7>When did the actual novelty take place?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was it when Einstein developed the </v>

2128
01:52:16.691 --> 01:52:21.691
<v Speaker 7>equations that describe nuclear fusion?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or was it the fishing rather?</v>

2129
01:52:21.821 --> 01:52:24.580
<v Speaker 7>Or was it the point where,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2130
01:52:24.581 --> 01:52:29.581
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we achieved the first sustained nuclear </v>

2131
01:52:29.581 --> 01:52:29.581
<v Speaker 7>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2132
01:52:29.581 --> 01:52:31.120
<v Speaker 7>these were not things that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 7>noticed at the time,</v>

2133
01:52:31.210 --> 01:52:36.130
<v Speaker 7>but those were the transformative events</v>
<v Speaker 7>that made it possible to,</v>

2134
01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:41.160
<v Speaker 7>a couple decades later,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dropped the atomic uttama on the atom </v>

2135
01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:41.560
<v Speaker 7>bomb on Hiroshima,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2136
01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:43.330
<v Speaker 7>and that's the one that got the </v>
<v Speaker 7>headlights,</v>

2137
01:52:43.331 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 7>but that wasn't really the roots of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>novelty,</v>

2138
01:52:45.951 --> 01:52:46.850
<v Speaker 7>if you know what I'm saying.</v>

2139
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2140
01:52:47.441 --> 01:52:52.441
<v Speaker 1>I totally know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems that they're all pile onto </v>

2141
01:52:52.441 --> 01:52:55.350
<v Speaker 1>each other as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pile onto each other and they're </v>

2142
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.350
<v Speaker 1>cumulative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2143
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:58.120
<v Speaker 1>And we haven't even started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely.</v>

2144
01:52:58.150 --> 01:52:59.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't started.</v>

2145
01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Which is why the concept of an alien </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion seems so ridiculous to us based</v>

2146
01:53:05.111 --> 01:53:07.930
<v Speaker 1>on our current capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so inevitable.</v>

2147
01:53:07.931 --> 01:53:12.931
<v Speaker 1>When you think about the fact that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got robots wandering around on Mars </v>

2148
01:53:12.931 --> 01:53:13.030
<v Speaker 1>right now as we speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2149
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:15.880
<v Speaker 1>what would we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would we think we're going to do?</v>

2150
01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do,</v>

2151
01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:20.560
<v Speaker 1>the most spectacular thing we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have two things we do.</v>

2152
01:53:20.770 --> 01:53:25.770
<v Speaker 1>We blow shit up and we explore space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two things that gathered </v>

2153
01:53:25.781 --> 01:53:26.790
<v Speaker 1>the most attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2154
01:53:27.010 --> 01:53:27.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

2155
01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:32.820
<v Speaker 1>we can blow up a city or we can send a </v>
<v Speaker 1>robot to wander around on Mars and send </v>

2156
01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:35.320
<v Speaker 1>back videos and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

2157
01:53:35.321 --> 01:53:39.910
<v Speaker 1>those are the two very distinctly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2158
01:53:39.911 --> 01:53:43.700
<v Speaker 1>But this exemplify the limit</v>

2159
01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:44.900
<v Speaker 7>higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:49.901
<v Speaker 7>We have the power to completely disrupt </v>
<v Speaker 7>the whole shooting match and just,</v>

2161
01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:55.420
<v Speaker 7>it all turns into radioactive slag or we</v>
<v Speaker 7>escaped some way and I think,</v>

2162
01:53:55.941 --> 01:53:56.900
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2163
01:53:56.901 --> 01:54:01.070
<v Speaker 7>I think it's wonderful that we can send </v>
<v Speaker 7>robots to Maurice and all this,</v>

2164
01:54:01.071 --> 01:54:06.071
<v Speaker 7>but space is so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's never really gonna become </v>

2165
01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:11.690
<v Speaker 7>accessible to us unless we can figure </v>
<v Speaker 7>out this hyper light thing.</v>

2166
01:54:11.691 --> 01:54:16.691
<v Speaker 7>And I don't know if it's traveling the </v>
<v Speaker 7>traveling faster than light or figuring </v>

2167
01:54:17.121 --> 01:54:19.400
<v Speaker 7>out how to open up a portal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2168
01:54:19.401 --> 01:54:20.930
<v Speaker 7>this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2169
01:54:21.050 --> 01:54:24.770
<v Speaker 7>there's Tony Newtonian space separated </v>
<v Speaker 7>by this vast distances.</v>

2170
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:29.860
<v Speaker 7>I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think there's a way to get from one </v>

2171
01:54:30.091 --> 01:54:35.091
<v Speaker 7>place to another without going through </v>
<v Speaker 7>new to hyperspace as a real thing.</v>

2172
01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might get down to,</v>

2173
01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:42.530
<v Speaker 1>to learn how to navigate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might get down to we just have to be </v>

2174
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:46.550
<v Speaker 1>stopped being carbon based life forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might know that made it real space </v>

2175
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:47.120
<v Speaker 1>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2176
01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:49.760
<v Speaker 1>It may end up that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

2177
01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:54.860
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimethyltryptamine and similar </v>

2178
01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:59.571
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics are a gateway to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some other thing,</v>

2179
01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:04.700
<v Speaker 1>whether it's another dimension and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of being another access to a part </v>

2180
01:55:05.041 --> 01:55:06.530
<v Speaker 1>of the mind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't,</v>

2181
01:55:06.570 --> 01:55:09.150
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that,</v>

2182
01:55:09.151 --> 01:55:11.130
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

2183
01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to say this,</v>

2184
01:55:15.001 --> 01:55:20.001
<v Speaker 1>but is that something that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take a long time before </v>

2185
01:55:21.631 --> 01:55:26.631
<v Speaker 1>that's something that you could pass off</v>
<v Speaker 1>to other folks that haven't experienced </v>

2186
01:55:26.631 --> 01:55:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that and have them accept it and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there a bridge to sort of,</v>

2187
01:55:28.621 --> 01:55:31.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them to consider these ideas?</v>

2188
01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:36.710
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really,</v>

2189
01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:37.910
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2190
01:55:37.911 --> 01:55:40.820
<v Speaker 7>I mean the bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the most convincing thing is,</v>

2191
01:55:40.850 --> 01:55:41.530
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's,</v>

2192
01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:43.620
<v Speaker 7>here's the pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>smoke the pipe.</v>

2193
01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:47.040
<v Speaker 7>You don't need me to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>As you mentioned before,</v>

2194
01:55:47.041 --> 01:55:52.041
<v Speaker 7>and it's quite true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One of the beautiful things about </v>

2195
01:55:52.041 --> 01:55:52.290
<v Speaker 7>psychedelics is you don't have to have </v>
<v Speaker 7>faith,</v>

2196
01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:55.590
<v Speaker 7>all you have to have is courage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2197
01:55:55.591 --> 01:56:00.591
<v Speaker 7>you have to have enough courage to sit </v>
<v Speaker 7>down and put that pipe to your lips and </v>

2198
01:56:00.591 --> 01:56:04.410
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can get beyond this conversation very</v>

2199
01:56:04.411 --> 01:56:05.270
<v Speaker 7>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

2200
01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:09.360
<v Speaker 7>Then we can have the real conversation </v>
<v Speaker 7>about what is all that mean,</v>

2201
01:56:09.361 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 7>what did,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what happened and what is the real,</v>

2202
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:13.920
<v Speaker 7>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are We,</v>

2203
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:19.350
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are you a tapping into some external,</v>

2204
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:20.820
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these,</v>

2205
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:24.590
<v Speaker 7>these ridiculous words that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>dualistic,</v>

2206
01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:25.860
<v Speaker 7>enhance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2207
01:56:25.861 --> 01:56:30.861
<v Speaker 7>but are you tapping into some dimension </v>
<v Speaker 7>that is not part of you or is it,</v>

2208
01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:34.570
<v Speaker 7>or are you looking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2209
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:39.510
<v Speaker 7>a certain neurochemical brain state that</v>
<v Speaker 7>has,</v>

2210
01:56:39.690 --> 01:56:44.690
<v Speaker 7>that doesn't go beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then it's like we can fall back on </v>

2211
01:56:44.690 --> 01:56:48.981
<v Speaker 7>what we were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything you experienced isn't </v>

2212
01:56:48.981 --> 01:56:48.981
<v Speaker 7>neurochemical brain state,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2213
01:56:48.981 --> 01:56:51.630
<v Speaker 7>That's what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what our brain does.</v>

2214
01:56:52.190 --> 01:56:52.690
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2215
01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:57.850
<v Speaker 1>so do you define it yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>

2216
01:56:57.851 --> 01:56:59.550
<v Speaker 1>when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is happening?</v>

2217
01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:02.410
<v Speaker 1>DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the most profound one</v>

2218
01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:06.320
<v Speaker 7>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2219
01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.110
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2220
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:12.340
<v Speaker 7>the problem with psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the,</v>

2221
01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:17.460
<v Speaker 7>one of the problems that we experienced </v>
<v Speaker 7>with psychedelics is they are </v>

2222
01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:21.421
<v Speaker 7>essentially an English language bull.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're beyond language and you take dmt</v>

2223
01:57:22.761 --> 01:57:26.210
<v Speaker 7>or something like that has such a </v>
<v Speaker 7>profound impact.</v>

2224
01:57:26.211 --> 01:57:28.250
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you probably noticed it in yourself.</v>

2225
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:33.140
<v Speaker 7>You're not even down from the experience</v>
<v Speaker 7>before.</v>

2226
01:57:33.141 --> 01:57:38.090
<v Speaker 7>You're trying to box it into some kind </v>
<v Speaker 7>of a linguistic box that's,</v>

2227
01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:43.300
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you're reaching out and you're </v>

2228
01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:43.300
<v Speaker 7>babbling and then you're say that it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's it.</v>

2229
01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:43.820
<v Speaker 7>Or my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my God,</v>

2230
01:57:43.821 --> 01:57:48.821
<v Speaker 7>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're trying to put it into some </v>

2231
01:57:48.821 --> 01:57:51.200
<v Speaker 7>kind of a linguistic box because.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because it's in comprehensible by nature</v>

2232
01:57:51.201 --> 01:57:56.201
<v Speaker 7>it seemed comprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like trying to describe what God </v>

2233
01:57:56.201 --> 01:57:59.840
<v Speaker 7>looks like it is by definition </v>
<v Speaker 7>undescribable and so,</v>

2234
01:57:59.930 --> 01:58:03.890
<v Speaker 7>but our brain wants to conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 7>things.</v>

2235
01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:05.480
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2236
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:08.240
<v Speaker 7>so whatever model you create of what it </v>
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>

2237
01:58:08.241 --> 01:58:10.280
<v Speaker 7>that's not it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not the thing.</v>

2238
01:58:10.281 --> 01:58:12.710
<v Speaker 7>It's not what you experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a memory of,</v>

2239
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:16.220
<v Speaker 7>of what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of what you experienced.</v>

2240
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:18.860
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2241
01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:24.760
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how you get around that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2242
01:58:24.981 --> 01:58:26.770
<v Speaker 7>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2243
01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:30.640
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2244
01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems even exploring the concept </v>

2245
01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:36.880
<v Speaker 1>itself is almost impossible without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience almost</v>

2246
01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:38.010
<v Speaker 7>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it,</v>

2247
01:58:38.370 --> 01:58:40.560
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you're asking me to a supply,</v>

2248
01:58:40.561 --> 01:58:42.610
<v Speaker 7>a description.</v>

2249
01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:49.140
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the caveat that any linguistic </v>

2250
01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:53.281
<v Speaker 4>description is going to be an adequate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say a lot of what my impressions</v>

2251
01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:58.890
<v Speaker 4>of DMT are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most profound experiences are it </v>

2252
01:58:58.890 --> 01:59:01.240
<v Speaker 4>strips away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to see the raw data,</v>

2253
01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:06.810
<v Speaker 4>the raw data of experience in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unprocessed for,</v>

2254
01:59:06.850 --> 01:59:11.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how we were talking about how the brain </v>

2255
01:59:11.850 --> 01:59:12.070
<v Speaker 4>takes experience and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2256
01:59:12.190 --> 01:59:17.190
<v Speaker 4>puts it all together into some kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>more or less comprehensible model.</v>

2257
01:59:17.561 --> 01:59:21.370
<v Speaker 4>And extrudes out has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

2258
01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:23.350
<v Speaker 4>your reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your movie,</v>

2259
01:59:23.351 --> 01:59:27.730
<v Speaker 4>the movie that your producer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>director and star of and uh,</v>

2260
01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:32.620
<v Speaker 4>it does that dmt gives you a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of arrest that process.</v>

2261
01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:34.180
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>

2262
01:59:34.181 --> 01:59:36.670
<v Speaker 4>step back from it and look at the raw </v>
<v Speaker 4>data,</v>

2263
01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:41.700
<v Speaker 4>look at the circuitry underneath free of</v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation and say,</v>

2264
01:59:43.210 --> 01:59:44.470
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2265
01:59:44.590 --> 01:59:47.200
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the machinery.</v>

2266
01:59:47.201 --> 01:59:49.870
<v Speaker 4>This is the machinery that generating </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

2267
01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:55.620
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by even saying that I don't do it </v>

2268
01:59:55.620 --> 01:59:55.620
<v Speaker 4>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

2269
01:59:55.620 --> 01:59:56.900
<v Speaker 4>it's slippery obviously it's a slippery </v>
<v Speaker 4>cock onset</v>

2270
01:59:57.210 --> 01:59:58.830
<v Speaker 3>intensely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intensely,</v>

2271
01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:01.670
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered like what is the,</v>

2272
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:06.950
<v Speaker 3>if there is a way to describe it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who hasn't experienced and I </v>

2273
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.950
<v Speaker 3>don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there is,</v>

2274
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:09.690
<v Speaker 3>and even to those of us who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced it,</v>

2275
02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:14.720
<v Speaker 3>you can't describe it after my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been tricked,</v>

2276
02:00:15.690 --> 02:00:19.650
<v Speaker 3>like that's not anything like Terence </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna or Dennis Mckenna described it.</v>

2277
02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.330
<v Speaker 3>What did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was your experience like?</v>

2278
02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:24.420
<v Speaker 3>No self transforming machine elves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2279
02:00:24.421 --> 02:00:27.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of of my first mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

2280
02:00:27.391 --> 02:00:32.391
<v Speaker 3>but now my first dmt experience was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it sounds trivial,</v>

2281
02:00:33.211 --> 02:00:38.211
<v Speaker 3>but it was sort of like some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gingerbread or play dough that was alive</v>

2282
02:00:38.641 --> 02:00:43.410
<v Speaker 3>and talking to me and just sort of one </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of the godhead.</v>

2283
02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Just sort of gingerbread or playdough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2284
02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:52.120
<v Speaker 3>it was sort of like alive gingerbread </v>
<v Speaker 3>people I guess way it didn't look like </v>

2285
02:00:53.851 --> 02:00:54.580
<v Speaker 3>an Elf but it.</v>

2286
02:00:54.620 --> 02:00:56.580
<v Speaker 3>And it kind of had that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that aspect.</v>

2287
02:00:56.590 --> 02:00:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It certainly felt alive like it had been</v>

2288
02:00:59.521 --> 02:01:01.120
<v Speaker 3>waiting for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2289
02:01:01.150 --> 02:01:03.660
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird thing to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2290
02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:08.280
<v Speaker 3>The weird one is the friendliness of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I felt dead.</v>

2291
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:11.190
<v Speaker 3>That was my overwhelming feeling was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

2292
02:01:11.191 --> 02:01:14.160
<v Speaker 3>I've really done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the back of my mind I knew that I</v>

2293
02:01:14.161 --> 02:01:19.161
<v Speaker 3>was coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was still sitting in my chair and </v>

2294
02:01:19.161 --> 02:01:23.271
<v Speaker 3>before I knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was over and I was Doug Stan hope </v>

2295
02:01:23.271 --> 02:01:23.271
<v Speaker 3>who's a good friend of mine is a stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>up comedian.</v>

2296
02:01:23.370 --> 02:01:26.220
<v Speaker 3>Did a dmt with me the first time you </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever did it.</v>

2297
02:01:26.221 --> 02:01:29.940
<v Speaker 3>I had them over my house and he went </v>
<v Speaker 3>into convulsions,</v>

2298

2300
02:01:36.030 --> 02:01:38.880
<v Speaker 3>he started moaning and foaming at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth,</v>

2301
02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:40.240
<v Speaker 3>like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2302

<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

2303
02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking of the Qti from this </v>

2304
02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:50.711
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of anybody that's </v>

2305
02:01:50.711 --> 02:01:50.711
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just killed my friend.</v>

2306
02:01:50.711 --> 02:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How am I gonna explain this.</v>

2307
02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:54.500
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

2308
02:01:54.501 --> 02:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody have that one</v>

2309
02:01:56.230 --> 02:01:59.140
<v Speaker 7>experience before or since.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2310
02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.490
<v Speaker 7>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was,</v>

2311
02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:02.830
<v Speaker 7>he was moaning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was a big dose.</v>

2312
02:02:02.831 --> 02:02:05.950
<v Speaker 7>He took a big dose and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2313
02:02:05.951 --> 02:02:10.450
<v Speaker 7>when he came back just for just filled </v>
<v Speaker 7>with descriptions that were inadequate,</v>

2314
02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:11.920
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which we all are,</v>

2315
02:02:12.730 --> 02:02:17.730
<v Speaker 7>but a five methoxy is even trickier.</v>
<v Speaker 7>DMT,</v>

2316
02:02:17.921 --> 02:02:22.921
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean I've had very limited experience </v>

2317
02:02:22.921 --> 02:02:26.320
<v Speaker 7>with firefox seat because it's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2318
02:02:26.321 --> 02:02:28.810
<v Speaker 7>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't think I was coming back.</v>

2319
02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:34.320
<v Speaker 7>That's my baby.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's exactly the one we should be </v>

2320
02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:34.510
<v Speaker 7>looking into.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2321
02:02:34.570 --> 02:02:35.440
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2322
02:02:35.590 --> 02:02:40.590
<v Speaker 7>but it has more issues with toxicity and</v>
<v Speaker 7>all that and to uh,</v>

2323
02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:44.830
<v Speaker 7>but it's definitely puts you in this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2324
02:02:44.890 --> 02:02:46.280
<v Speaker 7>in this place to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2325
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:50.560
<v Speaker 7>James horrocks book the trip to me </v>
<v Speaker 7>palace.</v>

2326
02:02:50.590 --> 02:02:51.580
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2327
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:56.910
<v Speaker 7>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You might want to get him on this show </v>

2328
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:56.910
<v Speaker 7>palace.</v>
<v Speaker 7>James Orac.</v>

2329
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:56.950
<v Speaker 7>How do you spell it?</v>

2330
02:02:57.650 --> 02:02:59.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>R o</v>

2331
02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:04.400
<v Speaker 7>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe five methoxy DM.</v>

2332
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:08.280
<v Speaker 7>This is all about 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 7>ctmt that's this whole book.</v>

2333
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:12.120
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he says you think DMT is something?</v>

2334
02:03:12.210 --> 02:03:17.210
<v Speaker 7>Five methoxy is where it's really at.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I can't dispute that because frankly</v>

2335
02:03:19.621 --> 02:03:20.490
<v Speaker 7>it scares the shit out.</v>

2336
02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was different for me because,</v>

2337
02:03:24.641 --> 02:03:29.641
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't give me the sort of comfort </v>

2338
02:03:29.641 --> 02:03:32.491
<v Speaker 1>that dmt did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was sort of talking to me and </v>

2339
02:03:32.491 --> 02:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>communicating with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was completely absent of any context.</v>

2340
02:03:34.121 --> 02:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>It was impossible</v>

2341
02:03:35.690 --> 02:03:37.100
<v Speaker 4>play it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was.</v>

2342
02:03:37.130 --> 02:03:39.200
<v Speaker 4>There were no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no friendly Elfin,</v>

2343
02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:42.140
<v Speaker 4>no gingerbread people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no machines,</v>

2344
02:03:42.141 --> 02:03:43.790
<v Speaker 4>no nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

2345
02:03:43.791 --> 02:03:44.960
<v Speaker 4>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were.</v>

2346
02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:50.500
<v Speaker 4>My apprehension was that was that I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of this oort cloud of souls.</v>

2347
02:03:52.071 --> 02:03:57.071
<v Speaker 4>I was a part of this somewhere somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's a place where all conscious </v>

2348
02:03:57.441 --> 02:04:02.441
<v Speaker 4>entities arose from and go back to and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was in the center of this galactic cloud</v>

2349
02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:07.130
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of being,</v>

2350
02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2351
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:13.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean I sort of had that diem awareness</v>
<v Speaker 4>of my existence as a separate entity,</v>

2352
02:04:13.971 --> 02:04:16.760
<v Speaker 4>but mostly I was part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the soul</v>

2353
02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:21.030
<v Speaker 7>all out and a is the best I can describe</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

2354
02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:25.140
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And by the time I came back,</v>

2355
02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:27.590
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2356
02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:32.600
<v Speaker 7>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was all completely faded as it </v>

2357
02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:32.600
<v Speaker 7>tended to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was,</v>

2358
02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:32.600
<v Speaker 7>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2359
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:38.990
<v Speaker 7>that was 20 years ago that I had that </v>
<v Speaker 7>experience and still resonating with me.</v>

2360
02:04:39.331 --> 02:04:40.320
<v Speaker 7>I haven't done it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sam.</v>

2361
02:04:40.710 --> 02:04:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only had it a few times and I </v>

2362
02:04:45.710 --> 02:04:45.710
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to go back again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2363
02:04:45.710 --> 02:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

2364
02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the on any time,</v>

2365
02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>ethel trip to mean was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was different every time and it </v>

2366
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.490
<v Speaker 1>seemed like it was a communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something was talking to me.</v>

2367
02:04:56.491 --> 02:05:01.491
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The visual aspect of it was way more </v>

2368
02:05:01.491 --> 02:05:01.491
<v Speaker 1>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2369
02:05:01.491 --> 02:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I did very little visual aspect with </v>
<v Speaker 1>foxy was just white.</v>

2370
02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2371
02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:10.670
<v Speaker 1>it felt like I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a consciousness anymore is</v>

2372
02:05:10.671 --> 02:05:13.370
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that I've ever done that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to eliminate consciousness.</v>

2373
02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:15.420
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter.</v>

2374
02:05:15.450 --> 02:05:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Like the vaguely aware the Dolly aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that you exist at all was </v>

2375
02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:22.800
<v Speaker 1>one of the more terrifying aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2376
02:05:22.801 --> 02:05:23.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2377
02:05:23.221 --> 02:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>this is probably what happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

2378
02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:30.200
<v Speaker 1>When you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably go into this thing and </v>

2379
02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:31.910
<v Speaker 1>become whatever part of this cloud you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are</v>

2380
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:36.560
<v Speaker 7>community of over souls,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is every conscious being that ever</v>

2381
02:05:36.561 --> 02:05:38.570
<v Speaker 7>existed anywhere in the universe.</v>

2382
02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>It also gave me the most tangible </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of there not being an up and </v>

2383
02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:45.210
<v Speaker 1>then not being in down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no laugh.</v>

2384
02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:48.290
<v Speaker 1>There is no right or as the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2385
02:05:48.291 --> 02:05:52.640
<v Speaker 1>and then you're part of the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just goes everywhere.</v>

2386
02:05:52.641 --> 02:05:54.110
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in the middle,</v>

2387
02:05:54.140 --> 02:05:56.330
<v Speaker 1>you're not in the center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in the left,</v>

2388
02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>not to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just show the whole thing,</v>

2389
02:05:59.690 --> 02:06:00.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2390
02:06:00.710 --> 02:06:01.980
<v Speaker 1>it's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

2391
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:06.990
<v Speaker 1>that was the weird aspect of the planets</v>
<v Speaker 1>were an illusion that everything's a </v>

2392
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>little wind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

2393
02:06:08.061 --> 02:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just a part of the whole,</v>

2394
02:06:10.131 --> 02:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>when you get down to the lowest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a part of the whole soup.</v>

2395
02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2396
02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:16.330
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He thought that drug,</v>

2397
02:06:16.331 --> 02:06:21.331
<v Speaker 7>he refers to a zero energy point feel,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2398
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:23.530
<v Speaker 7>which uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2399
02:06:23.531 --> 02:06:28.360
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's a definitely a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a worth putting on your map.</v>

2400
02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:31.600
<v Speaker 7>And if you're brave enough or foolish </v>
<v Speaker 7>enough,</v>

2401
02:06:31.601 --> 02:06:34.100
<v Speaker 7>it's probably worth exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I'm,</v>

2402
02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:36.340
<v Speaker 7>I'm too old for that shit.</v>

2403
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:36.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2404
02:06:43.190 --> 02:06:48.190
<v Speaker 1>My friend Duncan took it and he took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge dose because he didn't believe it </v>

2405
02:06:48.190 --> 02:06:51.601
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had never done any dmt before and he </v>

2406
02:06:51.601 --> 02:06:51.601
<v Speaker 1>had done acid and I had never done acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2407
02:06:51.601 --> 02:06:54.290
<v Speaker 1>And I was telling him about dmts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even ever even done acid.</v>

2408
02:06:54.530 --> 02:06:59.530
<v Speaker 1>So he takes a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes dmt in a big dose and he calls </v>

2409
02:06:59.530 --> 02:06:59.530
<v Speaker 1>me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2410
02:06:59.930 --> 02:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2411
02:07:01.761 --> 02:07:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I told you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2412
02:07:03.021 --> 02:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>he didn't tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of told me,</v>

2413
02:07:04.821 --> 02:07:06.040
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2414
02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was convinced that he died.</v>

2415
02:07:09.321 --> 02:07:12.080
<v Speaker 1>He was a believer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

2416
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Was he ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2417
02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

2418
02:07:15.670 --> 02:07:18.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very disturbing.</v>

2419
02:07:18.591 --> 02:07:23.591
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to ignore transcendent </v>

2420
02:07:23.591 --> 02:07:23.591
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2421
02:07:23.591 --> 02:07:27.160
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Salvia divinorum can take a </v>

2422
02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:27.590
<v Speaker 3>person to a similar space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

2423
02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:32.820
<v Speaker 3>You feel that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're no longer a point of </v>

2424
02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:34.100
<v Speaker 3>consciousness except it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't feel like a cloud.</v>

2425
02:07:34.101 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 3>It feels like a Mexican dance party</v>

2426
02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:40.780
<v Speaker 1>or geometric thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2427
02:07:40.781 --> 02:07:45.781
<v Speaker 1>Because it slipped through that Salvia </v>
<v Speaker 1>slip through and it took a while before </v>

2428
02:07:45.851 --> 02:07:50.851
<v Speaker 1>people realize that slipped through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean legally speaking through </v>

2429
02:07:50.851 --> 02:07:53.860
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its own best insurance against abuse.</v>

2430
02:07:55.110 --> 02:07:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Most people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once there's enough,</v>

2431
02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:01.270
<v Speaker 1>never again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these ones like five.</v>

2432
02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:02.470
<v Speaker 7>See,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean most,</v>

2433
02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:07.800
<v Speaker 7>some people do seem to be fascinated by </v>
<v Speaker 7>it and they keep going back to it and,</v>

2434
02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:15.220
<v Speaker 7>but most people find it very disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 7>and not,</v>

2435
02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:18.640
<v Speaker 7>not particularly enjoyable and actually </v>
<v Speaker 7>just,</v>

2436
02:08:18.970 --> 02:08:22.480
<v Speaker 7>just bizarro no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But again,</v>

2437
02:08:22.481 --> 02:08:23.910
<v Speaker 7>these are areas,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2438
02:08:23.911 --> 02:08:28.090
<v Speaker 7>of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These pharmacological tools are,</v>

2439
02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:28.960
<v Speaker 7>are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2440
02:08:29.060 --> 02:08:34.060
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their exploratory probes into these </v>

2441
02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:37.230
<v Speaker 7>realms of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And just because you're familiar with </v>

2442
02:08:37.230 --> 02:08:41.250
<v Speaker 7>the psychedelic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is mainly the tryptamine mediated </v>

2443
02:08:41.250 --> 02:08:41.890
<v Speaker 7>Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2444
02:08:41.891 --> 02:08:46.891
<v Speaker 7>dimension there all those other </v>
<v Speaker 7>dimensions out there and are aspects of </v>

2445
02:08:46.891 --> 02:08:50.940
<v Speaker 7>consciousness to Salvia divinorum </v>
<v Speaker 7>happens to be the kappa opiates.</v>

2446
02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:53.590
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a kappa opioid like end.</v>

2447
02:08:53.591 --> 02:08:55.960
<v Speaker 7>It's very selective for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2448
02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:00.430
<v Speaker 7>we don't think of opiates is going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>those places,</v>

2449
02:09:00.431 --> 02:09:01.920
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>heroin and morphine,</v>

2450
02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:04.120
<v Speaker 7>those sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're euphoric,</v>

2451
02:09:04.121 --> 02:09:05.700
<v Speaker 7>gentle,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2452
02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:09.730
<v Speaker 7>almost sedated states of mind kappa OPA </v>
<v Speaker 7>eight,</v>

2453
02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:10.800
<v Speaker 7>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2454
02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:15.810
<v Speaker 7>one of the three opiate receptors that </v>
<v Speaker 7>happens to be the one that's Salvia </v>

2455
02:09:15.810 --> 02:09:16.300
<v Speaker 7>divinorum exists.</v>

2456
02:09:16.690 --> 02:09:18.880
<v Speaker 7>It's a whole other ballgame,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2457
02:09:18.881 --> 02:09:21.340
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not a,</v>

2458
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:25.660
<v Speaker 7>certainly not anything that anyone would</v>
<v Speaker 7>seek out,</v>

2459
02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:27.340
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>certainly not addictive,</v>

2460
02:09:27.370 --> 02:09:32.370
<v Speaker 7>but so that realm of consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 7>mediated by that whole network.</v>

2461
02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:36.630
<v Speaker 7>If you look at a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the tourist,</v>

2462
02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:41.640
<v Speaker 7>the night shades,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the anticholinergics that's working on </v>

2463
02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:43.420
<v Speaker 7>Acetylcholine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Acetylcholine blockers,</v>

2464
02:09:43.421 --> 02:09:46.600
<v Speaker 7>so that's a whole other neurotransmitter</v>
<v Speaker 7>system.</v>

2465
02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:49.830
<v Speaker 7>And if you look into,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2466
02:09:49.930 --> 02:09:54.930
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I may have a long history of use </v>

2467
02:09:54.930 --> 02:09:54.930
<v Speaker 7>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they seem to be,</v>

2468
02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:00.360
<v Speaker 7>if you look into the use of tollway in </v>
<v Speaker 7>South America to weigh a brick band,</v>

2469
02:10:01.201 --> 02:10:04.720
<v Speaker 7>cea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or you look at detour for another night,</v>

2470
02:10:04.721 --> 02:10:09.721
<v Speaker 7>shades in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is the realm of race and ghosts and</v>

2471
02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:13.090
<v Speaker 7>that sort of thing.</v>

2472
02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Detour is a very interesting one too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the,</v>

2473
02:10:17.521 --> 02:10:22.521
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality desolving properties of it </v>

2474
02:10:22.521 --> 02:10:23.340
<v Speaker 1>where people think that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that they're not,</v>

2475
02:10:23.370 --> 02:10:28.370
<v Speaker 1>and they have huge issues with memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that's the disruption of </v>

2476
02:10:28.370 --> 02:10:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Acetylcholine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2477
02:10:29.070 --> 02:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>

2478
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 1>it does disrupt memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that Acetylcholine has a lot to</v>

2479
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:36.910
<v Speaker 7>do with the entrainment of memory and </v>
<v Speaker 7>detour,</v>

2480
02:10:37.380 --> 02:10:38.900
<v Speaker 7>detour.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It disrupts that.</v>

2481
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:44.950
<v Speaker 7>So it's hard to remember the state,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is probably a good thing because </v>

2482
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:46.910
<v Speaker 7>the states are really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2483
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:52.870
<v Speaker 7>I tell people detour it a night shade.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Detour is not a psychedelic,</v>

2484
02:10:53.991 --> 02:10:58.991
<v Speaker 7>but it's a true hallucinogen in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>sense that it's not a psychedelic state,</v>

2485
02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:03.620
<v Speaker 7>but you have hallucinations.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The problem is you can't tell if they're</v>

2486
02:11:03.621 --> 02:11:06.800
<v Speaker 7>real or not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Usually a psychedelic hallucination,</v>

2487
02:11:06.801 --> 02:11:08.030
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not real.</v>

2488
02:11:08.031 --> 02:11:10.160
<v Speaker 7>You may be seeing something that's not </v>
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>

2489
02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:14.530
<v Speaker 7>but there's a part of your mind that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>saying this is a hallucination year.</v>

2490
02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:15.950
<v Speaker 7>It's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2491
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:21.400
<v Speaker 7>you see things on detour.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't know if they're there or not </v>

2492
02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:21.560
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2493
02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:22.700
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

2494
02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.980
<v Speaker 7>if I could,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could have a hallucination.</v>

2495
02:11:24.981 --> 02:11:29.981
<v Speaker 7>I'm sitting across from you talking and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you see ms dot real and solid as you do </v>

2496
02:11:30.771 --> 02:11:31.370
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>

2497
02:11:32.150 --> 02:11:34.010
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're not there.</v>

2498
02:11:34.610 --> 02:11:39.610
<v Speaker 7>I'm having a conversation with you and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then you sort of just fade away like </v>

2499
02:11:39.610 --> 02:11:40.970
<v Speaker 7>kind of a wraith,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2500
02:11:40.971 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 7>you sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

2501
02:11:42.231 --> 02:11:44.660
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where did you go?</v>

2502
02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.910
<v Speaker 7>Is that what has happened to you have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2503
02:11:46.911 --> 02:11:49.760
<v Speaker 7>that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What happened to you when you did it?</v>

2504
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:52.070
<v Speaker 7>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you were talking to someone.</v>

2505
02:11:52.071 --> 02:11:53.690
<v Speaker 7>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They literally didn't exist.</v>

2506
02:11:53.691 --> 02:11:54.290
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2507
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.820
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2508
02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:58.070
<v Speaker 7>I took a detour.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I described this in my book.</v>

2509
02:11:58.071 --> 02:11:59.780
<v Speaker 7>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have old chapter of it,</v>

2510
02:11:59.781 --> 02:12:04.781
<v Speaker 7>a friend of mine and I took a detour up </v>
<v Speaker 7>when we were 16.</v>

2511
02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:09.820
<v Speaker 7>Not even knowing what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean this is how clueless we were at </v>

2512
02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:14.321
<v Speaker 7>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I actually thought it was a kind of </v>

2513
02:12:14.321 --> 02:12:14.321
<v Speaker 7>morning glory.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2514
02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:18.590
<v Speaker 7>I had had lsd once in my life and we </v>
<v Speaker 7>took this detour it.</v>

2515
02:12:18.590 --> 02:12:20.870
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was a different species of </v>
<v Speaker 7>morning glory.</v>

2516
02:12:20.871 --> 02:12:23.810
<v Speaker 7>So all this stuff began to happen and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>thought,</v>

2517
02:12:23.811 --> 02:12:26.060
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is what a bad acid trip is.</v>

2518
02:12:26.061 --> 02:12:27.950
<v Speaker 7>Like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And no,</v>

2519
02:12:27.951 --> 02:12:32.951
<v Speaker 7>it's not what a bad acid trip is like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's what a totally typical a detour.</v>

2520
02:12:33.411 --> 02:12:38.411
<v Speaker 7>A trip is like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's characteristic that you see </v>

2521
02:12:38.411 --> 02:12:42.020
<v Speaker 7>entities,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you see things that are there.</v>

2522
02:12:42.230 --> 02:12:47.230
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was an and it was quite anxiety </v>

2523
02:12:47.230 --> 02:12:49.070
<v Speaker 7>provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2524
02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:51.560
<v Speaker 7>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was in my bedroom,</v>

2525
02:12:51.561 --> 02:12:53.370
<v Speaker 7>I managed to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2526
02:12:53.371 --> 02:12:56.540
<v Speaker 7>you have to read the chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I finally got to my bedroom,</v>

2527
02:12:56.541 --> 02:13:00.740
<v Speaker 7>I barricaded myself in my bedroom and my</v>
<v Speaker 7>mother was completely freaked out.</v>

2528
02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:03.200
<v Speaker 7>What was going on?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just said,</v>

2529
02:13:03.201 --> 02:13:04.190
<v Speaker 7>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how old,</v>

2530
02:13:04.191 --> 02:13:06.230
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll be out in 12 hours.</v>

2531
02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:12.770
<v Speaker 7>16.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2532
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:16.820
<v Speaker 7>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so I'm in the bedroom and one of the</v>

2533
02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:21.940
<v Speaker 7>weird things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess people who take detours should </v>

2534
02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:24.971
<v Speaker 7>be for ward.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One of the things that does this dilate </v>

2535
02:13:24.971 --> 02:13:24.971
<v Speaker 7>your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2536
02:13:24.971 --> 02:13:28.800
<v Speaker 7>It's used medically to dilate your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Atrophying is what they put in your eyes</v>

2537
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 7>to do an eye exam.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What means is your</v>

2538
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:35.910
<v Speaker 4>eyes are dilated so you can't see very </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2539
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:37.510
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2540
02:13:37.530 --> 02:13:41.580
<v Speaker 4>so any modeled surface anything with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>texture,</v>

2541
02:13:41.670 --> 02:13:46.670
<v Speaker 4>like a table cloth or wallpaper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything you're looking at starts to </v>

2542
02:13:46.670 --> 02:13:49.410
<v Speaker 4>swarm and step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the next thing you know,</v>

2543
02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:53.070
<v Speaker 4>they're bugs everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me.</v>

2544
02:13:53.071 --> 02:13:56.370
<v Speaker 4>So it was like the bug experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were insects,</v>

2545
02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:59.520
<v Speaker 4>all surfaces were covered with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>swarming,</v>

2546
02:14:00.570 --> 02:14:03.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things which were the visual distortions</v>

2547
02:14:03.721 --> 02:14:08.721
<v Speaker 4>of not being able to focus on anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was totally freaked out by this </v>

2548
02:14:08.721 --> 02:14:13.341
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so my friends or images of my </v>

2549
02:14:13.341 --> 02:14:17.601
<v Speaker 4>friends kept appearing at the edge of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>bed at the end of my bed and they would </v>

2550
02:14:17.601 --> 02:14:19.470
<v Speaker 4>appear and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>help me,</v>

2551
02:14:19.471 --> 02:14:21.570
<v Speaker 4>help me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get me out of here.</v>

2552
02:14:21.630 --> 02:14:22.530
<v Speaker 4>I'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2553
02:14:22.710 --> 02:14:25.110
<v Speaker 4>and they would sort of just look at me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

2554
02:14:25.111 --> 02:14:26.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pour sand,</v>

2555
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:30.500
<v Speaker 1>shake their head and then just fade </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2556
02:14:31.370 --> 02:14:36.370
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating that it has something </v>

2557
02:14:36.370 --> 02:14:37.310
<v Speaker 1>to do with Acetylcholine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2558
02:14:37.311 --> 02:14:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever experimented with taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>acetylcholine before you go to bed?</v>

2559
02:14:41.090 --> 02:14:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

2560
02:14:42.490 --> 02:14:47.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you the most amazing lucid </v>

2561
02:14:47.490 --> 02:14:47.490
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing Dreams.</v>

2562
02:14:47.490 --> 02:14:51.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating what I called durable lucid </v>

2563
02:14:51.021 --> 02:14:51.480
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2564
02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm not a lucid dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2565
02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disciplined in I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never studied it.</v>

2566
02:14:57.651 --> 02:15:02.651
<v Speaker 1>I don't practice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's techniques that you </v>

2567
02:15:02.651 --> 02:15:05.261
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn how to successfully lucid </v>

2568
02:15:05.261 --> 02:15:07.880
<v Speaker 1>dream on the Nash as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you take acetylcholine before you</v>

2569
02:15:07.881 --> 02:15:12.881
<v Speaker 1>go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a couple of hours before you go to </v>

2570
02:15:12.881 --> 02:15:14.741
<v Speaker 1>bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have lucid dreams whether you like </v>

2571
02:15:14.741 --> 02:15:14.741
<v Speaker 1>it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just more.</v>

2572
02:15:14.741 --> 02:15:16.850
<v Speaker 1>It seems like your dreams are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>durable when you're aware.</v>

2573
02:15:17.110 --> 02:15:19.880
<v Speaker 1>It meets me personally when I'm aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dreams.</v>

2574
02:15:19.881 --> 02:15:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Normally they'd fade away like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2575
02:15:21.501 --> 02:15:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's gone.</v>

2576
02:15:22.671 --> 02:15:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I wake up.</v>

2577
02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:28.680
<v Speaker 4>You're just boosting what's a natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>process because when you go to sleep,</v>

2578
02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:33.740
<v Speaker 4>your brain becomes flooded with </v>
<v Speaker 4>acetylcholine and these detours,</v>

2579
02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:35.850
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these troll pain alkaloids,</v>

2580
02:15:35.851 --> 02:15:40.280
<v Speaker 4>what they do is block acetylcholine and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they block the receptors,</v>

2581
02:15:40.281 --> 02:15:45.120
<v Speaker 4>so their acetylcholine that called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>technical term is anti-cholinergic.</v>

2582
02:15:45.121 --> 02:15:49.200
<v Speaker 4>They block acetylcholine from binding to</v>
<v Speaker 4>its receptor,</v>

2583
02:15:49.290 --> 02:15:54.290
<v Speaker 4>so that's the basis of the altered state</v>
<v Speaker 4>of consciousness and interestingly </v>

2584
02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:59.061
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the detour a state of mind resembles it </v>

2585
02:16:01.651 --> 02:16:06.651
<v Speaker 4>resembles profound sleep deprivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you keep yourself awake for five </v>

2586
02:16:09.181 --> 02:16:14.181
<v Speaker 4>days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will have experiences and </v>

2587
02:16:14.181 --> 02:16:17.901
<v Speaker 4>hallucinations that are almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>indistinguishable from a state of </v>

2588
02:16:17.901 --> 02:16:19.930
<v Speaker 4>deterrent intoxication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's bizarre.</v>

2589
02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:21.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't recommend it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

2590
02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:24.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do Detroit or if you do deterrent,</v>

2591
02:16:24.810 --> 02:16:29.810
<v Speaker 4>have somebody there is looking after you</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you really can't distinguished </v>

2592
02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

2593
02:16:30.230 --> 02:16:32.430
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you do silly things.</v>

2594
02:16:32.431 --> 02:16:32.800
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2595
02:16:32.801 --> 02:16:37.801
<v Speaker 7>I had a friend who took the literal one </v>
<v Speaker 7>time and he spent the whole time a </v>

2596
02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:43.660
<v Speaker 7>dismantling his motorcycle engine on the</v>
<v Speaker 7>floor,</v>

2597
02:16:43.690 --> 02:16:48.690
<v Speaker 7>on his kitchen floor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>taking it apart and cleaning it and </v>

2598
02:16:48.690 --> 02:16:50.470
<v Speaker 7>putting it back together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He didn't own a motorcycle.</v>

2599
02:16:56.830 --> 02:16:59.680
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What if he learned how to do to do</v>

2600
02:16:59.690 --> 02:17:04.690
<v Speaker 7>it though?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What if you gave a motorcycle engine is </v>

2601
02:17:04.690 --> 02:17:04.690
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2602
02:17:04.690 --> 02:17:06.911
<v Speaker 7>I've done this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then he starts doing it all the </v>

2603
02:17:06.911 --> 02:17:09.520
<v Speaker 7>other Uber Bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is that?</v>

2604
02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:13.910
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's that drug that they use for,</v>

2605
02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:17.750
<v Speaker 7>for air sickness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Same One.</v>

2606
02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:18.530
<v Speaker 7>Scope.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Paula.</v>

2607
02:17:18.531 --> 02:17:19.190
<v Speaker 7>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

2608
02:17:19.191 --> 02:17:20.860
<v Speaker 7>That's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the same thing.</v>

2609
02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:27.280
<v Speaker 7>That's Columbia Dental psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 7>alkaloid in detour and Bella,</v>

2610
02:17:27.330 --> 02:17:29.690
<v Speaker 7>Donna,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and this is the one that does it.</v>

2611
02:17:29.691 --> 02:17:32.280
<v Speaker 7>There are other alkaloids,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's primarily sculpture.</v>

2612
02:17:33.630 --> 02:17:36.210
<v Speaker 7>And they used to use medically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they used to use scope.</v>

2613
02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:39.230
<v Speaker 7>Paula mean because it's a for </v>
<v Speaker 7>childbirth.</v>

2614
02:17:39.290 --> 02:17:44.290
<v Speaker 7>Back in the days of barbarism when they </v>
<v Speaker 7>thought women in order to give </v>

2615
02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:45.890
<v Speaker 7>childbirth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>give birth,</v>

2616
02:17:45.891 --> 02:17:49.130
<v Speaker 7>had to be put in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it had to be drugged,</v>

2617
02:17:49.131 --> 02:17:54.131
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they use Capella mean to put them in a </v>

2618
02:17:54.131 --> 02:17:56.321
<v Speaker 7>twilight state,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a hypnotic state of semi </v>

2619
02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:59.050
<v Speaker 7>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then they could have the baby,</v>

2620
02:17:59.330 --> 02:18:01.890
<v Speaker 7>of course they didn't remember any </v>
<v Speaker 7>experience,</v>

2621
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:04.520
<v Speaker 7>which was sort of the point,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess.</v>

2622
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:09.350
<v Speaker 7>How does nicotine fit in?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because one of my most intense,</v>

2623
02:18:09.351 --> 02:18:12.770
<v Speaker 7>lucid dreaming experiences with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with a nicotine patch,</v>

2624
02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:16.280
<v Speaker 7>nicotine has the opposite effect to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>tropics.</v>

2625
02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:21.340
<v Speaker 7>Nicotine is what's the trope?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Answer what's called a acetylcholine </v>

2626
02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:25.220
<v Speaker 7>antagonists.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nicotine is an agonist,</v>

2627
02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:30.250
<v Speaker 7>so it has an Acetylcholine like effect,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is why when you smoke you get this</v>

2628
02:18:32.061 --> 02:18:34.400
<v Speaker 7>sort of cognitive activation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2629
02:18:34.401 --> 02:18:39.401
<v Speaker 7>it's great to settle down and focus your</v>
<v Speaker 7>attention on a task.</v>

2630
02:18:41.091 --> 02:18:46.091
<v Speaker 7>It activates cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of the research now on Alzheimer's</v>

2631
02:18:47.331 --> 02:18:51.740
<v Speaker 7>and other dementias are finding things </v>
<v Speaker 7>that either have this,</v>

2632
02:18:51.741 --> 02:18:52.460
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

2633
02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:54.400
<v Speaker 7>this colon,</v>
<v Speaker 7>colon nurture jake,</v>

2634
02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:59.700
<v Speaker 7>a agonist effect like nicotine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or they block acetylcholine from being </v>

2635
02:18:59.700 --> 02:19:03.830
<v Speaker 7>broken down their Acetylcholine esterase</v>
<v Speaker 7>inhibitors.</v>

2636
02:19:03.831 --> 02:19:08.660
<v Speaker 7>Acetylcholine estrace is the insight in </v>
<v Speaker 7>that breaks down acetylcholine.</v>

2637
02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:10.940
<v Speaker 7>I don't smoke cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I,</v>

2638
02:19:10.941 --> 02:19:15.941
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I found it absolutely fascinating </v>

2639
02:19:15.941 --> 02:19:18.650
<v Speaker 7>reading Stephen King's book on writing </v>
<v Speaker 7>where he talked about when he stopped </v>

2640
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:20.390
<v Speaker 7>smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It really affected his writing process.</v>

2641
02:19:20.391 --> 02:19:22.810
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not surprised she didn't,</v>

2642
02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:25.630
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't really fire up the way he is.</v>

2643
02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:27.450
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2644
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:31.520
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So now we've again got off the track and</v>

2645
02:19:31.521 --> 02:19:34.610
<v Speaker 7>we're off in the jungles of </v>
<v Speaker 7>pharmacology.</v>

2646
02:19:34.690 --> 02:19:35.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating.</v>

2647
02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:36.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's off track at all.</v>

2648
02:19:36.911 --> 02:19:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all interesting because it's all in</v>

2649
02:19:39.701 --> 02:19:44.701
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what we understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently about compounds that affect </v>

2650
02:19:45.281 --> 02:19:50.281
<v Speaker 1>the human body and what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the ethno botanical stewardship </v>

2651
02:19:50.281 --> 02:19:54.430
<v Speaker 1>council is to try to educate people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

2652
02:19:54.431 --> 02:19:59.431
<v Speaker 1>try to expand consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness of these things and really </v>

2653
02:19:59.431 --> 02:20:00.910
<v Speaker 1>just just promote it and put energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>

2654
02:20:01.090 --> 02:20:01.290
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

2655
02:20:02.010 --> 02:20:07.010
<v Speaker 3>part of it is education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's developing a model of self </v>

2656
02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:11.001
<v Speaker 3>regulation that can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can improve the safety of people that </v>

2657
02:20:11.001 --> 02:20:15.051
<v Speaker 3>want to use these traditional plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one thing I want to be clear about </v>

2658
02:20:15.051 --> 02:20:17.340
<v Speaker 3>is that we're ourselves not setting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>standard per se.</v>

2659
02:20:17.341 --> 02:20:22.341
<v Speaker 3>We're engaging people in dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're kind of setting the table for </v>

2660
02:20:22.341 --> 02:20:24.870
<v Speaker 3>indigenous groups and people that run </v>
<v Speaker 3>retreat centers,</v>

2661
02:20:26.130 --> 02:20:28.630
<v Speaker 3>people that are selling Iowasca online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

2662
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:33.710
<v Speaker 3>All the people that are involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of value chain of iowasca to come </v>

2663
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:34.980
<v Speaker 3>together and determine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2664
02:20:34.981 --> 02:20:37.910
<v Speaker 3>what is sustainability at the site level</v>
<v Speaker 3>look like?</v>

2665
02:20:37.930 --> 02:20:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Like ecotourism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you giving back to the </v>

2666
02:20:42.930 --> 02:20:45.741
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the biodiversity of the place where </v>

2667
02:20:45.741 --> 02:20:45.741
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have your site,</v>

2668
02:20:45.741 --> 02:20:47.220
<v Speaker 3>how are you making sure that people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ceremony are safe,</v>

2669
02:20:47.610 --> 02:20:50.460
<v Speaker 3>that they're screen psychologically or </v>
<v Speaker 3>for heart conditions.</v>

2670
02:20:50.461 --> 02:20:55.461
<v Speaker 3>They're not tAking antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a people babysitting or </v>

2671
02:20:55.461 --> 02:21:00.231
<v Speaker 3>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people don't wander off into the </v>

2672
02:21:00.231 --> 02:21:00.231
<v Speaker 3>jungle.</v>

2673
02:21:00.231 --> 02:21:00.231
<v Speaker 1>The antidepressants wants is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting one.</v>

2674
02:21:00.231 --> 02:21:01.200
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the issue with that?</v>

2675
02:21:02.290 --> 02:21:07.290
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the issue with antidepressants and </v>

2676
02:21:07.290 --> 02:21:10.170
<v Speaker 7>iowasca is [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 7>Iowasca involves mao inhibitors,</v>

2677
02:21:11.381 --> 02:21:13.060
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so,</v>

2678
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:14.430
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2679
02:21:15.550 --> 02:21:18.610
<v Speaker 7>it prevents the breakdown of dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2680
02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:23.640
<v Speaker 7>And the butt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so there's a lot of dmt in your </v>

2681
02:21:24.251 --> 02:21:26.860
<v Speaker 7>suit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a serotonergic agonist,</v>

2682
02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:30.280
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so are the antidepressants.</v>

2683
02:21:30.310 --> 02:21:35.310
<v Speaker 7>So you are essentially piling on one </v>
<v Speaker 7>sarah to nurture agonist on another </v>

2684
02:21:36.650 --> 02:21:38.830
<v Speaker 7>cause you're inhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the breakdown process,</v>

2685
02:21:38.831 --> 02:21:43.060
<v Speaker 7>man is involved in breaking down both </v>
<v Speaker 7>dmt and serotonin,</v>

2686
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:46.120
<v Speaker 7>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the safety wise,</v>

2687
02:21:46.121 --> 02:21:49.990
<v Speaker 7>the issue is that it could lead to </v>
<v Speaker 7>what's called a serotonin syndrome.</v>

2688
02:21:50.440 --> 02:21:55.440
<v Speaker 7>And the serotonin syndrome is something </v>
<v Speaker 7>that happens when you got too much </v>

2689
02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:55.780
<v Speaker 7>serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>too much,</v>

2690
02:21:56.530 --> 02:21:57.250
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2691
02:21:58.780 --> 02:22:03.780
<v Speaker 7>pushing the serotonin button a little </v>
<v Speaker 7>bit too hard and it can lead to </v>

2692
02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:07.680
<v Speaker 7>hyperthermia and a cardiac,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your regularities and,</v>

2693
02:22:07.681 --> 02:22:10.210
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ultimately death if it's really bad,</v>

2694
02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:13.810
<v Speaker 7>you want to avoid the serotonin syndrome</v>
<v Speaker 7>if possible.</v>

2695
02:22:13.850 --> 02:22:18.850
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating because that's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue that people have if they take </v>

2696
02:22:18.850 --> 02:22:22.360
<v Speaker 1>an ssri and they want to consume </v>
<v Speaker 1>tryptophan or five htp.</v>

2697
02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:23.990
<v Speaker 7>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

2698
02:22:24.050 --> 02:22:29.050
<v Speaker 7>That's also a one way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And in some ways the psychedelic </v>

2699
02:22:29.050 --> 02:22:31.980
<v Speaker 7>experience itself is kind of skirting </v>
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

2700
02:22:31.981 --> 02:22:32.590
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

2701
02:22:32.980 --> 02:22:35.580
<v Speaker 7>you're pushing the serotonin button,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2702
02:22:35.610 --> 02:22:40.610
<v Speaker 7>But in most cases with psychedelic you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you haven't inactivated the instamatic </v>

2703
02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:46.620
<v Speaker 7>breaks that are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that are metabolizing this stuff.</v>

2704
02:22:46.621 --> 02:22:49.350
<v Speaker 7>So It's not an issue with iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

2705
02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:54.920
<v Speaker 7>it's really only an issue if you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>taking an ssri or if you're taking mao </v>

2706
02:22:56.221 --> 02:22:59.070
<v Speaker 7>inhibitors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which most people,</v>

2707
02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:04.280
<v Speaker 7>they're not used clinically anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was a whole older generation of </v>

2708
02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:07.040
<v Speaker 7>antidepressants that are mao inhibitors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You shouldn't,</v>

2709
02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:12.200
<v Speaker 7>you shouldn't combine those with iowasca</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you shouldn't combine ssrs with </v>

2710
02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:13.570
<v Speaker 7>iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

2711
02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:18.150
<v Speaker 7>that may be a theoretical hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>

2712
02:23:18.151 --> 02:23:23.151
<v Speaker 7>I haven't seen a lot of reports of </v>
<v Speaker 7>serotonin syndrome happening with </v>

2713
02:23:23.970 --> 02:23:25.860
<v Speaker 7>iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2714
02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:31.040
<v Speaker 7>but so it's a theoretical hazard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm sure there are people taking </v>

2715
02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:35.030
<v Speaker 7>serotonin uptake inhibitors that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>taking iowasca given there is no </v>

2716
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:38.220
<v Speaker 7>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they're probably taking lower doses.</v>

2717
02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:41.490
<v Speaker 7>It's just a good idea to get off those </v>
<v Speaker 7>things.</v>

2718
02:23:43.170 --> 02:23:48.170
<v Speaker 7>Before you take iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is it a good idea to get off those </v>

2719
02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:48.170
<v Speaker 7>things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>period?</v>

2720
02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:50.130
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean is if you can,</v>

2721
02:23:50.131 --> 02:23:53.400
<v Speaker 7>if not for every day really helped some </v>
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

2722
02:23:53.401 --> 02:23:55.770
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but a lot of times,</v>

2723
02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:57.000
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2724
02:23:57.060 --> 02:24:02.060
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>antidepressants are over prescribed and </v>

2725
02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:03.150
<v Speaker 7>overused for too many things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't,</v>

2726
02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:06.780
<v Speaker 7>they don't really help people get to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>root of their problems.</v>

2727
02:24:06.781 --> 02:24:11.220
<v Speaker 7>They just kind of bandaid it over and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you feel sort of normal,</v>

2728
02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:16.700
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you can be a productive citizen and </v>

2729
02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:16.700
<v Speaker 7>you don't really think about things too </v>
<v Speaker 7>much.</v>

2730
02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:18.870
<v Speaker 7>They're prescribed for ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2731
02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:23.900
<v Speaker 7>but they don't cure ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just kind of dampen it down and </v>

2732
02:24:25.370 --> 02:24:27.900
<v Speaker 7>bury it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't give you an opportunity,</v>

2733
02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:29.550
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to really,</v>

2734
02:24:29.790 --> 02:24:30.770
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2735
02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:36.080
<v Speaker 7>look at issues and work them through.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is why psychedelics or not a good </v>

2736
02:24:37.621 --> 02:24:39.060
<v Speaker 7>model for big pharma.</v>

2737
02:24:39.090 --> 02:24:44.090
<v Speaker 7>Big pharma wants things like ssri,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which you take everyday for the rest of </v>

2738
02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:45.750
<v Speaker 7>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the business model.</v>

2739
02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:51.140
<v Speaker 7>Psychedelics are things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 7>take a few times and work through your </v>

2740
02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:53.340
<v Speaker 7>issues and you don't need </v>
<v Speaker 7>antidepressants.</v>

2741
02:24:53.341 --> 02:24:57.210
<v Speaker 7>After that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've talked to many,</v>

2742
02:24:57.211 --> 02:24:58.860
<v Speaker 7>many people who said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2743
02:24:58.890 --> 02:25:02.100
<v Speaker 7>who have been on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They go to south America,</v>

2744
02:25:02.101 --> 02:25:07.101
<v Speaker 7>they take a few iowasca sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They never have to go back to </v>

2745
02:25:07.101 --> 02:25:08.670
<v Speaker 7>antidepressants again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2746
02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:13.500
<v Speaker 7>they can get off at for good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Many people have that experience.</v>

2747
02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:17.970
<v Speaker 7>That's a huge problem financially for </v>
<v Speaker 7>pharmaceutical companies as well.</v>

2748
02:25:17.971 --> 02:25:22.971
<v Speaker 7>You don't see him pilate on exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 7>they need to start selling iowasca yeah.</v>

2749
02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:29.140
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not gonna work that way because big</v>

2750
02:25:29.141 --> 02:25:31.840
<v Speaker 7>pharma,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they want drugs that people consume.</v>

2751
02:25:31.841 --> 02:25:34.810
<v Speaker 7>I think the way that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think one of the business model,</v>

2752
02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:40.380
<v Speaker 7>you can't use these drugs in therapy in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in a therapeutic session without intense</v>

2753
02:25:41.470 --> 02:25:43.750
<v Speaker 7>psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether,</v>

2754
02:25:43.810 --> 02:25:48.810
<v Speaker 7>whether that's actual psychotherapy or </v>
<v Speaker 7>shamanism or some combination of those </v>

2755
02:25:48.810 --> 02:25:53.551
<v Speaker 7>things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these are drugs that have to be used in </v>

2756
02:25:53.551 --> 02:25:53.551
<v Speaker 7>context,</v>
<v Speaker 7>know the,</v>

2757
02:25:53.551 --> 02:25:58.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the take two and call me in the morning </v>

2758
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.070
<v Speaker 7>model doesn't work for these.</v>

2759
02:25:58.070 --> 02:26:01.480
<v Speaker 7>These have to be used in a very highly </v>
<v Speaker 7>controlled set and setting.</v>

2760
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:04.270
<v Speaker 7>So I think where they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2761
02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:09.300
<v Speaker 7>where the business model come see it is </v>
<v Speaker 7>you have places where people can go and </v>

2762
02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:13.720
<v Speaker 7>get this kind of therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it shifts from the drug itself.</v>

2763
02:26:13.721 --> 02:26:14.700
<v Speaker 7>The emphasis is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2764
02:26:14.770 --> 02:26:15.620
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2765
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:20.670
<v Speaker 7>our whole biomedical industrial complex </v>
<v Speaker 7>is set up to encourage bandaid </v>

2766
02:26:22.541 --> 02:26:23.860
<v Speaker 7>solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2767
02:26:23.890 --> 02:26:26.470
<v Speaker 7>you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you go see your psychiatrist,</v>

2768
02:26:26.471 --> 02:26:29.260
<v Speaker 7>he has seven minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If he's lucky to talk to you,</v>

2769
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:31.840
<v Speaker 7>here's the prescription,</v>
<v Speaker 7>get out of here.</v>

2770
02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:37.160
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the way it works with </v>

2771
02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:37.160
<v Speaker 7>psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He actually have to have a therapist who</v>

2772
02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:41.581
<v Speaker 7>will sit down and talk with you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This whole novel concept and uh,</v>

2773
02:26:42.370 --> 02:26:47.370
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I think where the business potential </v>

2774
02:26:47.370 --> 02:26:50.341
<v Speaker 7>comes in is that to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to have centers of therapy where you </v>

2775
02:26:50.831 --> 02:26:55.831
<v Speaker 7>couldn't go and get psychedelic therapy </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the emphasis is more on the setting </v>

2776
02:26:56.591 --> 02:26:59.440
<v Speaker 7>and the services provided than the </v>
<v Speaker 7>actual chemicals.</v>

2777
02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The setting and the,</v>

2778
02:27:01.970 --> 02:27:02.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2779
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:07.550
<v Speaker 1>the new this is possible in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries where it's legal in America </v>

2780
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:10.560
<v Speaker 1>started happening in America right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge issue.</v>

2781
02:27:10.770 --> 02:27:15.770
<v Speaker 1>But josh was talking about selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>iowasca online.</v>

2782
02:27:16.410 --> 02:27:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people do that in?</v>

2783
02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:23.960
<v Speaker 1>What's the Legality when it comes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants themselves are not necessarily </v>

2784
02:27:24.691 --> 02:27:26.180
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2785
02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dmt is illegal.</v>

2786
02:27:29.390 --> 02:27:34.390
<v Speaker 7>Dmt is illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but dmt is found in so many plants that </v>

2787
02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:37.710
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2788
02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:43.680
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they can't really make all those plants </v>

2789
02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:43.680
<v Speaker 7>illegal because,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2790
02:27:44.190 --> 02:27:45.080
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they can,</v>

2791
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:46.880
<v Speaker 7>but they're not going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 7>enforce it.</v>

2792
02:27:46.890 --> 02:27:48.650
<v Speaker 7>Then it's going to be able to have </v>
<v Speaker 7>salad.</v>

2793
02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:54.460
<v Speaker 7>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not going to be able to have </v>

2794
02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:54.460
<v Speaker 7>salad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2795
02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:54.460
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2796
02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:59.200
<v Speaker 7>hearkening back to what we were saying </v>
<v Speaker 7>about how close dmt is to tryptofan two </v>

2797
02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:00.650
<v Speaker 7>steps away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll bet you,</v>

2798
02:28:01.310 --> 02:28:01.790
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2799
02:28:01.791 --> 02:28:04.250
<v Speaker 7>I wish somebody would do this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no funding for this,</v>

2800
02:28:04.251 --> 02:28:07.670
<v Speaker 7>but I'll bet you if you had sufficiently</v>
<v Speaker 7>sensitive instruments,</v>

2801
02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:12.140
<v Speaker 7>you could find dmt in all plants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2802
02:28:12.141 --> 02:28:17.141
<v Speaker 7>you could just start randomly selecting </v>
<v Speaker 7>them out of your backyard and run them </v>

2803
02:28:17.141 --> 02:28:19.580
<v Speaker 7>through the mass spec or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could pick up dmt.</v>

2804
02:28:19.850 --> 02:28:24.850
<v Speaker 7>Not in usable amounts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's universally just nature is </v>

2805
02:28:24.850 --> 02:28:25.690
<v Speaker 7>drenched in dia.</v>

2806
02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:29.660
<v Speaker 7>Why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because it's so close to trip to fan,</v>

2807
02:28:30.650 --> 02:28:31.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's just the,</v>

2808
02:28:31.950 --> 02:28:36.020
<v Speaker 7>the compound tryptofan is universally </v>
<v Speaker 7>distributed.</v>

2809
02:28:36.530 --> 02:28:41.510
<v Speaker 7>The enzymes that transform it to dmt </v>
<v Speaker 7>have other cellular functions.</v>

2810
02:28:41.511 --> 02:28:46.511
<v Speaker 7>So they're found in all cells.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're just part of metabolism and so </v>

2811
02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:50.090
<v Speaker 7>it's just an accident of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

2812
02:28:50.091 --> 02:28:52.280
<v Speaker 7>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just the way it is.</v>

2813
02:28:52.730 --> 02:28:57.730
<v Speaker 7>What a fascinating war.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's actually maybe nature's trying to </v>

2814
02:28:57.730 --> 02:29:01.220
<v Speaker 7>send us on a little message if you want </v>
<v Speaker 7>to interpret it that way,</v>

2815
02:29:01.221 --> 02:29:06.221
<v Speaker 7>but it's just the way it is or it's just</v>
<v Speaker 7>a part of the building blocks of the </v>

2816
02:29:06.221 --> 02:29:08.090
<v Speaker 7>universe itself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Part of the building blocks of.</v>

2817
02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:09.740
<v Speaker 7>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

2818
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:14.830
<v Speaker 7>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that chemical doorway to another </v>

2819
02:29:14.830 --> 02:29:14.900
<v Speaker 7>dimension exists in virtually everything</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's alive.</v>

2820
02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:19.720
<v Speaker 7>What a mind fuck that is selling iowasca</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2821
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:21.950
<v Speaker 7>online.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if uh,</v>

2822
02:29:22.130 --> 02:29:27.130
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if people are selling </v>
<v Speaker 7>iowasca prepared a iowasca bruce online </v>

2823
02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:33.770
<v Speaker 7>are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>seems to be the kid in a gray area.</v>

2824
02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:37.380
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's irresponsible because.</v>

2825
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:40.010
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because it's a,</v>

2826
02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:44.540
<v Speaker 7>it's a drug that needs to be taken and </v>
<v Speaker 7>an appropriate sentence setting.</v>

2827
02:29:44.570 --> 02:29:49.570
<v Speaker 7>It needs guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So to sell it online is to be guilty of </v>

2828
02:29:52.281 --> 02:29:55.280
<v Speaker 7>that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Take two and call me in the morning,</v>

2829
02:29:55.310 --> 02:30:00.310
<v Speaker 7>go off and do this with your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well that's what went out in the </v>

2830
02:30:00.310 --> 02:30:02.490
<v Speaker 7>operation and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the any real knowledge.</v>

2831
02:30:02.491 --> 02:30:05.610
<v Speaker 7>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not ethical in mind</v>

2832
02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:10.660
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how five mio is acquired until </v>

2833
02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:11.790
<v Speaker 1>fairly recently when I bought five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2834
02:30:11.791 --> 02:30:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just bought it online.</v>

2835
02:30:13.150 --> 02:30:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just delivered me enough to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world high.</v>

2836
02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:16.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a little,</v>

2837
02:30:16.780 --> 02:30:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize how potent it is and what a </v>

2838
02:30:21.780 --> 02:30:24.121
<v Speaker 1>small dose he need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're sending you some giant </v>

2839
02:30:24.121 --> 02:30:24.121
<v Speaker 1>supply of it,</v>

2840
02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:27.960
<v Speaker 7>well that's an issue with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with all of these things and the whole,</v>

2841
02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:30.300
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the whole designer drug thing,</v>

2842
02:30:30.301 --> 02:30:32.270
<v Speaker 7>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2843
02:30:32.310 --> 02:30:36.630
<v Speaker 7>hundreds and hundreds of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I sort of say,</v>

2844
02:30:36.631 --> 02:30:37.450
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2845
02:30:37.560 --> 02:30:42.560
<v Speaker 7>we should stick with the plants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At least we know what the identity of </v>

2846
02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:42.560
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

2847
02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:43.140
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2848
02:30:44.490 --> 02:30:45.900
<v Speaker 7>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2849
02:30:45.901 --> 02:30:48.510
<v Speaker 7>synthetic drugs are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People are going to use them.</v>

2850
02:30:48.511 --> 02:30:49.980
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

2851
02:30:49.981 --> 02:30:50.530
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

2852
02:30:50.540 --> 02:30:55.540
<v Speaker 7>it comes back to education,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to teach people how to,</v>

2853
02:30:57.630 --> 02:31:02.630
<v Speaker 7>how to use drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Basically you have to teach people how </v>

2854
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:06.231
<v Speaker 7>to use drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is what so called drug education </v>

2855
02:31:06.231 --> 02:31:06.231
<v Speaker 7>has,</v>
<v Speaker 7>won't quite,</v>

2856
02:31:07.170 --> 02:31:09.960
<v Speaker 7>hasn't quite grok to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hasn't quite admitted,</v>

2857
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:13.020
<v Speaker 7>but that is in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's real drug education,</v>

2858
02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:14.300
<v Speaker 7>not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2859
02:31:14.580 --> 02:31:16.650
<v Speaker 7>all drugs are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Never take it.</v>

2860
02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:18.450
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's absurd.</v>

2861
02:31:18.451 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 7>That's now you've</v>

2862
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:23.700
<v Speaker 1>lived through several errors of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic awareness.</v>

2863
02:31:23.701 --> 02:31:27.570
<v Speaker 1>you lived through the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live through all that craziness.</v>

2864
02:31:27.571 --> 02:31:31.500
<v Speaker 1>He lived through the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lived through the clamp down and now</v>

2865
02:31:31.501 --> 02:31:32.610
<v Speaker 1>you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2866
02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's safe to call this the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic renaissance.</v>

2867
02:31:36.211 --> 02:31:41.211
<v Speaker 1>I think this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new time when we'd like to </v>

2868
02:31:41.211 --> 02:31:41.211
<v Speaker 1>think so I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty positive.</v>

2869
02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:46.020
<v Speaker 1>At least it isn't my reality there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality that I experienced,</v>

2870
02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've never in my time seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics more reference than I see </v>

2871
02:31:51.560 --> 02:31:55.920
<v Speaker 1>them today and part of it's because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company I keep part of it is because the</v>

2872
02:31:55.921 --> 02:31:59.040
<v Speaker 1>message that I put out and the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I interact with because of that,</v>

2873
02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:02.130
<v Speaker 1>but I think also it's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of the cat got out of</v>

2874
02:32:02.131 --> 02:32:03.420
<v Speaker 1>the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stigma</v>

2875
02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:08.530
<v Speaker 7>is fading away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The whole sixties baggage that </v>

2876
02:32:08.530 --> 02:32:12.790
<v Speaker 7>psychedelics have been have been </v>
<v Speaker 7>marginalized with for so long that's </v>

2877
02:32:12.951 --> 02:32:17.951
<v Speaker 7>going away and a new more positive </v>
<v Speaker 7>perception is appearing as some of these</v>

2878
02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:24.040
<v Speaker 7>therapeutic uses are becoming more aware</v>
<v Speaker 7>in general consciousness.</v>

2879
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:28.220
<v Speaker 7>So ptsd can be treated with mds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mtma.</v>

2880
02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:30.980
<v Speaker 7>We've got veterans out there who need </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

2881
02:32:31.010 --> 02:32:35.870
<v Speaker 7>That's a hugely powerful message and if </v>
<v Speaker 7>the department of defense is behind it,</v>

2882
02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:37.880
<v Speaker 7>it can't be bad.</v>

2883
02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2884
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:43.790
<v Speaker 1>isn't that kind of ironic that the need </v>
<v Speaker 1>for psychedelics has arisen from the war</v>

2885
02:32:44.531 --> 02:32:48.100
<v Speaker 1>culture that we totally ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so strange.</v>

2886
02:32:48.101 --> 02:32:48.850
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

2887
02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:54.100
<v Speaker 7>And so these positive messages are being</v>
<v Speaker 7>hurt more and more and there's less and </v>

2888
02:32:55.351 --> 02:32:57.960
<v Speaker 7>less a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2889
02:32:58.830 --> 02:33:03.830
<v Speaker 7>partly because a lot of people from the </v>
<v Speaker 7>sixties are dying off or whatever they </v>

2890
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:07.230
<v Speaker 7>don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the knee jerk negative message about</v>

2891
02:33:07.231 --> 02:33:10.830
<v Speaker 7>psychedelics is not happening this </v>
<v Speaker 7>month.</v>

2892
02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2893
02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:16.780
<v Speaker 1>they're much harder to distinguish now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The folks who use them then the hippies </v>

2894
02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:18.680
<v Speaker 1>with the beads and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2895
02:33:18.681 --> 02:33:19.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2896
02:33:19.081 --> 02:33:22.800
<v Speaker 1>the look which was so stereotypical of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2897
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:28.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goldwater republicans found </v>

2898
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:30.720
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible about that generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were lazy,</v>

2899
02:33:30.750 --> 02:33:35.750
<v Speaker 1>shiftless do for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that just wanted to get high and </v>

2900
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.750
<v Speaker 1>escape reality and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2901
02:33:36.030 --> 02:33:39.990
<v Speaker 1>that paradigm that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that perception is passing.</v>

2902
02:33:40.090 --> 02:33:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all to the good.</v>

2903
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:44.820
<v Speaker 1>What has it been like for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience these different waves?</v>

2904
02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:48.270
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2905
02:33:51.130 --> 02:33:56.130
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I haven'T really been personally </v>

2906
02:33:56.130 --> 02:33:57.350
<v Speaker 7>impacted by this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this thing,</v>

2907
02:33:57.410 --> 02:33:58.040
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2908
02:33:58.090 --> 02:34:03.090
<v Speaker 7>I've been where I've been all the way </v>
<v Speaker 7>through and not particularly public.</v>

2909
02:34:03.891 --> 02:34:06.680
<v Speaker 7>I'm much more public now about it than I</v>
<v Speaker 7>have been.</v>

2910
02:34:06.681 --> 02:34:08.720
<v Speaker 7>So I may,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe that's a difference.</v>

2911
02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:14.160
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't feel that I have to be </v>

2912
02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:16.520
<v Speaker 7>careful about talking about it in </v>
<v Speaker 7>public.</v>

2913
02:34:16.521 --> 02:34:17.060
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

2914
02:34:17.770 --> 02:34:21.370
<v Speaker 7>I consider myself an advocate for </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsible use,</v>

2915
02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:23.380
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and good science.</v>

2916
02:34:23.381 --> 02:34:26.770
<v Speaker 7>And I'm not even saying people should </v>
<v Speaker 7>even take these things take,</v>

2917
02:34:26.910 --> 02:34:29.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what I'm saying is that if you decide to</v>

2918
02:34:29.591 --> 02:34:32.020
<v Speaker 7>take it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go into it with open eyes,</v>

2919
02:34:32.410 --> 02:34:37.410
<v Speaker 7>do some preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pay attention to set and setting do it </v>

2920
02:34:37.410 --> 02:34:38.030
<v Speaker 7>in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2921
02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:41.200
<v Speaker 7>if there are benefits to be had </v>
<v Speaker 7>maximized the benefit.</v>

2922
02:34:41.201 --> 02:34:46.201
<v Speaker 7>So approach it as a conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a conscious exercise and uh,</v>

2923
02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:49.930
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2924
02:34:50.050 --> 02:34:50.740
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2925
02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:54.040
<v Speaker 7>and approach them with respect and in </v>
<v Speaker 7>intention.</v>

2926
02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:55.510
<v Speaker 7>These are serious thing.</v>

2927
02:34:55.820 --> 02:34:59.750
<v Speaker 1>What do you say to someone who has zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and he thinks I'm gay.</v>

2928
02:34:59.751 --> 02:35:04.751
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you right now this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>is reaching people that have no </v>

2929
02:35:04.910 --> 02:35:09.910
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experience whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know anyone who has had any </v>

2930
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:14.381
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know where to turn or where </v>

2931
02:35:14.381 --> 02:35:16.901
<v Speaker 1>to start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're very intrigued and the </v>

2932
02:35:16.901 --> 02:35:16.901
<v Speaker 1>door's been open to them.</v>

2933
02:35:16.901 --> 02:35:20.630
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the first thing to do is get yourself </v>

2934
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.630
<v Speaker 7>educated about it,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2937
02:35:27.001 --> 02:35:32.001
<v Speaker 7>another group that I love to plug and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>think they're doing a marvelous work is </v>

<v Speaker 7>information about psychoactive drugs,</v>

2940

<v Speaker 7>If you want real solid information,</v>

2942

2943
02:35:53.311 --> 02:35:58.311
<v Speaker 7>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whose commitment is to accurate </v>

2946
02:36:00.330 --> 02:36:05.330
<v Speaker 7>There are trip reports,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there were safety reports that </v>

2947
02:36:05.330 --> 02:36:05.370
<v Speaker 7>chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2948
02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:06.120
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2949
02:36:06.121 --> 02:36:08.490
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the field botany,</v>

2950
02:36:08.491 --> 02:36:11.280
<v Speaker 7>the part of it that the shamanic </v>
<v Speaker 7>traditions,</v>

2951
02:36:11.281 --> 02:36:16.281
<v Speaker 7>it's all represented there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the place to start spelling out </v>

2952
02:36:16.281 --> 02:36:19.470
<v Speaker 7>to for p,</v>
<v Speaker 7>r o w id erowid.org.</v>

2953
02:36:19.830 --> 02:36:24.830
<v Speaker 7>Go there and read up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Educate yourself before you take the </v>

2954
02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:27.630
<v Speaker 7>substance so that you can make an </v>
<v Speaker 7>informed decision,</v>

2955
02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:32.100
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's an appropriate method of use?</v>

2956
02:36:32.430 --> 02:36:34.980
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what are the right circumstances?</v>

2957
02:36:34.981 --> 02:36:38.700
<v Speaker 7>What are the hazards?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you not want to do?</v>

2958
02:36:39.570 --> 02:36:41.120
<v Speaker 7>I think that's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I,</v>

2959
02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:42.060
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>

2960
02:36:42.061 --> 02:36:47.040
<v Speaker 7>I think this symposium,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a conference is gonna be great,</v>

2961
02:36:47.070 --> 02:36:49.920
<v Speaker 7>but it's also exemplary of what needs to</v>
<v Speaker 7>happen.</v>

2962
02:36:49.921 --> 02:36:52.620
<v Speaker 7>And I'm really impressed that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2963
02:36:53.100 --> 02:36:58.100
<v Speaker 7>young people like the folks that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>organizing this conference or are </v>

2964
02:36:58.100 --> 02:37:02.451
<v Speaker 7>stepping up to the plate and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we want to make this a part of </v>

2965
02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:07.050
<v Speaker 7>education,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an educational dialogue.</v>

2966
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:11.310
<v Speaker 7>We want to have this happen on lots of </v>
<v Speaker 7>university campuses.</v>

2967
02:37:11.311 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 7>Lots of places.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing we have better now than</v>

2968
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:18.380
<v Speaker 4>we've ever had for sharing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

2969
02:37:18.860 --> 02:37:21.300
<v Speaker 4>Take advantage of those tools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before back in the sixties,</v>

2971
02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:28.901
<v Speaker 4>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might not have had no experience </v>

2972
02:37:28.901 --> 02:37:31.640
<v Speaker 4>with psychedelics and no real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2973
02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:36.700

<v Speaker 4>educating yourself.</v>

2984
02:38:11.610 --> 02:38:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a good friend who had a back </v>

2985
02:38:16.610 --> 02:38:18.921
<v Speaker 1>injury and got hooked on pain pills and </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a real problem and really couldn't </v>

2986
02:38:18.921 --> 02:38:18.921
<v Speaker 1>kick it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2987
02:38:18.921 --> 02:38:21.090
<v Speaker 1>wenT to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did ibogaine,</v>

2988
02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:25.320
<v Speaker 1>became completely fascinated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cured,</v>

2989
02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:30.500
<v Speaker 1>and absolutely fascinated by obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how is this possible that this is </v>

2990
02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:32.430
<v Speaker 1>escape?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western medicine started his own.</v>

2991
02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became a center down there and now,</v>

2992
02:38:35.970 --> 02:38:36.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular.</v>

2993
02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just a different human being.</v>

2994
02:38:38.731 --> 02:38:41.130
<v Speaker 1>When I talked to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just so at peace and just,</v>

2995
02:38:41.410 --> 02:38:44.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows himself in a different way.</v>

2996
02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:49.420
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>it breaks that physical addiction to </v>

2997
02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:52.231
<v Speaker 3>opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instantly the esc is of signing a </v>

2998
02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:58.500
<v Speaker 3>memorandum of understanding with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>global ibogaine therapists alliance to </v>

2999
02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:02.671
<v Speaker 3>work on the safety and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainability of that traditional </v>

3000
02:39:02.671 --> 02:39:05.881
<v Speaker 3>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's under extreme pressure from the </v>

3001
02:39:05.881 --> 02:39:09.660
<v Speaker 3>growing global demand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's traditionally from africa and it </v>

3002
02:39:09.660 --> 02:39:12.901
<v Speaker 3>takes seven years for a mature plant to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be grown and then you have to take the </v>

3003
02:39:13.331 --> 02:39:15.640
<v Speaker 3>root out and you kill the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3004
02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:17.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of Work to be done.</v>

3005
02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

3006
02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:22.660
<v Speaker 3>a global ibogaine therapist alliance </v>
<v Speaker 3>conference in durban,</v>

3007
02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:27.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this may as well we're hoping to have </v>

3008
02:39:27.940 --> 02:39:29.200
<v Speaker 3>some big announcements come out of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the sustainability front.</v>

3009
02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:31.750
<v Speaker 4>So many things came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3010
02:39:32.130 --> 02:39:36.400
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it never went away.</v>

3011
02:39:36.401 --> 02:39:38.320
<v Speaker 4>It was always there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it a,</v>

3012
02:39:38.350 --> 02:39:41.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was suppressed essentially in western</v>

3013
02:39:41.591 --> 02:39:45.010
<v Speaker 4>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they had a perception that it had</v>

3014
02:39:45.011 --> 02:39:50.011
<v Speaker 4>no place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were almost clinical studies </v>

3015
02:39:50.011 --> 02:39:52.830
<v Speaker 4>approved by the fda and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>stepped back from it because of some </v>

3016
02:39:52.830 --> 02:39:57.540
<v Speaker 4>supposedly neuro toxicity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't think they ever </v>

3017
02:39:57.540 --> 02:39:58.990
<v Speaker 4>satisfactorily demonstrated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's a good example.</v>

3018
02:39:59.020 --> 02:40:01.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the therapeutic community was saying,</v>

3019
02:40:01.991 --> 02:40:06.991
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave is so useful for this addiction </v>

3020
02:40:06.991 --> 02:40:08.320
<v Speaker 4>therapy that we're just not gonna put up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this.</v>

3021
02:40:08.321 --> 02:40:12.220
<v Speaker 4>and so I began as not illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's illegal in the states,</v>

3022
02:40:12.221 --> 02:40:17.221
<v Speaker 4>but it's not in most of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these addiction treatment centers </v>

3023
02:40:17.731 --> 02:40:21.240
<v Speaker 4>have blossomed all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's Mexico,</v>

3024
02:40:21.241 --> 02:40:23.260
<v Speaker 4>south America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even Canada.</v>

3025
02:40:23.300 --> 02:40:28.300
<v Speaker 4>There are treatment centers that use </v>
<v Speaker 4>ibogaine to treat addiction and they've </v>

3026
02:40:28.381 --> 02:40:29.100
<v Speaker 4>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3027
02:40:29.130 --> 02:40:30.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck the fda,</v>

3028
02:40:30.451 --> 02:40:35.451
<v Speaker 4>we're going to step outside that </v>
<v Speaker 4>framework and do it because it's </v>

3029
02:40:35.451 --> 02:40:39.120
<v Speaker 4>important to get this therapy to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's all to the good.</v>

3030
02:40:39.121 --> 02:40:42.600
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a model maybe for what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to happen with iowasca.</v>

3031
02:40:43.010 --> 02:40:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hope so.</v>

3032
02:40:44.211 --> 02:40:49.211
<v Speaker 1>And I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see what's going on </v>

3033
02:40:49.211 --> 02:40:49.211
<v Speaker 1>right now with marijuana in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

3034
02:40:49.211 --> 02:40:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Slowly started happening with iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ibogaine,</v>

3035
02:40:50.910 --> 02:40:52.120
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

3036
02:40:52.121 --> 02:40:54.110
<v Speaker 1>all these various things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3037
02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:55.490
<v Speaker 1>do you have hope for that?</v>

3038
02:40:56.640 --> 02:40:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

3039
02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:01.950
<v Speaker 3>History is on our side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And first thing I'd tell people that are</v>

3040
02:41:01.951 --> 02:41:06.951
<v Speaker 3>considering psychedelics is put your </v>
<v Speaker 3>preconceptions aside and just look at </v>

3041
02:41:06.951 --> 02:41:07.800
<v Speaker 3>the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you say that</v>

3042
02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:08.860
<v Speaker 1>someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3043
02:41:08.890 --> 02:41:12.490
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if a guy's 50 and you know,</v>

3044
02:41:12.491 --> 02:41:15.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's going through a rough divorce</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3045
02:41:15.331 --> 02:41:15.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3046
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:18.730
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking I need to reset my brain.</v>

3047
02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I need to figure this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know anybody.</v>

3048
02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Nobody at the office knows anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this stuff.</v>

3049
02:41:26.020 --> 02:41:27.310
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3050
02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:31.060
<v Speaker 4>a smoked a joint in college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's about it.</v>

3051
02:41:32.300 --> 02:41:36.220
<v Speaker 3>Take it in a traditional context that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel comfortable with.</v>

3052
02:41:36.250 --> 02:41:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Take it in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're looking for psychological </v>

3053
02:41:41.250 --> 02:41:44.371
<v Speaker 3>help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe take it at a center that focuses </v>

3054
02:41:44.371 --> 02:41:46.681
<v Speaker 3>on that if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've always been attracted to </v>

3055
02:41:46.681 --> 02:41:49.831
<v Speaker 3>shamanic experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then suss out which centers might be </v>

3056
02:41:49.831 --> 02:41:53.881
<v Speaker 3>best for you and read revIews of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in two to three years the esc will </v>

3057
02:41:54.431 --> 02:41:59.431
<v Speaker 3>have a rating system or kind of star </v>
<v Speaker 3>rating system for sites based on how </v>

3058
02:41:59.431 --> 02:42:02.740
<v Speaker 3>sustainable they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how safe side psychedelics is.</v>

3059
02:42:02.741 --> 02:42:07.741
<v Speaker 3>Not so much a yelp or a deeper level </v>
<v Speaker 3>than a yelp because they can't fake it </v>

3060
02:42:08.231 --> 02:42:13.231
<v Speaker 3>though you can't take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard for somebody going in to </v>

3061
02:42:13.231 --> 02:42:16.771
<v Speaker 3>see what kind of an impact a center has </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the local community or where they're </v>

3062
02:42:16.771 --> 02:42:19.480
<v Speaker 3>sourcing the iowasca come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from and that's where we're,</v>

3063
02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:22.600
<v Speaker 3>the esc is bringing that professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>expertise to,</v>

3064
02:42:22.770 --> 02:42:24.820
<v Speaker 3>to supplement what the community is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

3065
02:42:25.390 --> 02:42:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and certainly we will rely on feedback </v>

3066
02:42:30.390 --> 02:42:34.591
<v Speaker 3>from visitors that will be part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>credibility and the transparency that </v>

3067
02:42:34.591 --> 02:42:38.131
<v Speaker 3>we're building into the way of assuring </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sites are sustainable and safe or be</v>

3068
02:42:39.011 --> 02:42:41.710
<v Speaker 3>grievance mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a bad experience,</v>

3069
02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:44.670
<v Speaker 4>hopefully in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>

3070
02:42:44.790 --> 02:42:49.790
<v Speaker 4>that's probably optimistic timeframe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hopefully in 10 years they'll be </v>

3071
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:53.990
<v Speaker 4>places you can go and have these </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences where you don't have to </v>

3072
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.300
<v Speaker 4>leave the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3073
02:42:54.301 --> 02:42:56.970
<v Speaker 4>you can already find them outside the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

3074
02:42:56.971 --> 02:43:00.480
<v Speaker 4>but it would be nice if there were </v>
<v Speaker 4>places in the states where you could get</v>

3075
02:43:00.481 --> 02:43:05.481
<v Speaker 4>this and it would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would transform a psychiatric </v>

3076
02:43:05.481 --> 02:43:05.700
<v Speaker 4>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3077
02:43:05.930 --> 02:43:07.920
<v Speaker 4>if there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is again,</v>

3078
02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:11.560
<v Speaker 4>threatening to many people with a stake </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole estate</v>

3079
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:15.760
<v Speaker 7>in how it's done now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I talked to so many,</v>

3080
02:43:15.810 --> 02:43:17.770
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>psychiatrists,</v>

3081
02:43:17.771 --> 02:43:21.460
<v Speaker 7>other professionals that are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 7>the mental health world.</v>

3082
02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:23.680
<v Speaker 7>They're very frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

3083
02:43:23.681 --> 02:43:28.681
<v Speaker 7>say these people are hurting and the way</v>
<v Speaker 7>that we're handling them is not solving </v>

3084
02:43:29.711 --> 02:43:31.870
<v Speaker 7>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's only making it worse.</v>

3085
02:43:32.530 --> 02:43:34.270
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>

3086
02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:38.020
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there needs to be a wholesale,</v>

3087
02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:42.130
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't say overturning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but transformation of the model.</v>

3088
02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:45.040
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3089
02:43:45.730 --> 02:43:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're on the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

3090
02:43:48.221 --> 02:43:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are cynical</v>

3091
02:43:49.811 --> 02:43:54.160
<v Speaker 1>today and they look at today's culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they look at the toxification of our</v>

3092
02:43:54.161 --> 02:43:57.670
<v Speaker 1>environment and the materialism and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense on television.</v>

3093
02:43:57.940 --> 02:44:00.300
<v Speaker 1>They see it as a bad sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3094
02:44:00.301 --> 02:44:05.301
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really feel like civilizations </v>

3095
02:44:05.301 --> 02:44:05.301
<v Speaker 1>cramming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3096
02:44:05.301 --> 02:44:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think we're just scrambling to </v>

3097
02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:11.221
<v Speaker 1>try and maybe we need something like all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this nonsense that we experience on a </v>

3098
02:44:11.221 --> 02:44:13.950
<v Speaker 1>daily basis to sort of really motivate </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3099
02:44:14.010 --> 02:44:15.640
<v Speaker 1>this global awakening.</v>

3100
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:18.880
<v Speaker 7>We have to consume it to the extent that</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're sick of it,</v>

3101
02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:23.940
<v Speaker 7>that it makes us sick,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then we purge the iowasca bottle.</v>

3102
02:44:24.281 --> 02:44:29.281
<v Speaker 7>We consume so much of it that eventually</v>
<v Speaker 7>you just regurgitate it all and you feel</v>

3103
02:44:29.831 --> 02:44:31.730
<v Speaker 7>much better afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

3104
02:44:32.450 --> 02:44:36.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's partly what we're doing.</v>

3105
02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I think the most exciting thing too is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have a way out or we have a way </v>

3106
02:44:41.891 --> 02:44:44.650
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like it's not like we're in this</v>

3107
02:44:44.651 --> 02:44:47.030
<v Speaker 1>pit and there's no ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a fucking lie.</v>

3108
02:44:47.090 --> 02:44:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

3109
02:44:49.210 --> 02:44:50.680
<v Speaker 1>we have the tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3110
02:44:50.681 --> 02:44:53.680
<v Speaker 1>and they're incredibly profound and </v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

3111
02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these aren't theoretical things like,</v>

3112
02:44:56.290 --> 02:45:01.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of these theoretical </v>

3113
02:45:01.290 --> 02:45:01.420
<v Speaker 1>concepts about like fixing the plastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ocean.</v>

3114
02:45:01.450 --> 02:45:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3115
02:45:02.111 --> 02:45:05.140
<v Speaker 1>some 19 year old kid figured out a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a machine.</v>

3116
02:45:05.141 --> 02:45:10.141
<v Speaker 1>It scoops it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it converts it into something </v>

3117
02:45:10.141 --> 02:45:10.141
<v Speaker 1>usable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we could use that for energy.</v>

3118
02:45:10.141 --> 02:45:11.680
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing's true with nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>waste.</v>

3119
02:45:11.681 --> 02:45:14.020
<v Speaker 1>There's some theories about how to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those are all.</v>

3120
02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Those are theoretical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may or may not be effective.</v>

3121
02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:23.220
<v Speaker 1>They may or may not ever get built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ladder is not be in your life right </v>

3122
02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:23.470
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3123
02:45:23.740 --> 02:45:24.470
<v Speaker 7>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3124
02:45:24.500 --> 02:45:26.870
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in respect to that,</v>

3125
02:45:27.170 --> 02:45:29.990
<v Speaker 7>we look at this dire existential </v>
<v Speaker 7>situation,</v>

3126
02:45:29.991 --> 02:45:34.991
<v Speaker 7>the environmental crisis and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I take heart in the notion of never </v>

3127
02:45:35.181 --> 02:45:38.450
<v Speaker 7>underestimate human ingenuity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3128
02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:43.510
<v Speaker 7>there are a lot of really smart people </v>
<v Speaker 7>working on all these problems and that's</v>

3129
02:45:45.410 --> 02:45:46.870
<v Speaker 7>my hope,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3130
02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:51.860
<v Speaker 7>for our survival,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that the ingenuity will prevail.</v>

3131
02:45:51.861 --> 02:45:53.930
<v Speaker 7>I hope so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because otherwise we're in.</v>

3132
02:45:54.380 --> 02:45:56.150
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're already in deep shit.</v>

3133
02:45:56.180 --> 02:45:58.940
<v Speaker 7>The question is how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do we dig out of it?</v>

3134
02:45:59.180 --> 02:46:00.240
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

3135
02:46:00.370 --> 02:46:01.340
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

3136
02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:05.030
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's why we have these smart brains,</v>

3137
02:46:05.031 --> 02:46:10.031
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're not going to get there by being </v>

3138
02:46:10.031 --> 02:46:11.741
<v Speaker 7>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've had of that and there's still </v>

3139
02:46:11.741 --> 02:46:15.290
<v Speaker 7>plenty of it to go around and.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But we need to move beyond that,</v>

3140
02:46:15.390 --> 02:46:18.800
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>stop listening to a lot of people,</v>

3141
02:46:18.801 --> 02:46:20.930
<v Speaker 7>like our politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

3142
02:46:21.260 --> 02:46:26.260
<v Speaker 7>who seemed to make a profession of </v>
<v Speaker 7>stupidity and they're actually proud of </v>

3143
02:46:26.691 --> 02:46:27.650
<v Speaker 7>their stupidity.</v>

3144
02:46:27.650 --> 02:46:32.650
<v Speaker 7>And that's distressing in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In what way do you feel like that would </v>

3145
02:46:32.650 --> 02:46:34.100
<v Speaker 7>be like sarah palin mean people like </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

3146
02:46:34.101 --> 02:46:35.810
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the science deniers,</v>

3147
02:46:35.811 --> 02:46:37.060
<v Speaker 7>the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3148
02:46:37.100 --> 02:46:37.850
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3149
02:46:37.851 --> 02:46:40.850
<v Speaker 7>don't bother me with your fucking facts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3150
02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:44.990
<v Speaker 7>my mind is made up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when god told me this and you know,</v>

3151
02:46:45.050 --> 02:46:46.430
<v Speaker 7>this is horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3152
02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:47.930
<v Speaker 7>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3153
02:46:48.380 --> 02:46:53.380
<v Speaker 7>clear thinking at least should be a </v>
<v Speaker 7>criteria and if you want to be a </v>

3154
02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:54.730
<v Speaker 7>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not somebody who's,</v>

3155
02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:57.560
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a buying into some,</v>

3156
02:46:57.620 --> 02:47:02.620
<v Speaker 7>some myth from the 14th century.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't necessarily even think most of </v>

3157
02:47:02.620 --> 02:47:07.361
<v Speaker 7>them are buying into it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think what they've done is realize </v>

3158
02:47:07.361 --> 02:47:10.391
<v Speaker 7>that there is a market for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's just a gigantic chunk of the </v>

3159
02:47:10.391 --> 02:47:13.360
<v Speaker 7>population is terrified of change,</v>
<v Speaker 7>terrified of the possibilities,</v>

3160
02:47:13.370 --> 02:47:15.320
<v Speaker 7>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the intangibles.</v>

3161
02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:18.290
<v Speaker 7>And they would like something norman </v>
<v Speaker 7>rockwell,</v>

3162
02:47:18.470 --> 02:47:23.470
<v Speaker 7>they would like you to paint some really</v>
<v Speaker 7>clear and easy to recognize a pattern </v>

3163
02:47:23.811 --> 02:47:24.350
<v Speaker 7>that they could see.</v>

3164
02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:26.510
<v Speaker 7>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>thank you jesus.</v>

3165
02:47:26.511 --> 02:47:27.650
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they just jumped.</v>

3166
02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:32.740
<v Speaker 7>The lord has blessed me in so many ways </v>
<v Speaker 7>and they just fucking locked themselves </v>

3167
02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:34.490
<v Speaker 7>in this box of perception.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then politicians come along and they</v>

3168
02:47:34.500 --> 02:47:34.760
<v Speaker 7>go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

3169
02:47:34.761 --> 02:47:39.761
<v Speaker 7>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know how to fucking play his </v>

3170
02:47:39.761 --> 02:47:39.761
<v Speaker 7>heartstrings.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

3171
02:47:39.761 --> 02:47:43.540
<v Speaker 7>You're part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not really helping solve the </v>

3172
02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:46.331
<v Speaker 7>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're taking advantage of what these </v>

3173
02:47:46.331 --> 02:47:48.791
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what I think even karl rove called </v>

3174
02:47:48.791 --> 02:47:49.910
<v Speaker 7>useful idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People that want simple answers,</v>

3175
02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:52.880
<v Speaker 7>I call them simple answers for simple </v>
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

3176
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:54.290
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>get over it.</v>

3177
02:47:54.291 --> 02:47:57.260
<v Speaker 7>There are no simple answers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3178
02:47:57.261 --> 02:48:00.260
<v Speaker 7>and what we need to be doing this </v>
<v Speaker 7>looking for the real answers,</v>

3179
02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:05.770
<v Speaker 7>asking the hard questions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>realizing that it's solve very </v>

3180
02:48:05.770 --> 02:48:06.920
<v Speaker 7>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are answers,</v>

3181
02:48:06.921 --> 02:48:10.980
<v Speaker 7>but we're not going to get there through</v>
<v Speaker 7>delusions and fairy tales.</v>

3182
02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:16.030
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've got to actually acknowledge and </v>

3183
02:48:16.030 --> 02:48:18.820
<v Speaker 7>start thinking about this and start </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about it to other people in a </v>

3184
02:48:18.891 --> 02:48:23.891
<v Speaker 7>real way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So sarah pailin these people in these </v>
