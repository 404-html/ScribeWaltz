00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.601
<v Speaker 1>Trey,</v>

2
00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:05.601
<v Speaker 1>my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all day round cake man goes to the body to</v>

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>it was a domination,</v>

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>like a total complete domination and was a strong favorite in this fight.</v>

5
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I Air Max Holloway.</v>

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Well although number 10 what's up?</v>

7
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>So let's build the guy up and that's what I think this</v>

8
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>guy's a killer someday in the future.</v>

9
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a legit fight and I think that's an interesting fight.</v>

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the flooring.</v>

11
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Callaway is a bad motherfucker.</v>

12
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Max Holloway is a bad motherfucker.</v>

13
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a really interesting fight.</v>

14
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you man.</v>

15
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.711
<v Speaker 1>Well Hey,</v>

16
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>they made Ferguson could be beneficial</v>

17
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>for interim title.</v>

18
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Everybody getting titles every fight now from now on will be an interim title.</v>

19
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.591
<v Speaker 1>Damn it.</v>

20
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>That'd be nice.</v>

21
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.501
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

22
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Khabib is,</v>

23
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry they made what?</v>

24
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:52.734
<v Speaker 1>21st century.</v>

25
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>but they made it as more title,</v>

27
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>which I don't understand.</v>

28
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

29
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>That's super confusing.</v>

30
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It's very confusing because Connor just won the title.</v>

31
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>see I think this is more of a sign that comms is going to fight Floyd next cause</v>

33
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>he's probably talking to Dana like you ain't see me anytime soon.</v>

34
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:12.891
<v Speaker 1>Son or it's more of a sign that they wanted to have a pay per view card that was</v>

35
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>stacked with championship fights.</v>

36
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>But if you keep doing interim titles,</v>

37
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

38
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.571
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

39
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>we get it.</v>

40
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's a fucking wheelchair to Congress about to have a baby because his</v>

41
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:22.610
<v Speaker 1>wife's about to have baby.</v>

42
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

43
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's going to be take some time.</v>

44
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe he's not.</v>

45
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's richer than lots of guys.</v>

46
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

47
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's like,</v>

48
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:31.441
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

49
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go through training camp right now and experienced this first</v>

50
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>kid had a baby.</v>

51
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Don't get from training camp.</v>

52
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a fucking man.</v>

54
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Bad asses.</v>

55
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.503
<v Speaker 1>Yoyo Rodriguez.</v>

56
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.441
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

57
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the coming out party folks Bj had on his back though.</v>

58
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Or is it a product of Bj being basically a heavy bag in there and I love Bj.</v>

59
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>It's that,</v>

60
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.611
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

61
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:50.851
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

62
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:51.601
<v Speaker 1>I think Bj,</v>

63
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>when he was 10 years younger,</v>

64
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a tougher fight for you out here for sure.</v>

65
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting for sure,</v>

66
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.373
<v Speaker 1>way tougher fight</v>

67
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.663
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

68
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.561
<v Speaker 1>Who fucking knows.</v>

69
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem though,</v>

70
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>is that it's not just a matter of Bj being a legend.</v>

71
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Bj being an all time great to division world champion,</v>

72
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>bad motherfucker without a doubt,</v>

73
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>but his style is a boxing based attack and then a vicious ground and pound and</v>

74
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:16.011
<v Speaker 1>vicious,</v>

75
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>a top game submission game.</v>

76
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Bj is not a guy who submits guys off his back and Bj is not necessarily a guy</v>

77
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>who kicks that much.</v>

78
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.291
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

79
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I hear who's an outstanding kicker,</v>

80
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>the best kickers.</v>

81
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>He has just this huge advantage.</v>

82
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what it's like if you check window,</v>

83
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>if you had a guy who said and you box a little bit,</v>

84
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>if you had a guy that said,</v>

85
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

86
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>let's spar,</v>

87
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>you can kick and I'll just box.</v>

88
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.461
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

89
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>well good luck with all that.</v>

90
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.733
<v Speaker 1>Can I kick your legs?</v>

91
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.491
<v Speaker 1>And he'd be like,</v>

92
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:44.641
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

93
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

94
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

95
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.300

<v Speaker 1>Or did he fight a cheetah?</v>

106
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.433
<v Speaker 1>Cheetah.</v>

107
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

108
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Christ as a heavyweight.</v>

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Rock and the rumble on the rock.</v>

110
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>The Rock in Hawaii.</v>

111
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

112
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.603
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

113
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>He fought Leonardo in Japan and rumble on the rock.</v>

114
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>He fought Carlos Con.</v>

115
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.481
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

116
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>he didn't find Carlos Condit Lialda and rumble on the rock.</v>

117

<v Speaker 1>He fought go me.</v>

118
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.120

119
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Brought Gomi over to rumble.</v>

120
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Beat the shit out of him and strangle them.</v>

121
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.930
<v Speaker 1>You spot somebody else.</v>

122
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I think you find in a,</v>

123
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.680

124
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

125
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.100

126
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>The Rock.</v>

127
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.440
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

128
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

129
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.853
<v Speaker 1>You might be right.</v>

130
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know you that Jamie.</v>

131
00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:39.461
<v Speaker 1>How powerful fucking tie and pocket handkerchief for Tyron Woodley.</v>

132
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I know all you gotta.</v>

133
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.720
<v Speaker 1>You gotta fucking kind of feel like you're half in less.</v>

134
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>George Saint Pierre comes out of retirement.</v>

135
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Then you make an exception.</v>

136
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>But since joy,</v>

137
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.021
<v Speaker 1>oh look at this.</v>

138
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Just as horrible to watch,</v>

139
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:54.271
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

140
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>He's just taking that left kick to the head.</v>

141
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.801
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

142
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.634
<v Speaker 1>the wheel kick.</v>

143
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is like right away.</v>

144
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.621
<v Speaker 1>Early in the fight.</v>

145
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:00.431
<v Speaker 1>He's getting staggered.</v>

146
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:02.060
<v Speaker 1>He's getting his legs kicked out for longest.</v>

147
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.000
