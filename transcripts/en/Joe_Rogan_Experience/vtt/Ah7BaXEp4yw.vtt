1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.590
<v Speaker 1>so the reason I,</v>

4
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Speaker 1>the reason I think a guy like that gets that good especially so quick is because</v>

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have a favorite part.</v>

6
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like,</v>

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>he loves the whole thing,</v>

8
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:14.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>you know those guys that they're good strikers and they love striking.</v>

11
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they want to do all the time.</v>

12
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.151
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

13
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:21.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

14
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>he works in everything because for his offense to be as good and as defense to</v>

15
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>be just as good.</v>

16
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys just want to be offensive.</v>

17
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Guys just want to win in the gym.</v>

18
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Guys want to get on top and they want to stay there and they want to control.</v>

19
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>So when those guys get put on their back,</v>

20
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>they don't really know what to do or they have a much harder time escaping or</v>

21
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>transitioning out of that position.</v>

22
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.630
<v Speaker 1>But not a guy like that though.</v>

23
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Those are the best guys in the world.</v>

24
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.511
<v Speaker 1>You look at,</v>

25
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you look at Dj,</v>

26
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>you look at dom,</v>

27
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean even Connor,</v>

28
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>the Nate fight is a bad example because that was the first time he was in a</v>

31
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>fight in the UFC and,</v>

32
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't like it the second time he did better.</v>

33
00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>But at the same thing with Chad,</v>

34
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>the little bit of a fight he was in with Mendez when he was on his back,</v>

35
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>he did some work,</v>

36
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>got back to his feet.</v>

37
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

38
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't so uncomfortable with a,</v>

39
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>with a dominant wrestler like that on top that he wasn't going to be able to get</v>

40
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:13.614
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>

41
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Connor is,</v>

44
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>is definitely evolving.</v>

45
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>you could definitely tell that he's,</v>

47
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>like especially his approach to the second Nate Diaz fight.</v>

49
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>He fought that fight very smart and he survived some moments where it looks like</v>

50
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.784
<v Speaker 1>he was gassing out,</v>

51
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>or at least he got that opportunity to reset.</v>

52
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>If he wasn't gassing out,</v>

53
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely diminished.</v>

54
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>But he managed it.</v>

55
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>He managed it much better than the first time because I mean,</v>

56
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>when he got in trouble the first time,</v>

57
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>he did try to change the game,</v>

58
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>but when it wasn't in his favor,</v>

59
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.411
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

60
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I kind of want Outta here.</v>

61
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] spirit.</v>

62
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

63
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.471
<v Speaker 1>as a fighter,</v>

64
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I look at that and I'm like,</v>

65
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>his spirit kind of broke there.</v>

66
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>But he asked for that fight again and then he did it again and he did run into</v>

67
00:01:56.491 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>some trouble and he improved and he fought through it.</v>

68
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>The second time he didn't,</v>

69
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:02.821
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't like,</v>

70
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:02.941
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

71
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>this is a real fight.</v>

72
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Now I gotta get Outta here.</v>

73
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.821
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

74
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:06.331
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

75
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm staying right here.</v>

76
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>So I'm excited to see that Conor fight Eddie because I mean,</v>

77
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:13.284
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

78
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Nate is the same kind of guy.</v>

79
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to worry about those kinds of things.</v>

80
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>But like Eddie is a different beast.</v>

81
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's that Philly beast.</v>

82
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>He's a savage.</v>

83
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.971
<v Speaker 1>So I want to see,</v>

84
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I want to see them get into a fight,</v>

85
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>like not that it could easily happen to and we could easily happen.</v>

86
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.331
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Abras,</v>

87
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>the fucking savage,</v>

88
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.663
<v Speaker 1>he really is.</v>

89
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>He watched that Rafael dos Anjos stoppage.</v>

90
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

91
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.591
<v Speaker 1>The combination,</v>

92
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:38.424
<v Speaker 1>he hit him worth,</v>

93
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

94
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:39.441
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

95
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

96
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

97
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>the sheer amount of punches he through the barrage that it took to put them</v>

98
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:45.954
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

99
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had some fucking serious endurance to press the pace like that.</v>

100
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing that Connor has been struggling with,</v>

101
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Would that pace and insurance and Eddie has the power to put that pace on him</v>

105
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:02.231
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

106
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>when Nate gets him tired or it gets him hurt on his feet,</v>

107
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>he's got that power is not as dynamic.</v>

108
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

109
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a very strong guy too.</v>

110
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a very strong guy for one 55 I'm looking forward to that too.</v>

111
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

113
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious actually to see what Connor looks like at 55 because right.</v>

114
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>We haven't seen him there in the UFC.</v>

115
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>We've seen 45 and then you've seen him cut?</v>

116
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>No wait and wait like one 69 I think he weighed against Nate.</v>

117
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>It would be interesting to see,</v>

118
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 1>what does Connor look like when he's at one 55?</v>

119
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:33.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

120
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>that might be the perfect weight for him.</v>

121
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible.</v>

122
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>We might see a better McGregor at one 55.</v>

123
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the deepest division.</v>

124
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it has been for the longest time and that if,</v>

127
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.091
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

128
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>if anybody dominates that division,</v>

129
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>like Rda did it for a little,</v>

130
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>he looked dominant for a little bit.</v>

131
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

132
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>even coming up to the title fight,</v>

133
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>he looked like he was going to hold onto that for a while.</v>

134
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>but everybody there so close everybody that way.</v>

136
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Class is so close.</v>

137
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody does it,</v>

138
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.031
<v Speaker 1>but what about neuroma?</v>

139
00:04:05.031 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Grumet off because he ragdolled everybody he's gotten in there with.</v>

140
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the one guy you can't say it's close with because everybody he's got</v>

141
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:13.001
<v Speaker 1>ahold of,</v>

142
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 1>he's beating the fuck out of that guy is special no matter if it's special.</v>

143
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.573
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

144
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

145
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I like that guy because what you said,</v>

146
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>he's special.</v>

147
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

148
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And when you see that special thing,</v>

149
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>then I guess people kind of get lost in the void when everybody's close to being</v>

150
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>just as good as each other.</v>

151
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Then you kind of just fight to get just a little bit better than the other guy,</v>

152
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit better than the other.</v>

153
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I just gotta be better than him.</v>

154
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>But then when you get the John Jones that comes into the arena and he's,</v>

155
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>she's leaps and bounds ahead of everybody else,</v>

156
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>then you realize there's a bigger gap and guys start closing that.</v>

157
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

158
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Like a Alyse Alinka,</v>

159
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Alexandra Gusterson.</v>

160
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.623
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

161
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>he always fights at that level,</v>

162
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>especially when he's in a title fight.</v>

163
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if,</v>

164
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>if John Jones didn't exist,</v>

165
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>if he would rise to that occasion,</v>

166
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.520
<v Speaker 1>what I mean eat.</v>

167
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.871
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

168
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>so somebody's got to show up in the lightweight division at some point like that</v>

169
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.461
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

170
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>to make people raise their level.</v>

171
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Because guys right now,</v>

172
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>which is the deepest and toughest division,</v>

173
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>but guys are so close and maybe no Maga Madoff is that guy.</v>

174
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.373
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

175
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

176
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>he certainly has been in when it comes to grappling,</v>

177
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>like what he did to dos Anjos was,</v>

178
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>was pretty stunning,</v>

179
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:28.511
<v Speaker 1>because there was like,</v>

181
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>man though Santos is a legit Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt,</v>

182
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>super strong guy,</v>

183
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.450
<v Speaker 1>really good on the ground and it just seemed like [inaudible] off.</v>

184
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Just got ahold of them and just did whatever the fuck you wanted to.</v>

185
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Once you've got them on the ground,</v>

186
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>just throws dudes around.</v>

187
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he's built different,</v>

188
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.373
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't,</v>

189
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 1>like if Gleason bow was doing that to dude's,</v>

191
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.071
<v Speaker 1>I'd go,</v>

192
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I that makes sense.</v>

193
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking guy.</v>

194
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>But when Norma Madoff does it,</v>

195
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily just some overwhelming physical attribute.</v>

196
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>It's his technique and his aggression.</v>

197
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Just just super fucking aggressive and tight with his grappling in his</v>

198
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:04.671
<v Speaker 1>positioning,</v>

199
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>his ground and pound as horrific.</v>

200
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He's a scary dude,</v>

201
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.954
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

202
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.041
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>

203
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't even have to think about the way he does those moves.</v>

204
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I remember when you said that and when you say ragdoll on people in Rda,</v>

205
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Rda took that shot on him and he was in the third and he hit him with it.</v>

206
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Uchi Mata basically right from the over Hook whizzer and tripped him forcing it</v>

207
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's not easy.</v>

208
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Throw it a hit and especially from that range,</v>

209
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>it didn't look like it was going to happen,</v>

210
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>but he does it to the guy who goes on and become the world champion that way and</v>

211
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>then dominate other guys at that weight class.</v>

212
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

213
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>like that guy is special man.</v>

214
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:39.951
<v Speaker 1>I want to see,</v>

215
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to see him improve his standup and get and get and just get better.</v>

216
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I want to see him do things like Dj is,</v>

217
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:45.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>just working on his weaknesses and cause,</v>

219
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy would never lose.</v>

220
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if he had Djs,</v>

221
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>MMA Iq and skillset,</v>

222
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 1>but his rest with his red.</v>

223
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>What is wrestling and ground is now like who's beating that guy?</v>

224
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I would send that guy to fight wars for me.</v>

225
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

226
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

227
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.081
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

228
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:12.471
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

229
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:15.790
<v Speaker 1>he rocked dolls dudes in a very unusual way and deal.</v>

230
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then a guy will come up like that that can do that.</v>

231
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 1>And he does it with intensity and aggression.</v>

232
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Like Damien Maia,</v>

233
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:23.601
<v Speaker 1>rag dolls,</v>

234
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people too,</v>

235
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 1>especially lately,</v>

236
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 1>he gets ahold of guys like I did with Rick story,</v>

237
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>but he's doing it in like this technical squeezy way.</v>

238
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>You know when Norma grow off gets a hold of dudes.</v>

239
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>It's smash.</v>

240
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Everything is smash.</v>

241
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.660
<v Speaker 1>He's driving you into the ground,</v>

242
00:07:39.661 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 1>smashing you into the ground that's smashing when you're on top of you.</v>

243
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Damien Maia is just constricting.</v>

244
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>He's like moving into position and he slowly closing you off and he's gonna</v>

245
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.323
<v Speaker 1>choke you.</v>

246
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different kind of domination.</v>

247
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.163
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

248
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's entirely the fairest comparison cause Damien is obviously</v>

249
00:07:58.401 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>far a much longer career and he fought at one 85 and he fought again.</v>

250
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

251
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 1>it's against Anderson.</v>

252
00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out by Nate.</v>

253
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>He's had a lot of ups and downs in the UFC and Jake shields beat him.</v>

254
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>People forget that.</v>

255
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Jake shields essentially out grappled them.</v>

256
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 1>But number coming off.</v>

257
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

258
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.371
<v Speaker 1>Good luck out.</v>

259
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Grapple on that dude.</v>

260
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.553
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

261
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:20.421
<v Speaker 1>But what's his,</v>

262
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:21.141
<v Speaker 1>what does it take down?</v>

263
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Percentage like two.</v>

264
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a million percent.</v>

265
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:25.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

266
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>he takes down everybody.</v>

267
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing about number Grumet off is um,</v>

268
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:29.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 1>then he gets injured a lot and you've got to wonder,</v>

270
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>is it because of that insane fucking aggressive style of his,</v>

271
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:38.530
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

272
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>it makes it so fun to watch him.</v>

273
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 1>He's that like you're kind of red lining your body too much</v>

274
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.183
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

275
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:46.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

276
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

277
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

279
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:49.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

280
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:49.850
<v Speaker 1>you got arrest,</v>

281
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:50.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

282
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>You gotta heal up.</v>

283
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>You can't always be on.</v>

284
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

285
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

286
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>can a guide like a Damien Maia who trains very technically,</v>

287
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously he wrestles and he does like a lot of chaotic movements as</v>

288
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:02.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

289
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 1>but probably not nearly what the kind of intensity,</v>

290
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>the number of men off does.</v>

291
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.340
<v Speaker 1>You gotta wonder like a,</v>

292
00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:14.341
<v Speaker 1>that style is obviously super effective and very fucking devastating and fun to</v>

293
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

294
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder if preparing for that style and executing that style is almost like</v>

295
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 1>ultimately too much on your joints,</v>

296
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>too much on your body.</v>

297
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I guess the question would be then is can he be no Magna Madoff without that</v>

298
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:32.574
<v Speaker 1>style?</v>

299
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Does he have the skill to translate that to slowing it down and,</v>

300
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

301
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.510
<v Speaker 1>and turning the volume down?</v>

302
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
