WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.700
<v Speaker 1>We gotta figure out a way to make it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>we just have a white hole,</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>one button thing where everything syncs </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with one button to so possible one </v>

3
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>day maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live right now with live,</v>

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>How are you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>

8
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no worries.</v>

9
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Thanks so much for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris is going to be with us,</v>

10
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>but he flaked out last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's busy,</v>

11
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>he's a busy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so.</v>

13
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

14
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested to talk to you about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of things,</v>

15
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:32.241
<v Speaker 1>but one of the big ones is this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective altruism and this is something</v>

16
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>that you really promote to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

17
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I read this about you,</v>

18
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>that everything that you make over </v>
<v Speaker 1>$36,000</v>

19
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you donate.</v>

20
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

21
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>So wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>So everything above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically it's anything above 20,000</v>

23
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>pounds from 2009 Oxford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just inflation,</v>

24
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>cost of living changes and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's about $36,000.</v>

25
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>So you've just sort of decided that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is by the way,</v>

26
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>the one percent for the whole world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Not quite two percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still be in the top two percent.</v>

29
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Even despite that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 34,000.</v>

30
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I think $34,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts you in a top one percent.</v>

31
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:12.921
<v Speaker 1>I think it's $55,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a change and maybe since </v>

32
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>trump's been in office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

33
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

36
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>that's a very charitable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:25.791
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's most of my income over the </v>

38
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>course of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like especially as an academic,</v>

39
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to an tons though,</v>

40
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>since the effect of altruism blew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up getting things like speaking </v>

41
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>fees and give all that away as well.</v>

42
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>It's going to end up probably being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>large majority of income,</v>

43
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>

44
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever like want to buy something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

45
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:46.461
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wasn't so goddamn generous I'd be </v>

46
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:46.461
<v Speaker 1>able to get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I never do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like basically never think that,</v>

48
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like this,</v>

49
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:55.101
<v Speaker 1>like I feel like in contemporary society</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just get bombarded with marketing </v>

50
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>stuff all the time saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

51
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you really need this thing if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have a good life.</v>

52
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think like an almost every case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not true.</v>

53
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the psychological evidence just </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that once you go above a certain </v>

54
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>level of income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>additional money just has a very small </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on your happiness.</v>

56
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>And in my own case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the things that make me happy.</v>

57
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I like being surrounded by friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the gym membership,</v>

58
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>that's like $40 a month or something.</v>

59
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not very much I can afford that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being able to work and you know,</v>

60
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>why I really am passionate about and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>already have that.</v>

61
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 1>So my life is just so good in so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways and I feel like there's so much of </v>

62
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>a focus on money and how money is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>key to happiness and it's just,</v>

63
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just all bullshit basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's definitely some bullshit in it.</v>

64
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:43.641
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that a lot in my neighborhood </v>

65
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:45.590
<v Speaker 1>because I live where white people go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>breed and they,</v>

66
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go to breed and they,</v>

67
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>they sit down and they just talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

68
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.310
<v Speaker 1>They talk about Range Rovers and certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>watches and certain purses and shoes and</v>

69
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes this constant.</v>

70
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>The amazing thing is just how you adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's called the hedonic treadmill.</v>

71
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>The richer you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richer you need to be.</v>

72
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was once part of a conversation,</v>

73
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to give a talk and um,</v>

74
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I was going to like a family and was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of the private jet in fact.</v>

75
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.720
<v Speaker 1>And the conversation was discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different private jets in which private </v>

76
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.411
<v Speaker 1>jets are better than so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this other person has this really </v>

77
00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>nice private jet and it just means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like at no stage do you ever lose the </v>

78
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

79
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I could just have this nicer thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

80
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>because you can get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want a jumbo jet,</v>

81
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>like one of those Quantas air buses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

82
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:43.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that one of those Richard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Branson type character characters </v>

84
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:43.201
<v Speaker 1>probably has something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

85
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>that's totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to get to this.</v>

86
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.270
<v Speaker 1>You hit this critical mass stage where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

87
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:53.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these billionaire characters where </v>

88
00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:53.271
<v Speaker 1>they start buying $100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>yachts,</v>

89
00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:57.810
<v Speaker 1>$400,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>yachts and what is the most expensive </v>

90
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Yada believe it's a half a billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars or more incredible.</v>

91
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to have a staff to take care of</v>

92
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>it the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it ever.</v>

93
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.020
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I had a car that would make </v>

94
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.020
<v Speaker 1>my life worse because not only to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressing about this,</v>

95
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>like what if it gets damaged?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel bad that I'm not using it.</v>

96
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And less.</v>

98
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess not though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you look at this,</v>

99
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.810
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a billion billion dollars in a </v>

100
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The streets of Monaco is what it's </v>

101
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>called and it is $1,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to that thing.</v>

102
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

103
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

104
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some floating neighborhood.</v>

105
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I think on all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have the place,</v>

106
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.470
<v Speaker 1>the cost with how many bed nets you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could buy for children in sub Saharan </v>

107
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

108
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>well that's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

109
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Go up one once a one point 2 billion.</v>

110
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Scroll up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Estimated price.</v>

111
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eclipse.</v>

112
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront.</v>

113
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 1>50 million to one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$2 billion.</v>

114
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 1>That's like when you go to get it made </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go like,</v>

115
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:59.450
<v Speaker 1>how much is it going to cost me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

116
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>between four $50 million and one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>$2 billion.</v>

117
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

118
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

<v Speaker 1>normal shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking change.</v>

120
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that God damn thing.</v>

121
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>

122
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's a replica of the Monaco Grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prix track.</v>

123
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

124
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>So you can drive around on your yacht at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ridiculous rate of speed.</v>

125
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.310
<v Speaker 1>So this guy probably has like a Ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go all over the surface of his </v>

126
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>crazy yacht.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

127
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>let's get a fake beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it hasn't been sold yet.</v>

128
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't actually owned yet,</v>

129
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

130
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

131
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:47.311
<v Speaker 1>Who buys that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get love attention </v>

132
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:47.311
<v Speaker 1>where there are enough people.</v>

133
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

134
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anyone to billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably.</v>

135
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>There's only a couple of thousand people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world who are worth that much.</v>

136
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>If somebody's willing to sink the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate.</v>

138
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>How many billionaires do you think there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are worldwide?</v>

139
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Let's guess he and a half thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars million.</v>

140
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.830
<v Speaker 1>There's three and a half thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

141
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sound very confident.</v>

142
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

144
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a large number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is kind of crazy.</v>

145
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Three and a half thousand people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have more than $100.</v>

146
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:16.511
<v Speaker 1>Million dollars and here's a whole will </v>
<v Speaker 1>macaskill at over 35,000.</v>

147
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Cuts it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then half of that 1800,</v>

148
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.460
<v Speaker 1>1800 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

149
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.390
<v Speaker 1>you're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glad we've got.</v>

150
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

151
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm just happy we've got fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check it on.</v>

152
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Connected health statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of money,</v>

153
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:36.821
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is one of those weird things </v>

154
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:36.821
<v Speaker 1>where I do not think that money equates </v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

155
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that money does do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it alleviates the stress of bills,</v>

156
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.100
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of those stress of bills can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be alleviated by not buying as many </v>

157
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.100
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

158
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>So like a lot of the stress of bills </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have is sort of self imposed</v>

159
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you get a mortgage for a very large</v>

160
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have car payments,</v>

161
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 1>you have all these different things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're paying for.</v>

162
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.540
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of money stress that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people put themselves under is actually </v>

163
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>not really necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

164
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you broke it down to what do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually need,</v>

165
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>just need a nice place to live where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not crime Britain and it's safe.</v>

166
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 1>You need a bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else do you need?</v>

167
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need food.</v>

168
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You one of those.</v>

169
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:14.910
<v Speaker 1>No TV dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a tail?</v>

170
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched Netflix.</v>

171
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I just finished veep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love.</v>

172
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

173
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 1>it gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first season's on so good,</v>

174
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>patience.</v>

175
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

176
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:31.991
<v Speaker 1>I just got addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I want something and I think </v>

177
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:31.991
<v Speaker 1>it's awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still just.</v>

178
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I will get addicted right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to watch olefins.</v>

179
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've liked the most compulsive </v>

180
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen house of cards?</v>

181
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I have not seen a deliberately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Stock Show.</v>

182
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good show.</v>

183
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Like game of thrones makes my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

184
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I like hate it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amazing television,</v>

185
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 1>but I find it to so distressing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have to watch it all the time.</v>

186
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Why do you find it distressing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the violence,</v>

187
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:54.940
<v Speaker 1>the violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's gang.</v>

188
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 1>The heads popped and stung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

189
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 1>that one with the mountain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:07:57.861 --> 00:07:59.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that really stays with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

191
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 1>That's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

193
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:07.770
<v Speaker 1>It gives me a lot of anxiety because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know there's only two seasons left and </v>

194
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.441
<v Speaker 1>the next season is one coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only seven episodes and the final </v>

195
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 1>season is only six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy about that.</v>

196
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not making me happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

197
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not very happy about that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone saying they're going </v>

198
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:19.210
<v Speaker 1>to stop selling heroin or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

199
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to get hooked on </v>

200
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.081
<v Speaker 1>Oxycontin and that's what I feel I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to watch the whole season </v>

201
00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:27.790
<v Speaker 1>all over again or the whole series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

202
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>so you have a television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a computer.</v>

203
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

204
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

205
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I like moving around two tons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I normally,</v>

206
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.440
<v Speaker 1>like I don't have a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't be convenient type of </v>

207
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:41.440
<v Speaker 1>house because I'm traveling so much to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

208
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Brenda apartment or something and had an</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

209
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 1>You live in England?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in oaks most of the time.</v>

210
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I spent quite a chunk of my time out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bay area.</v>

211
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm like significant part of our staff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the nonprofits out there.</v>

212
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I've got lots of contacts still the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations about that.</v>

213
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:59.201
<v Speaker 1>So most of your time you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you're spending working </v>

214
00:08:59.201 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 1>for charitable organizations or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

215
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>so I have kind of three hats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one is an academic,</v>

216
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>so I'm the festival oxides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second is this kind of more public </v>

217
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.651
<v Speaker 1>figure whether I'm talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas through books or on this podcast </v>

218
00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:16.911
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then third is I run a nonprofit </v>

219
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:16.911
<v Speaker 1>called the center for effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>altruism,</v>

220
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:19.050
<v Speaker 1>which is more about like finding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best charities,</v>

221
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:24.051
<v Speaker 1>the ones that doing the most good is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to help other people the most and </v>

222
00:09:24.051 --> 00:09:28.221
<v Speaker 1>kind of promote them and try and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to give more and to give more </v>

223
00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:28.221
<v Speaker 1>effectively.</v>

224
00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've gone over ineffective charities or</v>

225
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say ineffective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but charities that are the way they're </v>

226
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.901
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at how much money is </v>

227
00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>actually going towards the charity </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and how much is going towards the</v>

228
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 1>structure of the organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of crazy.</v>

229
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think so that's normally the </v>

230
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.140
<v Speaker 1>focus of ineffective cavities is on </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

231
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much is spent on overheads.</v>

232
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>But I actually think that's not the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing.</v>

233
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing is what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>charity actually doing?</v>

234
00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the actual program?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one chata tea for the example that </v>

235
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you'll find funny as a chatbot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled homeopaths without borders and </v>

236
00:10:04.491 --> 00:10:09.260
<v Speaker 1>it goes to Haiti and particularly on </v>
<v Speaker 1>disobedience like homeopathic </v>

237
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:09.260
<v Speaker 1>calamities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

238
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which don't work,</v>

239
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:14.451
<v Speaker 1>they don't provide any health benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if at a zero percent overhead </v>

240
00:10:14.451 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 1>cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so apps like spent nothing,</v>

241
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 1>everything was volunteers.</v>

242
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.100
<v Speaker 1>It would still be bad child teach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those shouldn't be given to that Chata </v>

243
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.880
<v Speaker 1>tea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one I didn't know that that one </v>

244
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:24.880
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

245
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of small,</v>

246
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.331
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine phil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thankfully homeopaths without Borders </v>

247
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.840
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's some super effective </v>

248
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.991
<v Speaker 1>charities like paradigm that's saving a </v>
<v Speaker 1>life with flt three and a half thousand </v>

249
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the against malaria foundation.</v>

250
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Even if they were spending a bunch on </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating what are the best areas to</v>

251
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 1>focus on or like paying of that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

252
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.760
<v Speaker 1>If what you should just care about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much money you're putting in and </v>

253
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:52.760
<v Speaker 1>what you're getting is an outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

254
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's impossible for everyone to.</v>

255
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible for you to give $10 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all $10 is going to go directly to the </v>

256
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 1>charity because there's got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>overhead,</v>

257
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:07.911
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be a bunch of people </v>

258
00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 1>working there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rent costs.</v>

259
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.490
<v Speaker 1>But the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point does it become kind of a </v>

260
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.841
<v Speaker 1>scam?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there are most certainly some </v>

261
00:11:17.841 --> 00:11:21.021
<v Speaker 1>organizations that appear to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>charitable organizations but are really </v>

262
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:22.340
<v Speaker 1>kind of a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

263
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the kid's wish network,</v>

264
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like the make a wish foundation,</v>

265
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:32.541
<v Speaker 1>similar idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they spent 99 percent of their </v>

266
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:35.391
<v Speaker 1>budget on fundraising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were just like this kind of </v>

267
00:11:35.391 --> 00:11:39.100
<v Speaker 1>chatter Ponzi scheme basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they spend all their money on </v>

268
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.760
<v Speaker 1>fundraising itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.900
<v Speaker 1>To then invest in more fundraising and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent somehow or another gets out </v>

270
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:44.900
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

271
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.910
<v Speaker 1>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not as high as 99 percent is </v>

272
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.130
<v Speaker 1>above 90 percent or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that money get to?</v>

273
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Like what do they do with the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>money itself?</v>

274
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea that was</v>

275
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 2>granting wishes for sick children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

276
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.710
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

277
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 2>do you remember the San Francisco thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with back kid?</v>

278
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.060
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit like there was a big event,</v>

279
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:08.410
<v Speaker 2>lots of publicity around this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a child that had some strange disorder.</v>

280
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

281
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the child,</v>

282
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the child had leukemia.</v>

283
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 2>They have wished was that they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be Batman for the day.</v>

284
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] this is a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

285
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

286
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>So they like the make a wish foundation </v>
<v Speaker 2>set up.</v>

287
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.710
<v Speaker 2>This um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

288
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 2>amazing store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

289
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 2>they got to kind of drive and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>batmobile and like have this a fantastic</v>

290
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:31.351
<v Speaker 2>day with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically Batman for the day kids which </v>

291
00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:31.351
<v Speaker 2>network is doing basically the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

292
00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:35.850
<v Speaker 2>They find seriously sick kids often </v>
<v Speaker 2>terminally ill kids and say what one </v>

293
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:36.490
<v Speaker 2>thing would you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll make it happen.</v>

294
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:43.270
<v Speaker 2>But at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the but there is a lot of focus </v>

295
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:43.450
<v Speaker 2>on like particularly bad charities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

296
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 2>the ones that really come up too is </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely dysfunctional.</v>

297
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's not actually the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>important message.</v>

298
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 2>What's most important is just even among</v>
<v Speaker 2>the charities that kind of good,</v>

299
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.580
<v Speaker 2>even the ones that are making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>

300
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.850
<v Speaker 2>there's still a vast difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact that you have difference of </v>

301
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.821
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of times between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the penalties that are merely good and </v>

302
00:13:02.821 --> 00:13:06.860
<v Speaker 2>there's ones that are really the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>best and that's by mainly dependent on </v>

303
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.560
<v Speaker 2>what program are they focusing on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is there any charity that people</v>

304
00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:15.901
<v Speaker 2>should avoid spending their money on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are there other charities that you </v>

305
00:13:15.901 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 2>feel like are just so ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 2>ineffective?</v>

306
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

307
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:24.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean like the ones we mentioned of </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids who wished network or homeopaths </v>

308
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:25.200
<v Speaker 2>without borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the borders.</v>

309
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.850
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like food.</v>

310
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Who on parade?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just stop.</v>

311
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was another one.</v>

312
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember that but it does.</v>

313
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm a strategy without limits and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that limit.</v>

314
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

315
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm dolphin therapy for autistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>children which has no evidence of </v>

316
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:43.580
<v Speaker 2>working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

317
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.720
<v Speaker 2>but does actually just have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the risk of the children's </v>

318
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.230
<v Speaker 2>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

319
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.130
<v Speaker 2>so you can like chatty pick these </v>
<v Speaker 2>examples.</v>

320
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:56.131
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is that these aren't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like not really representative in </v>

321
00:13:56.131 --> 00:13:56.131
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think charities doing good.</v>

322
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the question is just like in the </v>

323
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.550
<v Speaker 2>same way as if you're buying a product </v>
<v Speaker 2>for yourself,</v>

324
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.270
<v Speaker 2>you don't just want to get like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 2>a laptop as long as it's work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to find like what's the best</v>

326
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:11.701
<v Speaker 2>laptop I can get with my money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if you're investing you want to not </v>

327
00:14:11.701 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 2>just get like an okay to turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to say,</v>

328
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 2>well what's the best to the attorney can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

329
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>

330
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I think like the number of charities </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you think is just,</v>

331
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:22.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is literally competing for being </v>

332
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:22.290
<v Speaker 2>the most effective charity in the world.</v>

333
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 2>That's actually fairly small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So givewell for the examples a evaluates</v>

334
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:30.121
<v Speaker 2>it looks all sorts of different global </v>
<v Speaker 2>health and global development charities </v>

335
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 2>and it's less of charities that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

336
00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:37.351
<v Speaker 2>this is super good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should literally be donating to </v>

337
00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:39.511
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only seven charities long at the </v>

338
00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:41.551
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine is up from last year when it was </v>

339
00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:41.551
<v Speaker 2>only for travel to wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven charities.</v>

340
00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:42.370
<v Speaker 2>That of how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

341
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>what is the overall total of act of </v>
<v Speaker 2>charities?</v>

342
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be in the thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands,</v>

343
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What got you involved in this?</v>

344
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:55.201
<v Speaker 2>So you're a young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you seem like you should be playing </v>

345
00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 2>video games and skateboarding or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

346
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of my teenage years </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing video games.</v>

347
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

348
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsive personality.</v>

349
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I need the band myself from doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're compulsive personalities now </v>

350
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:07.500
<v Speaker 2>going towards good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

351
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I manage the key was managing my life so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the things I get really focused on </v>

352
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:11.890
<v Speaker 2>addicted.</v>

353
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm addicted to good things than bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

354
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all started back in.</v>

355
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:22.090
<v Speaker 2>So I was back in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of undergraduate of being very </v>

356
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 2>convinced by the arguments that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher,</v>

357
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Peter Singer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

358
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I know Peter Singer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a radical animal rights </v>

359
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:30.090
<v Speaker 2>activist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has.</v>

360
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a few things.</v>

361
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had this argument,</v>

362
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

363
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:41.110
<v Speaker 2>the way I tell the story is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine I'm someone walks is walking </v>

364
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.581
<v Speaker 2>past a shallow pond and they see a child</v>
<v Speaker 2>drowning in that shallow pond and they </v>

365
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:48.800
<v Speaker 2>could run in and they could save the </v>
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>

366
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Butler willing a really nice suit suit </v>
<v Speaker 2>the costs like $3,000.</v>

367
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And so they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

368
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to save that child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to walk by and let it </v>

369
00:15:59.750 --> 00:15:59.750
<v Speaker 2>down because I don't want to lose the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cost of this suit.</v>

370
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I normally say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look in moral philosophy,</v>

371
00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 2>we have a technical term for people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they called assholes.</v>

372
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

373
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.920
<v Speaker 2>this is how I convey it in my seminars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

374
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 2>and obviously we all agree like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

375
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:16.790
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's just,</v>

376
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.190
<v Speaker 2>you could clearly save this child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's light in front of you.</v>

377
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.510
<v Speaker 2>You ought to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cost of $30,000</v>

378
00:16:21.511 --> 00:16:26.511
<v Speaker 2>does not count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then what Peter Singer's insight is </v>

379
00:16:26.511 --> 00:16:26.511
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

380
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.120
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 2>child?</v>

381
00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:33.121
<v Speaker 2>It's right there in front of you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that child that's in Subsaharan Africa </v>

382
00:16:33.121 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 2>who you could save,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll never meet them for sure.</v>

383
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could still save their life with</v>

384
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:42.011
<v Speaker 2>just a few thousand dollars if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>donate it to a barely effective </v>

385
00:16:42.011 --> 00:16:45.011
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit and he considers all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways in which these cases </v>

386
00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 2>might be just analogous but decides </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately like,</v>

387
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually just know morally </v>

388
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:51.760
<v Speaker 2>relevant difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

389
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.841
<v Speaker 2>we do just have an obligation to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>away at least a very significant </v>

390
00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:55.841
<v Speaker 2>proportion of our income.</v>

391
00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.360
<v Speaker 2>And I was really convinced by this kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of on an intellectual level for many </v>

392
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.890
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never really did anything about </v>

393
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:05.890
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

394
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.720
<v Speaker 2>and not until I went to Oxford to do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>postgraduate degree in philosophy.</v>

395
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.570
<v Speaker 2>And in the summer between that I needed </v>
<v Speaker 2>some money.</v>

396
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:16.571
<v Speaker 2>I worked as a fundraiser for care </v>
<v Speaker 2>international global development </v>

397
00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:17.360
<v Speaker 2>charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was one of those annoying people in</v>

398
00:17:17.361 --> 00:17:18.960
<v Speaker 2>the street who had kind of passed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>light,</v>

399
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.010
<v Speaker 2>can get in your way and then ask you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>donate $10 a month.</v>

400
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.380
<v Speaker 2>And it meant the all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every day.</v>

401
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

402
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:27.650
<v Speaker 2>this is the conditions of people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme poverty,</v>

403
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.860
<v Speaker 2>we can do so much to help people at such</v>
<v Speaker 2>little cost to ourselves,</v>

404
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we not doing this?</v>

405
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:38.050
<v Speaker 2>And I was just over and over again kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting these apathetic responses and</v>

406
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.310
<v Speaker 2>I was just getting so frustrated because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought,</v>

407
00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:42.030
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people just not living up to their</v>

408
00:17:42.031 --> 00:17:42.830
<v Speaker 2>own values.</v>

409
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.130
<v Speaker 2>People killingly do Claire Care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some sort of block going on.</v>

410
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.780
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

411
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:52.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the time I was planning to do like </v>

412
00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:52.930
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logic,</v>

413
00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 2>very esoteric stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought,</v>

414
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not living up to my own values.</v>

415
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should really try and make a change.</v>

416
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.520
<v Speaker 2>And so I went to Oxford and I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking a whole bunch of different kind </v>

417
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 2>of academics or what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the impact of your work?</v>

418
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:09.600
<v Speaker 2>What kind of difference have you made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And normally they were like,</v>

419
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really in it to make an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got interested in these ideas and</v>

420
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:18.921
<v Speaker 2>that was pretty disheartening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I kept persisting until I met </v>

421
00:18:18.921 --> 00:18:19.890
<v Speaker 2>another postgraduate student called Toby</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ord,</v>

422
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 2>and he just blew me away because he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>also been convinced by these ideas,</v>

423
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:26.400
<v Speaker 2>but he'd gone one step further and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

424
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:31.401
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've made a commitment to give away </v>

425
00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:31.401
<v Speaker 2>almost all of my income of the course of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life,</v>

426
00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 2>about million pounds.</v>

427
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.870
<v Speaker 2>At the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was living on 9,000</v>

428
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:38.871
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saving 2000 pounds and donating 2000 </v>

429
00:18:38.871 --> 00:18:38.871
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was like,</v>

430
00:18:38.871 --> 00:18:42.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hardcore the thing as well as </v>

431
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.640
<v Speaker 2>actually taking these ideas and putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>into practice what really blew me away </v>

432
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:45.640
<v Speaker 2>was just how positive he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was.</v>

433
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:50.690
<v Speaker 2>It was not the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of wearing his hair shirt </v>

434
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.480
<v Speaker 2>flagellating instead he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

435
00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:55.290
<v Speaker 2>this is an amazing way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this amazing opportunity to do a</v>

436
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 2>huge amount of goods to help so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>

437
00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:02.991
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a very low cost to </v>

438
00:19:02.991 --> 00:19:06.021
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And me having that one person who also </v>

439
00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 2>kind of shared my worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shared my ambitions,</v>

440
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 2>just meant kind of gave that little </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological block was lifted.</v>

441
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 2>And it meant that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

442
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on board first,</v>

443
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I can a committed 10 percent.</v>

444
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

445
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:22.170
<v Speaker 2>actually I think I can do this for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pledge.</v>

446
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that meant I had this question </v>

447
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

448
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm planning to give awake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come like million pounds over the course</v>

449
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:30.660
<v Speaker 2>of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where should that money go?</v>

450
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure it has as big an </v>

451
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:35.730
<v Speaker 2>impact as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that meant I started digging into,</v>

452
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.850
<v Speaker 2>well how can we compare the between </v>
<v Speaker 2>different charities?</v>

453
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:40.560
<v Speaker 2>I found there was a ton of work for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

454
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Speaker 2>health and development economics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could help us to answer this.</v>

455
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 2>And what began as this kind of side </v>
<v Speaker 2>project between these two,</v>

456
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ivory tower,</v>

457
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:50.220
<v Speaker 2>academics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and toby,</v>

458
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.640
<v Speaker 2>we found that loads of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just Lee,</v>

459
00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm taken by this idea both of giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>more but in particular have given more </v>

460
00:19:57.841 --> 00:20:00.030
<v Speaker 2>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And over time,</v>

461
00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:05.031
<v Speaker 2>this kind of global movement called </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective altruism start to form around </v>

462
00:20:05.031 --> 00:20:07.080
<v Speaker 2>these ideas and sort to pollutant and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of ways.</v>

463
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:12.710
<v Speaker 2>So one is the pollutant away from just </v>
<v Speaker 2>charitable donations to also thinking </v>

464
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.680
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

465
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.530
<v Speaker 2>what should I think about with respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make personal consumption?</v>

466
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.800
<v Speaker 2>What should I think about with respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>to my career if I'm really aiming to do </v>

467
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:21.800
<v Speaker 2>as much good as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should I do?</v>

468
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.920
<v Speaker 2>And then secondly also starting to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about cause areas other than just global</v>

469
00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:30.921
<v Speaker 2>poverty as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it tends to be the case that within </v>

470
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:34.431
<v Speaker 2>the community at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cause areas that people think are </v>

471
00:20:34.431 --> 00:20:36.900
<v Speaker 2>the very most pressing our global health</v>
<v Speaker 2>and development still for sure.</v>

472
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.000
<v Speaker 2>But then also factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

473
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:45.590
<v Speaker 2>where again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just such a vast amount of </v>

474
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.590
<v Speaker 2>suffering which is completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary.</v>

475
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.780
<v Speaker 2>And then also preservation the long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long future of humanity and wedding </v>

476
00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.080
<v Speaker 2>about risks of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:57.090
<v Speaker 2>global catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that may be fairly unlikely but </v>

478
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.090
<v Speaker 2>would be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad.</v>

479
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they did happen,</v>

480
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 2>especially relating to new technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>like um,</v>

481
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>novel pathogens,</v>

482
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 2>sort of violence as you could design in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lab and so on.</v>

483
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:10.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're also very concerned with ai as </v>

484
00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:10.550
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

485
00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:10.550
<v Speaker 3>Artificial</v>

486
00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:10.550
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

487
00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:10.700
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

488
00:21:10.701 --> 00:21:14.420
<v Speaker 2>I think in this category of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the history of,</v>

489
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human progress,</v>

490
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.880
<v Speaker 2>technological change just creates these </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge step changes and just how humanity </v>

491
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.720
<v Speaker 2>progresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was only 12 years,</v>

492
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 19 nine,</v>

493
00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>33 to then 1945 between Leo Szilard </v>

494
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.100
<v Speaker 2>first coming up with the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear chain reaction and that was just</v>

495
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:36.410
<v Speaker 2>purely conceptual idea in a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper,</v>

496
00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.980
<v Speaker 2>12 years from that to then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deployment of the first nuclear bomb and</v>

497
00:21:42.021 --> 00:21:47.021
<v Speaker 2>think how radical a change that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>having suddenly being in the nuclear </v>

498
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:47.570
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was only 12 years.</v>

499
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went over the,</v>

500
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:54.130
<v Speaker 3>the invention of the airplane to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dropping an atomic bomb out of the </v>

501
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.550
<v Speaker 3>airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was 50 years,</v>

502
00:21:55.551 --> 00:22:00.551
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 </v>

503
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:00.551
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

504
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:00.551
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that take a few?</v>

505
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So technological progress can suddenly </v>

506
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.551
<v Speaker 2>go in these huge leaps that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared for the well often very not </v>

507
00:22:06.551 --> 00:22:10.241
<v Speaker 2>prepared for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think artificial intelligence is </v>

508
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:11.590
<v Speaker 2>in this context that you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were really making a radical progress in</v>

509
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.760
<v Speaker 2>ai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially over the last five years.</v>

510
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really one of the fastest </v>

511
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.190
<v Speaker 2>developing technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

512
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.520
<v Speaker 2>and yet has huge potential and so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

513
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as with any new technology,</v>

514
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.740
<v Speaker 2>huge positive potential relief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get ai light,</v>

515
00:22:27.741 --> 00:22:31.550
<v Speaker 2>you can solve almost any problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also potential risks as well.</v>

516
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's a risk that might be more </v>

517
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.000
<v Speaker 2>familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

518
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's about automation,</v>

519
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.100
<v Speaker 2>unemployment and what he's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous weapons,</v>

520
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.820
<v Speaker 2>which I think should be taken seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also just what he's about.</v>

521
00:22:46.821 --> 00:22:51.821
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if we could really do manage to </v>

522
00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:51.821
<v Speaker 2>make human level artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence?</v>

523
00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:54.620
<v Speaker 2>It's very good arguments that would then</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly move to super human level,</v>

524
00:22:54.621 --> 00:22:59.621
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what then are we now in a situation </v>

525
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.840
<v Speaker 2>like the neanderthals Homo Sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we've suddenly created this </v>

526
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.570
<v Speaker 2>intelligence that's greater than our </v>
<v Speaker 2>own?</v>

527
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Are we able to control that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we able to ensure that transition is</v>

528
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.980
<v Speaker 2>positive rather than negative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever ever</v>

529
00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.980
<v Speaker 3>considered the possibility when you look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all the impoverished people in the </v>

530
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.170
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the cruelty,</v>

531
00:23:21.171 --> 00:23:23.510
<v Speaker 3>all the people that we are so concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

532
00:23:23.511 --> 00:23:28.511
<v Speaker 3>material possessions and shallow </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking and war and just the evil that </v>

533
00:23:29.301 --> 00:23:34.301
<v Speaker 3>men do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that we're sort of an </v>

534
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:39.490
<v Speaker 3>outdated concept that what we are as </v>
<v Speaker 3>these biological organisms that are </v>

535
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.811
<v Speaker 3>still slaves to the whole Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary survival of the fittest,</v>

536
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.320
<v Speaker 3>natural selection sort of paradigm that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've operated under for all these many </v>

537
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 3>thousands and hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years as humans?</v>

538
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that we're giving birth </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the next thing that just like we </v>

539
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:04.391
<v Speaker 3>don't long for the days when we used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be monkeys throwing shit at each other </v>

540
00:24:04.391 --> 00:24:07.691
<v Speaker 3>from the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day we will be something different.</v>

541
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:13.211
<v Speaker 3>Whether it will be a combination of us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and these machines or whether we're </v>

542
00:24:13.211 --> 00:24:17.450
<v Speaker 3>going to augment our own intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>with some sort of artificial.</v>

543
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's some sort of a an exo brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something that's going to take us to </v>

544
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:28.331
<v Speaker 3>the or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be simply that we create </v>

545
00:24:28.331 --> 00:24:31.961
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artificial intelligence no longer has </v>

546
00:24:31.961 --> 00:24:34.961
<v Speaker 3>used for us because we're a logical and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then that becomes the new life form and </v>

547
00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:38.720
<v Speaker 3>then we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're locked hide in the cave somewhere </v>

548
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:38.720
<v Speaker 3>hoping the terminators don't get us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

549
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think like over the longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean with all of these things,</v>

550
00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:47.141
<v Speaker 3>the question of kind of timelines is </v>
<v Speaker 3>very hot and sometimes people want to </v>

551
00:24:47.141 --> 00:24:50.090
<v Speaker 3>project this discussion because Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so far in the future.</v>

552
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I think like if something </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently report we should be talking</v>

553
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:55.910
<v Speaker 3>about it even if maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

554
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.230
<v Speaker 3>decades and generations hence might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

555
00:25:00.231 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean it might not be that far away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who knows,</v>

556
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Lakewood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the atomic bomb.</v>

557
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 3>That was hugely fast progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

558
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 years.</v>

559
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 3>So we want to be prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

560
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.600
<v Speaker 3>but then has for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

561
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 3>is it going to be Homo sapiens around </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the next,</v>

562
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a thousand years' time.</v>

563
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that would just be extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>unlikely.</v>

564
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:23.830
<v Speaker 3>That will be around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think we're not going to be around </v>

565
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.830
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

566
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think if intelligent creatures </v>
<v Speaker 3>are still around,</v>

567
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:27.500
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be some in a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>years' time,</v>

568
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:29.900
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be something that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>homo sapiens.</v>

569
00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Like he said this kind of fee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

570
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.840
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like not what we would consider </v>

571
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:37.840
<v Speaker 3>consider kind of typical humans now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

572
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.240
<v Speaker 3>we're obviously severely flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

573
00:25:39.241 --> 00:25:39.830
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're,</v>

574
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ask people,</v>

575
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.360
<v Speaker 3>if you ask the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that in your lifetime you </v>

576
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.260
<v Speaker 3>can imagine a world without war?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people say no.</v>

577
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Like the vast majority of people say no </v>
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>

578
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.900
<v Speaker 3>a world without crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a world without violence,</v>

579
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.550
<v Speaker 3>a world without theft.</v>

580
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Most people say no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

581
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.230
<v Speaker 3>that just shows you how inherently </v>
<v Speaker 3>flawed.</v>

582
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Most people view the human species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that we can do it in small </v>

583
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:05.240
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

584
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.830
<v Speaker 3>like if the three of us were on an </v>
<v Speaker 3>island,</v>

585
00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure we wouldn't be stealing </v>
<v Speaker 3>from each other and murder each other,</v>

586
00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:09.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

587
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.260
<v Speaker 3>just a few of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you get to large scale,</v>

588
00:26:12.261 --> 00:26:17.261
<v Speaker 3>humanity comes very easy to disassociate</v>
<v Speaker 3>or create this diffusion of </v>

589
00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 3>responsibility where there's enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

590
00:26:20.601 --> 00:26:23.900
<v Speaker 3>So you don't really value them as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're allowed to get away with some</v>

591
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:28.901
<v Speaker 3>pretty heinous stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you consider drone </v>

592
00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:31.451
<v Speaker 3>warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that we're able to do with long </v>

593
00:26:31.451 --> 00:26:32.450
<v Speaker 3>distance where we're not seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person that we're having the effect on.</v>

594
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

595
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a very flawed thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The human species.</v>

596
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:42.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be better if something </v>

597
00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:42.150
<v Speaker 3>better came along?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

598
00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I think this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

599
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 3>sorta.</v>

600
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the case though.</v>

601
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be obsolete.</v>

602
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

603
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:48.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

604
00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.940
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be obsolete in a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years anyway.</v>

605
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:53.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as in will be dead.</v>

606
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is just,</v>

607
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll all kind of,</v>

608
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generations hence will,</v>

609
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

610
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:03.530
<v Speaker 2>The question is not really about us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about our grandchildren live.</v>

611
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.660
<v Speaker 2>It really forces the idea to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered like what is valuable about </v>

612
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is it the experience,</v>

613
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:16.080
<v Speaker 2>is it happiness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it shared fun?</v>

614
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Is it love?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is,</v>

615
00:27:18.211 --> 00:27:23.211
<v Speaker 2>what's valuable about being a person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of that is going to change if </v>

616
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 2>we're made out of something that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have created or,</v>

617
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:32.390
<v Speaker 2>or maybe were made out of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence has created </v>

618
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:33.390
<v Speaker 2>because we've created something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>far superior to us.</v>

619
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.650
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

620
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I have a view on this as you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect.</v>

621
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>

622
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:44.150
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's valuable and the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's valuable ultimately as </v>

623
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:45.490
<v Speaker 2>conscious experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's good.</v>

624
00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Like red conscious experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy happiness,</v>

625
00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:49.770
<v Speaker 2>joy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

626
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:55.070
<v Speaker 2>That's positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good for the world of negative </v>

627
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.070
<v Speaker 2>conscious experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>

628
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>distress,</v>

629
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 2>those are bad for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why,</v>

630
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:03.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing for me to do some </v>

631
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.990
<v Speaker 2>service to you to benefit you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't do anything good to benefit </v>

632
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.430
<v Speaker 2>this bottle of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

633
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 2>And so then the key question in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should we think about,</v>

634
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 2>supposing it is the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:16.230
<v Speaker 2>thousand years time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now a synthetic life.</v>

636
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 2>It's artificial intelligence or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's a,</v>

637
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

638
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.660
<v Speaker 2>like the in charge and are no longer any</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

639
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Would this be good or bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question for me is,</v>

640
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:32.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they having conscious experiences </v>

641
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.570
<v Speaker 2>and others conscious experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good or bad?</v>

642
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.980
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just conscious experience.</v>

643
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a consumer so selfish.</v>

644
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:42.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a controversial view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a thought experiment which is </v>

645
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 2>often used to challenge this view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

646
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.300
<v Speaker 2>do you want to hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

647
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.640
<v Speaker 2>So it's called the experienced machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is supposing that tomato </v>

648
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:56.450
<v Speaker 2>you could plug into this machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the most amazing vr you could </v>

649
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.770
<v Speaker 2>ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in this machine you will live,</v>

650
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.420
<v Speaker 2>let's say you live 200 years and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the most amazing bliss.</v>

651
00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:05.610
<v Speaker 2>You'll have the most amazing experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

652
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:11.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your experiences will involve </v>

653
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.681
<v Speaker 2>incredible relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible creative achievement and so </v>

654
00:29:12.681 --> 00:29:12.681
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

655
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.720
<v Speaker 2>and it'll just be like the perfect life </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could live expedientially for </v>

656
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.411
<v Speaker 2>the next 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question is in so far as </v>

657
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.580
<v Speaker 2>yourself interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so put aside considerations you might </v>

658
00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:28.580
<v Speaker 2>have about wanting to make the world a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better place,</v>

659
00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 2>but just in so far as you care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

660
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.960
<v Speaker 2>would you plug into this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bearing in mind that in a certain sense </v>

661
00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:35.960
<v Speaker 2>all of these experiences is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>fake.</v>

662
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have experiences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having amazing friendships,</v>

663
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>laying great works of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you think late works</v>

664
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 1>of art and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're.</v>

665
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.880
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just sensory inputs provided by a </v>

666
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.320
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

667
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:56.500
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you or you in so far as your self </v>

668
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 1>interested and plug into this machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you,</v>

669
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 1>what would you answer as a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>

670
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I might already be plugged into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

671
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

672
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:09.871
<v Speaker 1>so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a great question and I think </v>

673
00:30:09.871 --> 00:30:12.871
<v Speaker 1>it's a good argument against is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question will supposedly you will </v>

674
00:30:12.871 --> 00:30:12.871
<v Speaker 1>already plugged in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you unplug?</v>

675
00:30:12.871 --> 00:30:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Supposing I told you that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a banker in Monaco and fuck </v>

676
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Monaco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

677
00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

678
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

679
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Speaker 1>So can I stay plugged in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please?</v>

680
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Do I have to pay more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would have to do.</v>

681
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.210
<v Speaker 1>You would have to do nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting man.</v>

682
00:30:28.211 --> 00:30:30.760
<v Speaker 1>If people think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

683
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.720
<v Speaker 1>and it seemed like maybe yourself would </v>
<v Speaker 1>intuitively you'd say,</v>

684
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:36.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't plug into this machine.</v>

685
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would say that I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to really deeply consider it </v>

686
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.890
<v Speaker 1>because right now it's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so abstract.</v>

687
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.740
<v Speaker 1>This idea that that could be possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's.</v>

688
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.510
<v Speaker 1>It's fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were having fun,</v>

689
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.940
<v Speaker 1>but when you talk to</v>

690
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.160
<v Speaker 3>the leading minds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to virtual reality or </v>

691
00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.991
<v Speaker 3>artificial reality or simulation theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when they start talking about </v>

692
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:06.971
<v Speaker 3>what will be possible one day they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to without a doubt within a 100 </v>

693
00:31:06.971 --> 00:31:11.321
<v Speaker 3>years or 500 years or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number is there going to be able to </v>

694
00:31:11.321 --> 00:31:12.740
<v Speaker 3>create an artificial reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's indiscernible from this reality.</v>

695
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.780
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be able to feel things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be emotions that come </v>

696
00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:17.780
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going,</v>

697
00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.720
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be able to recreate </v>
<v Speaker 3>every single aspect of in everyday life.</v>

698
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

699
00:31:22.371 --> 00:31:27.371
<v Speaker 3>they're really close now and not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really close in terms of like they </v>

700
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:28.820
<v Speaker 3>don't give you emotions and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>give you feeling,</v>

701
00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:33.821
<v Speaker 3>but if you put on an htc vive and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through some of those virtual reality </v>

702
00:31:33.821 --> 00:31:36.650
<v Speaker 3>games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's bizarre how real it feels.</v>

703
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.100
<v Speaker 3>And when you go back to like playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>pong,</v>

704
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:41.450
<v Speaker 3>did you ever play Polo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

705
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.760
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

706
00:31:43.761 --> 00:31:48.380
<v Speaker 3>it's such a weird thing that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened inside of me when I was a kid.</v>

707
00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Pong came along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were blown away.</v>

708
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.860
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't believe that we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually do something on the television.</v>

709
00:31:54.861 --> 00:31:59.000
<v Speaker 3>You could see it move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so fantastic and if you gave that</v>

710
00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:00.680
<v Speaker 3>to one of my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd spit on it.</v>

711
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.920
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of pizza shit video game is </v>

712
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.531
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they would think it's just so </v>

713
00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:08.531
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to me at the time it was amazing.</v>

714
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.600
<v Speaker 3>You go from that to one of these htc </v>
<v Speaker 3>vive games which has all taken place </v>

715
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.780
<v Speaker 3>within my lifetime and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

716
00:32:14.781 --> 00:32:19.781
<v Speaker 3>a lifetime from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you follow the exponential increase </v>

717
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:20.660
<v Speaker 3>in the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technological innovation,</v>

718
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.000
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be.</v>

719
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when that does happen,</v>

720
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:30.670
<v Speaker 3>how will you be able to know if it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>indiscernible how will you know if </v>

721
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.240
<v Speaker 3>you're in it and how do you know if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not in it right now?</v>

722
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.590
<v Speaker 3>That's the real question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

723
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'll actually some arguments </v>

724
00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:39.160
<v Speaker 1>for thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

725
00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>this is nick boss than my colleague of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine simulation argument</v>

726
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 2>for thinking we are and in late now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

727
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:45.060
<v Speaker 2>it's very likely that we should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

728
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

729
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of agnostic.</v>

730
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:52.490
<v Speaker 2>I think you should take the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hypothesis seriously.</v>

731
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the,</v>

732
00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:01.610
<v Speaker 2>the argument doesn't quite go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what's attractive and what's not </v>

733
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 2>attractive about that theory to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his version of it.</v>

734
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the argument is the frame and if you </v>

735
00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 2>could like his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his argument is the,</v>

736
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 2>in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposing we believe that the human race</v>

737
00:33:14.121 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 2>doesn't go extinct or post humans don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>go extinct over the next thousand,</v>

738
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 2>few thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And secondly,</v>

739
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:25.541
<v Speaker 2>that the people in the future have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in recreating their past just </v>

740
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:30.671
<v Speaker 2>for kind of historical interest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning that they're going to be </v>

741
00:33:30.671 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 2>insistent running sync because then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>got now going to have huge,</v>

742
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:31.910
<v Speaker 2>amazing computer power.</v>

743
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be able to create </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulations of the past that,</v>

744
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:40.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to have some interest in running </v>

745
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.700
<v Speaker 2>simulations of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

746
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.220
<v Speaker 2>the number of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that is true,</v>

747
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.830
<v Speaker 2>then the number of simulations that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

748
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:50.210
<v Speaker 2>these future people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>running will vastly outnumber the number</v>

749
00:33:50.211 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 2>of actual timelines that kind of base </v>
<v Speaker 2>universes at work.</v>

750
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:58.710
<v Speaker 2>So for the one real universe where </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

751
00:33:58.711 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of unfolds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also,</v>

752
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.180
<v Speaker 2>let's call it 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>simulations of that universe.</v>

753
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.960
<v Speaker 2>And if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's the case that well,</v>

754
00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 2>given that I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

755
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:17.381
<v Speaker 2>these things nearly all and dishonorable</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the people who are inside them is </v>

756
00:34:17.381 --> 00:34:21.521
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly likely just in the base </v>
<v Speaker 2>plate that I'm going to be in a </v>

757
00:34:21.521 --> 00:34:24.200
<v Speaker 2>simulation rather than I'm in the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

758
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And what Nick Bostrom says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

759
00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:28.940
<v Speaker 2>it's not that we definitely honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation,</v>

760
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.320
<v Speaker 2>but he just points out the conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>between these three kind of beliefs that</v>

761
00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:34.460
<v Speaker 2>we seem to hold.</v>

762
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:38.770
<v Speaker 2>One is that we're not going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>extinct in the near future too,</v>

763
00:34:38.771 --> 00:34:39.530
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

764
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:44.740
<v Speaker 2>people in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have some interest in simulating </v>

765
00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.080
<v Speaker 2>the past and thirdly that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in a simulation and he himself </v>

766
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 2>gives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

767
00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:51.590
<v Speaker 2>a reasonable degree of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he thinks it's like 10 percent,</v>

768
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 2>15 percent likely that within a </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation,</v>

769
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.040
<v Speaker 2>other people who understand the argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>very a bit more,</v>

770
00:34:58.041 --> 00:34:59.400
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.250
<v Speaker 2>it's something you should at least be </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken seriously.</v>

772
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I object it is kind of,</v>

773
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

774
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.840
<v Speaker 2>even weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's somewhat technical,</v>

775
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.990
<v Speaker 2>but the basic thought is just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

776
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 2>according to like the best guesses from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cosmo monogenists,</v>

777
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 2>we're actually in an infinite universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Universe is infinitely big now.</v>

778
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.910
<v Speaker 2>We can't affect an infinitely big </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe were restricted by the speed of</v>

779
00:35:28.911 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 2>light to what we can affect and to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see.</v>

780
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the best idea according to the best </v>

781
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 2>thing that we have universities of keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>on going,</v>

782
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:44.120
<v Speaker 2>but if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's old lady like an infinite </v>

783
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.041
<v Speaker 2>number of observers of people can have </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that bottom universe and that means </v>

784
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:53.421
<v Speaker 2>that you've now got kind of an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people kind of experiencing </v>

785
00:35:53.421 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 2>things and then you've got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulations and you've got like 10,000</v>

786
00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.000
<v Speaker 2>simulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't say there's 10,000</v>

787
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.450
<v Speaker 2>times as many simulated beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that our legal beings?</v>

788
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Because there's already an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of beings.</v>

789
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.850
<v Speaker 2>You're looking so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

790
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:11.620
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

791
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead,</v>

792
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.100
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that means if you've got.</v>

793
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 2>So the key of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

794
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.540
<v Speaker 2>of Bostrom's argument was that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got 10,000</v>

795
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 2>times as many simulated beings as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have real like non simulated beings,</v>

796
00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:23.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

797
00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:28.620
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an infinite number of real beings </v>

798
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:28.620
<v Speaker 3>because the universe is infinite.</v>

799
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

800
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.960
<v Speaker 2>And so if you've already got an infinite</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of real beings,</v>

801
00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.150
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you've got 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>times infinite,</v>

802
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:36.690
<v Speaker 2>that's still infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

803
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:41.710
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a case where like our best </v>

804
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.700
<v Speaker 2>methods of assigning degrees of belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>to things kind of on out.</v>

805
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.170
<v Speaker 2>If you think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:36:45.171 --> 00:36:50.171
<v Speaker 2>there's an infinite number of simulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings and infinite number of real </v>

807
00:36:50.171 --> 00:36:54.320
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what's the chance of you being one </v>

808
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.430
<v Speaker 2>of the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we don't actually have the tools to</v>

809
00:36:55.431 --> 00:36:56.120
<v Speaker 2>be able to answer that.</v>

810
00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Neil degrasse Tyson was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain this to me a couple of weeks ago</v>

811
00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:04.530
<v Speaker 3>that there are infinities that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger than other infinities</v>

812
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's also the case,</v>

813
00:37:06.581 --> 00:37:09.240
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my roof,</v>

814
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:13.090
<v Speaker 2>my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the number,</v>

815
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:18.620
<v Speaker 2>but the key,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all talking about the lowest was </v>

816
00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:18.620
<v Speaker 2>called cardinality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the smallest infinity,</v>

817
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:25.520
<v Speaker 2>which is the size of the infinity of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the integers.</v>

818
00:37:25.521 --> 00:37:25.870
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

819
00:37:25.871 --> 00:37:26.290
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

820
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Counting numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you take that size of infinity </v>

821
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.040
<v Speaker 2>and multiply it by 10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you just get the same number,</v>

822
00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:34.350
<v Speaker 2>which is infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

823
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what Neil was saying was he had</v>

824
00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:39.070
<v Speaker 2>to at least even bigger levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>infinity.</v>

825
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.500
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at not just all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>counting numbers,</v>

826
00:37:41.501 --> 00:37:46.501
<v Speaker 2>but all of the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make fractions out of a half a </v>

827
00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:46.750
<v Speaker 2>quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an eighth and so on.</v>

828
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:51.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just more numbers than the </v>

829
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.870
<v Speaker 2>infinity of the counting numbers.</v>

830
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I've spent a lot of time trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand why human beings are so </v>

831
00:37:57.091 --> 00:38:02.091
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why human beings are so obsessed with </v>

832
00:38:02.091 --> 00:38:05.091
<v Speaker 3>technological progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I continued </v>

833
00:38:05.091 --> 00:38:08.451
<v Speaker 3>to come to is that we think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in this world as being </v>

834
00:38:08.451 --> 00:38:12.891
<v Speaker 3>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the behavior of butterflies and </v>

835
00:38:12.891 --> 00:38:12.930
<v Speaker 3>wolves and the way rivers run down from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mountain.</v>

836
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 3>But we don't think of ourselves and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>own behavior as natural.</v>

837
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.280
<v Speaker 3>We don't think of our own thirst for </v>
<v Speaker 3>conquest and innovation and and the even</v>

838
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.980
<v Speaker 3>materialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think materialism is probably a very </v>

839
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.951
<v Speaker 3>natural reaction to our need to somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>or another fuel innovation.</v>

840
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.020
<v Speaker 3>And that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the ways to ensure that </v>

841
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.641
<v Speaker 3>innovation is constantly fueled is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are constantly obsessed with </v>

842
00:38:41.641 --> 00:38:45.151
<v Speaker 3>buying new things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly obsessed with the latest and </v>

843
00:38:45.151 --> 00:38:48.031
<v Speaker 3>greatest which fuels innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at the universe itself</v>

844
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:54.060
<v Speaker 3>and you look at all the various things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we know to be natural processes in </v>

845
00:38:55.091 --> 00:39:00.091
<v Speaker 3>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tucked in order to make a human </v>

846
00:39:00.091 --> 00:39:00.091
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a star has to explode when you literally</v>

847
00:39:00.091 --> 00:39:03.220
<v Speaker 3>are made out of Stardust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is when you run that by people for</v>

848
00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:04.870
<v Speaker 3>the first time they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait what?</v>

849
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:10.110
<v Speaker 3>Like in order to you for you to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbon based life form that has to be </v>

850
00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.530
<v Speaker 3>created inside a burning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dying star.</v>

851
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.560
<v Speaker 3>And that's the only way you make this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing like what you are right now.</v>

852
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.070
<v Speaker 3>And then that thing makes artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

853
00:39:18.071 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 3>And then that thing makes perhaps even </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazier.</v>

854
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Makes I mean if you follow the ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological progress,</v>

855
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 3>if something gets to a point where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>indiscernible from reality,</v>

856
00:39:29.981 --> 00:39:34.981
<v Speaker 3>how do you know it's not a new reality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you know it's not a new kind of </v>

857
00:39:34.981 --> 00:39:38.791
<v Speaker 3>reality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Jamie sent me hip to these </v>

858
00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:42.660
<v Speaker 3>artificial worlds that people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>created online where there essentially </v>

859
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.500
<v Speaker 3>infinite and they're constantly changing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and morphing and growing.</v>

860
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.010
<v Speaker 3>And the Games are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't like them because you go go</v>

861
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:56.011
<v Speaker 3>to places and there's fucking nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and you can go to an infinite </v>

862
00:39:56.011 --> 00:39:56.011
<v Speaker 3>number of these places and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing there.</v>

863
00:39:56.011 --> 00:39:58.030
<v Speaker 3>Like these adventures are nonexistent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're on these.</v>

864
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:03.660
<v Speaker 3>You're in these gigantic fake worlds </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're traveling from place to </v>

865
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:08.221
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but right now we're looking at it in a </v>

866
00:40:08.221 --> 00:40:10.710
<v Speaker 3>very two dimensional way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at it on a flat screen </v>

867
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.710
<v Speaker 3>one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be two dimensional.</v>

868
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:15.511
<v Speaker 3>One day it's going to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're interfacing with your </v>

869
00:40:15.511 --> 00:40:19.351
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is interfacing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it only real if we can take it and </v>

870
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.550
<v Speaker 3>drop it on something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can hit it with a hammer,</v>

871
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:29.551
<v Speaker 3>if we could put it on a scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can use a measuring stick and </v>

872
00:40:29.551 --> 00:40:32.290
<v Speaker 3>measuring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it only real there or is it real?</v>

873
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:37.470
<v Speaker 3>If it follows every single check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you check off every single item </v>

874
00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:40.810
<v Speaker 3>on the list of conscious reality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious experience.</v>

875
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great question because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the dichotomy that a lot of </v>

876
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.600
<v Speaker 2>people think in terms of natural and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnatural,</v>

877
00:40:48.601 --> 00:40:50.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

878
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people firstly think this is natural and</v>

879
00:40:52.551 --> 00:40:53.700
<v Speaker 2>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

880
00:40:53.701 --> 00:40:58.080
<v Speaker 2>in a sense everything we're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural because we're like homosapiens a</v>

881
00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:02.550
<v Speaker 2>part of a natural process and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

882
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.340
<v Speaker 2>maybe in another sense everything we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is not natural.</v>

883
00:41:05.341 --> 00:41:07.230
<v Speaker 2>But then why does that matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the model?</v>

884
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.830
<v Speaker 2>The relevance of something being natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus not natural.</v>

885
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Lots of stuff that happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural world is just really awful,</v>

886
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.570
<v Speaker 2>huge amounts of cannibalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>

887
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:18.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

888
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.700
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not clear why we would care </v>

889
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.240
<v Speaker 2>about something being natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural.</v>

890
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the second question is,</v>

891
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:33.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's consider this a virtual reality </v>

892
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:33.790
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

893
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 2>this experience machine that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>plug yourself into.</v>

894
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.290
<v Speaker 2>And as part of the description I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

895
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:44.291
<v Speaker 2>none of this would be a real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have all of these interactions </v>

896
00:41:44.291 --> 00:41:44.291
<v Speaker 2>with people that you think are friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>

897
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:49.300
<v Speaker 2>but that wouldn't be avail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you could very well pushed </v>

898
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.091
<v Speaker 2>back on that and say why should </v>
<v Speaker 2>something be physically instantiated?</v>

899
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

900
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 2>in order for it to count as a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

901
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 2>why is it not the case that in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality,</v>

902
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:04.010
<v Speaker 2>your interacting with algorithms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just as much,</v>

903
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:10.750
<v Speaker 2>at least it's possible for that to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>just as much friendship as if you're </v>

904
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.020
<v Speaker 2>interacting with people who are flesh </v>
<v Speaker 2>and blood.</v>

905
00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's hard to explain kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the difference would be because you</v>

906
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:19.270
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about star trek,</v>

907
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:24.790
<v Speaker 2>usually quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be friends with data and android </v>

908
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:26.830
<v Speaker 2>is not kind of bio biological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

909
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.240
<v Speaker 2>we think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

910
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:34.870
<v Speaker 2>you can still have kind of worth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>friendships and so on with creatures </v>

911
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:36.230
<v Speaker 2>that are not made of kind of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology,</v>

912
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:41.770
<v Speaker 2>in which case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is the fact that something merely </v>

913
00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:41.770
<v Speaker 2>lives on silicone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't.</v>

914
00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of seemingly merely </v>
<v Speaker 2>software.</v>

915
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.680
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't have kind of a genuine </v>

916
00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.200
<v Speaker 2>friendship with that thing if it the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Actin is sufficiently sophisticated </v>

917
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:53.200
<v Speaker 2>way perhaps</v>

918
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 3>isn't there also an issue with are </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly limited ability to view </v>

919
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.420
<v Speaker 3>reality itself because we're only </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewing the dimensions that are relevant</v>

920
00:43:00.421 --> 00:43:04.080
<v Speaker 3>to us in this current state of carbon </v>
<v Speaker 3>based life form.</v>

921
00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 3>This curt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is talking monkey claim to the </v>

922
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:10.710
<v Speaker 3>spaceship flying through the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

923
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 3>this is what's important to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you pay attention to those </v>

924
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:19.430
<v Speaker 3>dudes who write on yellow legal pads and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get into quantum physics and they </v>

925
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.670
<v Speaker 3>have all those crazy equations that </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody but them understands,</v>

926
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.190
<v Speaker 3>maybe you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at that shit and I go,</v>

927
00:43:23.191 --> 00:43:26.220
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are they writing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they believe,</v>

928
00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the current model?</v>

929
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:32.710
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe there's at least 11 </v>

930
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.521
<v Speaker 3>dimensions that perhaps could be more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if there is a dimension that you </v>

931
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:37.290
<v Speaker 3>can plug into that it's purely </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness driven,</v>

932
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.710
<v Speaker 3>meaning there's no physical experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no touching the ground.</v>

933
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:46.010
<v Speaker 3>There's no gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you exist in a conscious state and </v>

934
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:49.671
<v Speaker 3>it's perpetual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you take a rocket ship and it </v>

935
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:52.020
<v Speaker 3>gets past our gravity and shoots off </v>
<v Speaker 3>into distance space and you have a clear</v>

936
00:43:52.021 --> 00:43:53.130
<v Speaker 3>shot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

937
00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:58.131
<v Speaker 3>14 billion years back to the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the universe itself with nothing in </v>

938
00:43:58.131 --> 00:44:00.590
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to keep going for $14,</v>

939
00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:02.520
<v Speaker 3>billion light years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to keep going.</v>

940
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.880
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if there is a place that your </v>

941
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:07.880
<v Speaker 3>consciousness can go to like that where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't,</v>

942
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.300
<v Speaker 3>it's no longer burdened by biology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the timeline of birth to death,</v>

943
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:17.630
<v Speaker 3>by the limitations of the flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But consciousness itself can exist in </v>

944
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.360
<v Speaker 3>some bizarre dimension that we just have</v>
<v Speaker 3>an access to.</v>

945
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.830
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

946
00:44:22.831 --> 00:44:27.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think consciousness is probably just </v>

947
00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:30.020
<v Speaker 2>ultimately a physical process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that in a ultimately </v>

948
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.620
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] of a conservation of energy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

949
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.970
<v Speaker 2>the reason being so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

950
00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:38.760
<v Speaker 2>this is age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old philosophical debate between,</v>

951
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:43.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motorists and lists people who think</v>

952
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 2>is consciousness just ultimately some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of physical process or is it </v>

953
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 2>something special?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So descartes thought there was this,</v>

954
00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old grant gland.</v>

955
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.500
<v Speaker 2>There's a little bit of your brain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your conscious kind of soul was just </v>

956
00:44:57.601 --> 00:45:02.601
<v Speaker 2>going to steering your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like monkey body free with this pineal </v>

957
00:45:02.601 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 2>gland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the question is just for why I think</v>

958
00:45:05.821 --> 00:45:10.260
<v Speaker 2>the strongest argument about why that </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be right is it seems to be like</v>

959
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 2>it would have to be creating energy out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of nowhere and we've never.</v>

960
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:20.190
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be just fixed law of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe that just can't happen because </v>

961
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.740
<v Speaker 2>in order for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

962
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:26.430
<v Speaker 2>this conscious mind to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's not merely a physical process,</v>

963
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:31.431
<v Speaker 2>if it's not just the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order for that to be able to effect </v>

964
00:45:31.431 --> 00:45:34.611
<v Speaker 2>what this physical entity is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have to use energy to be able </v>

965
00:45:34.611 --> 00:45:34.611
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

966
00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:40.110
<v Speaker 2>So the energy would have to be coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>from somewhere and if it's not coming </v>

967
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.531
<v Speaker 2>from just the physical realm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then suddenly we've got this counter </v>

968
00:45:43.531 --> 00:45:43.531
<v Speaker 2>examples to all the rest of science</v>

969
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:48.710
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you aware of the theories of human </v>

970
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.290
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitters being pathways to </v>
<v Speaker 3>other dimensions,</v>

971
00:45:50.291 --> 00:45:52.630
<v Speaker 3>like dimethyltryptamine didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>about all that.</v>

972
00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

973
00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:58.951
<v Speaker 3>I know about the empty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what it's produced in the </v>

974
00:45:58.951 --> 00:46:01.141
<v Speaker 3>pineal gland where descartes thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>that all that stuff was going on the </v>

975
00:46:01.141 --> 00:46:02.830
<v Speaker 3>seat of the soul with the Egyptians </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the eye of horus.</v>

976
00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 3>The reason why the Catholics and so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient religions were so focused on </v>

977
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.050
<v Speaker 3>pine cones and their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their art and their,</v>

978
00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.100
<v Speaker 3>their imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the pineal gland.</v>

979
00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.070
<v Speaker 3>That's the image of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's supposed to represent.</v>

980
00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 3>And for people who've had these intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transformative psychedelic experiences </v>

981
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.870
<v Speaker 3>by consuming exogenous </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine,</v>

982
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:26.110
<v Speaker 3>which is produced by the brain that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have these insane,</v>

983
00:46:26.111 --> 00:46:31.111
<v Speaker 3>transformative experiences where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like you are traveling to other </v>

984
00:46:31.111 --> 00:46:31.111
<v Speaker 3>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

985
00:46:31.111 --> 00:46:31.960
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

986
00:46:31.961 --> 00:46:33.790
<v Speaker 3>I do want to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you done any of that?</v>

987
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done DMT,</v>

988
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:38.230
<v Speaker 3>son of eventual not what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're wasting your time.</v>

989
00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I know that's a good way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

990
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 3>but it's something that's in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

991
00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:46.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a natural product of a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology.</v>

992
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:51.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's natural or not isn't the </v>

993
00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:51.830
<v Speaker 2>question just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

994
00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to have a career based on </v>

995
00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:54.860
<v Speaker 2>my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be very careful to,</v>

996
00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:55.690
<v Speaker 2>to not break it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not be okay.</v>

997
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

998
00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's one of the most transient drugs</v>

999
00:46:58.121 --> 00:47:03.121
<v Speaker 3>ever observed in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body brings it back to baseline in </v>

1000
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:03.121
<v Speaker 3>like 15 minutes.</v>

1001
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:03.121
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1002
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1003
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:04.570
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of.</v>

1004
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I do think there's like tons of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>very often,</v>

1005
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.810
<v Speaker 2>greatly overestimate the risks of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonlegal blogs,</v>

1006
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.000
<v Speaker 2>like mdms like super safe and so on.</v>

1007
00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Very overestimate the list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the risks that you're saying.</v>

1008
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the MTMA yeah.</v>

1009
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Weird,</v>

1010
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one.</v>

1011
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:26.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not a natural drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dimethyltryptamine.</v>

1012
00:47:26.041 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 3>I think the real concern would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological because what you face</v>

1013
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:35.130
<v Speaker 1>is so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna Mckenna had the best </v>

1014
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:35.130
<v Speaker 1>quote about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said that,</v>

1015
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would risk death by astonishment.</v>

1016
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1017
00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:40.320
<v Speaker 1>So their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1018
00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:45.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so bizarre that it's almost a sin </v>

1019
00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 1>for a guy as smart as you did not </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience it,</v>

1020
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 1>but will you just come right back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1021
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 1>even when you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there mean to you.</v>

1022
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:54.901
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness dissolves into some </v>

1023
00:47:54.901 --> 00:47:59.310
<v Speaker 1>bizarre quasi living state and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to like work your way back to being</v>

1024
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:00.670
<v Speaker 1>you again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're,</v>

1025
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:03.790
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're will macaskill in the dimension,</v>

1026
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.940
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's crazy about it is that this </v>

1027
00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.421
<v Speaker 1>is produced in the very area where </v>
<v Speaker 1>descartes was believing the seat of the </v>

1028
00:48:12.421 --> 00:48:15.060
<v Speaker 1>soul is in so many different eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>religions and all,</v>

1029
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:19.630
<v Speaker 1>all this psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all these different,</v>

1030
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:25.290
<v Speaker 1>all these different religions and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different cultures,</v>

1031
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:30.840
<v Speaker 1>they were all convinced at that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>gland had some massive significance in </v>

1032
00:48:31.481 --> 00:48:34.690
<v Speaker 1>terms of the spirit and the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>

1033
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Whatever spirit means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1034
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:38.860
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is just in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

1035
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:44.250
<v Speaker 1>is it the case that you'll like seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>into genuinely seeing into another </v>

1036
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:48.391
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it the case that just have a new </v>

1037
00:48:48.391 --> 00:48:50.971
<v Speaker 1>kind of perspective on consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one thing I do think is that in terms</v>

1038
00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:56.161
<v Speaker 1>of conscious experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this the sort of conscious experiences </v>

1039
00:48:56.161 --> 00:48:58.801
<v Speaker 1>that humans have access to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that must just be point </v>

1040
00:48:58.801 --> 00:48:58.801
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

1041
00:48:58.801 --> 00:49:01.690
<v Speaker 1>one percent of the entire landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible conscious experiences.</v>

1042
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:07.220
<v Speaker 1>So if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if you have a bat and you could </v>

1043
00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.091
<v Speaker 1>echo locate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a radically different </v>

1044
00:49:09.091 --> 00:49:12.121
<v Speaker 1>conscious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that maps on to any sort </v>

1045
00:49:12.121 --> 00:49:12.121
<v Speaker 1>of conscious experience that humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have.</v>

1046
00:49:12.121 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen people do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blind people can do that.</v>

1047
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:16.630
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is amazing.</v>

1048
00:49:16.631 --> 00:49:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Very effectively too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like shockingly effectively.</v>

1049
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're absolutely right.</v>

1050
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also experiences,</v>

1051
00:49:23.981 --> 00:49:28.981
<v Speaker 1>human experiences that are available </v>
<v Speaker 1>without drugs that some people have </v>

1052
00:49:28.981 --> 00:49:31.930
<v Speaker 1>achieved through radical states of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation and Kundalini Yoga where they</v>

1053
00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:34.300
<v Speaker 1>could achieve natural psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>

1054
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.180
<v Speaker 1>holotropic breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have done that.</v>

1055
00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:42.181
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced like really radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological transformations and </v>

1056
00:49:42.181 --> 00:49:44.500
<v Speaker 1>incredible psychedelic experiences from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as well.</v>

1057
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think like,</v>

1058
00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:51.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of experiences are very </v>

1059
00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:51.980
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

1060
00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they,</v>

1061
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that maybe we experienced this </v>

1062
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.181
<v Speaker 1>point zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent of all possible conscious </v>

1063
00:50:00.181 --> 00:50:02.191
<v Speaker 1>experiences and that just allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do like see a little bit more of this </v>

1064
00:50:02.191 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 1>potential vast landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1065
00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:08.980
<v Speaker 1>well as I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's nothing on magical </v>

1066
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.181
<v Speaker 1>about saying ultimately that's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained in terms of physics in terms </v>

1067
00:50:12.181 --> 00:50:15.481
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different sorts of neurons firing and </v>

1068
00:50:15.481 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 1>differences once have a transmit as and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

1069
00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:17.500
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1070
00:50:17.501 --> 00:50:22.501
<v Speaker 1>and it's also this other thing which </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks all the known laws of physics </v>

1071
00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:25.060
<v Speaker 1>that you're seeing into some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

1072
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:27.130
<v Speaker 1>In order for that to be an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing.</v>

1073
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:33.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm a as unscientific to say we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost nothing about consciousness in </v>

1074
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 2>terms of the areas of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>inquiry.</v>

1075
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:40.630
<v Speaker 2>We have no understanding at all about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between conscious </v>

1076
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.100
<v Speaker 2>experiences and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1077
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:46.790
<v Speaker 2>what we would think of as physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>processes.</v>

1078
00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:49.190
<v Speaker 2>We really have no idea about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1079
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:54.250
<v Speaker 2>if you take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me any sufficiently complicated </v>

1080
00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:54.250
<v Speaker 2>physical processes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1081
00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:58.441
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are conscious and which are not </v>

1082
00:50:58.441 --> 00:50:58.441
<v Speaker 2>all we can go on is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm conscious.</v>

1083
00:50:58.441 --> 00:51:03.370
<v Speaker 2>And so I know the things that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>liked me or probably conscious too and </v>

1084
00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:04.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the best we've got really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1085
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:07.960
<v Speaker 2>and this is known as a hard problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and force.</v>

1086
00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:12.980
<v Speaker 2>It was often say they've solved it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and I think it's always </v>

1087
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.121
<v Speaker 2>begging the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should be very open to the </v>

1088
00:51:16.121 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 2>fact that I'm just as in um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1089
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.780
<v Speaker 2>3000 BC people had no idea about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws of physics.</v>

1090
00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:23.030
<v Speaker 2>This was just completely unexplored </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>

1091
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.690
<v Speaker 2>We should think contemporary science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just a big,</v>

1092
00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:31.840
<v Speaker 2>like a big black gap in our scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>

1093
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:34.580
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps it's something maybe 21st </v>
<v Speaker 2>century science,</v>

1094
00:51:34.581 --> 00:51:37.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe 22nd century science can really </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to grips with.</v>

1095
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does seem like the ultimate question,</v>

1096
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:45.110
<v Speaker 3>like what is it for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it here?</v>

1097
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:47.510
<v Speaker 3>What controls it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it in the mind?</v>

1098
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Is it external?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the brain just to an antenna that </v>

1099
00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.321
<v Speaker 3>tunes into consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dimethyltryptamine question is so </v>

1100
00:51:56.541 --> 00:52:01.541
<v Speaker 3>bizarre because it's the most potent </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drug known to man and your </v>

1101
00:52:01.541 --> 00:52:01.541
<v Speaker 3>brain man.</v>

1102
00:52:01.541 --> 00:52:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Except for I didn't know if this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>myth I've heard.</v>

1103
00:52:04.901 --> 00:52:06.940
<v Speaker 2>It's what gets made when you die.</v>

1104
00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The third,</v>

1105
00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:12.890
<v Speaker 3>they believe that during high rates of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress where your body believes you're </v>

1106
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.540
<v Speaker 3>going to die and when your dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in heavy rem sleep,</v>

1107
00:52:15.541 --> 00:52:17.810
<v Speaker 3>your body produces larger amounts of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

1108
00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:20.820
<v Speaker 3>than baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they don't know.</v>

1109
00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:22.590
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really difficult.</v>

1110
00:52:22.591 --> 00:52:25.230
<v Speaker 3>They've only just now within the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>few years,</v>

1111
00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.510
<v Speaker 3>the Cottonwood Research Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1112
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1113
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Dr Rick Strassman has a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who wrote the book Dmt,</v>

1114
00:52:34.591 --> 00:52:38.490
<v Speaker 3>the spirit molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did a bunch of the first FDA approved</v>

1115
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:44.150
<v Speaker 3>drug trials with civilians where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>took people and they gave them a </v>

1116
00:52:45.361 --> 00:52:47.250
<v Speaker 3>schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one drug dimethyltryptamine,</v>

1117
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.640
<v Speaker 3>which is so crazy that it's a schedule </v>
<v Speaker 3>one drug that your body produces,</v>

1118
00:52:50.641 --> 00:52:55.641
<v Speaker 3>but they gave it to be bull </v>
<v Speaker 3>intravenously over the course of several</v>

1119
00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:02.480
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they documented all the different </v>

1120
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:02.480
<v Speaker 3>trips and all the different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1121
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:06.060
<v Speaker 3>the different commonalities that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people had in their experiences and he's</v>

1122
00:53:06.541 --> 00:53:11.541
<v Speaker 3>working very closely with the cottonwood</v>
<v Speaker 3>research foundation and one of the </v>

1123
00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:14.571
<v Speaker 3>things that they found is that they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently discovered it was just </v>

1124
00:53:14.571 --> 00:53:15.450
<v Speaker 3>anecdotal evidence that it was produced </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the pineal gland.</v>

1125
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.390
<v Speaker 3>We knew the DMT was produced by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>liver and the lungs,</v>

1126
00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:21.600
<v Speaker 3>but now they know for sure because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've isolated it in rats.</v>

1127
00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.840
<v Speaker 3>So in living rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that they produce dmt with the</v>

1128
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:25.860
<v Speaker 3>gland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

1129
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 3>that explains a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1130
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:32.870
<v Speaker 3>ancient eastern mysticism and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbology this holy symbols that people </v>

1131
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:37.020
<v Speaker 3>had to represent this gland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they know,</v>

1132
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:42.021
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is definitely does produce </v>

1133
00:53:42.021 --> 00:53:42.021
<v Speaker 3>this incredibly potent psychedelic drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now the cross,</v>

1134
00:53:42.021 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 3>the question is at what levels during </v>
<v Speaker 3>what periods of stress,</v>

1135
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:51.290
<v Speaker 3>like how do you have to bring someone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point of death before they </v>

1136
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.230
<v Speaker 3>experienced this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that is the case,</v>

1137
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:56.370
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that consciousness itself</v>
<v Speaker 3>is something that we,</v>

1138
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:58.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since we haven't really figured out what</v>

1139
00:53:58.321 --> 00:54:03.321
<v Speaker 3>exactly it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that consciousness can </v>

1140
00:54:03.321 --> 00:54:06.741
<v Speaker 3>travel through this chemical pathway </v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe these intense </v>

1141
00:54:06.741 --> 00:54:11.660
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine experiences are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact a gateway to what people have </v>

1142
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:14.460
<v Speaker 3>assumed exists from the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1143
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:18.150
<v Speaker 3>like an afterlife or a sea of souls or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1144
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:23.151
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some stage of existence other than this </v>

1145
00:54:23.151 --> 00:54:24.840
<v Speaker 3>physical existence that we all </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience right now.</v>

1146
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

1147
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.260
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'd be crazy talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1148
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 3>It's as big they see</v>

1149
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:32.200
<v Speaker 2>coming out of my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

1150
00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:33.880
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude?</v>

1151
00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think I just be suppliers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness was just this one </v>

1152
00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:42.601
<v Speaker 2>chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more likely that </v>

1153
00:54:42.601 --> 00:54:44.701
<v Speaker 2>something is this emergent phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>from this incredibly complex system of,</v>

1154
00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of different neurons filing in </v>

1155
00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:52.231
<v Speaker 2>a certain way and when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain process that sufficiently </v>

1156
00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:55.010
<v Speaker 2>complex in the right way somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just this big black box that</v>

1157
00:54:55.011 --> 00:55:00.011
<v Speaker 2>we've got no idea about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow subjective experience comes out </v>

1158
00:55:00.011 --> 00:55:00.250
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it would seem,</v>

1159
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean otherwise the issue is you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have just dmt to traveling and just a </v>

1160
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.330
<v Speaker 2>test tube or something and petri dish </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it would seem like,</v>

1161
00:55:07.331 --> 00:55:08.920
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this petri dish?</v>

1162
00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm conscious that would seem the least </v>
<v Speaker 2>lane.</v>

1163
00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:15.140
<v Speaker 3>Why would that be the case?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're breathing air and you're,</v>

1164
00:55:15.141 --> 00:55:16.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the air keeps you alive,</v>

1165
00:55:16.971 --> 00:55:21.971
<v Speaker 3>like you're breathing in and breathing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't think that air carries </v>

1166
00:55:21.971 --> 00:55:22.020
<v Speaker 3>the life with it to another place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1167
00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Era is just a component of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that your body requires.</v>

1168
00:55:25.341 --> 00:55:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.620
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's the case though.</v>

1170
00:55:28.621 --> 00:55:33.621
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel I'd be surprised if it was like </v>

1171
00:55:33.621 --> 00:55:33.621
<v Speaker 2>this chemical is necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and stuff.</v>

1172
00:55:33.621 --> 00:55:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that's necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I am curious as to how </v>

1173
00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.000
<v Speaker 3>consciousness varies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness,</v>

1174
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:44.330
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and the actual feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being alive varies depending upon your </v>

1175
00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:46.170
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depending behind stress levels,</v>

1176
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.440
<v Speaker 3>depending upon love and happiness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different factors change the </v>

1177
00:55:51.511 --> 00:55:56.511
<v Speaker 3>way you view the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really interesting because in </v>

1178
00:55:56.511 --> 00:55:59.100
<v Speaker 3>in effect that change is consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can be more.</v>

1179
00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be more elevated,</v>

1180
00:56:01.111 --> 00:56:06.111
<v Speaker 3>like you can guarantee you all of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect of altruism that you're </v>

1181
00:56:06.111 --> 00:56:10.551
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on is somehow another </v>
<v Speaker 3>elevating your consciousness because </v>

1182
00:56:10.551 --> 00:56:13.761
<v Speaker 3>you're putting out so much love and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much happiness and you are helping so </v>

1183
00:56:13.761 --> 00:56:18.621
<v Speaker 3>many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many positive benefits to </v>

1184
00:56:18.621 --> 00:56:18.621
<v Speaker 3>your very existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to manage,</v>

1185
00:56:18.621 --> 00:56:23.601
<v Speaker 3>I've got to believe rather than somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>or another that manages to come back to </v>

1186
00:56:23.601 --> 00:56:23.601
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1187
00:56:23.601 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely comes back</v>

1188
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.070
<v Speaker 3>to me in kind of how I feel about my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1189
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were talking about how,</v>

1190
00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:31.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1191
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 3>money is just not the key to a happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1192
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:34.030
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1193
00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:39.031
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the answers are having a great </v>

1194
00:56:39.031 --> 00:56:39.031
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1195
00:56:39.031 --> 00:56:41.590
<v Speaker 3>having a greater purpose in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling like you're making a difference.</v>

1196
00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:45.730
<v Speaker 3>So all of these reasons of why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've built up this kind of community</v>

1197
00:56:45.731 --> 00:56:47.960
<v Speaker 3>around effective altruism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1198
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:53.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people all around the world who are </v>

1199
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:53.100
<v Speaker 3>making a significant change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1200
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:57.361
<v Speaker 3>donating 10 percent of the income to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>charities they think are most effective </v>

1201
00:56:57.361 --> 00:56:58.630
<v Speaker 3>or pursuing a career that we think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really effective.</v>

1202
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.360
<v Speaker 3>And one thing I wasn't surprising from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outset,</v>

1203
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 3>but I'm so happy happened is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a strong community is formed.</v>

1204
00:57:05.201 --> 00:57:10.201
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like a little global </v>
<v Speaker 3>village or something and people have </v>

1205
00:57:10.201 --> 00:57:13.420
<v Speaker 3>found the actually far from being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice as you might have expected,</v>

1206
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:18.010
<v Speaker 3>was actually incredibly rewarding </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you've now got this community of</v>

1207
00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:23.011
<v Speaker 3>people who have shared aims to you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all working towards this greater </v>

1208
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 3>goal.</v>

1209
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's something that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>very lacking in the world today.</v>

1210
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:31.360
<v Speaker 3>So many people just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they work nine to five and you know,</v>

1211
00:57:31.361 --> 00:57:34.230
<v Speaker 3>they have a nice time on the weekends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're like,</v>

1212
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:39.270
<v Speaker 3>where there's all of this going and at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of my life am I really going to </v>

1213
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.270
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1214
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:43.620
<v Speaker 3>I made the most of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you think at the end of your </v>

1215
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:43.620
<v Speaker 3>life like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

1216
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:47.581
<v Speaker 3>I dedicated my life to helping others </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had this transformative impact on </v>

1217
00:57:47.581 --> 00:57:51.961
<v Speaker 3>thousands of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to think at the end of </v>

1218
00:57:51.961 --> 00:57:51.961
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gee,</v>

1219
00:57:51.961 --> 00:57:56.100
<v Speaker 3>I really wasted that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just something I don't think you </v>

1220
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.011
<v Speaker 3>can really look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go deep though down the </v>

1221
00:57:59.011 --> 00:58:01.401
<v Speaker 3>philosophical rabbit hole and you really</v>
<v Speaker 3>consider that life is this temporary </v>

1222
00:58:02.671 --> 00:58:07.671
<v Speaker 3>experience and even benefiting someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this temporary experience is </v>

1223
00:58:07.671 --> 00:58:12.081
<v Speaker 3>still a temporary experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you are helping somebody gave </v>

1224
00:58:12.081 --> 00:58:15.291
<v Speaker 3>them a pillow for the ride and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>temporary ride and the ride comes to an </v>

1225
00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:19.731
<v Speaker 3>end and then what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what is the point of all this </v>

1226
00:58:19.731 --> 00:58:22.791
<v Speaker 3>like what is the point of effective </v>
<v Speaker 3>altruism if you're just helping people </v>

1227
00:58:22.791 --> 00:58:24.000
<v Speaker 3>during this temporary ride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to</v>

1228
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.430
<v Speaker 2>mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.340
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1230
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:28.370
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have loads.</v>

1231
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.320
<v Speaker 2>I can do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just raise up.</v>

1232
00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I just go with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was freak myself out.</v>

1233
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do get freaked out at this,</v>

1234
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:44.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think of cosmic is essential </v>

1235
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.800
<v Speaker 2>and so thanks to existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's two.</v>

1236
00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it was two emphasis yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1237
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 2>The first is that the light is the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

1238
00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:59.340
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think the purpose of life is to </v>

1239
00:58:59.340 --> 00:58:59.340
<v Speaker 2>increase the amount of happiness and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>juice,</v>

1240
00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:03.481
<v Speaker 2>the amount of suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the final goal is good experiences and </v>

1241
00:59:03.481 --> 00:59:04.120
<v Speaker 2>the kind of anti goal is bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

1242
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:07.000
<v Speaker 2>So when we're sitting here talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a great time,</v>

1243
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.360
<v Speaker 2>this is us kind of achieving getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>points in the wind.</v>

1244
00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:13.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm counter so we're having to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1245
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:14.140
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1246
00:59:14.141 --> 00:59:16.240
<v Speaker 2>if we were really hating this then we'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be losing.</v>

1247
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Well even more so because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcasting this live and millions of </v>

1248
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.720
<v Speaker 3>people are gonna hear it and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 3>not having hopefully that enjoying it.</v>

1249
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe if they're not at least a </v>

1250
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:28.750
<v Speaker 3>little stress relief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe they're at the gym and I go,</v>

1251
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 3>these fucking idiots when they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>squats and they're getting angry.</v>

1252
00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that's the first thing,</v>

1253
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.760
<v Speaker 2>but then the second thing is I'm late to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea of cosmic significance where </v>

1254
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Juan often motivate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>

1255
00:59:43.841 --> 00:59:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we're just along for the ride.</v>

1256
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.740
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to get eaten up by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sun eventually and so on.</v>

1257
00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:53.010
<v Speaker 2>What's the calculator?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Purpose of life by actually think what </v>

1258
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:56.551
<v Speaker 2>are some ways that our actions now can </v>
<v Speaker 2>have much greater cosmic significance </v>

1259
00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:02.730
<v Speaker 2>and that's if that's because I think if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that the human race survives </v>

1260
01:00:04.571 --> 01:00:09.571
<v Speaker 2>for the next few centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems kind of inevitable that we're </v>

1261
01:00:09.571 --> 01:00:10.060
<v Speaker 2>going to spend to the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1262
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:12.250
<v Speaker 2>and I think that would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1263
01:00:12.251 --> 01:00:17.251
<v Speaker 2>from this perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can go into more arguments if you </v>

1264
01:00:17.251 --> 01:00:19.891
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just saying what we want to do is </v>

1265
01:00:19.891 --> 01:00:21.871
<v Speaker 2>promote happiness and reduce suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that means we can live on other </v>

1266
01:00:22.211 --> 01:00:25.210
<v Speaker 2>planets as well and have kind of fiving </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations there.</v>

1267
01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Not only were the people are having </v>
<v Speaker 2>great lives but also making scientific </v>

1268
01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:33.850
<v Speaker 2>artistic contributions and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's a good thing to do as well.</v>

1269
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no technological reason for </v>

1270
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.870
<v Speaker 2>thinking that we won't be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the future.</v>

1271
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm given current late to technological </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress unless something really bad </v>

1272
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.330
<v Speaker 2>happens along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this kind of gets back to one of the</v>

1273
01:00:46.331 --> 01:00:51.331
<v Speaker 2>things we talked about right at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>start was one of the focus areas of the </v>

1274
01:00:52.361 --> 01:00:54.650
<v Speaker 2>effective altruism community is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>turnover.</v>

1275
01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Juice risks from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of human extinction,</v>

1276
01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:01.900
<v Speaker 2>of global catastrophic risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the sorts of things that could</v>

1277
01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:07.000
<v Speaker 2>imperil the human journey as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1278
01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.330
<v Speaker 2>and I think if you're working to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mitigate some of these things,</v>

1279
01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:14.500
<v Speaker 2>then you're increasing the chance that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do get to the sort of level where,</v>

1280
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1281
01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity can have a five in the future,</v>

1282
01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:22.540
<v Speaker 2>not just on this planet but on other </v>
<v Speaker 2>planets as well.</v>

1283
01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.960
<v Speaker 2>And that actually means your actions </v>
<v Speaker 2>really do have this huge cosmic </v>

1284
01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.160
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the conscious effort to be</v>

1285
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:31.920
<v Speaker 3>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1286
01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:36.921
<v Speaker 3>a generous person and effective altruism</v>
<v Speaker 3>spreads and it impacts people.</v>

1287
01:01:37.051 --> 01:01:42.051
<v Speaker 3>There's this ripple effect and your good</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeds could perhaps fuel enough people </v>

1288
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:49.370
<v Speaker 3>with this thought and with effective </v>
<v Speaker 3>altruism and more people might act on </v>

1289
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:54.261
<v Speaker 3>that to the point where we reduced the </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of suffering to the point where </v>

1290
01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:57.711
<v Speaker 3>we extend the lifespan of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We extend the areas where we have no </v>

1291
01:01:58.111 --> 01:02:00.720
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We reduced the amount of violence to the</v>

1292
01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:05.721
<v Speaker 3>point where we can successfully innovate</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point where we can get off this </v>

1293
01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:05.721
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

1294
01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:07.440
<v Speaker 3>And then start from scratch with a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictator on Mars,</v>

1295
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

1296
01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:10.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1297
01:02:10.891 --> 01:02:12.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think the boat,</v>

1298
01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:16.230
<v Speaker 3>none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mars will become president of Mas.</v>

1299
01:02:16.231 --> 01:02:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I'd be pretty happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Fascinating if we'd have to go to war</v>

1300
01:02:18.661 --> 01:02:19.410
<v Speaker 3>with Maurice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1301
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Do you think though the.</v>

1302
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've wondered about this many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>

1303
01:02:23.431 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's an outdated idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of traveling to the stars.</v>

1304
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:32.030
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go back to this whole inter </v>

1305
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.640
<v Speaker 3>dimensional thing that I wonder if </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the reason why we have never been</v>

1306
01:02:32.641 --> 01:02:36.270
<v Speaker 3>visited by other planets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by species from another planet.</v>

1307
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they develop artificial realities.</v>

1308
01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like Jamie was talking about to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>with these artificial computer </v>

1309
01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.060
<v Speaker 3>realities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

1310
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:51.140
<v Speaker 3>if someone develops some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>matrix like world where you can plug </v>

1311
01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:55.461
<v Speaker 3>into an experience and an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of things in an infinite number </v>

1312
01:02:55.461 --> 01:02:58.260
<v Speaker 3>of artificially created dimensions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are indistinguishable from this,</v>

1313
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:03.980
<v Speaker 3>why would you want to like risk a six </v>
<v Speaker 3>month trip and a metal tube to another </v>

1314
01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.640
<v Speaker 3>planet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe that's really retro.</v>

1315
01:03:05.641 --> 01:03:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's a really ancient way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at things.</v>

1316
01:03:08.101 --> 01:03:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's like Zepplins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like big flying balloons instead of,</v>

1317
01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:12.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1318
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:17.710
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question you raised is called the </v>

1319
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Fermi paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just given this.</v>

1320
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.680
<v Speaker 2>So 100 billion stars in our galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>m 8 billion galaxies in the effect </v>

1321
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:27.950
<v Speaker 2>double universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 billion in the observable universe.</v>

1322
01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nfs is also the old 15 billion years</v>

1323
01:03:31.431 --> 01:03:36.431
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it was the case that life is very </v>

1324
01:03:36.431 --> 01:03:38.700
<v Speaker 2>common that it's very easy for us to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1325
01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:43.400
<v Speaker 2>life to then developed a level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced technological ability.</v>

1326
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:46.850
<v Speaker 2>We should expect to see evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens all over the Bronx.</v>

1327
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.120
<v Speaker 2>But yet we see absolutely none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means that from somewhere from </v>

1328
01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.340
<v Speaker 2>a habitable planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere along the path from habitable </v>

1329
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.760
<v Speaker 2>planet to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of space fanning civilization,</v>

1330
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:04.120
<v Speaker 2>there must be some big filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There must be some step that's just </v>

1331
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.201
<v Speaker 2>incredibly hard for that to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And can I be unlikely that civilization </v>

1332
01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.550
<v Speaker 2>musome or life moves from that step to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

1333
01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.310
<v Speaker 2>And one hypothesis is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1334
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:18.430
<v Speaker 2>like people just society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Civilization gets to sufficiently </v>

1335
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:21.320
<v Speaker 2>advanced level and they just chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just go internally.</v>

1336
01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go and tunnel.</v>

1337
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:27.320
<v Speaker 2>The issue with that explanation I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's just not long enough because,</v>

1338
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:30.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to think that that's for this</v>

1339
01:04:30.591 --> 01:04:33.260
<v Speaker 2>kind of filter to work has to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really filter.</v>

1340
01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1341
01:04:34.551 --> 01:04:37.550
<v Speaker 2>As in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many stars,</v>

1342
01:04:37.551 --> 01:04:40.820
<v Speaker 2>so many earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many seemingly habitable planets.</v>

1343
01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be the case that it's </v>

1344
01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.020
<v Speaker 2>exceptionally unlikely at some stage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other like,</v>

1345
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.850
<v Speaker 2>and not just really unlikely as in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1346
01:04:49.851 --> 01:04:53.960
<v Speaker 2>one in a trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlikely to,</v>

1347
01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:59.290
<v Speaker 2>on this path for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>habitable planet to space fading </v>

1348
01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:00.860
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you'd have to think of a trillion</v>

1349
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:04.250
<v Speaker 2>civilizations that get to this level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological ability,</v>

1350
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.230
<v Speaker 2>the old shoes to turn inward.</v>

1351
01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:08.690
<v Speaker 2>And that seems very unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like,</v>

1352
01:05:08.691 --> 01:05:11.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least one word really spread out.</v>

1353
01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.750
<v Speaker 2>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'd see evidence of that.</v>

1354
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because cosmically speaking the time for</v>

1355
01:05:19.101 --> 01:05:24.101
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting to the level of </v>

1356
01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:26.191
<v Speaker 2>technological capability where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend to the stars and the level where </v>

1357
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 2>we'd be able to get to see real evidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that is kind of small.</v>

1358
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
<v Speaker 2>So I actually think that the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't see aliens is because the very </v>

1359
01:05:36.011 --> 01:05:41.011
<v Speaker 2>first stages of life and incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unlikely the move from nothing to kind </v>

1360
01:05:41.551 --> 01:05:46.551
<v Speaker 2>of basic application.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then secondly to move from single </v>

1361
01:05:46.551 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 2>celled organisms to multicellular </v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms.</v>

1362
01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:54.300
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for thinking this is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlikely is it took an incredibly long </v>

1363
01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:58.201
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on earth billions of years before </v>

1364
01:05:58.201 --> 01:06:01.501
<v Speaker 2>this happened and in particular in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>move from single cell to multi-celled </v>

1365
01:06:01.501 --> 01:06:01.870
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's only ever happened once.</v>

1366
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:06.280
<v Speaker 2>And so given that we don't see any </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens,</v>

1367
01:06:06.281 --> 01:06:08.530
<v Speaker 2>we should think some part of this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard.</v>

1368
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Our best guess is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1369
01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:16.140
<v Speaker 2>that move them single cell to </v>
<v Speaker 2>multi-celled and perhaps from the </v>

1370
01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 2>creation of the first cells as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was incredibly difficult.</v>

1371
01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means that we're just </v>

1372
01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>exceptionally lucky to be alive as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

1373
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1374
01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:29.550
<v Speaker 3>if the universe is infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means that this has happened in </v>

1375
01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:29.740
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of times.</v>

1376
01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what I though it might be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>far away.</v>

1377
01:06:32.551 --> 01:06:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Probably like sufficiently far the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are not connectable to eat.</v>

1378
01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Like we can't contact each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>observe each other.</v>

1379
01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.190
<v Speaker 3>But there's an infinite number of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinitely far places.</v>

1380
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be some.</v>

1381
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.900
<v Speaker 2>There will be some like clusters of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and again,</v>

1382
01:06:49.901 --> 01:06:52.570
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the universe is infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly a hypothesis,</v>

1383
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.210
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just deferring to other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who say it's the leading.</v>

1384
01:06:55.350 --> 01:07:00.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most puzzling hypothesis to me was </v>

1385
01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:04.311
<v Speaker 3>the evidence of supermassive black holes</v>
<v Speaker 3>being at the center of every galaxy and </v>

1386
01:07:05.101 --> 01:07:10.050
<v Speaker 3>that the hypothesis was that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermassive black holes are exactly one</v>

1387
01:07:10.051 --> 01:07:12.480
<v Speaker 3>half of one percent of the mass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire galaxy.</v>

1388
01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.420
<v Speaker 3>And then if you go through those </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermassive black holes,</v>

1389
01:07:15.421 --> 01:07:20.421
<v Speaker 3>you may in fact go into a completely new</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe filled with hundreds of </v>

1390
01:07:20.421 --> 01:07:25.041
<v Speaker 3>billions of galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each with supermassive black holes at </v>

1391
01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:28.401
<v Speaker 3>the center of those galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will take you to hundreds of </v>

1392
01:07:28.401 --> 01:07:29.040
<v Speaker 3>billions of galaxies in another </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

1393
01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:33.180
<v Speaker 3>And that it's never ending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the real infinity is.</v>

1394
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:38.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not just the mass of all the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can observe in the 14 plus </v>

1395
01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.070
<v Speaker 3>billion light years that we know of from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Big Bang to today.</v>

1396
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:46.400
<v Speaker 3>It's all of those things being portals </v>
<v Speaker 3>to incredibly different.</v>

1397
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Totally new universes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1398
01:07:50.101 --> 01:07:52.470
<v Speaker 3>So it's turtles all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turtles all the way down.</v>

1399
01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:55.500
<v Speaker 3>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real question to me,</v>

1400
01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.890
<v Speaker 3>and this I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I proposed this to Brian Cox,</v>

1401
01:07:58.891 --> 01:08:03.891
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a sufficient answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why would we assume that there's </v>

1402
01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:09.290
<v Speaker 3>someone more advanced than us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it is possible that someone,</v>

1403
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:14.660
<v Speaker 3>some species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some thing is the tip of the spear that </v>

1404
01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 3>some thing is the first,</v>

1405
01:08:16.230 --> 01:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>that something is the most advanced life</v>
<v Speaker 1>form in the universe.</v>

1406
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Why would we assume that someone would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be more advanced than us?</v>

1407
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>If we are the most advanced thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can find?</v>

1408
01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:31.210
<v Speaker 1>The only logic that I could point to was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1409
01:08:31.211 --> 01:08:36.211
<v Speaker 1>that we're relatively young in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history and the age of the universe </v>

1410
01:08:36.211 --> 01:08:40.571
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The university itself being roughly 14 </v>

1411
01:08:40.571 --> 01:08:40.970
<v Speaker 1>billion years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are four point six.</v>

1412
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>What do we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the age of the earth?</v>

1413
01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in there,</v>

1414
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1415
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Relatively young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you consider that 10 billion years </v>

1416
01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.311
<v Speaker 1>of life give or take happen or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or existence happened before we came </v>

1417
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:59.381
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would we assume that there's </v>

1418
01:08:59.381 --> 01:09:02.441
<v Speaker 1>anything out there that's more advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why would we assume that this isn't </v>

1419
01:09:02.441 --> 01:09:03.710
<v Speaker 1>as far as anybody's ever gotten?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1420
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:06.650
<v Speaker 1>that's so in terms of infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1421
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Fourteen billion years seems like a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1422
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:11.810
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a blink.</v>

1423
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 1>So I think we should believe that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1424
01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:20.560
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's now just fits the infinity and </v>

1425
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:20.560
<v Speaker 1>just think about the observable </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

1426
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.640
<v Speaker 1>which is finite because people pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>over sweating in their car right now.</v>

1427
01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1428
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:24.500
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Infinity.</v>

1429
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of claims number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a total digression of claims</v>

1430
01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:31.540
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe so.</v>

1431
01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It was known as um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1432
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.730
<v Speaker 1>the largest number ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously used in the mathematical proof</v>

1433
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:41.330
<v Speaker 1>and the table and of wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why has this amazing post?</v>

1434
01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to explain just how big could</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am's number.</v>

1435
01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:49.571
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you have to use a special </v>

1436
01:09:49.571 --> 01:09:49.571
<v Speaker 1>notation and what's to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>

1437
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:53.390
<v Speaker 1>The numbers just get really big and once</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really start to think this through,</v>

1438
01:09:53.391 --> 01:09:56.390
<v Speaker 1>you're just like your left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of rocking back and forth.</v>

1439
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1440
01:09:58.881 --> 01:10:01.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just peeked out.</v>

1441
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the little monkey,</v>

1442
01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Lillian is so big affiliate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a speck of dust compared to </v>

1443
01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:09.290
<v Speaker 1>even a trillion years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a speck of dust.</v>

1444
01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:14.320
<v Speaker 1>When you consider the possibility of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe itself being infinite or the </v>

1445
01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.230
<v Speaker 1>possibility that is a continuous cycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of big bangs to expansion,</v>

1446
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>to contraction back to an infinitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>small point,</v>

1447
01:10:21.591 --> 01:10:24.590
<v Speaker 1>back to another big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a plausible possibility.</v>

1448
01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1449
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:28.100
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1450
01:10:28.101 --> 01:10:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fairly.</v>

1451
01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1452
01:10:29.421 --> 01:10:31.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not neil degrasse Tyson,</v>

1453
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.100
<v Speaker 1>a butch thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tons of the science.</v>

1454
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I think my understanding of the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we currently think that the </v>

1455
01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:40.580
<v Speaker 1>universe is just expanding and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps expanding.</v>

1456
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I know it's definitely a leading theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was going to expand and slow and</v>

1457
01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:45.850
<v Speaker 1>then kind of on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1458
01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you mentioned a humans being the </v>

1459
01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:51.740
<v Speaker 1>most advanced kind of cliche.</v>

1460
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably is correct in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>observable or certainly our galaxy,</v>

1461
01:10:56.301 --> 01:10:59.570
<v Speaker 1>let's say in our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we know it is in our solar system,</v>

1462
01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:00.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1463
01:11:00.471 --> 01:11:05.471
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we know it isn't our galaxy </v>

1464
01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:05.471
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1465
01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:07.240
<v Speaker 1>And again the nice so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is that,</v>

1466
01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:10.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's far as in it's like 100,000</v>

1467
01:11:10.311 --> 01:11:15.311
<v Speaker 1>light years thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're thinking about 15 </v>

1468
01:11:15.311 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 1>billion years of age of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually just a very short period</v>

1469
01:11:18.571 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why would you assume that 100,000</v>

1470
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:24.690
<v Speaker 1>light years from now there is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something exactly like us.</v>

1471
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is that if it was somewhat</v>

1472
01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:33.531
<v Speaker 1>easy or if it was just not incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for intelligent life to </v>

1473
01:11:33.531 --> 01:11:37.431
<v Speaker 1>evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it would have happened in the past </v>

1474
01:11:37.431 --> 01:11:39.531
<v Speaker 1>already and we will see evidence of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that we don't see any </v>

1475
01:11:39.531 --> 01:11:43.060
<v Speaker 1>evidence at all of intelligent life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other solar systems or,</v>

1476
01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:48.100
<v Speaker 1>and like a toll a suggest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly difficult for that to </v>

1477
01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:52.341
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that like being in the woods </v>

1478
01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 1>and unzipping your tent and sticking </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head out and saying,</v>

1479
01:11:53.671 --> 01:11:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This must be empty woods.</v>

1480
01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like,</v>

1481
01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a very small area </v>

1482
01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.750
<v Speaker 1>that you've observed and we've taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>account of.</v>

1483
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1484
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.050
<v Speaker 1>because I think</v>

1485
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.790
<v Speaker 1>if an alien civilization or us in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future goes to kind of start,</v>

1486
01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1487
01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending to the stars in the course of,</v>

1488
01:12:23.521 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1489
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.130
<v Speaker 1>just a few seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years,</v>

1490
01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:30.990
<v Speaker 1>let's say there'll be nearly significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence you'd see dyson's spheres being</v>

1491
01:12:30.991 --> 01:12:32.900
<v Speaker 1>constructed around sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1492
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:37.950
<v Speaker 1>to harness the sun's energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd see some evidence of like </v>

1493
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 1>dialectic engineering projects and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1494
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:44.150
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like a really big impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd see that with hundreds of </v>

1495
01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:47.010
<v Speaker 1>thousands of light years between us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the observable objects,</v>

1496
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.690
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>

1497
01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:52.100
<v Speaker 1>light years is just not very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1498
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:57.470
<v Speaker 1>compared to the kind of 15 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would just be this amazing </v>

1499
01:12:57.470 --> 01:13:01.581
<v Speaker 1>coincidence if it's the case that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life that's as advanced and more </v>

1500
01:13:01.581 --> 01:13:06.150
<v Speaker 1>advanced than us has a voltage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the same time as us were 100,000</v>

1501
01:13:06.151 --> 01:13:11.151
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give or take is basically just the same </v>

1502
01:13:11.151 --> 01:13:13.371
<v Speaker 1>time but hasn't evolved in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't involved more than a million </v>

1503
01:13:13.371 --> 01:13:16.590
<v Speaker 1>years ago where we will start to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of major impact of that.</v>

1504
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.120
<v Speaker 1>So if something within the observable </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe we've observed so little,</v>

1505
01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:26.210
<v Speaker 1>we don't even have really adequate </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs of anything outside of our </v>

1506
01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:29.121
<v Speaker 1>solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything is just radio </v>

1507
01:13:29.121 --> 01:13:29.121
<v Speaker 1>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1508
01:13:29.121 --> 01:13:30.960
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the analysis is that they're getting off</v>

1509
01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:34.920
<v Speaker 1>of light waves of what the components of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere is.</v>

1510
01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And so using your analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm suggesting is that,</v>

1511
01:13:38.150 --> 01:13:43.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was the case that alien life was </v>

1512
01:13:43.150 --> 01:13:44.850
<v Speaker 1>not intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life was not that hard to come by.</v>

1513
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:47.520
<v Speaker 1>You'd stick your head out of the 10 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look like Tokyo.</v>

1514
01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I've often looking like the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to look like Tokyo?</v>

1515
01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Why can't it look like Kansas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I be like really spread out?</v>

1516
01:13:56.191 --> 01:14:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And very little life because I think if </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is splitting out,</v>

1517
01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.160
<v Speaker 1>then it's just going to want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does life do?</v>

1518
01:14:02.161 --> 01:14:05.180
<v Speaker 1>It just phase to harness resources in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to color more of itself.</v>

1519
01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:10.450
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it reaches a point where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes that's few tile just </v>

1520
01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:11.290
<v Speaker 1>concentrates on effective altruism at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

1521
01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh battlestar.</v>

1522
01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's the turning inward suggestion </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1523
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:17.850
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe it's the case that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1524
01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:23.210
<v Speaker 3>like is it more important to get your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit together at home or to go all over </v>

1525
01:14:23.311 --> 01:14:26.790
<v Speaker 3>the world with the same bullshit ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1526
01:14:26.791 --> 01:14:31.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the case would not be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing that you could turn towards </v>

1527
01:14:31.791 --> 01:14:36.530
<v Speaker 3>interstellar travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wouldn't it be more important for </v>

1528
01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:39.810
<v Speaker 3>these communities to concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking care of their planet and figuring</v>

1529
01:14:39.811 --> 01:14:44.811
<v Speaker 3>out a way to work in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>harmonious fashion with the very nature </v>

1530
01:14:45.061 --> 01:14:47.970
<v Speaker 3>of the planet itself rather than travel </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the star.</v>

1531
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now imagine this.</v>

1532
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.560
<v Speaker 2>So on this alien alien planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 10 billion aliens and they're </v>

1533
01:14:56.021 --> 01:15:01.021
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that a thousand years more </v>

1534
01:15:01.021 --> 01:15:01.440
<v Speaker 2>advanced than humans at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1535
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:06.570
<v Speaker 2>in order for this argument to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd have to be the case that every </v>

1536
01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:09.151
<v Speaker 2>single one of them makes that decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>to just turn inwards and focus on why </v>

1537
01:15:09.151 --> 01:15:09.210
<v Speaker 2>was that</v>

1538
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:12.090
<v Speaker 3>the case because not all those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be the ones that would innovate in</v>

1539
01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:17.091
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't have to be everyone that </v>

1540
01:15:17.091 --> 01:15:19.131
<v Speaker 3>makes a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but have to be everyone have a high </v>

1541
01:15:19.131 --> 01:15:21.141
<v Speaker 3>enough consciousness to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make these interstellar machines </v>

1542
01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:23.970
<v Speaker 3>decides not to harness this nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and jet off into space.</v>

1543
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:28.170
<v Speaker 2>But I think over time that will just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would just be everyone because.</v>

1544
01:15:28.770 --> 01:15:29.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1545
01:15:29.131 --> 01:15:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean just technological progress just </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps going.</v>

1546
01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.920
<v Speaker 2>And eventually like tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously we're doing this like </v>

1547
01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.660
<v Speaker 2>weird though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment speculating on economics and </v>

1548
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.640
<v Speaker 2>sociology of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetical alien world.</v>

1549
01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.570
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1550
01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean just at some point as that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a civilization progresses,</v>

1551
01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1552
01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.320
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many actors.</v>

1553
01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm with sufficient power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of liability to spend to </v>

1554
01:15:58.201 --> 01:16:00.810
<v Speaker 2>the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to say that every single one of</v>

1555
01:16:00.811 --> 01:16:01.980
<v Speaker 2>them decides to turn inwards.</v>

1556
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.690
<v Speaker 3>So it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1557
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:08.690
<v Speaker 3>technology becomes very rare and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately over time becomes very common</v>

1558
01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.440
<v Speaker 3>like the cell phone cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1559
01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:15.670
<v Speaker 3>So when cell phone was first invented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was extremely rare and very </v>

1560
01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:19.781
<v Speaker 3>expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now everyone has one and the </v>

1561
01:16:19.781 --> 01:16:20.000
<v Speaker 3>capabilities of those cell phones have </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatly,</v>

1562
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:25.030
<v Speaker 3>greatly improved and that this will </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen with everything including space </v>

1563
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.030
<v Speaker 3>travel.</v>

1564
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also it doesn't need to be the case </v>

1565
01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:29.870
<v Speaker 2>that gets up to 10 billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's just like a thousand people</v>

1566
01:16:29.871 --> 01:16:31.250
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1567
01:16:31.251 --> 01:16:33.520
<v Speaker 2>it would just seem unlikely that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1568
01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:36.380
<v Speaker 2>in every civilization and every one just</v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

1569
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:37.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even just a thousand people,</v>

1570
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:40.670
<v Speaker 2>everyone chooses not a single person </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks,</v>

1571
01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:45.940
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just want that to be more like </v>

1572
01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:45.940
<v Speaker 2>spread out.</v>

1573
01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Now that obviously is dependent upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>there being a more advanced civilization</v>

1574
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:52.450
<v Speaker 3>than human beings on the planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if there weren't,</v>

1575
01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:57.720
<v Speaker 3>if there were a few years behind us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if they're stuck in the 19 fifties </v>

1576
01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.850
<v Speaker 3>or maybe they're stuck in ancient Greece</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

1577
01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.810
<v Speaker 3>then then obviously they don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities yet.</v>

1578
01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:05.650
<v Speaker 3>We might be the very most advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might be the very tip of the spear.</v>

1579
01:17:05.651 --> 01:17:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1580
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just think,</v>

1581
01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:12.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it would be unlikely </v>

1582
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:12.050
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1583
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:17.150
<v Speaker 1>something more advanced happened just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit faster than us,</v>

1584
01:17:17.151 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>but not say 100 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not very long ago.</v>

1585
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In cosmic terms,</v>

1586
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:27.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's still possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's still possible that </v>

1587
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:29.240
<v Speaker 1>something happened a hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker than us or that they haven't had</v>

1588
01:17:29.241 --> 01:17:34.241
<v Speaker 1>the same setbacks that we've had in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of asteroidal impacts and natural </v>

1589
01:17:34.241 --> 01:17:36.620
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe supervolcanoes and the link.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1590
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:41.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real weird thought experiment </v>

1591
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:42.410
<v Speaker 1>because you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start extrapolating,</v>

1592
01:17:42.411 --> 01:17:43.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well where are we going to be?</v>

1593
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:45.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we going to be in,</v>

1594
01:17:45.171 --> 01:17:50.171
<v Speaker 1>why would we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one of the things that </v>

1595
01:17:50.171 --> 01:17:50.450
<v Speaker 1>always gets me about this whole trip to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars and I had a joke about it in my,</v>

1596
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:55.540
<v Speaker 1>of my last comedy special where people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where somebody actually said this to me </v>

1597
01:17:55.540 --> 01:18:00.250
<v Speaker 1>because it was before California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's solved it's drought or Mother </v>

1598
01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Nature solved our drought for us rather.</v>

1599
01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Or people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1600
01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:04.940
<v Speaker 1>we should really consider going to Mars </v>
<v Speaker 1>because mean look at our environment and</v>

1601
01:18:04.941 --> 01:18:07.240
<v Speaker 1>California is almost out of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my joke was like,</v>

1602
01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.220
<v Speaker 1>we're right next to the fucking ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's so much water.</v>

1603
01:18:10.221 --> 01:18:12.800
<v Speaker 1>You can see the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a salt problem.</v>

1604
01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:15.040
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a water problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you going to do?</v>

1605
01:18:15.041 --> 01:18:20.041
<v Speaker 1>You going to bring water to Mars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the stupidest thing I've </v>

1606
01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:20.041
<v Speaker 1>ever heard in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1607
01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:20.041
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird.</v>

1608
01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:23.060
<v Speaker 1>When people start talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think so there's the,</v>

1609
01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.990
<v Speaker 1>it's going to Mas St Newton laws saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>in McCone right now,</v>

1610
01:18:26.991 --> 01:18:28.940
<v Speaker 1>like the aim of doing that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

1611
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Totally on board with that the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>as like going to the moon.</v>

1612
01:18:31.821 --> 01:18:36.821
<v Speaker 1>It's like look what we can achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an exciting like global human </v>

1613
01:18:36.821 --> 01:18:37.070
<v Speaker 1>fluidic totally just the space shuttle </v>
<v Speaker 1>going into orbit.</v>

1614
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:38.120
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1615
01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1616
01:18:38.811 --> 01:18:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then this talk of like,</v>

1617
01:18:40.821 --> 01:18:44.060
<v Speaker 1>oh well we need this and what's to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to survive as a species.</v>

1618
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1619
01:18:45.201 --> 01:18:50.201
<v Speaker 1>if you want to have this kind of refuge </v>
<v Speaker 1>or colony in order to make the math more</v>

1620
01:18:50.670 --> 01:18:53.570
<v Speaker 1>robust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mazda is just not a great place to pick.</v>

1621
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:56.730
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different ways that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1622
01:18:57.050 --> 01:19:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean Mazda's like wally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhospitable and if you wanted to build </v>

1623
01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:02.330
<v Speaker 1>a refuge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not go into the sea?</v>

1624
01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a going to be protected </v>

1625
01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:07.780
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1626
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viola says or asteroid impacts.</v>

1627
01:19:10.161 --> 01:19:15.161
<v Speaker 1>And so really though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if one of those big things that slammed </v>

1628
01:19:15.161 --> 01:19:15.920
<v Speaker 1>into the Yucatan slams into where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>villages and the sea,</v>

1629
01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1630
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:17.720
<v Speaker 1>if you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1631
01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:21.350
<v Speaker 1>this underwater village with 10 years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>food supplies and so on,</v>

1632
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.190
<v Speaker 1>then you could like come back because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact from the asteroid wasn't just</v>

1633
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:27.950
<v Speaker 1>like shook everyone office that the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>is falling,</v>

1634
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:32.930
<v Speaker 1>the sky is get clouded over with earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>rang for a million years.</v>

1635
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that as nla impact.</v>

1636
01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so interesting.</v>

1637
01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:43.360
<v Speaker 1>That's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how big that thing </v>

1638
01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.301
<v Speaker 1>was that killed the dinosaurs 65 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and that there's hundreds of </v>

1639
01:19:46.301 --> 01:19:47.300
<v Speaker 1>thousands of those things floating </v>
<v Speaker 1>around in space.</v>

1640
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:50.270
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was asking some people at Nasa just,</v>

1641
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:51.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1642
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:56.950
<v Speaker 1>just two days ago actually on how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them we've managed to identify </v>

1643
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:59.870
<v Speaker 1>because their cvs about kind of scanning</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skies to find them all.</v>

1644
01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer,</v>

1645
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought we had it covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was something that Nasa </v>

1646
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:07.840
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1647
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know with all the like.</v>

1648
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:10.740
<v Speaker 2>And they have response was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1649
01:20:10.741 --> 01:20:12.290
<v Speaker 2>we've got no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>

1650
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:17.430
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how many of them then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we don't know how many we've </v>

1651
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.430
<v Speaker 2>managed to track.</v>

1652
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:22.310
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy named Randall Carlson and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I found on podcast a few times and he's </v>

1653
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:25.821
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with the idea that asteroidal </v>
<v Speaker 3>impacts were probably would have ended </v>

1654
01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:26.830
<v Speaker 3>the ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1655
01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.440
<v Speaker 3>10 to 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1656
01:20:28.441 --> 01:20:30.060
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

1657
01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.820
<v Speaker 3>there's a significant amount of physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence that points to this,</v>

1658
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:34.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both in,</v>

1659
01:20:34.741 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence of impact and nuclear glass.</v>

1660
01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Try think it's called tribe tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the exact word,</v>

1661
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:46.640
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it appears all throughout Europe and </v>

1662
01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Asia and around that same timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around 10,000</v>

1663
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:52.280
<v Speaker 3>and 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago when they do core samples and </v>

1664
01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:56.210
<v Speaker 3>it points to this idea that there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant impacts from asteroidal </v>

1665
01:20:57.391 --> 01:21:01.470
<v Speaker 3>objects all over Europe and all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>Asia around that time.</v>

1666
01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:05.610
<v Speaker 3>And they think some of them slammed into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice caps that were,</v>

1667
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:10.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North America was covered in a giant </v>

1668
01:21:10.611 --> 01:21:12.180
<v Speaker 3>chunk of it was covered in as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>two miles high of ice just 10,000</v>

1669
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1670
01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:18.080
<v Speaker 3>And he points to an incredible amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical change in the environment that </v>

1671
01:21:18.091 --> 01:21:21.060
<v Speaker 3>looks like it took place over a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>short period of time.</v>

1672
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Like catastrophic change over incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>short amount of time that he believes </v>

1673
01:21:26.431 --> 01:21:30.480
<v Speaker 3>points to these impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Melting the ice caps,</v>

1674
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.630
<v Speaker 3>creating massive amount of flooding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing off.</v>

1675
01:21:33.631 --> 01:21:38.631
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how many people resetting </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization in many different parts of </v>

1676
01:21:38.631 --> 01:21:41.040
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this evidence of these,</v>

1677
01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:46.041
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the nuclear glass of these micro </v>

1678
01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:49.011
<v Speaker 3>diamonds that also exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They find them during a nuclear test </v>

1679
01:21:49.011 --> 01:21:53.181
<v Speaker 3>sites when they blow off bombs and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>also find them at asteroidal impacts </v>

1680
01:21:53.181 --> 01:21:54.660
<v Speaker 3>sites and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1681
01:21:54.661 --> 01:21:59.661
<v Speaker 3>you know that we have been hit many </v>
<v Speaker 3>times in the past and they do have </v>

1682
01:21:59.661 --> 01:22:03.231
<v Speaker 3>evidence of that and then you see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moon and all the different impact </v>

1683
01:22:03.231 --> 01:22:06.291
<v Speaker 3>craters on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He know that this is just what he calls </v>

1684
01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:06.930
<v Speaker 3>a cosmic shooting gallery essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1685
01:22:06.931 --> 01:22:11.070
<v Speaker 3>it's very likely that that was the cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the end of the ice age.</v>

1686
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:16.400
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's climate data that sort of seems </v>

1687
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:16.400
<v Speaker 3>to point to that as well.</v>

1688
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

1689
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:20.160
<v Speaker 2>so this is now like really outside my </v>
<v Speaker 2>area of expertise</v>

1690
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:23.540
<v Speaker 3>and you some links to some of his stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's been obsessed with this for</v>

1691
01:22:23.541 --> 01:22:26.120
<v Speaker 3>about 30 years because fascinating guy.</v>

1692
01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:28.360
<v Speaker 2>The two things that would really </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise me about that.</v>

1693
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that there were so many ice ages </v>

1694
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.900
<v Speaker 2>and it was just seemed to be this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes on and goes off for sure.</v>

1695
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1696
01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly dynamic,</v>

1697
01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:41.170
<v Speaker 2>predictable process where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>asteroid impact.</v>

1698
01:22:41.171 --> 01:22:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Super Random.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you wouldn't expect to have this kind</v>

1699
01:22:43.901 --> 01:22:46.930
<v Speaker 2>of back and forth then I make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was asteroids that was doing it.</v>

1700
01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 2>And then secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my understanding would be the asteroids </v>

1701
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 2>would cool the planet because asteroid </v>
<v Speaker 2>hits,</v>

1702
01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.100
<v Speaker 2>ash just spreads out all over the sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just blocks out sunlight.</v>

1703
01:22:57.850 --> 01:23:00.790
<v Speaker 2>So it would surprise me if it had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of warming effect.</v>

1704
01:23:01.330 --> 01:23:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea is that first of all,</v>

1705
01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:09.630
<v Speaker 3>when it it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the impact is massive and it melts off </v>

1706
01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 3>just to the huge chunk of the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>water that is a covering North America.</v>

1707
01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that causes</v>

1708
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:20.371
<v Speaker 3>this massive flooding and this massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing of the topography and as far as</v>

1709
01:23:20.451 --> 01:23:25.451
<v Speaker 3>like what causes the net,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it interrupts it </v>

1710
01:23:25.451 --> 01:23:27.070
<v Speaker 3>temporarily and then it comes back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets warmer.</v>

1711
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:27.650
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1712
01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:32.670
<v Speaker 3>that natural cycle of warming and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooling has been going on since they </v>

1713
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:34.270
<v Speaker 3>mean from as far back as they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure it.</v>

1714
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.840
<v Speaker 3>What he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His significant quick changes.</v>

1715
01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:43.050
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the extinction event that killed </v>

1716
01:23:43.050 --> 01:23:45.421
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around 65 percent or more of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the large mammals in North </v>

1717
01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.550
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really quickly,</v>

1718
01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.180
<v Speaker 3>like bully mammoths really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saber Tooth Tigers,</v>

1719
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:53.140
<v Speaker 3>they don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1720
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:58.320
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of speculation back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth about that because they would </v>

1721
01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.601
<v Speaker 3>think that humans did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they found these mass dead </v>

1722
01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:02.470
<v Speaker 3>sites where they're not consumed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1723
01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:05.560
<v Speaker 3>this was the ones that he showed where </v>
<v Speaker 3>these woolly mammoths,</v>

1724
01:24:05.561 --> 01:24:10.540
<v Speaker 3>they found them where they had their </v>
<v Speaker 3>legs were broken and it looked like they</v>

1725
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.390
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the impact of something had knocked them</v>

1726
01:24:13.391 --> 01:24:17.040
<v Speaker 3>flat and they'd found like thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and these mass death side sites.</v>

1727
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.030
<v Speaker 1>But I thought that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1728
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:22.110
<v Speaker 1>so firstly it just seemed to me like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>homo,</v>

1729
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.290
<v Speaker 1>the idea that humans killing them all </v>
<v Speaker 1>just seems like crazy.</v>

1730
01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it just seems like such a good</v>

1731
01:24:27.421 --> 01:24:28.530
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even have.</v>

1732
01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:30.750
<v Speaker 1>They had atlatl so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I was like,</v>

1733
01:24:30.751 --> 01:24:33.510
<v Speaker 1>the best weapon they have at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't even riding on horseback at</v>

1734
01:24:33.511 --> 01:24:38.511
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then with respect to the death </v>

1735
01:24:38.511 --> 01:24:40.191
<v Speaker 1>sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought the mechanism for killing a </v>

1736
01:24:40.191 --> 01:24:41.901
<v Speaker 1>woolly mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just got like 200 humans and you </v>

1737
01:24:41.901 --> 01:24:41.901
<v Speaker 1>just chase the William mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cliff.</v>

1738
01:24:41.901 --> 01:24:43.410
<v Speaker 1>So that does work if you can get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>near a cliff.</v>

1739
01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:48.710
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of getting them all near </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliffs and killing them all off by a </v>

1740
01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:50.760
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people that hadn't figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheel seems a little unlikely.</v>

1741
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It's possible like over thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years because that's the thing.</v>

1742
01:24:55.530 --> 01:24:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Like we often tell these stories about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1743
01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these civilizations,</v>

1744
01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.020
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1745
01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:02.230
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they might relate to me,</v>

1746
01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:07.340
<v Speaker 1>this journey to your left and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often that's like they moved a mile </v>

1747
01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.410
<v Speaker 1>of the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like fate journeys actually just</v>

1748
01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:15.630
<v Speaker 1>this very gradual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly if you've got this grave </v>

1749
01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:18.861
<v Speaker 1>site and it's got well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of woolly mammoths in this one </v>

1750
01:25:18.861 --> 01:25:18.861
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be over thousands of years.</v>

1751
01:25:18.861 --> 01:25:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1752
01:25:19.231 --> 01:25:20.880
<v Speaker 1>this is just something I know that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1753
01:25:20.881 --> 01:25:22.830
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about carbon dating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're all,</v>

1754
01:25:22.831 --> 01:25:27.831
<v Speaker 1>it's all within the same time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to really go over his stuff </v>

1755
01:25:27.831 --> 01:25:29.460
<v Speaker 1>with a fine tooth comb and talked to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because I'm not the right guy.</v>

1756
01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just listened to them and go woo,</v>

1757
01:25:31.481 --> 01:25:33.750
<v Speaker 1>and then try to relate it as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1758
01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:39.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a podcast that I actually read </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted today because somebody brought </v>

1759
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.420
<v Speaker 1>it up on Youtube.</v>

1760
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It's available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll,</v>

1761
01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll send you to it afterwards and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

1762
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:43.300
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1763
01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:44.630
<v Speaker 1>But this is something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1764
01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:46.920
<v Speaker 1>but if you know the book Sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>

1765
01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.110
<v Speaker 1>you're like the fifth person to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1766
01:25:49.111 --> 01:25:54.111
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get everyone talks about </v>
<v Speaker 1>savings savings is the book that </v>

1767
01:25:54.111 --> 01:25:56.640
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't just pull it up a little closer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you because it makes a big difference</v>

1768
01:25:56.641 --> 01:25:58.590
<v Speaker 1>in the sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1769
01:25:58.591 --> 01:26:00.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that most blew my mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1770
01:26:00.810 --> 01:26:05.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much megafauna there was in the </v>

1771
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:08.030
<v Speaker 1>early days of homosapiens moving across </v>
<v Speaker 1>North America.</v>

1772
01:26:08.031 --> 01:26:13.031
<v Speaker 1>There were two ton sloths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant sloths and one of just vanity </v>

1773
01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:18.501
<v Speaker 1>vanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many massive mega fauna that we just </v>

1774
01:26:18.501 --> 01:26:18.501
<v Speaker 1>don't have anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:26:18.501 --> 01:26:21.770
<v Speaker 1>The blitzkrieg hypothesis is what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>call the human animal,</v>

1776
01:26:21.771 --> 01:26:26.771
<v Speaker 1>killing off all the other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really troubling hypothesis </v>

1777
01:26:27.351 --> 01:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>because we don't want to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're capable of doing that,</v>

1778
01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:30.980
<v Speaker 1>but obviously we do do that.</v>

1779
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing it right now.</v>

1780
01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:36.080
<v Speaker 1>We did it to the buffalo and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost went to the Bison Dodo.</v>

1781
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:41.470
<v Speaker 1>We're doing it just a Tasmanian tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different animals that </v>

1782
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:42.170
<v Speaker 1>within our lifetime have gone extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1783
01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:44.300
<v Speaker 1>where it actually like in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinctions,</v>

1784
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:46.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if we'll get the number,</v>

1785
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:51.750
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be pretty accurate to describe </v>

1786
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:53.600
<v Speaker 1>this as the fourth and make show mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinction because it's just huge.</v>

1787
01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:58.370
<v Speaker 1>The number of species have gone extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this human activity and it's also one</v>

1788
01:26:58.371 --> 01:27:03.371
<v Speaker 1>of those things where we don't think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as being significant because it </v>

1789
01:27:03.371 --> 01:27:04.250
<v Speaker 1>happens slowly over the course of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1790
01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.410
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at it on a timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1791
01:27:06.411 --> 01:27:06.980
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1792
01:27:06.981 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 1>everything's dying right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1793
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:09.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1794
01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:13.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's slow by human standards fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick by nature,</v>

1795
01:27:13.011 --> 01:27:13.980
<v Speaker 1>logical standards.</v>

1796
01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:19.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end of the ice age happening so </v>

1797
01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:23.411
<v Speaker 1>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals dying off so quickly and so </v>

1798
01:27:23.411 --> 01:27:27.071
<v Speaker 1>many large mammals dying off so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you think about what we know </v>

1799
01:27:27.071 --> 01:27:31.661
<v Speaker 1>people have done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when we almost killed off the ice </v>

1800
01:27:31.661 --> 01:27:35.510
<v Speaker 1>and they know why they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know how they did that and they did </v>

1801
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:37.340
<v Speaker 1>it with extraordinary weapons and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it with high powered rifles.</v>

1802
01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:39.080
<v Speaker 1>They could shoot things from a far </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

1803
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:42.620
<v Speaker 1>They did it by shooting off trains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they did a lot of crazy shit back</v>

1804
01:27:42.621 --> 01:27:47.621
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we understand mean and there's a lot </v>

1805
01:27:47.621 --> 01:27:47.621
<v Speaker 1>of physical evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

1806
01:27:47.621 --> 01:27:51.950
<v Speaker 1>There's photographs of the actual piles </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bones and all that crazy shit when </v>

1807
01:27:52.281 --> 01:27:57.281
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you take away those physical </v>

1808
01:27:57.281 --> 01:27:58.931
<v Speaker 1>capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extraordinary physical capabilities </v>

1809
01:27:58.931 --> 01:28:01.160
<v Speaker 1>like even riding on horseback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Dan Flores who's a </v>

1810
01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 1>fascinating guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scholar who believes that even without</v>

1811
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:10.510
<v Speaker 1>the Europeans coming over here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>market hunting and killing off all the </v>

1812
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:14.060
<v Speaker 1>bison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks just the firearm and the horse</v>

1813
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:19.450
<v Speaker 1>with the native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that they were </v>

1814
01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:19.730
<v Speaker 1>going to eradicate the bison on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

1815
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:21.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1816
01:28:21.291 --> 01:28:26.291
<v Speaker 1>it just depends about timescales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even if you're just killing like </v>

1817
01:28:26.291 --> 01:28:30.131
<v Speaker 1>slightly more of the species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like killing just enough of the species </v>

1818
01:28:30.131 --> 01:28:32.140
<v Speaker 1>that they're now below the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1819
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:36.980
<v Speaker 1>two children for every two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viability stage.</v>

1820
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1821
01:28:37.821 --> 01:28:42.821
<v Speaker 1>Then just over sufficient time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembering the homo sapiens between the</v>

1822
01:28:42.831 --> 01:28:45.440
<v Speaker 1>hunter gatherer age was 190,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1823
01:28:45.970 --> 01:28:48.710
<v Speaker 1>A very long time spans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1824
01:28:48.711 --> 01:28:51.060
<v Speaker 1>very short geologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1825
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very long time span.</v>

1826
01:28:52.611 --> 01:28:53.250
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>

1827
01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:58.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be killing that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>woolly mammoth to delight them to </v>

1828
01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:00.500
<v Speaker 1>extinction over the course of several </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years.</v>

1829
01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.560
<v Speaker 1>What are your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to like the ethical </v>

1830
01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:06.540
<v Speaker 1>reintroduction of animals that have gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>extinct?</v>

1831
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Like there are some people in Russia </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are constant.</v>

1832
01:29:09.041 --> 01:29:13.800
<v Speaker 1>They're currently rather working on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of a woolly mammoth.</v>

1833
01:29:13.801 --> 01:29:18.801
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take woolly mammoth DNA </v>
<v Speaker 1>from some of these frozen bodies that </v>

1834
01:29:19.351 --> 01:29:19.770
<v Speaker 1>they've gotten.</v>

1835
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:24.360
<v Speaker 1>They've gotten some pretty intact woolly</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammoths now and they're going to try to</v>

1836
01:29:24.361 --> 01:29:25.920
<v Speaker 1>clone one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1837
01:29:25.921 --> 01:29:29.100
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know the details of how this </v>
<v Speaker 1>will work.</v>

1838
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess they have to just stay to in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elephant,</v>

1839
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:33.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1840
01:29:33.541 --> 01:29:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1841
01:29:34.981 --> 01:29:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

1842
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:41.390
<v Speaker 1>but what are they trying to make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>like where you have woolly mammoths </v>

1843
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.880
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1844
01:29:41.881 --> 01:29:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1845
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:48.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any ethical </v>

1846
01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:50.661
<v Speaker 1>imperative to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's not a competitive.</v>

1847
01:29:51.141 --> 01:29:56.141
<v Speaker 1>Not like I would think just if there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more wooly mammoths that's the same as </v>

1848
01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:58.960
<v Speaker 1>just being more um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephants and it might be a scientific </v>

1849
01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:58.960
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>

1850
01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:03.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild with like hypotheses that we heard </v>

1851
01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:03.800
<v Speaker 1>and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1852
01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.460
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds ridiculous.</v>

1853
01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1854
01:30:06.781 --> 01:30:11.781
<v Speaker 1>I heard the idea was leading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing woolly mammoths to like </v>

1855
01:30:11.781 --> 01:30:11.781
<v Speaker 1>stump down snow in order to prevent.</v>

1856
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prevent global warming.</v>

1857
01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Global warming can slow it down somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>

1858
01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely things that sort of </v>

1859
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:22.560
<v Speaker 1>thing that people say over dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1860
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:26.940
<v Speaker 1>with the idea wasn't just stomped down </v>
<v Speaker 1>snow but also to eat the foliage.</v>

1861
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:30:28.051 --> 01:30:33.051
<v Speaker 1>There was like some exfoliating thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're doing where they would </v>

1863
01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:38.570
<v Speaker 1>consume so many trees and so many plants</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would actually lower the </v>

1864
01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:39.240
<v Speaker 1>temperature of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck?</v>

1865
01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just seems skeptical of that.</v>

1866
01:30:42.571 --> 01:30:47.571
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this philosophical question of </v>

1867
01:30:47.571 --> 01:30:49.560
<v Speaker 1>whether you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question of biodiversity loss,</v>

1868
01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been huge.</v>

1869
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you value that?</v>

1870
01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:56.400
<v Speaker 1>So is it the case that loss of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>

1871
01:30:56.700 --> 01:31:01.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just cash that out in terms of </v>

1872
01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:05.340
<v Speaker 1>impacts on individuals because obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad for the animals that die in the</v>

1873
01:31:05.341 --> 01:31:10.341
<v Speaker 1>course of that and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we maybe have a loss of kind of </v>

1874
01:31:10.341 --> 01:31:10.770
<v Speaker 1>information that we can just not get </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1875
01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:17.540
<v Speaker 1>But is there something intrinsically bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>about just having fewer species and a </v>

1876
01:31:18.361 --> 01:31:23.361
<v Speaker 1>lot of people seem to act to act in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that suggests they seem to believe?</v>

1877
01:31:23.821 --> 01:31:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1878
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:31.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard philosophically to </v>

1879
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:31.010
<v Speaker 1>cash that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1880
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:35.451
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard to explain like why </v>
<v Speaker 1>would we care so much about losing </v>

1881
01:31:35.451 --> 01:31:37.800
<v Speaker 1>species where we don't seem to care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about having,</v>

1882
01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately randomizing.</v>

1883
01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm bleeding and so on that we get more </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

1884
01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like we're only just </v>

1885
01:31:49.050 --> 01:31:50.691
<v Speaker 1>conservative about not losing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it really is a value to have </v>

1886
01:31:50.691 --> 01:31:53.030
<v Speaker 1>greater diversity of species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we not actively find,</v>

1887
01:31:53.031 --> 01:31:58.031
<v Speaker 1>promote greater amount of bio diversity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of other merely preventing loss of </v>

1888
01:31:58.031 --> 01:31:59.130
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1889
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I think the reintroduction,</v>

1890
01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:05.610
<v Speaker 3>the reintroduction of species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also like if you have an environment </v>

1891
01:32:05.610 --> 01:32:10.051
<v Speaker 3>that's stable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you have some sort of an ecosystem </v>

1892
01:32:10.051 --> 01:32:13.141
<v Speaker 3>that's stable and then you reintroduce a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Predator or prey or some animal that's </v>

1893
01:32:13.151 --> 01:32:15.690
<v Speaker 3>gonna eat up all the foliage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's you,</v>

1894
01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:20.740
<v Speaker 3>you're running this big risk and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking these big chances that you can </v>

1895
01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:23.620
<v Speaker 3>sort of predict the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could look at a plus b equals c,</v>

1896
01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:27.700
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't always work that way and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there has been disastrous result results</v>

1897
01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.750
<v Speaker 3>when they've introduced species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1898
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:33.340
<v Speaker 3>to other environments where they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>native.</v>

1899
01:32:33.370 --> 01:32:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1900
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with places like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>

1901
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Australia is kind of hilarious in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>regard.</v>

1902
01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they introduced the lab.</v>

1903
01:32:39.630 --> 01:32:42.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the institute a type of flog to a slave.</v>

1904
01:32:42.991 --> 01:32:47.991
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to butcher this as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the entities type of flag to </v>

1905
01:32:47.991 --> 01:32:47.991
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took over,</v>

1906
01:32:47.991 --> 01:32:51.970
<v Speaker 2>so they introduced a lab at suitland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat these blogs or something to eat the </v>

1907
01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:54.490
<v Speaker 2>bugs and then they took over and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill the bugs and I think they</v>

1908
01:32:54.710 --> 01:32:59.710
<v Speaker 3>more than boxes to try to kill the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbits and they killed all the ground </v>

1909
01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:03.521
<v Speaker 3>nesting birds and they introduce cats to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill the foxes and I mean you have to </v>

1910
01:33:03.521 --> 01:33:08.410
<v Speaker 3>kill the rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fact back ward attending </v>

1911
01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:08.410
<v Speaker 3>introduced species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially back then,</v>

1912
01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:10.790
<v Speaker 3>you know when they were doing this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 18 hundreds in Australia,</v>

1913
01:33:10.791 --> 01:33:12.430
<v Speaker 3>they really didn't know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were doing.</v>

1914
01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:16.010
<v Speaker 3>They're thinking short term right in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of them and they also brought in a</v>

1915
01:33:16.011 --> 01:33:18.050
<v Speaker 3>bunch of animals that don't have natural</v>
<v Speaker 3>predators,</v>

1916
01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:20.330
<v Speaker 3>so they have to gun them down from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking sky.</v>

1917
01:33:20.690 --> 01:33:25.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these deer and stags and all these </v>

1918
01:33:25.690 --> 01:33:27.110
<v Speaker 3>magic beasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you ever seen a stag,</v>

1919
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:28.760
<v Speaker 3>they're incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They roar.</v>

1920
01:33:28.761 --> 01:33:33.761
<v Speaker 3>They sound like a lion and they have so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many of them in Australia and </v>

1921
01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:36.881
<v Speaker 3>particularly in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have any natural </v>

1922
01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:36.881
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>

1923
01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:36.881
<v Speaker 3>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no predators,</v>

1924
01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:39.200
<v Speaker 3>so they have to fly over and helicopters</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gunned them down.</v>

1925
01:33:39.650 --> 01:33:41.050
<v Speaker 3>It's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they leave them.</v>

1926
01:33:41.051 --> 01:33:43.580
<v Speaker 3>They just leave them to rot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have too many of them.</v>

1927
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Same with Kangaroos as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1928
01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've seen those herds of </v>

1929
01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ever seen that?</v>

1930
01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:51.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't.</v>

1931
01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a video that some guy took </v>

1932
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:58.480
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in Australia and it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of kangaroos </v>

1933
01:33:59.751 --> 01:34:01.660
<v Speaker 3>running across this field and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

1934
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:06.580
<v Speaker 3>like some apocalypse apocalyptic </v>
<v Speaker 3>kangaroo invasion.</v>

1935
01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:11.860
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find that Jamie the video</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because it's worth seeing two to </v>

1936
01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:11.860
<v Speaker 3>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1937
01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:14.750
<v Speaker 3>this is what can happen when there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>

1938
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:17.270
<v Speaker 3>Like animals just get completely out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

1939
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm vegetarian and have been for a </v>

1940
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:24.771
<v Speaker 2>long time now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with some other vegetarian fence we </v>

1941
01:34:24.771 --> 01:34:29.001
<v Speaker 2>had the conversation of yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be the most ethical meat to </v>

1942
01:34:29.001 --> 01:34:31.881
<v Speaker 2>eat and I think we can concluded that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kangaroo would be the most ethical </v>

1943
01:34:31.881 --> 01:34:34.620
<v Speaker 2>because it's being killed anyway because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just need to,</v>

1944
01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.930
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got this population explosion.</v>

1945
01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:40.060
<v Speaker 2>It's on land that wouldn't be otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>used for anything,</v>

1946
01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been fully.</v>

1947
01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.710
<v Speaker 2>They've got good lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1948
01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:47.230
<v Speaker 2>the environmental impact is therefore </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be um,</v>

1949
01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:49.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low or nonexistent as well.</v>

1950
01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it,</v>

1951
01:34:51.121 --> 01:34:54.330
<v Speaker 2>kangaroo meat is very unusual and almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those,</v>

1952
01:34:54.331 --> 01:34:54.840
<v Speaker 2>the guards,</v>

1953
01:34:55.050 --> 01:34:55.940
<v Speaker 3>it's not though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1954
01:34:55.941 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's very nutritious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently</v>

1955
01:34:58.050 --> 01:35:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos is actually a type of deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not.</v>

1956
01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that marsupial which has</v>

1957
01:35:04.191 --> 01:35:05.390
<v Speaker 1>a totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1958
01:35:05.391 --> 01:35:10.391
<v Speaker 1>but it's related to the deer in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>strict look at these fuckers just </v>

1959
01:35:10.391 --> 01:35:14.351
<v Speaker 1>hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the one I'm talking about </v>

1960
01:35:14.351 --> 01:35:14.351
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them running across a</v>

1961
01:35:14.351 --> 01:35:18.911
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a large population of </v>

1962
01:35:18.911 --> 01:35:18.911
<v Speaker 1>kangaroo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Some way in the deer family and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange way.</v>

1964
01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:27.130
<v Speaker 1>See if Jamie could find that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that we have wallabies in </v>

1965
01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Scotland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1966
01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1967
01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:28.190
<v Speaker 1>In an island called inch Konica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1968
01:35:28.191 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've visited them a number of times.</v>

1969
01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:33.290
<v Speaker 1>And were they introduced to Scotland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1970
01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:37.430
<v Speaker 1>So late the oven Kahuna had that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1971
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Well no need for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she,</v>

1972
01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I'd actually don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she owned,</v>

1973
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:46.760
<v Speaker 1>she owned the island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She owned the zoo on the island,</v>

1974
01:35:46.761 --> 01:35:47.720
<v Speaker 1>like a personal zoo.</v>

1975
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

1976
01:35:52.570 --> 01:35:57.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>died I think there lou the zoo went to </v>

1977
01:35:57.570 --> 01:35:58.000
<v Speaker 1>back and everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just kind of was a while,</v>

1978
01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.470
<v Speaker 1>but he's just got out and the wallabies </v>
<v Speaker 1>took over.</v>

1979
01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First evidence because people wouldn't </v>

1980
01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:08.510
<v Speaker 1>likely visited this was they would find </v>
<v Speaker 1>these dead wallaby caucuses on the </v>

1981
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:10.340
<v Speaker 1>mainland and that was during the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The law,</v>

1982
01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Scottish for lake would freeze over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wallabies would hop on the ice when </v>

1983
01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you get hit by a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then now very tame.</v>

1984
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:23.530
<v Speaker 1>It was a shame because I first found out</v>
<v Speaker 1>about them back when it was still a bit </v>

1985
01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:26.180
<v Speaker 1>of a seek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was fascinating and now it's become</v>

1986
01:36:26.181 --> 01:36:29.480
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a tourist hotspot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1987
01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:35.300
<v Speaker 4>Says that Kangaroos are marsupials and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more closely related to possums than </v>

1988
01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:35.330
<v Speaker 4>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1989
01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.990
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're not related to dear mean.</v>

1990
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.740
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.600
<v Speaker 4>Someone had told me that there were in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some way in the deer family or cousins </v>

1992
01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:46.140
<v Speaker 4>of deer or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Early explorers said that they were just</v>

1993
01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:49.590
<v Speaker 4>what their descriptions were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like deers without antlers and</v>

1994
01:36:49.591 --> 01:36:50.190
<v Speaker 4>they stood up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1995
01:36:50.191 --> 01:36:53.000
<v Speaker 4>Like men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a salsa.</v>

1996
01:36:53.010 --> 01:36:54.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a cure a question.</v>

1997
01:36:54.511 --> 01:36:58.110
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't find like an official </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist saying here's deciding on it,</v>

1998
01:36:58.111 --> 01:36:58.530
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1999
01:36:59.290 --> 01:37:04.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I wish I had this my whole </v>

2000
01:37:04.290 --> 01:37:06.961
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who could just follow me around </v>

2001
01:37:06.961 --> 01:37:06.961
<v Speaker 1>and correct me if the time I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about this,</v>

2002
01:37:06.961 --> 01:37:11.080
<v Speaker 1>this is an amazing time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody puts something up on instagram </v>

2003
01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:14.851
<v Speaker 1>today and it was a a quote from the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds about an ancient philosopher or</v>

2004
01:37:16.031 --> 01:37:21.031
<v Speaker 1>an ancient scholar rather would give his</v>
<v Speaker 1>life for the information that's </v>

2005
01:37:21.031 --> 01:37:22.240
<v Speaker 1>available to the common school boy </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2006
01:37:22.241 --> 01:37:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and this was from a quote from 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>88.</v>

2007
01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is nothing now compared to what we</v>

2008
01:37:30.041 --> 01:37:31.150
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2009
01:37:31.151 --> 01:37:36.151
<v Speaker 1>I think there was another statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again it's unclear how do you </v>

2010
01:37:36.151 --> 01:37:37.240
<v Speaker 1>measure this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of letting the information,</v>

2011
01:37:37.241 --> 01:37:42.241
<v Speaker 1>at least one newspaper has yet more </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting the information in it than a </v>

2012
01:37:43.781 --> 01:37:46.900
<v Speaker 1>typical person in the 17 hundreds would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be exposed to for the entire lifetime.</v>

2013
01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the natural Predator of </v>

2014
01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because kangaroos are.</v>

2015
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>They're a native animal to Australia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they</v>

2016
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.940
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know,</v>

2017
01:37:56.941 --> 01:38:01.110
<v Speaker 3>there was a giant Predator in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zealand at least at one point in time.</v>

2018
01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:04.800
<v Speaker 3>It was called the Haast Eagle and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>an enormous eagle.</v>

2019
01:38:04.801 --> 01:38:09.801
<v Speaker 3>The biggest eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that ever lived and had </v>

2020
01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:11.170
<v Speaker 3>something like a 10 foot wingspan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe that even hunted people who</v>

2021
01:38:11.171 --> 01:38:14.790
<v Speaker 3>have huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge eagle and it's a part of the.</v>

2022
01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:20.420
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's the Mowery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of their ancient mythology </v>

2023
01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.540
<v Speaker 3>and they found out that it is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real animal.</v>

2024
01:38:21.541 --> 01:38:26.541
<v Speaker 3>That was somewhere around the 14 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds was made extinct through </v>

2025
01:38:26.541 --> 01:38:26.940
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

2026
01:38:27.490 --> 01:38:32.490
<v Speaker 1>My understanding was in Australia before</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans invaded crocodiles.</v>

2027
01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:38.220
<v Speaker 1>My understanding was it was just no </v>
<v Speaker 1>major predators for um,</v>

2028
01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.180
<v Speaker 1>that's the Tasmanian Tiger</v>

2029
01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:44.210
<v Speaker 3>thylacine yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call that thing the Tasmanian Tiger</v>

2030
01:38:44.211 --> 01:38:48.910
<v Speaker 3>that died during human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like modern Thompson's.</v>

2031
01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:53.920
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy looking picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's face will get that mouth on </v>

2032
01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:53.920
<v Speaker 3>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2033
01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:55.340
<v Speaker 3>But that I believe those things</v>

2034
01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:58.080
<v Speaker 1>died off in the cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just typed this in here,</v>

2035
01:38:58.081 --> 01:38:59.250
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's now extinct,</v>

2036
01:38:59.251 --> 01:39:02.700
<v Speaker 1>but the Dingo is probably the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator they had.</v>

2037
01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.860
<v Speaker 3>When did it die?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thylacine is now extinct.</v>

2038
01:39:05.861 --> 01:39:10.861
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans arrived in Australia at least </v>

2039
01:39:10.861 --> 01:39:10.861
<v Speaker 3>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and introduced the Dingo about</v>

2040
01:39:10.861 --> 01:39:11.050
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

2041
01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:17.230
<v Speaker 3>So maybe those things were tank </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos were a big part of Kangaroos,</v>

2042
01:39:17.231 --> 01:39:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I guess would probably catching them </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're not with.</v>

2043
01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:25.770
<v Speaker 3>They're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they carry their young inside their </v>

2044
01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:28.021
<v Speaker 3>body in that pouch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes them different from any </v>

2045
01:39:28.021 --> 01:39:29.450
<v Speaker 3>other kind of animal that it would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>prey because they can take care of their</v>

2046
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:30.820
<v Speaker 3>young and bounce away quickly.</v>

2047
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why.</v>

2048
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of large mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans killed every single type of large</v>

2049
01:39:37.791 --> 01:39:40.070
<v Speaker 1>mammal other than Kangaroos in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

2050
01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I think they were kind of hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different types of originally.</v>

2051
01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different things </v>

2052
01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:47.680
<v Speaker 1>other than Kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2053
01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2054
01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Like what again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2055
01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:49.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe giant Koalas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

2056
01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2057
01:39:52.161 --> 01:39:53.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2058
01:39:53.091 --> 01:39:58.091
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my understanding was the reason for </v>

2059
01:39:58.091 --> 01:39:58.091
<v Speaker 1>that was because they didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural predators.</v>

2060
01:39:58.091 --> 01:40:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they just didn't know what to do </v>

2061
01:40:02.650 --> 01:40:04.160
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that makes sense to have all of these</v>

2062
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:09.310
<v Speaker 1>defensive mechanisms there and also have</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves and coyotes and bears and all </v>

2063
01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:11.150
<v Speaker 1>these different things that are chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them down.</v>

2064
01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:14.990
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting that the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the most ethical thing to eat.</v>

2065
01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I would think you would think it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like mollusks.</v>

2066
01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

2067
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do think it's totally fine to eat </v>

2068
01:40:24.610 --> 01:40:25.240
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2069
01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:27.320
<v Speaker 1>what I say is I don't eat anything with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a plane.</v>

2070
01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:32.620
<v Speaker 1>So that means the oysters mussels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clams they have.</v>

2071
01:40:33.131 --> 01:40:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2072
01:40:34.161 --> 01:40:39.161
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got convinced I didn't use to be like </v>

2073
01:40:39.161 --> 01:40:39.161
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got convinced by.</v>

2074
01:40:39.161 --> 01:40:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm an advocate for gets called by valve</v>
<v Speaker 1>veganism.</v>

2075
01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make a big difference.</v>

2076
01:40:42.801 --> 01:40:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat them occasionally,</v>

2077
01:40:44.541 --> 01:40:46.730
<v Speaker 1>but you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like muscles.</v>

2078
01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:47.870
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2079
01:40:47.871 --> 01:40:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2080
01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had linguine with muscles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at a good Italian restaurant with </v>

2081
01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:53.920
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice red sauce?</v>

2082
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2083
01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.800
<v Speaker 2>so when they're good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>define and when the bad really bad in </v>

2084
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.740
<v Speaker 2>that case with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2085
01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Some things when they're good they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>grows hamburgers.</v>

2086
01:41:04.511 --> 01:41:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2087
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:06.590
<v Speaker 2>you can get down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2088
01:41:06.591 --> 01:41:08.770
<v Speaker 2>you could rotten food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2089
01:41:08.771 --> 01:41:09.730
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2090
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:12.100
<v Speaker 2>good pizza is just amazing pizza or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2091
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:14.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I feel like my,</v>

2092
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:17.260
<v Speaker 2>the fatty best muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like mad towards a really?</v>

2093
01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

2094
01:41:18.041 --> 01:41:19.870
<v Speaker 2>you need to go to a really good Italian </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>

2095
01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I ever had linguine with clams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do like clams.</v>

2096
01:41:23.621 --> 01:41:25.900
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel I feel pain differently.</v>

2097
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2098
01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:31.540
<v Speaker 2>she's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just need to go to a really good </v>

2099
01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:31.540
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are eating in England,</v>

2100
01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:31.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

2101
01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:33.490
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to make Italian food</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2102
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the great Indian.</v>

2103
01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:37.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a few people right now.</v>

2104
01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.250
<v Speaker 2>They're screaming in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2105
01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:40.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you son of a bitch.</v>

2106
01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:43.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm generalizing and I'm aware I'm an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorant and saying that,</v>

2107
01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.420
<v Speaker 2>but I can't defend English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuisine.</v>

2108
01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having been out to New York,</v>

2109
01:41:48.731 --> 01:41:52.550
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>London has some amazing restaurants now.</v>

2110
01:41:52.570 --> 01:41:53.890
<v Speaker 2>London does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2111
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:58.330
<v Speaker 2>But it was always the generalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotypical knock.</v>

2112
01:41:58.331 --> 01:42:03.331
<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Food in England was terrible the </v>

2113
01:42:03.331 --> 01:42:03.331
<v Speaker 2>first time I went there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty bad.</v>

2114
01:42:03.331 --> 01:42:07.740
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with respect to what's the most ethical </v>

2115
01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.331
<v Speaker 2>meat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is a really interesting </v>

2116
01:42:09.331 --> 01:42:10.921
<v Speaker 2>question because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the debate and vegetarianism </v>

2117
01:42:10.921 --> 01:42:14.401
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's normally face to this either or </v>

2118
01:42:14.401 --> 01:42:15.370
<v Speaker 2>thing like not doing anything or just go</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian or Vegan.</v>

2119
01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was interested in this question of</v>

2120
01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:19.030
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2121
01:42:19.031 --> 01:42:23.370
<v Speaker 2>well supposedly you only want to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>halfway or of the different foodstuffs,</v>

2122
01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:28.380
<v Speaker 2>like what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the ones that are going to do </v>

2123
01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:28.990
<v Speaker 2>the most in terms of animal welfare if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you cut them out?</v>

2124
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Because most people when they go halfway</v>
<v Speaker 2>to being vegetarian,</v>

2125
01:42:33.041 --> 01:42:35.530
<v Speaker 2>they might cut red meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beef and so on.</v>

2126
01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:40.780
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think if you care the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least about the animal welfare side of </v>

2127
01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:43.651
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just long and I think </v>

2128
01:42:43.651 --> 01:42:45.180
<v Speaker 2>there's two reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is a one,</v>

2129
01:42:45.210 --> 01:42:50.210
<v Speaker 2>it's the respect to the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering that the animal has in the </v>

2130
01:42:50.210 --> 01:42:54.031
<v Speaker 2>course of its life where the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens are couldn't lead to the tip.</v>

2131
01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:59.250
<v Speaker 2>If you look at just average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again we're talking about most </v>

2132
01:42:59.250 --> 01:42:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Checkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2133
01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:01.090
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish farming conditions,</v>

2134
01:43:01.091 --> 01:43:06.091
<v Speaker 2>which is well over 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 99 percent of chickens they've </v>

2135
01:43:06.091 --> 01:43:08.320
<v Speaker 2>eaten other than these conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>life's just,</v>

2136
01:43:08.410 --> 01:43:10.780
<v Speaker 2>I think they're the worst stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creatures on the planet basically.</v>

2137
01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cows I think often don't have great </v>

2138
01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.130
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just nothing really compared to</v>

2139
01:43:18.131 --> 01:43:19.480
<v Speaker 2>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think poker is similar,</v>

2140
01:43:19.481 --> 01:43:22.210
<v Speaker 2>like pigs also have really terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

2141
01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas yeah,</v>

2142
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.170
<v Speaker 2>large animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cows,</v>

2143
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:30.040
<v Speaker 2>a sheep just in general aren't being </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated as badly.</v>

2144
01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:34.210
<v Speaker 2>And then the second question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2145
01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:39.370
<v Speaker 2>how many animals are you affecting where</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2146
01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:45.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer steak or something that's like </v>

2147
01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:47.880
<v Speaker 2>a thousandth of account when I finished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas you can easily eat kind of half </v>

2148
01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.541
<v Speaker 2>a chicken and that's a factor that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people normally don't consider those as </v>

2149
01:43:51.541 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously maybe you value a cow's</v>

2150
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:54.200
<v Speaker 1>life later than a chicken's life or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2151
01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:59.230
<v Speaker 1>We do in some strange way the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have almost inherently,</v>

2152
01:43:59.301 --> 01:44:01.400
<v Speaker 1>or at least we do in the western world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2153
01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:06.401
<v Speaker 1>I think it was really hard to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is one of the hottest </v>

2154
01:44:06.401 --> 01:44:10.390
<v Speaker 1>philosophical question I've thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>about phages and have essentially given </v>

2155
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:14.351
<v Speaker 1>up on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got an unhappy cow day and </v>

2156
01:44:14.351 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 1>unhappy chicken tell you which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where I had to wait.</v>

2157
01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Those two can't or an unhappy fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have very few feelings about </v>

2158
01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:19.840
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

2159
01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.920
<v Speaker 1>you see a dead fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't feel the same way.</v>

2160
01:44:21.921 --> 01:44:23.630
<v Speaker 1>They feel if you see a dead lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:26.210
<v Speaker 1>But in general life become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic.</v>

2162
01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bias where we tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathize more with things that look </v>

2163
01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.260
<v Speaker 1>like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fish have these weird kind of look.</v>

2164
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.660
<v Speaker 1>They don't take care of the young too.</v>

2165
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:37.160
<v Speaker 1>That's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2166
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:42.520
<v Speaker 1>And so over time I've definitely become </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more sympathetic to taking </v>

2167
01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.270
<v Speaker 1>suffering of chickens and fish fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

2168
01:44:44.970 --> 01:44:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2169
01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I think when you combine these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors of,</v>

2170
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:50.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2171
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:51.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

2172
01:44:51.021 --> 01:44:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I think except that there's less good </v>
<v Speaker 1>information on them.</v>

2173
01:44:54.230 --> 01:44:55.750
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this might be in the category,</v>

2174
01:44:55.751 --> 01:44:58.100
<v Speaker 1>but certainly chickens and pigs compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to beef.</v>

2175
01:44:58.460 --> 01:44:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I actually think if you just want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill,</v>

2176
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:02.360
<v Speaker 1>like take out most of the suffering from</v>
<v Speaker 1>your diet,</v>

2177
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:05.610
<v Speaker 1>removing chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cage,</v>

2178
01:45:05.611 --> 01:45:10.611
<v Speaker 1>then caged eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the US actually that's </v>

2179
01:45:10.611 --> 01:45:10.670
<v Speaker 1>basically all x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you can show them yourself.</v>

2180
01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pork,</v>

2181
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I think you're the moving and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

2182
01:45:15.711 --> 01:45:20.711
<v Speaker 1>I think you moving most of the suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your diet vastly more than when it </v>

2183
01:45:20.711 --> 01:45:21.860
<v Speaker 1>comes to before milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2184
01:45:21.861 --> 01:45:26.861
<v Speaker 1>Well in terms of the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals that get impacted your </v>

2185
01:45:26.861 --> 01:45:30.431
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one cow can feed much more people </v>

2186
01:45:30.431 --> 01:45:30.431
<v Speaker 1>obviously then one chicken cancer.</v>

2187
01:45:30.431 --> 01:45:31.940
<v Speaker 1>So if you're taking one life and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

2188
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:34.610
<v Speaker 1>what disturbs me most about factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>farming?</v>

2189
01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one thing that disturbs me,</v>

2190
01:45:36.621 --> 01:45:41.621
<v Speaker 1>it sort of existed and then I found out </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and it was already there and I </v>

2191
01:45:41.621 --> 01:45:44.000
<v Speaker 1>had been eating it all along and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked me in that I was sitting.</v>

2192
01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:48.560
<v Speaker 1>I remember sitting back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd watched some documentary on it and I</v>

2193
01:45:48.561 --> 01:45:53.561
<v Speaker 1>remember sitting back thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened because we weren't paying </v>

2194
01:45:53.561 --> 01:45:54.590
<v Speaker 1>attention because I was a grown man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I found out about it,</v>

2195
01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't been paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you leave people alone and you </v>

2196
01:45:59.620 --> 01:45:59.930
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2197
01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:02.120
<v Speaker 1>do you think you can get us some beef?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's like,</v>

2198
01:46:02.121 --> 01:46:02.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2199
01:46:02.421 --> 01:46:02.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

2200
01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just stay over there and your city.</v>

2201
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll take care of it over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of sight,</v>

2202
01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:12.100
<v Speaker 1>out of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when we find out about it and </v>

2203
01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:13.250
<v Speaker 1>then you hear about in America we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things called ag gag laws.</v>

2204
01:46:13.251 --> 01:46:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

2205
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Like no possible justification for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>

2206
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

2207
01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Whets their hiding information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hiding information.</v>

2208
01:46:24.381 --> 01:46:29.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a case where there was an </v>

2209
01:46:29.381 --> 01:46:33.251
<v Speaker 1>animal welfare activists goes into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory farm is filming instances of </v>

2210
01:46:33.251 --> 01:46:37.571
<v Speaker 1>animal cruelty for of documentary film </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets presented and she got fired </v>

2211
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:43.850
<v Speaker 1>and had to go to prison for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervening in the animal cruelty.</v>

2212
01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:46.580
<v Speaker 1>That was just happening all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

2213
01:46:46.581 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>the person is actually about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she got tried for intervening,</v>

2214
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:55.010
<v Speaker 3>not stopping the animal cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just haven't to maintain all of the </v>

2215
01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:58.701
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought she would get tried for </v>

2216
01:46:58.701 --> 01:46:58.701
<v Speaker 3>violating the AG gag laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2217
01:46:58.701 --> 01:47:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Well she was an invasion of privacy on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the corporation.</v>

2218
01:47:01.810 --> 01:47:03.030
<v Speaker 3>The corporate secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2219
01:47:03.031 --> 01:47:04.600
<v Speaker 3>I think it was applied to the Ad Guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Louis.</v>

2220
01:47:04.770 --> 01:47:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they found another way to try to </v>

2221
01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:09.770
<v Speaker 3>discourage that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:10.200
<v Speaker 3>So that's so insane.</v>

2223
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:13.180
<v Speaker 2>But the thing you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which when you're talking about the ways</v>

2224
01:47:13.181 --> 01:47:16.510
<v Speaker 2>in which humans are broken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you just look at,</v>

2225
01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:21.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering the humans of inflicting now </v>

2226
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:24.460
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's really wanting is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanized it's become.</v>

2227
01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:27.790
<v Speaker 2>So if imagine if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2228
01:47:27.791 --> 01:47:32.791
<v Speaker 2>there was even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a chicken just like here in </v>

2229
01:47:32.791 --> 01:47:32.791
<v Speaker 2>front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't just for fun,</v>

2230
01:47:32.791 --> 01:47:34.690
<v Speaker 2>just kick it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2231
01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:38.080
<v Speaker 2>people would be outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would just think I'm this kind of</v>

2232
01:47:38.081 --> 01:47:43.081
<v Speaker 2>despicable person and that's the natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction because I'm just inflicting </v>

2233
01:47:43.081 --> 01:47:45.160
<v Speaker 2>unnecessarily suffering on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature.</v>

2234
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:50.910
<v Speaker 2>But then you can just modify the </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances such that this natural </v>

2235
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:55.711
<v Speaker 2>emotional reaction of sympathy just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fades away where now it's this huge </v>

2236
01:47:56.351 --> 01:48:01.351
<v Speaker 2>warehouse and it's not just one chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hundreds of thousands of chicken </v>

2237
01:48:01.351 --> 01:48:02.980
<v Speaker 2>and it's all mechanized and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken out of sight.</v>

2238
01:48:03.690 --> 01:48:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm suddenly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2239
01:48:06.130 --> 01:48:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean just Stalin said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2240
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:10.070
<v Speaker 2>single death is a tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a million deaths statistic,</v>

2241
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and life lessons for them stolen.</v>

2242
01:48:15.821 --> 01:48:16.510
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2243
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:18.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an extremely good quote,</v>

2244
01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:21.950
<v Speaker 3>but he was telling about humans and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2245
01:48:21.951 --> 01:48:25.670
<v Speaker 3>any death of a human will be tragedy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2246
01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:28.040
<v Speaker 3>when they get to large numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of,</v>

2247
01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:33.660
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to calculate because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for people to understand or </v>

2248
01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:34.400
<v Speaker 3>grasp the concept of a million people </v>
<v Speaker 3>dying.</v>

2249
01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:40.720
<v Speaker 3>What's bizarre about factory farming is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's all kind of done behind these </v>

2250
01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:49.480
<v Speaker 3>warehouse walls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all undercover and it's all </v>

2251
01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:52.880
<v Speaker 3>incredibly common and it's all not </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed.</v>

2252
01:48:53.210 --> 01:48:57.240
<v Speaker 3>This was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike was going to say the wars happening</v>

2253
01:48:57.241 --> 01:49:02.241
<v Speaker 3>and 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people a month are dying or discussing </v>

2254
01:49:02.241 --> 01:49:02.600
<v Speaker 3>how do we mitigate this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we stop this?</v>

2255
01:49:02.601 --> 01:49:04.220
<v Speaker 3>How do we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we bring peace?</v>

2256
01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:09.290
<v Speaker 3>There's so few people wondering how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop chicken suffering.</v>

2257
01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2258
01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:15.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean because we've looked into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the reasons it's such a </v>

2259
01:49:15.461 --> 01:49:18.260
<v Speaker 2>priority area is just the amount of just</v>
<v Speaker 2>philanthropic money going into this when</v>

2260
01:49:18.261 --> 01:49:20.210
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The focus is clearly on factory farming,</v>

2261
01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:25.240
<v Speaker 2>not sled dogs and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the low tens of millions of </v>

2262
01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:25.240
<v Speaker 2>dollars</v>

2263
01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.900
<v Speaker 3>trying to stop factory farming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2264
01:49:26.901 --> 01:49:31.901
<v Speaker 3>Or trying to mitigate it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the solution like other than </v>

2265
01:49:31.901 --> 01:49:31.901
<v Speaker 3>going vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian,</v>

2266
01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.200
<v Speaker 3>when have we reached this point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sort of like unmanageable point where</v>

2267
01:49:36.201 --> 01:49:38.810
<v Speaker 3>the population centers like Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>

2268
01:49:38.811 --> 01:49:43.811
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't grow their own food and have </v>

2269
01:49:43.811 --> 01:49:44.570
<v Speaker 3>gotten so massive that in order to fuel </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people with food,</v>

2270
01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.370
<v Speaker 3>especially with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with animal protein,</v>

2271
01:49:46.371 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 3>you almost have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have these setups.</v>

2272
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think if you've got the </v>

2273
01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:55.660
<v Speaker 1>constraint of animal protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2274
01:49:55.661 --> 01:50:00.661
<v Speaker 1>I think the answer's probably still no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing is you just don't </v>

2275
01:50:00.661 --> 01:50:02.800
<v Speaker 1>need that constraint of animal protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We eat way more meat than we did.</v>

2276
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2277
01:50:04.271 --> 01:50:05.890
<v Speaker 1>50 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years ago,</v>

2278
01:50:06.370 --> 01:50:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm far more than we need to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy diet.</v>

2279
01:50:08.890 --> 01:50:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been vegetarian 11 years.</v>

2280
01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you eat eggs though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Free range eggs?</v>

2281
01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2282
01:50:12.821 --> 01:50:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2283
01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:18.780
<v Speaker 1>that's for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand when people don't </v>

2284
01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:20.380
<v Speaker 1>like when Peter had that whole campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>about eggs or chickens periods,</v>

2285
01:50:20.381 --> 01:50:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2286
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I can understand you not wanting to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory farmed chickens,</v>

2287
01:50:24.641 --> 01:50:28.300
<v Speaker 1>eggs because these animals are tortured </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're confined and it's horrific,</v>

2288
01:50:28.301 --> 01:50:32.290
<v Speaker 1>but you can definitely find eggs and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have my own chickens.</v>

2289
01:50:32.291 --> 01:50:37.291
<v Speaker 1>I have 22 chickens and they lay eggs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat their eggs all the time and I ate </v>

2290
01:50:37.291 --> 01:50:37.900
<v Speaker 1>five of them this morning.</v>

2291
01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:42.900
<v Speaker 1>They're great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're talking about those </v>

2292
01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:42.900
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

2293
01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eggs come out,</v>

2294
01:50:46.330 --> 01:50:48.150
<v Speaker 1>they don't become a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take them.</v>

2295
01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:51.400
<v Speaker 1>It's free and those chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2296
01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:54.460
<v Speaker 1>there are a bunch of little murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run around my yard.</v>

2297
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them eat a mouse before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they found a bird that was down like </v>

2298
01:50:59.550 --> 01:51:03.631
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a nesting bird that had fallen out </v>

2299
01:51:03.631 --> 01:51:03.631
<v Speaker 1>of a nest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll fuck that bird up.</v>

2300
01:51:03.631 --> 01:51:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing they don't seem to like,</v>

2301
01:51:06.431 --> 01:51:08.890
<v Speaker 1>they don't seem to like slugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2302
01:51:08.891 --> 01:51:10.110
<v Speaker 1>You've tried to feed them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2303
01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:13.690
<v Speaker 1>they eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pick up a rock in my garden.</v>

2304
01:51:13.691 --> 01:51:18.691
<v Speaker 1>I'll pick up a rock and they should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>come over and just jack anything that's </v>

2305
01:51:18.691 --> 01:51:19.030
<v Speaker 1>under the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out that when I lift up the</v>

2306
01:51:19.031 --> 01:51:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's bugs under there,</v>

2307
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:21.970
<v Speaker 1>there a little murderers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2308
01:51:21.971 --> 01:51:22.750
<v Speaker 1>they're ruthless.</v>

2309
01:51:22.930 --> 01:51:27.930
<v Speaker 1>They don't like slugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try them and then they start </v>

2310
01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:31.590
<v Speaker 1>shaking their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to get the slime off their </v>

2311
01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:31.590
<v Speaker 1>beak and it kind of freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:31.590
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2313
01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:35.761
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big within the animal welfare kind </v>

2314
01:51:35.761 --> 01:51:38.540
<v Speaker 1>of animal activists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is actually quite big divide </v>

2315
01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:38.540
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2316
01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you could call them maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>abolitionists to one side and the </v>

2317
01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:43.870
<v Speaker 1>feminists and the abolitionists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The view is just,</v>

2318
01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

2319
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:47.740
<v Speaker 1>The way we treat animals is like how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated slaves.</v>

2320
01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:53.720
<v Speaker 1>This is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of the equivalent of </v>

2321
01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:53.720
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of time and the only end,</v>

2322
01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:58.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if we'd been in slave owning </v>

2323
01:51:58.701 --> 01:51:58.701
<v Speaker 1>Americans had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2324
01:51:58.701 --> 01:52:00.850
<v Speaker 1>well why don't we just cut down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of slaves?</v>

2325
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:03.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just not doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll model csns,</v>

2326
01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:07.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the welfare lists in contrast,</v>

2327
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:10.800
<v Speaker 1>a more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look almost oldest something.</v>

2328
01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.850
<v Speaker 1>If we're going to quantify the soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing of the way humans,</v>

2329
01:52:12.851 --> 01:52:16.870
<v Speaker 1>the animals know 99 percent of it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from factory farms.</v>

2330
01:52:16.871 --> 01:52:18.940
<v Speaker 1>If we could eliminate and factory farms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

2331
01:52:18.941 --> 01:52:23.941
<v Speaker 1>there's still something left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like even if you could a went </v>

2332
01:52:23.941 --> 01:52:27.330
<v Speaker 1>on the kind of final stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is where the vast majority of </v>

2333
01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:28.420
<v Speaker 1>both the animals used under the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions are.</v>

2334
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And so the welfare would instead say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2335
01:52:30.311 --> 01:52:35.311
<v Speaker 1>let's literally just focus all of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention on this and things like </v>

2336
01:52:35.311 --> 01:52:38.761
<v Speaker 1>theater and eggs or services or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for just these are just literally kind </v>

2337
01:52:38.761 --> 01:52:42.060
<v Speaker 1>of not the main issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2338
01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:47.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm naturally most sympathetic to the </v>

2339
01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:47.720
<v Speaker 1>kind of welfare perspective.</v>

2340
01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is interesting of the animal.</v>

2341
01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I know lots of people who were in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>welfare this camp and then moved to the </v>

2342
01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:55.850
<v Speaker 2>abolitionists camp on welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The clowns were.</v>

2343
01:52:55.851 --> 01:53:00.851
<v Speaker 2>The kind of Wiley is just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're just an to get people to do a </v>

2344
01:53:00.851 --> 01:53:04.061
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're not actually going to move </v>

2345
01:53:04.061 --> 01:53:04.700
<v Speaker 2>them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you need to have this hard moral</v>

2346
01:53:04.701 --> 01:53:07.490
<v Speaker 2>line and then people kind of see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity of that follow up.</v>

2347
01:53:07.610 --> 01:53:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that there's a slippery </v>

2348
01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:14.561
<v Speaker 3>slope when agriculture and civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>were introduced that someone wasn't </v>

2349
01:53:14.561 --> 01:53:18.401
<v Speaker 3>going to exploit it to the nth degree </v>
<v Speaker 3>and finger while it's just got to be a </v>

2350
01:53:18.401 --> 01:53:18.500
<v Speaker 3>better way to squeeze money out of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

2351
01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:21.230
<v Speaker 3>And then next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got these factory pig farms.</v>

2352
01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've seen those horrific one where </v>

2353
01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:28.520
<v Speaker 3>they fly the drone over the lakes of pig</v>
<v Speaker 3>pis and pig shit.</v>

2354
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:33.870
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That these animals are living just </v>

2355
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:35.801
<v Speaker 3>completely confined where they can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even turn around and they're just </v>

2356
01:53:35.801 --> 01:53:38.861
<v Speaker 3>pumping them up with whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>they need to keep them alive until they </v>

2357
01:53:38.861 --> 01:53:38.861
<v Speaker 3>get to a certain point where they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill them.</v>

2358
01:53:38.861 --> 01:53:39.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2359
01:53:39.550 --> 01:53:42.190
<v Speaker 2>and it is through people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people would be.</v>

2360
01:53:42.191 --> 01:53:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was lightly and fund,</v>

2361
01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.130
<v Speaker 2>it would be second.</v>

2362
01:53:45.330 --> 01:53:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hence the AG gag laws.</v>

2363
01:53:47.730 --> 01:53:52.730
<v Speaker 3>In order to keep that money coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to keep people in the dark of </v>

2364
01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:55.761
<v Speaker 3>these situations unless they go online </v>
<v Speaker 3>and seek it out and watch these videos.</v>

2365
01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.130
<v Speaker 3>And those videos are very polarizing too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

2366
01:53:59.210 --> 01:54:04.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you come to a lot of these animal </v>

2367
01:54:04.210 --> 01:54:05.661
<v Speaker 3>rights organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them have roots in the Animal </v>

2368
01:54:05.661 --> 01:54:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Liberation Organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't even believe that you </v>

2369
01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:11.211
<v Speaker 3>should have pets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that your pets are all </v>

2370
01:54:11.211 --> 01:54:11.250
<v Speaker 3>prisoners.</v>

2371
01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting.</v>

2372
01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Going back to Peter Singer were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said the animal liberation,</v>

2373
01:54:16.001 --> 01:54:19.930
<v Speaker 2>which was the name of his book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was kind of text founding text for</v>

2374
01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:25.140
<v Speaker 2>what became the animal rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting is the singer </v>

2375
01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:26.320
<v Speaker 2>doesn't believe in rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a consequentialist.</v>

2376
01:54:26.321 --> 01:54:27.310
<v Speaker 2>CC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>utilitarian.</v>

2377
01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Never used the word once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what he,</v>

2378
01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:31.890
<v Speaker 2>his approach would just be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2379
01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 2>what's going to do the most good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2380
01:54:34.150 --> 01:54:36.610
<v Speaker 2>and on the pets question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2381
01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:38.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to speak for Peter,</v>

2382
01:54:38.801 --> 01:54:40.420
<v Speaker 2>but he's going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2383
01:54:40.421 --> 01:54:43.360
<v Speaker 2>if they have a good life and the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>teetered just seems fine.</v>

2384
01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd want to say like,</v>

2385
01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:47.650
<v Speaker 2>the focus should be on suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2386
01:54:47.651 --> 01:54:52.651
<v Speaker 2>On the huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vast magnitudes of suffering that goes </v>

2387
01:54:52.651 --> 01:54:52.651
<v Speaker 2>on in factory farms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's with one,</v>

2388
01:54:52.651 --> 01:54:52.651
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

2389
01:54:52.651 --> 01:54:52.690
<v Speaker 2>and four.</v>

2390
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard time even entertaining the</v>

2391
01:54:55.981 --> 01:55:00.981
<v Speaker 3>conversation that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong with a healthy pet dog like that </v>

2392
01:55:00.981 --> 01:55:04.551
<v Speaker 3>dog loved the owner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people love the dog and the dog has </v>

2393
01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:07.521
<v Speaker 3>obviously gone through an incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary process where it's gone </v>

2394
01:55:07.521 --> 01:55:12.261
<v Speaker 3>from being a wolf to being a Chihuahua.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you think that thing should be </v>

2395
01:55:12.261 --> 01:55:13.470
<v Speaker 3>out fending for itself and the forest </v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

2396
01:55:13.471 --> 01:55:15.300
<v Speaker 3>you're dooming that little fucker to </v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

2397
01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:20.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question that dog in all of these </v>

2398
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:23.001
<v Speaker 3>cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the animals wouldn't exist </v>

2399
01:55:23.001 --> 01:55:23.001
<v Speaker 3>otherwise and that wouldn't exist from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2400
01:55:23.001 --> 01:55:27.231
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it wasn't for people breeding </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and making them this bulldog like </v>

2401
01:55:27.231 --> 01:55:31.341
<v Speaker 3>this thing that can't even hardly </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathe and walks with a wattle like </v>

2402
01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:32.040
<v Speaker 3>we're weird that we've done that in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first year place.</v>

2403
01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I find especially the pets like </v>

2404
01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:37.100
<v Speaker 2>dogs that have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2405
01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:39.000
<v Speaker 2>like difficulty thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic diseases.</v>

2406
01:55:39.210 --> 01:55:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I find it kind of goes like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gross that we've kind of done that.</v>

2407
01:55:42.330 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What type of</v>

2408
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.710
<v Speaker 3>dog do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Shibu Ino English bulldog mix.</v>

2409
01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Some poor little fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a mess.</v>

2410
01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:50.150
<v Speaker 3>We got him as a puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2411
01:55:50.170 --> 01:55:55.170
<v Speaker 3>because he was cute and he just seemed </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it needed a home and we took </v>

2412
01:55:55.170 --> 01:55:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Amanda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2413
01:55:55.170 --> 01:55:57.600
<v Speaker 3>he's all messed up man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've had them for 10 years.</v>

2414
01:55:57.601 --> 01:56:00.360
<v Speaker 3>He said all these surgeries and can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>walk right?</v>

2415
01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:02.700
<v Speaker 3>His hips are all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just like,</v>

2416
01:56:02.701 --> 01:56:05.300
<v Speaker 3>they breed them to the point where he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>half sheebu.</v>

2417
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:09.300
<v Speaker 3>He knows he's actually better off than a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of bulldogs because he's 12 now.</v>

2418
01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think bulldogs usually live that</v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

2419
01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:16.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they lived to that age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's got all sorts of difficulties.</v>

2420
01:56:16.330 --> 01:56:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Can't really run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2421
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:20.160
<v Speaker 3>he's lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just likes to lay down snore.</v>

2422
01:56:20.610 --> 01:56:23.880
<v Speaker 3>But the poor little things like if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at an actual,</v>

2423
01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:26.970
<v Speaker 3>like legit English bulldog with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>flat faces,</v>

2424
01:56:26.971 --> 01:56:30.890
<v Speaker 3>like they have massive respiratory </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems and yeah.</v>

2425
01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:34.620
<v Speaker 3>So I find that like the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>like engaged in this paddock,</v>

2426
01:56:35.370 --> 01:56:37.050
<v Speaker 3>depleting them kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then like,</v>

2427
01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to have a dog and look </v>

2428
01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:42.080
<v Speaker 3>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well like it's not the problem.</v>

2429
01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:47.000
<v Speaker 3>And so this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this question is just if you're talking </v>

2430
01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.161
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you just like distracting from the </v>

2431
01:56:49.161 --> 01:56:50.040
<v Speaker 3>main issue which is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So seems to me that,</v>

2432
01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:52.410
<v Speaker 3>that this is just like everything else </v>
<v Speaker 3>in life,</v>

2433
01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:57.920
<v Speaker 3>like as you go down the rabbit hole and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at a deeper and deeper and </v>

2434
01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:57.920
<v Speaker 3>deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

2435
01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:58.290
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a complicated issue.</v>

2436
01:56:58.770 --> 01:57:03.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you get all these people to stop </v>

2437
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:04.290
<v Speaker 3>eating so much meat so that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>need so much meat so that you don't need</v>

2438
01:57:04.291 --> 01:57:09.291
<v Speaker 3>factory farming and have to get people </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of what is the consequences of </v>

2439
01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:11.880
<v Speaker 3>going and buying a chicken sandwich?</v>

2440
01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know where that chicken came </v>

2441
01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:16.880
<v Speaker 3>from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here?</v>

2442
01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you happy now?</v>

2443
01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:20.710
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they watched those videos and then </v>

2444
01:57:20.710 --> 01:57:20.710
<v Speaker 3>they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2445
01:57:20.710 --> 01:57:20.710
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hungry.</v>

2446
01:57:20.710 --> 01:57:20.820
<v Speaker 3>I want a chicken sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2447
01:57:20.821 --> 01:57:22.650
<v Speaker 3>lots of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think though,</v>

2448
01:57:22.651 --> 01:57:26.730
<v Speaker 3>like so in the UK at least if you buy a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pack of cigarettes,</v>

2449
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:28.920
<v Speaker 3>you get these pictures on them showing </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of what this is,</v>

2450
01:57:28.921 --> 01:57:33.921
<v Speaker 3>what the lungs will look like if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke 20 a day and those warnings and </v>

2451
01:57:33.921 --> 01:57:33.921
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2452
01:57:33.921 --> 01:57:34.050
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't stop people in some weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2453
01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean people are addicted to sick of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that so I think it must have some </v>

2454
01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:39.560
<v Speaker 3>impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder it does.</v>

2455
01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:41.310
<v Speaker 3>If you could buy a pack of chicken and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd say,</v>

2456
01:57:41.311 --> 01:57:45.000
<v Speaker 3>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is this field of piss and shit.</v>

2457
01:57:45.090 --> 01:57:46.410
<v Speaker 3>That chicken grew up in.</v>

2458
01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the opposite of an ag gag law.</v>

2459
01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Like force it in your face because look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're just giving the consumer </v>

2460
01:57:54.371 --> 01:57:56.000
<v Speaker 3>more information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having that.</v>

2461
01:57:56.430 --> 01:58:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Like if you went to the butcher shop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to the butcher section in the </v>

2462
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:05.221
<v Speaker 3>grocery store and there was videos that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were playing constantly above the </v>

2463
01:58:05.221 --> 01:58:07.800
<v Speaker 3>package meat that showed these animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting like a piston through the head,</v>

2464
01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:11.970
<v Speaker 3>hanging by their ankles and getting bled</v>
<v Speaker 3>out while they kicked.</v>

2465
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how many people that would be a </v>

2466
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:18.720
<v Speaker 3>fucking conveyor belt of baby mail </v>
<v Speaker 3>checks falling into this.</v>

2467
01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:23.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting ground up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a fascinating </v>

2468
01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:28.401
<v Speaker 3>psychological examination to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>people walk up to that butcher shop and </v>

2469
01:58:28.771 --> 01:58:31.560
<v Speaker 3>see those videos playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if that became the law.</v>

2470
01:58:31.690 --> 01:58:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

2471
01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:37.670
<v Speaker 3>there's an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a comedy sketch show that um,</v>

2472
01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 3>did something kind of similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the bill would go up to</v>

2473
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.480
<v Speaker 2>the butcher's counter and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2474
01:58:43.481 --> 01:58:44.920
<v Speaker 2>I'd like some sausages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

2475
01:58:44.921 --> 01:58:47.670
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up a little baby pig at good to,</v>

2476
01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:50.260
<v Speaker 2>into this box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This box is obviously fake.</v>

2477
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:55.470
<v Speaker 2>And just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this action in sausages would come </v>

2478
01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:57.721
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they're not actually getting </v>

2479
01:58:57.721 --> 01:58:59.330
<v Speaker 2>it right and people will be out late and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2480
01:59:00.930 --> 01:59:04.600
<v Speaker 2>no web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She not know where pork comes down.</v>

2481
01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:10.860
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that's just amazing is </v>

2482
01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:10.860
<v Speaker 2>how people can call themselves an animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>lovers.</v>

2483
01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Well there's also</v>

2484
01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:16.540
<v Speaker 3>people that love animals and eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they'll eat steak and then get mad </v>

2485
01:59:16.641 --> 01:59:18.080
<v Speaker 3>at people for hunting animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2486
01:59:18.250 --> 01:59:20.300
<v Speaker 3>I've experienced that personally.</v>

2487
01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:23.860
<v Speaker 2>This is a good case though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the salient issue where,</v>

2488
01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2489
01:59:26.050 --> 01:59:29.560
<v Speaker 2>so I have like a post hunting and bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>fandom that gets killed,</v>

2490
01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:35.160
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is it's so salient </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to factually farming and it's </v>

2491
01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.220
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2492
01:59:36.221 --> 01:59:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I prefer that people hung meat other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than like factory farming.</v>

2493
01:59:38.831 --> 01:59:39.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

2494
01:59:39.501 --> 01:59:44.501
<v Speaker 2>and like you do the math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like not only am I behind that and </v>

2495
01:59:44.501 --> 01:59:44.860
<v Speaker 2>behind that like a thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2496
01:59:44.861 --> 01:59:47.470
<v Speaker 2>the hunting is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this fairly salient thing,</v>

2497
01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:48.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UK,</v>

2498
01:59:48.490 --> 01:59:51.280
<v Speaker 2>a huge uproar about fox hunting and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2499
01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:53.350
<v Speaker 2>But that's a different thing because fox</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

2500
01:59:53.351 --> 01:59:55.450
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not eating it now.</v>

2501
01:59:55.470 --> 01:59:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's supposed to be for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2502
01:59:57.041 --> 01:59:58.330
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda like I'm in control.</v>

2503
01:59:58.410 --> 01:59:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's some,</v>

2504
01:59:59.581 --> 02:00:03.270
<v Speaker 3>there's some logic to that that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have natural predators,</v>

2505
02:00:03.271 --> 02:00:08.271
<v Speaker 3>you need to figure out some way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>control certain populations that can be </v>

2506
02:00:08.271 --> 02:00:10.560
<v Speaker 3>damaging like Fox or in some places </v>
<v Speaker 3>black bear.</v>

2507
02:00:10.561 --> 02:00:12.990
<v Speaker 3>And there's a bunch of different animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you do have to control because they</v>

2508
02:00:12.991 --> 02:00:14.820
<v Speaker 3>don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a natural predator.</v>

2509
02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2510
02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:19.320
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that's like incredible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2511
02:00:19.321 --> 02:00:24.321
<v Speaker 2>it's just how people can have such long </v>
<v Speaker 2>views on that and such long views on </v>

2512
02:00:24.321 --> 02:00:26.280
<v Speaker 2>hunting and then just eat me know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions effectively.</v>

2513
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Farming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2514
02:00:27.090 --> 02:00:28.500
<v Speaker 2>They just don't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2515
02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:31.080
<v Speaker 2>it is just because we have value </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulable.</v>

2516
02:00:31.081 --> 02:00:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Is he in terms of a model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the action.</v>

2517
02:00:34.530 --> 02:00:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Well there's obviously a wedding because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain that you have.</v>

2518
02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:40.970
<v Speaker 3>There are certain animals that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to control the populations of less,</v>

2519
02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:45.980
<v Speaker 3>especially invasive species like pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like wild pigs are huge problem in </v>

2520
02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:50.301
<v Speaker 3>America and getting bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you guys don't have them as much </v>

2521
02:00:50.301 --> 02:00:50.370
<v Speaker 3>in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>

2522
02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:55.460
<v Speaker 3>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in Texas and now in </v>

2523
02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:55.830
<v Speaker 3>northern California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a massive,</v>

2524
02:00:55.831 --> 02:01:00.831
<v Speaker 3>massive populations of wild pigs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they give birth two to three times a </v>

2525
02:01:00.831 --> 02:01:04.881
<v Speaker 3>year and they can give birth to as many </v>
<v Speaker 3>as three to six piglets in each lit and </v>

2526
02:01:05.401 --> 02:01:10.401
<v Speaker 3>they just caught and then six months </v>
<v Speaker 3>later those piglets are ready to give </v>

2527
02:01:10.401 --> 02:01:10.401
<v Speaker 3>birth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they just boom,</v>

2528
02:01:10.401 --> 02:01:10.620
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2529
02:01:10.621 --> 02:01:15.621
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't control their </v>

2530
02:01:15.621 --> 02:01:16.941
<v Speaker 3>populations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you gonna do you're gonna like </v>

2531
02:01:16.941 --> 02:01:16.941
<v Speaker 3>let wolves lose to control their </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations.</v>

2532
02:01:16.941 --> 02:01:17.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have to figure out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2533
02:01:18.210 --> 02:01:23.210
<v Speaker 3>and so they've taken to a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same strategies that they're using in </v>

2534
02:01:23.210 --> 02:01:25.230
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand that we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what stags in Texas,</v>

2535
02:01:25.530 --> 02:01:30.530
<v Speaker 3>they have these helicopter hunts where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they fly around in helicopters just </v>

2536
02:01:30.530 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 3>gunned down hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these pigs and they do wind up donating </v>

2537
02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:38.940
<v Speaker 3>the meat of that pigs to homeless </v>
<v Speaker 3>shelters and people who need it and it.</v>

2538
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:42.710
<v Speaker 3>It's actually very nutritious and very </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy and very good for you and that's</v>

2539
02:01:42.711 --> 02:01:47.711
<v Speaker 3>probably way better than buying pig from</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's raised it in some horrific</v>

2540
02:01:48.111 --> 02:01:53.111
<v Speaker 3>factory farming environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for people that just want the </v>

2541
02:01:53.111 --> 02:01:54.230
<v Speaker 3>animals to live and be unchallenged in </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2542
02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:56.330
<v Speaker 3>on preyed upon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2543
02:01:56.690 --> 02:02:01.690
<v Speaker 3>They all seemed very disturbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to control the populations </v>

2544
02:02:01.690 --> 02:02:02.090
<v Speaker 3>because you're not going to have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture.</v>

2545
02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:07.840
<v Speaker 3>They're going to find out where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>farms are and they tear them apart at </v>

2546
02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:07.840
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're nocturnal animals.</v>

2547
02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 3>You can't stop them with fences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go right through fences,</v>

2548
02:02:10.611 --> 02:02:11.960
<v Speaker 3>they're huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge animals,</v>

2549
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:15.590
<v Speaker 3>wild pigs create millions of dollars of </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage in Riverside County.</v>

2550
02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2551
02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:20.480
<v Speaker 3>That's like Riverside county's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>super populated,</v>

2552
02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:22.970
<v Speaker 3>but this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an enormous,</v>

2553
02:02:22.971 --> 02:02:25.160
<v Speaker 3>enormous problem in this country and by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>

2554
02:02:25.161 --> 02:02:30.161
<v Speaker 3>when you look at that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really cool about pigs is that </v>

2555
02:02:30.161 --> 02:02:30.161
<v Speaker 3>they morph.</v>

2556
02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:35.260
<v Speaker 3>When you see that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks very different than a domestic </v>

2557
02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:35.260
<v Speaker 3>pig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's exact same animal.</v>

2558
02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:38.140
<v Speaker 3>They're all the same genus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so called [inaudible],</v>

2559
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:43.750
<v Speaker 3>and when you take a domestic pig and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>let it go within months,</v>

2560
02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:47.510
<v Speaker 3>within months of being free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hair starts to change.</v>

2561
02:02:47.630 --> 02:02:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Their snouts starts to elongate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their tusks start to grow longer.</v>

2562
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:53.360
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they become feral,</v>

2563
02:02:53.361 --> 02:02:55.460
<v Speaker 3>once they realize they have to fend for </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

2564
02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:59.510
<v Speaker 3>there's an actual physiological change </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the structure of their body.</v>

2565
02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:03.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really crazy.</v>

2566
02:03:03.141 --> 02:03:08.141
<v Speaker 3>Their hair gets thicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they develop a thicker plate the males </v>

2567
02:03:08.141 --> 02:03:11.951
<v Speaker 3>do around the chest to protect </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves from other males when they </v>

2568
02:03:11.951 --> 02:03:12.620
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre.</v>

2569
02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:15.860
<v Speaker 3>So those wild pigs that people see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of different kinds.</v>

2570
02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are Russian boars are wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2571
02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:21.200
<v Speaker 3>the different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different kind of a pig,</v>

2572
02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.330
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately they all interbreed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

2573
02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:29.060
<v Speaker 3>It's just so interesting as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coming back to the question of what's </v>

2574
02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:32.630
<v Speaker 3>natural and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people often think about meat that a </v>

2575
02:03:32.630 --> 02:03:36.101
<v Speaker 3>thing as well where if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chickens can barely stand because </v>

2576
02:03:36.681 --> 02:03:39.260
<v Speaker 3>they've been so engineered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge blasts,</v>

2577
02:03:39.310 --> 02:03:41.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pigs that you're talking about like,</v>

2578
02:03:41.890 --> 02:03:44.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not meant to be pink to be blown,</v>

2579
02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:50.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cows just can you really imagine a cow </v>

2580
02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:53.141
<v Speaker 3>like evolving in the wild are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course not all of these things that </v>

2581
02:03:53.141 --> 02:03:57.250
<v Speaker 3>can edibly unnatural through thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>of years of a selective leading.</v>

2582
02:03:57.450 --> 02:04:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Well crap cows don't live in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's where it gets interesting.</v>

2583
02:04:01.221 --> 02:04:03.890
<v Speaker 3>In Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when cows have gotten wild,</v>

2584
02:04:04.190 --> 02:04:09.190
<v Speaker 3>they've gotten loose from these pens </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people held them in and then they </v>

2585
02:04:09.190 --> 02:04:13.661
<v Speaker 3>become what they call scrub bowls and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're out there in the wild and people</v>

2586
02:04:13.881 --> 02:04:18.881
<v Speaker 3>hunt them like they would hunt a wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal and they're very wary and they </v>

2587
02:04:18.881 --> 02:04:18.881
<v Speaker 3>run from people.</v>

2588
02:04:18.881 --> 02:04:23.740
<v Speaker 3>They see people that get the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and the bowls are incredibly </v>

2589
02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:24.140
<v Speaker 3>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

2590
02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:29.200
<v Speaker 3>the male cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These scrub bowls are some of the most </v>

2591
02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:33.101
<v Speaker 3>dangerous things to hunt in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they'll actively chase you down </v>

2592
02:04:33.101 --> 02:04:33.380
<v Speaker 3>like a bull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2593
02:04:33.381 --> 02:04:38.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you see like people trying to ride </v>

2594
02:04:38.381 --> 02:04:40.271
<v Speaker 3>bowls and bowls kick and they go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these scrub bowls are essentially </v>

2595
02:04:40.271 --> 02:04:40.920
<v Speaker 3>those bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but many,</v>

2596
02:04:40.921 --> 02:04:42.210
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many generations.</v>

2597
02:04:42.211 --> 02:04:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're feral bowls.</v>

2598
02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2599
02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:51.340
<v Speaker 3>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of were bred to be this </v>

2600
02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:55.041
<v Speaker 3>domestic thing and then they got loose </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they became this wild thing and</v>

2601
02:04:55.231 --> 02:04:57.870
<v Speaker 3>so they look slightly differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they look like.</v>

2602
02:04:57.930 --> 02:05:02.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a scrub bull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're becoming slowly over the </v>

2603
02:05:02.930 --> 02:05:06.240
<v Speaker 3>course of many generations are more wild</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

2604
02:05:06.450 --> 02:05:11.450
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have these hunts for these </v>

2605
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:11.450
<v Speaker 3>scribbles and if that thing sees you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2606
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:14.010
<v Speaker 3>that crazy look and bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will fuck you up.</v>

2607
02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:20.050
<v Speaker 3>There are some of the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals that you can encounter in the </v>

2608
02:05:20.050 --> 02:05:20.580
<v Speaker 3>wild apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2609
02:05:20.581 --> 02:05:21.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a buddy,</v>

2610
02:05:21.450 --> 02:05:22.470
<v Speaker 3>my friend Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2611
02:05:22.471 --> 02:05:24.900
<v Speaker 3>They look different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like look at the Hump on its back,</v>

2612
02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:30.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean that looks like some crazy wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>African animal and it was originally a </v>

2613
02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:34.551
<v Speaker 3>long time ago of regular domestic cow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it shows just how officially they </v>

2614
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:38.170
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's just,</v>

2615
02:05:38.370 --> 02:05:41.390
<v Speaker 3>if that's the sort of changes you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>over just the course of a few generation</v>

2616
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:44.970
<v Speaker 3>natural selection as opposed to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing with dogs.</v>

2617
02:05:45.090 --> 02:05:47.310
<v Speaker 3>You know when we create a bulldog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is,</v>

2618
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:52.580
<v Speaker 3>those are the animals that have survived</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and they've changed their </v>

2619
02:05:52.580 --> 02:05:54.450
<v Speaker 3>coloration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their physical structure looks different</v>

2620
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:56.160
<v Speaker 3>in over many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many generations.</v>

2621
02:05:56.161 --> 02:05:57.720
<v Speaker 3>It's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite fascinating.</v>

2622
02:05:57.740 --> 02:06:00.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we have to figure out where we</v>

2623
02:06:00.451 --> 02:06:03.900
<v Speaker 3>stand I think in terms of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecosystem,</v>

2624
02:06:04.110 --> 02:06:06.450
<v Speaker 3>because we're certainly not viable.</v>

2625
02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:09.180
<v Speaker 3>We can't go out there and live amongst </v>
<v Speaker 3>those animals.</v>

2626
02:06:09.181 --> 02:06:10.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean we won't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get killed,</v>

2627
02:06:10.801 --> 02:06:15.801
<v Speaker 3>will get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We so we have to stay inside of our </v>

2628
02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:18.921
<v Speaker 3>homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to stay inside of our </v>

2629
02:06:18.921 --> 02:06:19.440
<v Speaker 3>environments and then we have to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out like how much of an impact should we</v>

2630
02:06:19.441 --> 02:06:22.980
<v Speaker 3>have on those things around us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we be like all the other animals,</v>

2631
02:06:23.070 --> 02:06:25.620
<v Speaker 3>like all the wolves and all these other </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

2632
02:06:25.621 --> 02:06:30.621
<v Speaker 3>the coyotes that have this impact on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment or should we try to lessen </v>

2633
02:06:30.621 --> 02:06:33.690
<v Speaker 3>our footprint to the point where we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero impact on any of the animals and we</v>

2634
02:06:33.691 --> 02:06:36.780
<v Speaker 3>just live inside of these sustained </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas that grow vegetation.</v>

2635
02:06:37.550 --> 02:06:38.190
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2636
02:06:38.250 --> 02:06:41.880
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting question because </v>
<v Speaker 3>those animals prey on each other.</v>

2637
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:43.120
<v Speaker 3>They all do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

2638
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:46.020
<v Speaker 3>what should we be a part of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we take place?</v>

2639
02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Should we take part in that?</v>

2640
02:06:47.670 --> 02:06:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't think we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>factory farm.</v>

2641
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that that was a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistake and I also definitely think that</v>

2642
02:06:54.571 --> 02:06:58.290
<v Speaker 3>that huge mistake is what led us to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to have these gigantic cities and I</v>

2643
02:06:58.291 --> 02:07:00.780
<v Speaker 3>don't think necessarily cities are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge mistake,</v>

2644
02:07:01.110 --> 02:07:06.110
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how to feed those </v>

2645
02:07:06.110 --> 02:07:06.570
<v Speaker 3>people in the way that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>accustomed to eating right now.</v>

2646
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:08.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a massive,</v>

2647
02:07:08.770 --> 02:07:10.190
<v Speaker 3>massive battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2648
02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:15.200
<v Speaker 3>But I think the kind of question of </v>
<v Speaker 3>large populations and how do you feed </v>

2649
02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:19.341
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that massively tells in favor of flow </v>

2650
02:07:19.341 --> 02:07:20.390
<v Speaker 3>and meat consumption or vegetation or </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you've got this 10 to one little</v>

2651
02:07:20.410 --> 02:07:24.150
<v Speaker 3>way to create a category of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need 10 calories or more of,</v>

2652
02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:29.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of they ignore soliah wherever you're </v>

2653
02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:33.171
<v Speaker 3>feeding them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're dealing with people just </v>

2654
02:07:33.171 --> 02:07:33.171
<v Speaker 3>consuming wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2655
02:07:33.171 --> 02:07:33.171
<v Speaker 3>Wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2656
02:07:33.171 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos or something with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>exceptions to that as well.</v>

2657
02:07:36.161 --> 02:07:41.161
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's enough to feed </v>

2658
02:07:41.161 --> 02:07:41.161
<v Speaker 3>people though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing.</v>

2659
02:07:41.161 --> 02:07:41.560
<v Speaker 3>There's 350 million people in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

2660
02:07:41.561 --> 02:07:43.700
<v Speaker 3>There's not $350 million wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2661
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:44.140
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2662
02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it means that in the future,</v>

2663
02:07:46.661 --> 02:07:50.860
<v Speaker 2>just as populations get larger than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2664
02:07:50.861 --> 02:07:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to need to use,</v>

2665
02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:55.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>landon energy more efficiently.</v>

2666
02:07:55.601 --> 02:08:00.601
<v Speaker 2>So this is yet another argument in favor</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a plant based diet.</v>

2667
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2668
02:08:02.201 --> 02:08:04.870
<v Speaker 3>in America at least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the majority,</v>

2669
02:08:04.871 --> 02:08:08.410
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of the money that goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards conservation,</v>

2670
02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:11.890
<v Speaker 3>towards keeping wild animal populations </v>
<v Speaker 3>high is actually from hunting.</v>

2671
02:08:12.670 --> 02:08:17.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a real strange contradiction that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes people really uncomfortable once </v>

2672
02:08:17.670 --> 02:08:21.091
<v Speaker 3>they find it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the vast majority of the money </v>

2673
02:08:21.091 --> 02:08:23.770
<v Speaker 3>that goes to present protect habitat to </v>
<v Speaker 3>preserve wild lands.</v>

2674
02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:26.140
<v Speaker 3>It comes from hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2675
02:08:26.170 --> 02:08:30.130
<v Speaker 3>hunters voluntarily agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was in the 19 thirties,</v>

2676
02:08:30.131 --> 02:08:35.131
<v Speaker 3>to give up 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure that number's right </v>

2677
02:08:35.131 --> 02:08:39.571
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but have the the money in terms of the </v>

2678
02:08:39.571 --> 02:08:43.141
<v Speaker 3>percentage of sales of hunting equipment</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes directly towards conservation.</v>

2679
02:08:43.241 --> 02:08:44.710
<v Speaker 3>There's all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2680
02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:49.920
<v Speaker 3>there's all these different entities </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation </v>

2681
02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:51.040
<v Speaker 3>that have repopulated elk into all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>

2682
02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:56.050
<v Speaker 3>but done so specifically so that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>can hunt them so it gets really weird,</v>

2683
02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:00.820
<v Speaker 3>like it might be an uneasy alliance </v>
<v Speaker 3>between in many people's eyes,</v>

2684
02:09:00.850 --> 02:09:02.650
<v Speaker 3>but they're the ones that are giving up </v>
<v Speaker 3>the money.</v>

2685
02:09:02.651 --> 02:09:05.440
<v Speaker 3>The money is not coming from altruistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations.</v>

2686
02:09:05.441 --> 02:09:10.441
<v Speaker 3>It just want to preserve these animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that they can exist in the free wild </v>

2687
02:09:10.441 --> 02:09:11.050
<v Speaker 3>way that they did before people got </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2688
02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:16.260
<v Speaker 3>But there's more white tail deer in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America today that when Columbus landed </v>

2689
02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:19.360
<v Speaker 3>so and that's all because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation,</v>

2690
02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:24.420
<v Speaker 3>because of hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's another one of those weird </v>

2691
02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:25.120
<v Speaker 3>things where at the whole picture,</v>

2692
02:09:25.330 --> 02:09:30.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a solution that's I've heard </v>

2693
02:09:30.330 --> 02:09:32.161
<v Speaker 2>suggested for reducing species loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to um,</v>

2694
02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:39.430
<v Speaker 2>allow basically ownership of species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can copy the panda.</v>

2695
02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't this a weird idea?</v>

2696
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:45.280
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is that then now suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like at the moment,</v>

2697
02:09:45.281 --> 02:09:47.770
<v Speaker 2>no one has a financial incentive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2698
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:52.800
<v Speaker 2>to ensure that pandas don't go extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if someone were able to say,</v>

2699
02:09:55.001 --> 02:09:55.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2700
02:09:55.810 --> 02:09:59.620
<v Speaker 2>if you want to use a panda and video or </v>
<v Speaker 2>so and you have to pay the owner.</v>

2701
02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm very uncomfortable with the </v>

2702
02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:07.180
<v Speaker 3>idea of this laboratory created meet as </v>
<v Speaker 3>to where that's going to go.</v>

2703
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:10.480
<v Speaker 3>Why are you uncomfortable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very positive about it.</v>

2704
02:10:10.481 --> 02:10:15.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean the science is kind of tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm positive about it and that it's </v>

2705
02:10:15.481 --> 02:10:19.081
<v Speaker 3>not gonna be any animal suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be fascinating in that </v>

2706
02:10:19.081 --> 02:10:22.201
<v Speaker 3>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's going to happen if we find </v>

2707
02:10:22.201 --> 02:10:22.270
<v Speaker 3>out that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2708
02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:23.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2709
02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:25.390
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to make sure that it's healthy.</v>

2710
02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:30.720
<v Speaker 3>We have to make sure that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause some sort of a weird disease </v>

2711
02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:33.961
<v Speaker 3>because you're not eating something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's living and moving and when you </v>

2712
02:10:33.961 --> 02:10:36.591
<v Speaker 3>meet sedentary creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's some sort of an adverse </v>

2713
02:10:36.591 --> 02:10:39.821
<v Speaker 3>impact on our biology because I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an adverse impact when you eat </v>

2714
02:10:39.821 --> 02:10:44.081
<v Speaker 3>protein from an animal that is weak and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sick and they've actually shown that.</v>

2715
02:10:44.650 --> 02:10:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a study that Dr Rhonda Patrick</v>

2716
02:10:48.291 --> 02:10:53.291
<v Speaker 3>sent me recently that showed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals that eat older sick animals die </v>

2717
02:10:56.570 --> 02:11:01.570
<v Speaker 3>quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a shorter lifespan and in </v>

2718
02:11:01.570 --> 02:11:04.900
<v Speaker 3>exhibit less health characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was than animals that ate </v>

2719
02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:09.791
<v Speaker 3>younger animals and there seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a direct correlation </v>

2720
02:11:09.791 --> 02:11:14.621
<v Speaker 3>between eating younger healthy things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and having a positive impact on,</v>

2721
02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:20.460
<v Speaker 3>on physical life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the animal that's consuming it and that </v>

2722
02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:22.160
<v Speaker 3>if you're eating something that never </v>
<v Speaker 3>existed in the first place,</v>

2723
02:11:22.161 --> 02:11:27.161
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless they're able to recreate the </v>

2724
02:11:27.161 --> 02:11:29.270
<v Speaker 3>characteristics of a healthy animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a strong muscle tissue.</v>

2725
02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:31.640
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe they could do that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrical impulses,</v>

2726
02:11:31.641 --> 02:11:34.790
<v Speaker 3>like some sort of electrical muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muscular stimulation.</v>

2727
02:11:35.170 --> 02:11:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why that would be a problem.</v>

2728
02:11:36.611 --> 02:11:41.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least you'd think you'd be able to </v>

2729
02:11:41.611 --> 02:11:41.611
<v Speaker 2>get past that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

2730
02:11:41.611 --> 02:11:46.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat that we've currently got </v>

2731
02:11:46.050 --> 02:11:46.050
<v Speaker 2>stuffed full of antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2732
02:11:46.050 --> 02:11:49.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a often viruses that or</v>

2733
02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:52.920
<v Speaker 3>why this is the kind of aligned swine </v>
<v Speaker 3>flu,</v>

2734
02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:54.170
<v Speaker 3>flu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flu.</v>

2735
02:11:54.171 --> 02:11:59.171
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could avoid all of them with all </v>

2736
02:11:59.171 --> 02:12:01.571
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff comes from factory farm </v>

2737
02:12:01.571 --> 02:12:01.571
<v Speaker 3>and in fact.</v>

2738
02:12:01.571 --> 02:12:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact then once you start to </v>

2739
02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:05.631
<v Speaker 2>engineer meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps you could engineer exactly the </v>

2740
02:12:05.631 --> 02:12:09.381
<v Speaker 2>healthiest sort of meat you've got so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more control over the product.</v>

2741
02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:11.340
<v Speaker 2>There'll be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you've got to,</v>

2742
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:13.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with development of any new technology,</v>

2743
02:12:13.411 --> 02:12:16.920
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be a cautious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2744
02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:22.700
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately it seems like we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to get to the point where we </v>

2745
02:12:22.711 --> 02:12:24.990
<v Speaker 2>have tastier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaper,</v>

2746
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:30.350
<v Speaker 2>more healthy meat that uses far less </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon like has far less carbon dioxide </v>

2747
02:12:31.261 --> 02:12:34.530
<v Speaker 2>as a side effect uses far less land </v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

2748
02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:36.330
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be better than every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single way.</v>

2749
02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:38.850
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the science,</v>

2750
02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:42.030
<v Speaker 2>it does seem hard in particular just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the costs down low enough.</v>

2751
02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they've got it down pretty low.</v>

2752
02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a recent article about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2753
02:12:45.371 --> 02:12:50.371
<v Speaker 3>whether we're talking about the original</v>
<v Speaker 3>one was worth hundreds of thousands of </v>

2754
02:12:50.371 --> 02:12:50.800
<v Speaker 3>dollars and now they've got it down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 20 bucks.</v>

2755
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was misleading wasn't.</v>

2756
02:12:53.450 --> 02:12:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a shame.</v>

2757
02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:00.520
<v Speaker 2>It seemed to me like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been a little bit too much hype in </v>

2758
02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:00.520
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2759
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:02.060
<v Speaker 2>where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2760
02:13:02.061 --> 02:13:04.580
<v Speaker 2>there's some stories of like the costs a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of [inaudible] going down.</v>

2761
02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2762
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:11.470
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely much lower than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's definitely still decades </v>

2763
02:13:11.470 --> 02:13:11.470
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>

2764
02:13:11.470 --> 02:13:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2765
02:13:11.811 --> 02:13:16.811
<v Speaker 2>Really what makes you think decades?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the argument is that the currently </v>

2766
02:13:16.811 --> 02:13:21.281
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it depends on what you're talking </v>

2767
02:13:21.281 --> 02:13:21.281
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2768
02:13:21.281 --> 02:13:23.840
<v Speaker 2>egg white I think is Pez competitively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2769
02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:27.850
<v Speaker 2>milk is comparatively easy but </v>
<v Speaker 2>structured meet so you know,</v>

2770
02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:30.610
<v Speaker 2>steak or chicken that has a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2771
02:13:31.590 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2772
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I think very difficult and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently part of what the difficulty </v>

2773
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:39.930
<v Speaker 1>is there's a certain solution that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to go with this meat and,</v>

2774
02:13:39.931 --> 02:13:41.790
<v Speaker 1>and that solution is currently very </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>

2775
02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the key part of the cost and even </v>

2776
02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:48.360
<v Speaker 1>once we get to the point of being able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop this,</v>

2777
02:13:48.361 --> 02:13:49.650
<v Speaker 1>getting the costs down low enough so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2778
02:13:49.690 --> 02:13:52.260
<v Speaker 1>it's competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need to take this.</v>

2779
02:13:52.350 --> 02:13:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm fluid that currently costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much,</v>

2780
02:13:56.350 --> 02:14:01.350
<v Speaker 1>like a thousand dollars a liter liter </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it down to the cost of soda and we </v>

2781
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:04.770
<v Speaker 1>don't currently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a clear kind of scientific</v>

2782
02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:08.190
<v Speaker 1>who would be the ultimate Turner </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syndrome if they found out that the only</v>

2783
02:14:08.191 --> 02:14:13.191
<v Speaker 1>way to make that fluid and to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>financially viable is to make it out of </v>

2784
02:14:13.191 --> 02:14:16.110
<v Speaker 1>ground up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pets will get killed anyway.</v>

2785
02:14:16.111 --> 02:14:21.111
<v Speaker 1>Euthanized pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at liquid people be upset if they </v>

2786
02:14:21.111 --> 02:14:24.051
<v Speaker 1>took euthanize pets and they used it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the fluid to grow the artificial </v>

2787
02:14:24.051 --> 02:14:26.460
<v Speaker 1>meeting or would they prefer those </v>
<v Speaker 1>euthanize pets just be cremated?</v>

2788
02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:30.000
<v Speaker 1>So at the moment that fluid does have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from animals.</v>

2789
02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Certain parts of it that is animal based</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just guessing.</v>

2790
02:14:33.590 --> 02:14:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not exactly,</v>

2791
02:14:36.061 --> 02:14:37.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground up pets.</v>

2792
02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand it's still currently not </v>

2793
02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting.</v>

2794
02:14:44.671 --> 02:14:49.671
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do think given the level of </v>

2795
02:14:49.671 --> 02:14:51.450
<v Speaker 1>just model cognitive dissonance that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently going on,</v>

2796
02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:54.420
<v Speaker 1>people's attitudes to animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pets,</v>

2797
02:14:54.570 --> 02:14:57.030
<v Speaker 1>any animal they can see and consumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>of meat.</v>

2798
02:14:57.540 --> 02:15:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Once you take self infest out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>

2799
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:03.090
<v Speaker 1>once you've got meat that is cheaper and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as tasty,</v>

2800
02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I think just everyone's going to switch </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then within a generation people will</v>

2801
02:15:06.751 --> 02:15:08.940
<v Speaker 1>look back at the current generation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just think,</v>

2802
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:14.000
<v Speaker 1>how did anyone ever engage in such </v>
<v Speaker 1>abominable activity as factory farmed </v>

2803
02:15:15.781 --> 02:15:16.800
<v Speaker 1>meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2804
02:15:16.801 --> 02:15:21.801
<v Speaker 1>Well it's probably one of the darkest </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we as a civilized humanity </v>

2805
02:15:22.861 --> 02:15:23.250
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2806
02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:25.920
<v Speaker 1>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about other than war,</v>

2807
02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:31.280
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously the most horrific </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing or one of the most horrific </v>

2808
02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.091
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's arguable that in terms of </v>

2809
02:15:35.091 --> 02:15:35.960
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the next thing because it's.</v>

2810
02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean it has to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the next thing,</v>

2811
02:15:37.741 --> 02:15:42.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other than poisoning people for </v>

2812
02:15:42.741 --> 02:15:42.741
<v Speaker 1>profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2813
02:15:42.741 --> 02:15:46.311
<v Speaker 1>other than companies that have polluted </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments that have won a poisoning </v>

2814
02:15:46.311 --> 02:15:46.311
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2815
02:15:46.311 --> 02:15:51.110
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 50 billion animals are killed every </v>

2816
02:15:51.110 --> 02:15:51.240
<v Speaker 1>year for human consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want worldwide,</v>

2817
02:15:51.241 --> 02:15:56.241
<v Speaker 1>most of them have kind of short life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a layer.</v>

2818
02:15:56.850 --> 02:15:59.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broiler hens have six week lives.</v>

2819
02:15:59.910 --> 02:16:01.650
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six weeks.</v>

2820
02:16:01.850 --> 02:16:06.480
<v Speaker 1>So from the time they're incubated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time they're in a oven six weeks,</v>

2821
02:16:06.510 --> 02:16:07.230
<v Speaker 1>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2822
02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:12.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think that nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point at which they die is that the </v>

2823
02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:15.111
<v Speaker 1>highlight of their life and my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because their life is just filled with </v>

2824
02:16:15.111 --> 02:16:15.510
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2825
02:16:16.410 --> 02:16:21.410
<v Speaker 1>so that means any at any one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 7 billion animals in factory farms </v>

2826
02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:23.790
<v Speaker 1>now living basically being tortured for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entirety of their short lives.</v>

2827
02:16:23.791 --> 02:16:26.280
<v Speaker 1>So the entire population of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

2828
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:28.810
<v Speaker 1>it's basically one to one yet at any one</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2829
02:16:29.650 --> 02:16:30.240
<v Speaker 1>isn't nuts</v>

2830
02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:32.080
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's less than 100 years old.</v>

2831
02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Yet much less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less than 50 years old.</v>

2832
02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Fifty years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2833
02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:40.660
<v Speaker 2>That's the first crazy asshole that </v>
<v Speaker 2>jammed those chickens,</v>

2834
02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:42.850
<v Speaker 2>those little cages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henley field.</v>

2835
02:16:42.851 --> 02:16:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name.</v>

2836
02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:48.580
<v Speaker 2>So he fascinating it of the free </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketeers.</v>

2837
02:16:48.730 --> 02:16:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back in the fifties I'm getting,</v>

2838
02:16:51.121 --> 02:16:53.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go into a digression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as bad as the affinity.</v>

2839
02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:55.330
<v Speaker 2>I promise you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all awesome.</v>

2840
02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:01.400
<v Speaker 2>So back in the fifties I'm free market </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics was just completely dead.</v>

2841
02:17:01.401 --> 02:17:06.340
<v Speaker 2>That was just not a mainstream idea toll</v>
<v Speaker 2>within academic economics,</v>

2842
02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:11.940
<v Speaker 2>but it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was to prominence acos end of the </v>

2843
02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:14.731
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly the seventies and then fetch </v>

2844
02:17:14.731 --> 02:17:16.910
<v Speaker 2>and logan getting empowered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge uptake in this intellectual </v>

2845
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:18.610
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is kind of where did</v>

2846
02:17:18.611 --> 02:17:23.611
<v Speaker 2>it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was actually very significantly </v>

2847
02:17:23.611 --> 02:17:26.980
<v Speaker 2>driven by a small number of people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fifties and early sixties.</v>

2848
02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Like very deliberately saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2849
02:17:29.261 --> 02:17:34.261
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want this ideology to become really </v>

2850
02:17:34.261 --> 02:17:36.601
<v Speaker 2>dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the most important first </v>

2851
02:17:36.601 --> 02:17:38.680
<v Speaker 2>organizations was the institute for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Economic Affairs based in London,</v>

2852
02:17:38.681 --> 02:17:43.681
<v Speaker 2>I think tank and it was funded by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who put the factory farm chicken </v>

2853
02:17:43.681 --> 02:17:46.450
<v Speaker 2>to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2854
02:17:46.451 --> 02:17:51.451
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because I promote this idea </v>

2855
02:17:51.451 --> 02:17:54.370
<v Speaker 2>of I'm earning to give as something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>young people should consider.</v>

2856
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the only thing that they should do.</v>

2857
02:17:56.291 --> 02:17:58.210
<v Speaker 2>But as one of many things they should </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2858
02:17:58.590 --> 02:18:01.240
<v Speaker 2>a should consider doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to do good,</v>

2859
02:18:01.630 --> 02:18:03.730
<v Speaker 2>you could go and like directly have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact.</v>

2860
02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:08.940
<v Speaker 2>But there is also another option which </v>
<v Speaker 2>is doing something you're really </v>

2861
02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:11.590
<v Speaker 2>passionate about that maybe has less of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a direct impact on a lot and donate,</v>

2862
02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:16.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're making at least a </v>

2863
02:18:16.860 --> 02:18:17.140
<v Speaker 2>significant part of that to the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think are most important.</v>

2864
02:18:17.530 --> 02:18:19.540
<v Speaker 2>And then I think of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Henry Fisher,</v>

2865
02:18:19.550 --> 02:18:24.550
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like this most perverse </v>

2866
02:18:24.550 --> 02:18:25.620
<v Speaker 2>instantiation of that where the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

2867
02:18:25.650 --> 02:18:30.300
<v Speaker 2>became a factory farming entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically any ticket I give glands.</v>

2868
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:32.060
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2869
02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:37.170
<v Speaker 3>isn't that just so indicative of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans are so contradictory were so </v>

2870
02:18:37.841 --> 02:18:42.841
<v Speaker 3>complex and so strange and that we will </v>
<v Speaker 3>find all these justifications for all </v>

2871
02:18:43.001 --> 02:18:48.001
<v Speaker 3>these bizarre behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we were never like totally </v>

2872
02:18:48.001 --> 02:18:49.090
<v Speaker 3>pure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's so many,</v>

2873
02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:53.230
<v Speaker 3>so many people that are so that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a terrible example,</v>

2874
02:18:53.231 --> 02:18:57.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's the one I use all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill cosby made so many people laugh and</v>

2875
02:18:57.371 --> 02:19:00.460
<v Speaker 3>he raped about $100 or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly,</v>

2876
02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:05.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was helping and putting out so </v>

2877
02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:09.151
<v Speaker 3>much love to so many people and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>being fucking evil to a bunch of people </v>

2878
02:19:09.461 --> 02:19:10.090
<v Speaker 3>that he drug.</v>

2879
02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if they just know that this exists,</v>

2880
02:19:13.261 --> 02:19:17.130
<v Speaker 2>this duality that they think about Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

2881
02:19:17.131 --> 02:19:19.890
<v Speaker 2>you think about the number of people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are involved in the Holocaust,</v>

2882
02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:21.810
<v Speaker 2>who loved their children and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

2883
02:19:21.811 --> 02:19:24.300
<v Speaker 2>and if you talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have had a great conversation.</v>

2884
02:19:24.301 --> 02:19:25.770
<v Speaker 2>They would have been very caring and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2885
02:19:26.370 --> 02:19:27.680
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2886
02:19:27.681 --> 02:19:29.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very powerful idea.</v>

2887
02:19:30.650 --> 02:19:35.650
<v Speaker 2>The banality of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having events phase where,</v>

2888
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:42.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst crimes committed and not </v>

2889
02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:46.481
<v Speaker 2>because people are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because [inaudible] not bad or evil</v>

2890
02:19:46.491 --> 02:19:51.491
<v Speaker 2>in the way that you think James Bond </v>
<v Speaker 2>villain like this person's plotting </v>

2891
02:19:51.491 --> 02:19:54.611
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just because they have some goal </v>

2892
02:19:54.611 --> 02:19:57.820
<v Speaker 2>that is some goal in which they </v>
<v Speaker 2>indifference to suffering and the cause </v>

2893
02:19:58.191 --> 02:20:01.430
<v Speaker 2>that as a side effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's the same if you ask people,</v>

2894
02:20:01.431 --> 02:20:04.690
<v Speaker 2>do you want animals to suffer that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically in factory farms will say,</v>

2895
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:05.540
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

2896
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:08.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Casualties of war.</v>

2897
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And casualties of civilization.</v>

2898
02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:14.660
<v Speaker 2>And the same insight actually when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about ai as well as,</v>

2899
02:20:14.661 --> 02:20:16.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2900
02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:18.140
<v Speaker 2>sometimes in the media people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2901
02:20:18.141 --> 02:20:21.080
<v Speaker 2>the worry about ai as a terminator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to want to kill humans,</v>

2902
02:20:21.081 --> 02:20:26.081
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the wedding at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea when you think about homo </v>

2903
02:20:26.081 --> 02:20:26.780
<v Speaker 2>sapiens and neanderthals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2904
02:20:26.781 --> 02:20:30.860
<v Speaker 2>it's just having some other entity that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has goals on which you are just not very</v>

2905
02:20:30.861 --> 02:20:31.850
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2906
02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means that,</v>

2907
02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:33.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2908
02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:36.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're also going to judge us.</v>

2909
02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they are intelligent and they are </v>

2910
02:20:41.530 --> 02:20:43.671
<v Speaker 1>superior to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to judge us based on the </v>

2911
02:20:43.671 --> 02:20:43.671
<v Speaker 1>entire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole of our behavior.</v>

2912
02:20:43.671 --> 02:20:45.600
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to go look at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>messy species.</v>

2913
02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:50.900
<v Speaker 1>This species is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon mucks mosque has my most terrifying</v>

2914
02:20:51.390 --> 02:20:52.460
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2915
02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:57.660
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his quote is the most terrifying to me </v>

2916
02:20:57.660 --> 02:20:58.440
<v Speaker 1>that he thinks that with ai we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>summoning the demon king,</v>

2917
02:20:58.441 --> 02:20:59.070
<v Speaker 1>the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2918
02:20:59.071 --> 02:21:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I love that quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just like.</v>

2919
02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want A.</v>

2920
02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think a lot of the media </v>

2921
02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:08.991
<v Speaker 1>attention around ai is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been really unfortunate because it </v>

2922
02:21:08.991 --> 02:21:10.800
<v Speaker 1>suggests like it's coming next year and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna Control.</v>

2923
02:21:10.801 --> 02:21:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think anthropomorphized is necessarily</v>

2924
02:21:14.941 --> 02:21:16.680
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of I think,</v>

2925
02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but if it's ultimate goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extinction of the human race,</v>

2926
02:21:19.591 --> 02:21:21.740
<v Speaker 1>that's very demonic in our regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2927
02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's more indifferent than sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way we think about mollusks.</v>

2928
02:21:28.170 --> 02:21:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2929
02:21:29.071 --> 02:21:30.620
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other way we think of like,</v>

2930
02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:36.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes mosquitoes with my favorite </v>

2931
02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:37.590
<v Speaker 1>because vegans are slap mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2932
02:21:37.591 --> 02:21:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm get mosquitoes are not like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're alive.</v>

2933
02:21:42.390 --> 02:21:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But are they like,</v>

2934
02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I think clams mollusks on 70 and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>insects.</v>

2935
02:21:46.261 --> 02:21:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2936
02:21:46.951 --> 02:21:50.340
<v Speaker 1>there's some weird arguments about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>then mean why not eat crickets?</v>

2937
02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Because cricket protein is excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had cricket bars before.</v>

2938
02:21:54.210 --> 02:21:55.920
<v Speaker 1>They're covered in chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They taste really good.</v>

2939
02:21:55.921 --> 02:21:57.060
<v Speaker 1>They're high protein.</v>

2940
02:21:58.040 --> 02:22:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know many people who do advocate </v>

2941
02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:06.970
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My view is just like if you're unsure </v>

2942
02:22:06.970 --> 02:22:06.970
<v Speaker 2>then play safe.</v>

2943
02:22:06.970 --> 02:22:07.230
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd be eating a lot of crickets,</v>

2944
02:22:07.330 --> 02:22:08.250
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2945
02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:10.030
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of crickets out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

2946
02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

2947
02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:16.610
<v Speaker 1>could them like might be hunting tickets</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a tiny little spear.</v>

2948
02:22:17.010 --> 02:22:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you do it,</v>

2949
02:22:18.580 --> 02:22:20.190
<v Speaker 1>you're a lot more brutal than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2950
02:22:20.191 --> 02:22:23.490
<v Speaker 1>I think factory farming for crickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a horrific institution,</v>

2951
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:25.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just.</v>

2952
02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 1>What would you do?</v>

2953
02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking swarms of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The smash them down to a protein bar.</v>

2954
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:32.730
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worry about.</v>

2955
02:22:32.731 --> 02:22:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the current number of the amount</v>

2956
02:22:35.611 --> 02:22:37.950
<v Speaker 3>of species that have ever existed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are now extinct?</v>

2957
02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:40.620
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 nine point nine,</v>

2958
02:22:40.621 --> 02:22:42.270
<v Speaker 3>nine percent or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not us?</v>

2959
02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Why not us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2960
02:22:43.771 --> 02:22:46.050
<v Speaker 3>And if we do give birth to artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

2961
02:22:46.051 --> 02:22:51.051
<v Speaker 3>if we are the caterpillar that gives </v>
<v Speaker 3>birth to the butterfly that winds up </v>

2962
02:22:51.051 --> 02:22:52.980
<v Speaker 3>taking over the world some artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>butterfly.</v>

2963
02:22:53.710 --> 02:22:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2964
02:22:54.251 --> 02:22:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing that worries me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2965
02:22:57.930 --> 02:23:00.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ai is it's kind of its own thing.</v>

2966
02:23:01.390 --> 02:23:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

2967
02:23:03.430 --> 02:23:08.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do because it's like potentially </v>

2968
02:23:08.430 --> 02:23:09.040
<v Speaker 2>extremely beneficial as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it goes,</v>

2969
02:23:09.070 --> 02:23:14.070
<v Speaker 2>even if supposing it goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's a huge thing like we should </v>

2970
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:17.491
<v Speaker 2>care about it whether or not we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about the extinction risk </v>

2971
02:23:17.491 --> 02:23:20.320
<v Speaker 2>because it's one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the later cases I think where we </v>

2972
02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:20.500
<v Speaker 2>can really see into the future and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

2973
02:23:20.501 --> 02:23:25.501
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be a transformative </v>

2974
02:23:25.501 --> 02:23:25.501
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know when it's gonna happen,</v>

2975
02:23:25.501 --> 02:23:26.410
<v Speaker 2>but when it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it does,</v>

2976
02:23:26.411 --> 02:23:29.110
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be tons formative and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be very powerful.</v>

2977
02:23:29.111 --> 02:23:32.260
<v Speaker 2>And that means we should have some kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of careful thought about it.</v>

2978
02:23:32.890 --> 02:23:37.890
<v Speaker 2>But it seems to me there's a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that the human race could kill </v>

2979
02:23:37.890 --> 02:23:37.890
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2980
02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:42.820
<v Speaker 2>So novel pathogens being one example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>large Hadron collider.</v>

2981
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:49.950
<v Speaker 2>So my colleague toby actually wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper on the large Hadron collider </v>

2982
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:53.140
<v Speaker 2>because there was always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2983
02:23:53.170 --> 02:23:55.510
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh we could hold and so on.</v>

2984
02:23:56.050 --> 02:24:01.050
<v Speaker 2>And so he either an academic paper where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just talked about the risk analysis </v>

2985
02:24:01.181 --> 02:24:02.500
<v Speaker 2>that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

2986
02:24:02.530 --> 02:24:07.530
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chance of the large Hadron collider </v>

2987
02:24:07.530 --> 02:24:08.240
<v Speaker 2>creating a black hole or something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like really dangerous.</v>

2988
02:24:08.241 --> 02:24:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Is Ten to the power of negative 60 feet.</v>

2989
02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:12.690
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not going zero.</v>

2990
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:14.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Firstly,</v>

2991
02:24:14.011 --> 02:24:16.390
<v Speaker 3>it's not zero was motherfuckers that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could addiction.</v>

2992
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:19.120
<v Speaker 3>What if we put the odds were really </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

2993
02:24:19.121 --> 02:24:19.890
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know.</v>

2994
02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:22.770
<v Speaker 2>But the second thing also is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2995
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:25.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't think that anything's tend</v>

2996
02:24:25.111 --> 02:24:26.230
<v Speaker 2>to the negative 60 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bailey,</v>

2997
02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:29.020
<v Speaker 2>unless you have very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong models behind,</v>

2998
02:24:29.021 --> 02:24:34.021
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what's the chance that you just </v>

2999
02:24:34.021 --> 02:24:34.021
<v Speaker 2>made some mistake in your calculation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3000
02:24:34.021 --> 02:24:38.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's as low as one in a million </v>

3001
02:24:38.661 --> 02:24:41.230
<v Speaker 2>that mistake completely swamped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was the point he was making </v>

3002
02:24:41.230 --> 02:24:43.860
<v Speaker 2>just statistical point saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3003
02:24:43.950 --> 02:24:46.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not commenting on whether this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous or not,</v>

3004
02:24:46.290 --> 02:24:48.360
<v Speaker 2>it's just that you've made a mistake in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your methodology,</v>

3005
02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:50.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with respect to your risk assessment.</v>

3006
02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:53.130
<v Speaker 2>And so it was really funny because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was there.</v>

3007
02:24:53.131 --> 02:24:54.840
<v Speaker 2>This is fairly calm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensible,</v>

3008
02:24:55.170 --> 02:24:56.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3009
02:24:56.700 --> 02:25:01.500
<v Speaker 2>a philosopher from Oxford in a meeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>with lunch either and Kaleida surrounded</v>

3010
02:25:01.501 --> 02:25:02.740
<v Speaker 2>by all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3011
02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:04.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3012
02:25:04.570 --> 02:25:07.560
<v Speaker 2>elementum like tin foil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tin foil,</v>

3013
02:25:07.561 --> 02:25:10.570
<v Speaker 2>hat people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aluminum file minium.</v>

3014
02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:12.450
<v Speaker 2>I love the way you guys say aluminum </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

3015
02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Apparently I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so annoyed when I found this.</v>

3016
02:25:15.421 --> 02:25:16.270
<v Speaker 2>But penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

3017
02:25:16.470 --> 02:25:21.470
<v Speaker 2>your way is correct and it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird area tire with an I really.</v>

3018
02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:24.100
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

3019
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.610
<v Speaker 1>then you start saying things like click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3020
02:25:27.611 --> 02:25:31.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a nice click of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>niche and the fire.</v>

3021
02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say it's a niche for for.</v>

3022
02:25:35.290 --> 02:25:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

3023
02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

3024
02:25:37.130 --> 02:25:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We say for here though,</v>

3025
02:25:38.350 --> 02:25:41.020
<v Speaker 1>do people say four year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've definitely heard for you.</v>

3026
02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Walmart people was a white trash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you from originally?</v>

3027
02:25:45.550 --> 02:25:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Where am I from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey is where I was born because I</v>

3028
02:25:48.341 --> 02:25:50.350
<v Speaker 1>thought it was a New York thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe,</v>

3029
02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:52.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I didn't really grow up there.</v>

3030
02:25:52.830 --> 02:25:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Grew up all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston mostly.</v>

3031
02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3032
02:25:56.021 --> 02:25:57.470
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do so many things long.</v>

3033
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very distressing to me.</v>

3034
02:25:59.561 --> 02:26:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what we don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't do Queens.</v>

3035
02:26:01.241 --> 02:26:03.990
<v Speaker 1>You guys still have queens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the Queen Shit.</v>

3036
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:06.760
<v Speaker 1>She's still going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

3037
02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I feel like every time I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3038
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I think the queen is like hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution.</v>

3039
02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:20.500
<v Speaker 1>That's his job always to like wave and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this wave she just kind of rocks her </v>

3040
02:26:20.761 --> 02:26:24.210
<v Speaker 1>hand back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of weird semi vulcan stance.</v>

3041
02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda funny.</v>

3042
02:26:25.831 --> 02:26:30.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking to especially some of the kind </v>

3043
02:26:30.831 --> 02:26:31.310
<v Speaker 1>of pick last of friends I have in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical,</v>

3044
02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:34.500
<v Speaker 1>like you've got a monarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone talking about it.</v>

3045
02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:36.450
<v Speaker 1>If you guys like it's quaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3046
02:26:36.451 --> 02:26:40.430
<v Speaker 1>We're just like no one really thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about her.</v>

3047
02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she still lives in a fucking castle </v>

3048
02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:45.680
<v Speaker 1>and the castle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she lives off the dime.</v>

3049
02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:48.510
<v Speaker 1>But if you do an economic analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she brings in more money than she,</v>

3050
02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:50.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

3051
02:26:50.251 --> 02:26:53.070
<v Speaker 1>But she takes a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's sort of the anti will macaskill if</v>

3052
02:26:53.071 --> 02:26:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you asked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3053
02:26:54.191 --> 02:26:59.191
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the test is they support and she </v>

3054
02:26:59.191 --> 02:27:01.101
<v Speaker 1>just gets all this free money and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch just wears gold and shit and </v>

3055
02:27:01.101 --> 02:27:01.101
<v Speaker 1>drives around in a limo.</v>

3056
02:27:01.101 --> 02:27:02.730
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could,</v>

3057
02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:03.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could definitely,</v>

3058
02:27:03.721 --> 02:27:05.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the same tour.</v>

3059
02:27:05.521 --> 02:27:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't benefit people are mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

3060
02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:09.060
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really meaning the word bitch,</v>

3061
02:27:09.090 --> 02:27:12.180
<v Speaker 1>so I could all due respect folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a figure of speech,</v>

3062
02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:14.280
<v Speaker 1>a humorous figure speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3063
02:27:14.281 --> 02:27:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Well I appreciate the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3064
02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to disparage your ruler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cliche,</v>

3065
02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:21.960
<v Speaker 1>the caveat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a strange rule though.</v>

3066
02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Kings and Queens and Prince Charles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>

3067
02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Pov that sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I keep.</v>

3068
02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:32.730
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because I keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time in California,</v>

3069
02:27:32.731 --> 02:27:37.170
<v Speaker 1>but every time I come back it seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be on some major event to do with ilt.</v>

3070
02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:42.380
<v Speaker 1>So one was the queen's birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one was the event of the Queens being </v>

3071
02:27:42.380 --> 02:27:44.310
<v Speaker 1>the longest ever running monarch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was the jubilee.</v>

3072
02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:49.640
<v Speaker 1>We don't know about that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things for you is these massive </v>

3073
02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:51.170
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means I come off the plane being</v>

3074
02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:53.880
<v Speaker 1>in America for a while and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pictures of the queen.</v>

3075
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Everyone say okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3076
02:27:55.831 --> 02:27:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely back in play tea now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what's going on now?</v>

3077
02:27:59.201 --> 02:28:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening now.</v>

3078
02:28:01.170 --> 02:28:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge news today.</v>

3079
02:28:03.210 --> 02:28:04.110
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3080
02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:07.260
<v Speaker 1>well for me as a skunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Nicholas Sturgeon,</v>

3081
02:28:07.270 --> 02:28:12.270
<v Speaker 1>the first minister of Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A kind of think of Scotland to the UK is</v>

3082
02:28:15.450 --> 02:28:17.760
<v Speaker 1>state to federal level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little bit different.</v>

3083
02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>announced there's gonna be a second.</v>

3084
02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:22.580
<v Speaker 1>She's planning second Scottish </v>
<v Speaker 1>referendum.</v>

3085
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:28.210
<v Speaker 2>So because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Britain is taking yourself out </v>

3086
02:28:28.210 --> 02:28:32.741
<v Speaker 2>of the European Union where they expect </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that announcing can meet Tuesday end </v>

3087
02:28:33.831 --> 02:28:35.540
<v Speaker 2>of month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very shortly.</v>

3088
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scotland did not want to leave.</v>

3089
02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:42.920
<v Speaker 2>The EU voted overwhelmingly in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>remaining.</v>

3090
02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:46.370
<v Speaker 2>So Scotland in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tends to lean a lot further left than</v>

3091
02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:48.310
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3092
02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:50.270
<v Speaker 2>and previously had an independence </v>
<v Speaker 2>referendum.</v>

3093
02:28:50.271 --> 02:28:53.150
<v Speaker 2>It was very close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually 52 percent,</v>

3094
02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:58.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within favor of staying apart for the </v>

3095
02:28:58.660 --> 02:28:59.420
<v Speaker 2>union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the state of the Union,</v>

3096
02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:04.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's now going to be a second </v>

3097
02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:04.780
<v Speaker 2>referendum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

3098
02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:05.300
<v Speaker 2>this is what Nicola Sturgeon is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3099
02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:11.170
<v Speaker 2>and because of the Brexit vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more likely that </v>

3100
02:29:11.170 --> 02:29:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Scotland will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3101
02:29:11.631 --> 02:29:16.631
<v Speaker 2>we're going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they have the main part of the </v>

3102
02:29:16.631 --> 02:29:16.631
<v Speaker 2>European Union where there's the last of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Litton,</v>

3103
02:29:16.631 --> 02:29:18.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will leave.</v>

3104
02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:23.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting for me because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was very kind of play with the union </v>

3105
02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:25.060
<v Speaker 2>against independence in the previous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3106
02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:31.300
<v Speaker 2>referendum now I'm not sure now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I probably am in it because I </v>

3107
02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:32.900
<v Speaker 2>think that brexit was just such bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision,</v>

3108
02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:38.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I kind of want them to be punished </v>

3109
02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:38.400
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

3110
02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:38.960
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two things.</v>

3111
02:29:38.961 --> 02:29:39.880
<v Speaker 2>One is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3112
02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:46.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that now the case for Scotland </v>
<v Speaker 2>being part of the EU but not part of </v>

3113
02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economic case can,</v>

3114
02:29:47.731 --> 02:29:50.180
<v Speaker 2>it makes a bit more sense now than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>did in the past.</v>

3115
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:54.210
<v Speaker 2>But then secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just I would kind of worry that um,</v>

3116
02:29:55.430 --> 02:29:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Britain leaves the EU,</v>
<v Speaker 2>EU,</v>

3117
02:29:56.811 --> 02:30:00.330
<v Speaker 2>does that trigger kind of spark like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3118
02:30:00.331 --> 02:30:04.460
<v Speaker 2>a much larger movement where the just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the EU as a project kind of breaks down.</v>

3119
02:30:05.090 --> 02:30:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it's the case like,</v>

3120
02:30:07.710 --> 02:30:10.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UK leaves the EU,</v>

3121
02:30:10.011 --> 02:30:12.050
<v Speaker 2>but as a result the country just falls </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

3122
02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:15.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that you wanted that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wanted England to fall apart,</v>

3123
02:30:15.950 --> 02:30:17.870
<v Speaker 3>to be punished for leaving the</v>

3124
02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.530
<v Speaker 2>be like a very major signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think it would be.</v>

3125
02:30:21.531 --> 02:30:24.010
<v Speaker 2>What if they prospered?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

3126
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:26.500
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean then if it is,</v>

3127
02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:30.010
<v Speaker 2>if I do got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was convinced that the blacks,</v>

3128
02:30:30.011 --> 02:30:35.011
<v Speaker 2>that was the late decision that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually best for the world and then I </v>

3129
02:30:35.011 --> 02:30:35.011
<v Speaker 2>would change my mind.</v>

3130
02:30:35.011 --> 02:30:39.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do have a friend who's very </v>

3131
02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:39.440
<v Speaker 3>knowledgeable and he's from England and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

3132
02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:44.270
<v Speaker 3>His take on it was the real issue with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the EU is that you're dealing with a </v>

3133
02:30:45.451 --> 02:30:46.980
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people that aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>elected.</v>

3134
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:50.460
<v Speaker 3>They're just sort of running the </v>
<v Speaker 3>European Union and he's like,</v>

3135
02:30:50.730 --> 02:30:54.480
<v Speaker 3>and we don't have to tell you when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just look at history,</v>

3136
02:30:54.750 --> 02:30:59.750
<v Speaker 3>what happens when people have a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of power and aren't even elected </v>

3137
02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:03.411
<v Speaker 3>to their position and you're allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just go to any part of the European </v>

3138
02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Union and move into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3139
02:31:07.740 --> 02:31:12.740
<v Speaker 3>that was very detrimental and very bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the way England's financial </v>

3140
02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:15.540
<v Speaker 3>structure was set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

3141
02:31:15.541 --> 02:31:17.340
<v Speaker 3>this could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would be detrimental to England,</v>

3142
02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:21.000
<v Speaker 3>but beneficial to other places and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea was that we were supposed to accept</v>

3143
02:31:21.001 --> 02:31:26.001
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it'd be detrimental to </v>
<v Speaker 3>England and beneficial to other </v>

3144
02:31:26.001 --> 02:31:27.360
<v Speaker 3>countries and many people in England did</v>
<v Speaker 3>not want to do that.</v>

3145
02:31:27.361 --> 02:31:29.460
<v Speaker 3>And in doing and in making that </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision,</v>

3146
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:34.670
<v Speaker 3>they were thought to be Zena phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were thought to be a nationalistic </v>

3147
02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:35.070
<v Speaker 3>and that it was racist.</v>

3148
02:31:35.430 --> 02:31:36.660
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3149
02:31:37.770 --> 02:31:38.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>

3150
02:31:38.401 --> 02:31:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing is yeah,</v>

3151
02:31:39.331 --> 02:31:40.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3152
02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:41.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3153
02:31:41.911 --> 02:31:46.911
<v Speaker 2>so there's kind of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One where the specter of their </v>

3154
02:31:46.911 --> 02:31:46.911
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3155
02:31:46.911 --> 02:31:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean like European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it has its own parliament and so </v>

3156
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.110
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can vote on that.</v>

3157
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:55.281
<v Speaker 2>You each get number of electors and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason in so far as it's undemocratic,</v>

3158
02:31:55.651 --> 02:32:00.651
<v Speaker 2>it's mainly just because people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>care like the don't care democratic,</v>

3159
02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:05.640
<v Speaker 2>but t as in voter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so turnout to have elections for members</v>

3160
02:32:05.641 --> 02:32:07.890
<v Speaker 2>of European Parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The turnout is very low.</v>

3161
02:32:07.891 --> 02:32:09.330
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like 30 percent sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3162
02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it will be larger now they realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of it.</v>

3163
02:32:12.270 --> 02:32:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3164
02:32:12.691 --> 02:32:14.500
<v Speaker 2>there's not going to be anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna,</v>

3165
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:16.830
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna leave implode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3166
02:32:16.831 --> 02:32:21.831
<v Speaker 2>Benton's leaving Britain's leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you no longer voting for members of </v>

3167
02:32:21.831 --> 02:32:21.831
<v Speaker 2>parliament.</v>

3168
02:32:21.831 --> 02:32:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one question and then like is </v>

3169
02:32:26.390 --> 02:32:26.390
<v Speaker 2>this good or bad split?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3170
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I think like the economic case is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly swung for European kind of </v>

3171
02:32:32.371 --> 02:32:37.371
<v Speaker 2>good for the reason being just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fleet fade in general benefits both </v>

3172
02:32:37.371 --> 02:32:42.171
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to really maximize the amount </v>

3173
02:32:42.171 --> 02:32:42.171
<v Speaker 2>of fleet late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3174
02:32:42.171 --> 02:32:46.250
<v Speaker 2>but then the bigger thing for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like with respect to unity </v>

3175
02:32:46.250 --> 02:32:51.201
<v Speaker 2>between countries is like the tail risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk of war,</v>

3176
02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:57.470
<v Speaker 2>which we don't really think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we haven't had a like a world </v>

3177
02:32:57.470 --> 02:32:57.470
<v Speaker 2>war since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3178
02:32:57.470 --> 02:32:57.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early,</v>

3179
02:32:58.230 --> 02:33:00.200
<v Speaker 2>mid 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3180
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:05.750
<v Speaker 2>but Europe had had like a long period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>comparative peacefulness like before the</v>

3181
02:33:05.761 --> 02:33:06.870
<v Speaker 2>first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People thought,</v>

3182
02:33:06.871 --> 02:33:11.871
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unthinkable given the level of </v>

3183
02:33:11.871 --> 02:33:14.061
<v Speaker 2>interconnectedness between the countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are World War can play count and </v>

3184
02:33:14.061 --> 02:33:14.061
<v Speaker 2>intuited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3185
02:33:14.061 --> 02:33:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

3186
02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:16.400
<v Speaker 2>and I think those sorts of things would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

3187
02:33:16.730 --> 02:33:18.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tail outcome,</v>

3188
02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:20.380
<v Speaker 2>it can be very bad indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3189
02:33:20.490 --> 02:33:25.490
<v Speaker 2>and we don't often think about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's just this occasional thing </v>

3190
02:33:25.490 --> 02:33:28.200
<v Speaker 2>and so that's why in general and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>always more like not all,</v>

3191
02:33:28.201 --> 02:33:32.490
<v Speaker 2>almost always more pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm closer relations between,</v>

3192
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:34.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between companies</v>

3193
02:33:34.770 --> 02:33:36.060
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3194
02:33:36.210 --> 02:33:39.330
<v Speaker 3>what he said makes sense to me as well </v>
<v Speaker 3>though when he was saying essentially it</v>

3195
02:33:39.331 --> 02:33:44.331
<v Speaker 3>was like think of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now think of each state being </v>

3196
02:33:44.331 --> 02:33:46.590
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're allowed to elect a leader of that</v>

3197
02:33:46.591 --> 02:33:51.591
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't elect a leader for the </v>

3198
02:33:51.591 --> 02:33:54.200
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's essentially how he was </v>

3199
02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:54.200
<v Speaker 3>looking at the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying the European Union is,</v>

3200
02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:59.200
<v Speaker 3>they're not elected and yet there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling all these other elected </v>

3201
02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:03.681
<v Speaker 3>officials and elected state's all group </v>
<v Speaker 3>together instead of thinking of them as </v>

3202
02:34:03.681 --> 02:34:08.130
<v Speaker 3>like Germany and England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of them as states and think of the</v>

3203
02:34:08.130 --> 02:34:13.130
<v Speaker 3>European Union and the officials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are in control of the </v>

3204
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.130
<v Speaker 3>European Union aren't even elected.</v>

3205
02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

3206
02:34:13.911 --> 02:34:17.120
<v Speaker 2>you do elect the parliament and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the case,</v>

3207
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:22.000
<v Speaker 1>the analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the amount of power that Europe has</v>

3208
02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:27.180
<v Speaker 1>over the remaining the other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like nothing like the amount of </v>

3209
02:34:27.941 --> 02:34:32.941
<v Speaker 1>power of the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the federal government has overstates </v>

3210
02:34:32.941 --> 02:34:34.750
<v Speaker 1>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3211
02:34:34.751 --> 02:34:39.751
<v Speaker 1>the UK sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the power is the EU has one of the </v>

3212
02:34:40.061 --> 02:34:42.760
<v Speaker 1>things that are got made lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention was bendy,</v>

3213
02:34:42.761 --> 02:34:47.761
<v Speaker 1>bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy like a real focus area for </v>

3214
02:34:47.761 --> 02:34:48.430
<v Speaker 1>people's either also and what does that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

3215
02:34:48.490 --> 02:34:51.760
<v Speaker 1>So according to EU regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so EU has a single market,</v>

3216
02:34:51.850 --> 02:34:54.850
<v Speaker 1>so that means you have just the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards across all countries,</v>

3217
02:34:56.530 --> 02:35:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but then that means you just start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say have the standards of the things </v>

3218
02:35:01.530 --> 02:35:02.770
<v Speaker 1>like bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was one EU regulation which</v>

3219
02:35:02.771 --> 02:35:07.771
<v Speaker 1>was that a banana couldn't be too bendy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it would count as a defective </v>

3220
02:35:07.771 --> 02:35:10.710
<v Speaker 1>banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people were like up and age about</v>

3221
02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:11.140
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3222
02:35:11.180 --> 02:35:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Like how can the EU dictate to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3223
02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:18.920
<v Speaker 1>the shape of our bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the case is like a good one.</v>

3224
02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that important.</v>

3225
02:35:20.411 --> 02:35:25.411
<v Speaker 1>It's just a banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they even going to regulate it </v>

3226
02:35:25.411 --> 02:35:25.411
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3227
02:35:25.411 --> 02:35:26.150
<v Speaker 1>it's because if you want to have like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fee,</v>

3228
02:35:26.270 --> 02:35:31.270
<v Speaker 1>like single market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to have common standards </v>

3229
02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:31.270
<v Speaker 1>across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3230
02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:34.530
<v Speaker 1>and then this was just marketing </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards were like the Bendy,</v>

3231
02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:37.000
<v Speaker 1>bananas don't sell and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighter ones do.</v>

3232
02:35:37.810 --> 02:35:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3233
02:35:38.441 --> 02:35:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know more of the detail about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be the time the government</v>

3234
02:35:42.041 --> 02:35:46.030
<v Speaker 1>steps in on something as fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous as the bend in the shape of a</v>

3235
02:35:46.031 --> 02:35:47.260
<v Speaker 1>banana and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3236
02:35:47.261 --> 02:35:49.060
<v Speaker 1>fuck face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you go take care of poverty?</v>

3237
02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:50.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you,</v>

3238
02:35:50.650 --> 02:35:53.920
<v Speaker 1>why don't you handle something real </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of dealing with bendy bananas.</v>

3239
02:35:53.950 --> 02:35:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on the Bendy Madonna's case.</v>

3240
02:35:56.110 --> 02:35:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't off the top of my head.</v>

3241
02:35:57.851 --> 02:36:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Think of why you'd want to not allow the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sale.</v>

3242
02:36:00.370 --> 02:36:05.370
<v Speaker 1>But that's what people worry about when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they worried about bureaucracy when you </v>

3243
02:36:05.370 --> 02:36:05.370
<v Speaker 1>worried about too much control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3244
02:36:05.370 --> 02:36:05.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3245
02:36:05.770 --> 02:36:07.420
<v Speaker 1>that's a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

3246
02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:12.620
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why people don't want micromanaging of </v>

3247
02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:12.620
<v Speaker 1>our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3248
02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:15.430
<v Speaker 1>But then the question is do we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave over bananas?</v>

3249
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:19.720
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of other factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the bananas that caused it,</v>

3250
02:36:19.721 --> 02:36:24.721
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is the UK as part of the </v>

3251
02:36:24.721 --> 02:36:24.970
<v Speaker 1>European Union has sovereignty over like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's income taxes,</v>

3252
02:36:24.971 --> 02:36:29.971
<v Speaker 1>all of its laws as long as they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict with the UN Declaration of </v>

3253
02:36:30.491 --> 02:36:32.860
<v Speaker 1>human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was first invented by the UK,</v>

3254
02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:35.520
<v Speaker 1>has control of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3255
02:36:35.530 --> 02:36:36.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it's internal,</v>

3256
02:36:36.810 --> 02:36:37.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation,</v>

3257
02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:42.300
<v Speaker 1>it completely can go to war if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I'm undetected.</v>

3258
02:36:42.730 --> 02:36:47.140
<v Speaker 1>So the loss of sovereignty seems pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>mild from my perspective.</v>

3259
02:36:47.530 --> 02:36:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like I feel like they focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these examples,</v>

3260
02:36:52.631 --> 02:36:53.230
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3261
02:36:53.231 --> 02:36:55.090
<v Speaker 1>maybe like let's say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

3262
02:36:55.091 --> 02:37:00.091
<v Speaker 1>It's a cost we would like to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it'd be better if it could </v>

3263
02:37:00.091 --> 02:37:02.320
<v Speaker 1>make decision of men as maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bananas was the bad coal.</v>

3264
02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely doesn't seem like a </v>

3265
02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:07.360
<v Speaker 1>universal reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

3266
02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:08.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a large percentage of the people</v>

3267
02:37:08.681 --> 02:37:11.220
<v Speaker 1>in England are very upset about brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3268
02:37:11.810 --> 02:37:15.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a really interesting sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>divide between people.</v>

3269
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I find fascinating is </v>

3270
02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:22.250
<v Speaker 1>that we would make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this in general,</v>

3271
02:37:22.251 --> 02:37:27.251
<v Speaker 1>I think this the elections as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I studied a bunch of voting </v>

3272
02:37:27.251 --> 02:37:30.521
<v Speaker 1>theory wanting my phd and we make these </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentous decisions as a country where </v>

3273
02:37:30.521 --> 02:37:32.750
<v Speaker 1>we get everyone in the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

3274
02:37:32.751 --> 02:37:37.751
<v Speaker 1>Go to a specific place and then get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smallest possible information out of </v>

3275
02:37:38.211 --> 02:37:43.211
<v Speaker 1>them that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just a single tick like yes or </v>

3276
02:37:43.211 --> 02:37:43.211
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3277
02:37:43.211 --> 02:37:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Whereas there's so much more you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing.</v>

3278
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:46.820
<v Speaker 1>So in one case with a referendum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3279
02:37:46.850 --> 02:37:51.850
<v Speaker 1>rather than just at a particular date </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the turnout is affected by things </v>

3280
02:37:51.850 --> 02:37:52.730
<v Speaker 1>like the weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3281
02:37:53.060 --> 02:37:54.530
<v Speaker 1>it's affected by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3282
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:59.550
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the week before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead you just have figured referenda </v>

3283
02:37:59.550 --> 02:38:02.840
<v Speaker 1>and given them a mountainous </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentousness of the decision,</v>

3284
02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:06.020
<v Speaker 1>spending more money on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like actually getting the accurate views</v>

3285
02:38:06.021 --> 02:38:07.670
<v Speaker 1>of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3286
02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:09.970
<v Speaker 1>is super important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead,</v>

3287
02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:15.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have free over the period of six </v>

3288
02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:15.040
<v Speaker 1>months and choose the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3289
02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:18.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be best fee basically where there's,</v>

3290
02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:23.530
<v Speaker 1>that would be like a more accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an accurate representation of what </v>

3291
02:38:23.530 --> 02:38:23.530
<v Speaker 1>people think of a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3292
02:38:23.530 --> 02:38:27.851
<v Speaker 1>But isn't there also a gigantic issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people not being informed about </v>

3293
02:38:27.851 --> 02:38:29.810
<v Speaker 1>what they're voting on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be informed about what</v>

3294
02:38:29.811 --> 02:38:34.811
<v Speaker 1>you're voting on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You certainly don't have to be accurate </v>

3295
02:38:34.811 --> 02:38:36.851
<v Speaker 1>about what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could easily be misled and the </v>

3296
02:38:36.851 --> 02:38:39.281
<v Speaker 1>actual hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provable facts could be completely </v>

3297
02:38:39.281 --> 02:38:40.280
<v Speaker 1>outside of your grasp and yet you still </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a big decision.</v>

3298
02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I wondered before about having a um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attest attest.</v>

3299
02:38:46.551 --> 02:38:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go like,</v>

3300
02:38:47.770 --> 02:38:49.910
<v Speaker 1>but like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really basic.</v>

3301
02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would still.</v>

3302
02:38:52.540 --> 02:38:54.950
<v Speaker 1>There's this question of just why do we </v>
<v Speaker 1>care about democracy?</v>

3303
02:38:54.951 --> 02:38:59.951
<v Speaker 1>What's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we seems like a really important </v>

3304
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.890
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3305
02:39:00.891 --> 02:39:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Political philosophers talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

3306
02:39:03.050 --> 02:39:06.260
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of agreed like democracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems goods,</v>

3307
02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:09.920
<v Speaker 1>other forms of government that we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>so far seem terrible,</v>

3308
02:39:10.450 --> 02:39:11.240
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or worse.</v>

3309
02:39:11.390 --> 02:39:13.100
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is democracy good?</v>

3310
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Is it just that democracy gives us this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to boot out dictators and the risk </v>

3311
02:39:19.161 --> 02:39:22.010
<v Speaker 1>of a single person taking power is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

3312
02:39:22.011 --> 02:39:25.100
<v Speaker 1>really bad and so we just need some </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism to get rid of that.</v>

3313
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that it's intrinsically valuable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it that people just have a right to </v>

3314
02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:33.950
<v Speaker 1>have equal representation and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just this fundamental thing?</v>

3315
02:39:34.490 --> 02:39:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Or is it justified on just in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences?</v>

3316
02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Is it because if everybody's able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute then people will make better </v>

3317
02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:44.510
<v Speaker 1>decisions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never necessarily think it's an either</v>

3318
02:39:44.511 --> 02:39:49.511
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's also the people like to </v>

3319
02:39:49.511 --> 02:39:51.491
<v Speaker 1>feel like they play a part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they don't want to feel like </v>

3320
02:39:51.491 --> 02:39:51.491
<v Speaker 1>they're being ruled over by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>monarch.</v>

3321
02:39:51.491 --> 02:39:54.740
<v Speaker 1>They want to feel like they have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a play and the decision making.</v>

3322
02:39:55.020 --> 02:40:00.020
<v Speaker 1>It's also what one of the gross things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about trump winning in this country is </v>

3323
02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:03.101
<v Speaker 1>how many people gloated you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people gloat upon victory that </v>

3324
02:40:03.101 --> 02:40:07.151
<v Speaker 1>their side one and then you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this whole team mentality that </v>

3325
02:40:07.151 --> 02:40:08.630
<v Speaker 1>people adopt when it comes to any sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an issue.</v>

3326
02:40:08.910 --> 02:40:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is cool,</v>

3327
02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:11.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3328
02:40:11.540 --> 02:40:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3329
02:40:11.931 --> 02:40:16.931
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things I'm really </v>

3330
02:40:16.931 --> 02:40:16.931
<v Speaker 1>worried</v>

3331
02:40:16.931 --> 02:40:16.931
<v Speaker 2>about with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3332
02:40:16.931 --> 02:40:18.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3333
02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:23.240
<v Speaker 2>is increasing levels of partisanship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just this really robust </v>

3334
02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:23.390
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon that we're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3335
02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:28.640
<v Speaker 2>and it's really worrying because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means that we're just undermining any </v>

3336
02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:28.640
<v Speaker 2>chance of people changing their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone,</v>

3337
02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:30.290
<v Speaker 2>like people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3338
02:40:30.291 --> 02:40:35.291
<v Speaker 2>it costs a commie accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like the vast majority of votes </v>

3339
02:40:35.291 --> 02:40:38.871
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And similarly for Hillary's votes were </v>

3340
02:40:38.871 --> 02:40:38.940
<v Speaker 2>from people who just always voted </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican or Democrat.</v>

3341
02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily</v>

3342
02:40:40.650 --> 02:40:45.150
<v Speaker 3>because the trump won by so many votes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have good percentage of them had to</v>

3343
02:40:45.151 --> 02:40:47.760
<v Speaker 3>have voted for Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just statistically,</v>

3344
02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:48.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3345
02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm still thinking of thumps votes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What proportion of people have only ever</v>

3346
02:40:57.661 --> 02:40:59.310
<v Speaker 2>voted Republican?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

3347
02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:03.720
<v Speaker 2>And I would like definitely bet greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>than 80 percent negative.</v>

3348
02:41:03.721 --> 02:41:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3349
02:41:04.441 --> 02:41:06.450
<v Speaker 2>that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the polls,</v>

3350
02:41:06.451 --> 02:41:10.640
<v Speaker 2>like it's always that in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>expected number of votes,</v>

3351
02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:10.860
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3352
02:41:10.861 --> 02:41:13.730
<v Speaker 2>it's only 46 percent in favor trump with</v>
<v Speaker 2>his office.</v>

3353
02:41:13.770 --> 02:41:16.260
<v Speaker 3>So the issue that the independence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the swing states,</v>

3354
02:41:16.290 --> 02:41:19.860
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Gary Johnson or whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Jill Stein,</v>

3355
02:41:20.130 --> 02:41:25.130
<v Speaker 3>those independence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of votes they got would have </v>

3356
02:41:25.130 --> 02:41:25.840
<v Speaker 3>swung the other way towards Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3357
02:41:25.930 --> 02:41:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I remember looking into this for Jill </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stein in particular,</v>

3358
02:41:28.810 --> 02:41:32.710
<v Speaker 2>and actually it was the case she would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have won the popular vote by even more,</v>

3359
02:41:32.950 --> 02:41:36.130
<v Speaker 2>but in none of the swing states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did she get enough of a percentage,</v>

3360
02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:38.480
<v Speaker 3>not just Jill Stein or Gary Johnson as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well?</v>

3361
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though Gary Johnson,</v>

3362
02:41:39.601 --> 02:41:44.430
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to me was split almost evenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>between trump and hillary.</v>

3363
02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:48.930
<v Speaker 2>But this is an interesting case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that people.</v>

3364
02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about so much as like,</v>

3365
02:41:51.150 --> 02:41:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I think the process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all the sudden like a democracy,</v>

3366
02:41:53.941 --> 02:41:58.941
<v Speaker 2>but like one single,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like check box every four years.</v>

3367
02:41:59.731 --> 02:42:04.731
<v Speaker 2>It's like the smallest amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information you can be getting and it's </v>

3368
02:42:04.731 --> 02:42:05.940
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3369
02:42:05.941 --> 02:42:08.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's opposing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this happens on both sides.</v>

3370
02:42:08.250 --> 02:42:09.810
<v Speaker 2>It's opposing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jill Stein became,</v>

3371
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:10.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

3372
02:42:10.891 --> 02:42:13.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really popular,</v>

3373
02:42:13.530 --> 02:42:18.530
<v Speaker 2>took 10 percent of the vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would've just killed hillary like </v>

3374
02:42:18.530 --> 02:42:20.940
<v Speaker 2>absolutely or suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Evan Mcmullin,</v>

3375
02:42:20.970 --> 02:42:22.870
<v Speaker 2>is that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3376
02:42:22.890 --> 02:42:25.370
<v Speaker 2>he was a Publican Independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3377
02:42:25.620 --> 02:42:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Did well in Utah and it was supposedly a</v>
<v Speaker 2>far right candidate.</v>

3378
02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:30.520
<v Speaker 2>It does really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3379
02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:32.990
<v Speaker 2>takes all of the votes away from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from um,</v>

3380
02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:38.480
<v Speaker 2>the fact that that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shows that like first past the post </v>

3381
02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:39.000
<v Speaker 2>voting system is a very bad voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

3382
02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:44.220
<v Speaker 2>is not accurately representing the will </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people and we could do so much </v>

3383
02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:48.381
<v Speaker 2>better than it would mean that I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a democratic process,</v>

3384
02:42:48.421 --> 02:42:53.421
<v Speaker 2>you'd be much closer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Presenting what people actually believe </v>

3385
02:42:53.421 --> 02:42:56.010
<v Speaker 2>or feel about things because right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that yeah,</v>

3386
02:42:56.011 --> 02:43:01.011
<v Speaker 2>you can be influenced by stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much support as a third party </v>

3387
02:43:01.011 --> 02:43:01.011
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

3388
02:43:01.011 --> 02:43:02.600
<v Speaker 3>System's terrible system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lasts too long.</v>

3389
02:43:02.601 --> 02:43:07.601
<v Speaker 3>The decisions last for four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This person gets locked into position </v>

3390
02:43:07.601 --> 02:43:08.600
<v Speaker 3>unless you impeach them and then remove </v>
<v Speaker 3>them from office.</v>

3391
02:43:08.601 --> 02:43:10.100
<v Speaker 3>They're stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sucks.</v>

3392
02:43:10.101 --> 02:43:11.890
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could talk about more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't.</v>

3393
02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:12.110
<v Speaker 3>I gotta</v>

3394
02:43:12.130 --> 02:43:14.070
<v Speaker 1>get the Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3395
02:43:14.110 --> 02:43:19.110
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the least interesting thing we </v>

3396
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:21.091
<v Speaker 1>talked about today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the ai and all the other stuff is </v>

3397
02:43:21.091 --> 02:43:24.280
<v Speaker 1>just fascinating stuff.</v>
