1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Good experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is a good time to bring it</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:05.650
<v Speaker 1>up as any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously Anthony Bordain took his life</v>

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>last week and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a friend of mine and it was real.</v>

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>That was real hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday was real hard.</v>

6
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I woke up and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a text from my friend Maynard from</v>

7
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:21.380
<v Speaker 1>tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>maynard said so much for the Keenan</v>
<v Speaker 1>verses Bordain Celebrity Jujitsu match.</v>

9
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

11
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I googled it and I saw it.</v>

12
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit man,</v>

13
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't fuck what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>did you know his demons?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was friends with them,</v>

18
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>hung out with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got fucked up with them.</v>

19
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Did you get a feeling that he had that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in him?</v>

20
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really weird.</v>

21
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>It was like he'd been saying really</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently that he'd never been happier.</v>

22
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about his girlfriend and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that it never been happier.</v>

23
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know it could be that happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know someone could make them that</v>

24
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

25
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have.</v>

27
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>They might have broken up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

28
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

29
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.961
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

30
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

31
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes people when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been that happy,</v>

32
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>you're catching them on these ups and</v>
<v Speaker 1>downs,</v>

33
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

34
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>people get manic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people get,</v>

37
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>they get up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

38
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he liked to get fucked up.</v>

39
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he liked to drink.</v>

40
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

41
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>and he enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

42
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>it was something that he enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>

43
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did an episode of this show.</v>

44
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>We went hunting for pheasants in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

45
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>We cooked over this campfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He cooked fantastic.</v>

46
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then afterwards we drank whiskey and</v>

47
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>smoke weed and he goes deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes deep.</v>

48
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where I'm sitting down,</v>

49
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just try to catch myself</v>

50
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 1>real at the world spinning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep breath,</v>

51
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>deep breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

52
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>where's the fucking weed?</v>

53
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>They just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kept going.</v>

54
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>But I knew he drank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he smoked weed.</v>

55
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

56
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:27.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a heroin problem.</v>

57
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was younger and he kicked it.</v>

58
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't feel the need to just be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sober.</v>

59
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of interesting about them.</v>

60
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a thing you bright would get</v>

61
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>sober from a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like they have to get sober</v>

62
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:43.640
<v Speaker 1>from everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>That did not feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

64
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he would drink,</v>

65
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>but when he was home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with his kid and he's homeless,</v>

66
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>he didn't drink at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he would only know that he would</v>

67
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>only do that when he would do beyond the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

68
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He'd want me to show stretches of</v>

69
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>time and he didn't drink at all and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was addicted to Jujitsu.</v>

70
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

71
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing Jujitsu,</v>

72
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>like literally every day when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging around with him,</v>

73
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went,</v>

74
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>we were in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to Bozeman to find a local</v>

75
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu club and trained with them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>

76
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>She just trained with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

77
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I hardly ever did that on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a place I would just go to the gym</v>

78
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:29.641
<v Speaker 1>and workout wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was so into learning and getting</v>

79
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:33.260
<v Speaker 1>better at Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a fundamental</v>

80
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.650
<v Speaker 1>problem with the way people approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and uh,</v>

81
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it goes back to what we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier about right versus</v>

82
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:44.461
<v Speaker 1>left or Republican versus Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not thinking of the consequences</v>

83
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>of arguing for or against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that climate change is a</v>

84
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>human caused thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not thinking of the</v>

85
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to win.</v>

86
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

87
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>And what their side to be ready to be.</v>

88
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.491
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

89
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>what bums me out is they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the consequences of that for</v>

90
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>the both the American enterprise and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human enterprise.</v>

91
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because you know,</v>

92
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep calling one branch of</v>

93
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hoax,</v>

94
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.930
<v Speaker 1>then what's to say the other branches</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

95
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 1>then you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

97
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>you're rolling down this slippery slope</v>
<v Speaker 1>where like the other countries,</v>

98
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

99
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>So most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Nobel Prizes Americans have one</v>

100
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>where people from other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came here to do their science</v>

101
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>because we had the best scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>

102
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>The next generation just go somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

103
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.680
<v Speaker 1>they'll go to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

105
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>there's that part of it and the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties like,</v>

106
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just science.</v>

107
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't care about your political</v>
<v Speaker 1>views and you know,</v>

108
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not fair to use the cell phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the antibiotics and then turn</v>

109
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>around and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then suddenly treat this thing as if</v>

110
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>it was another thing in your bucket of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies.</v>

111
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I think also people think that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another compromise industry's</v>

112
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work,</v>

113
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to kill jobs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna damage the economy and</v>

114
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>that's more important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

116
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And if people really saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

117
00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

118
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

119
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.890
<v Speaker 1>just like I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change shows how powerful people</v>

120
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>become and also shows how powerful are</v>
<v Speaker 1>our enterprise.</v>

121
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did this by building businesses,</v>

122
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>by building enterprise bi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we built this world curdling machine</v>

123
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:16.020
<v Speaker 1>of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

124
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

125
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>the planet actually noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you like that term world girdling</v>

126
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.820
<v Speaker 1>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives me the girdle wrapping around.</v>

127
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because it's from like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare,</v>

128
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>like from a Caesar or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys you could take out</v>

129
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:31.774
<v Speaker 1>there that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

130
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.960
<v Speaker 1>track and field guys or football players</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could get them to fight better</v>

131
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>than him and a couple of weeks right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easily because they're athletes,</v>

132
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>they're athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would understand how to shift their</v>

133
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw a punch.</v>

134
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:45.484
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

135
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

136
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.370
<v Speaker 2>the sparring videos that I saw was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was from his first fight,</v>

137
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:51.540
<v Speaker 2>but even then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he wasn't,</v>

138
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:54.920
<v Speaker 2>he signed for like two years before he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had his first fight or something that</v>

139
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 2>there's no way that you're six years</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep in the game.</v>

140
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:58.110
<v Speaker 2>And yet</v>

141
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>he was still at that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

142
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have any talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

143
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.510
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't have physical talent or</v>

144
00:06:04.511 --> 00:06:06.600
<v Speaker 1>whatever for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a,</v>

145
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his approach,</v>

146
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>his intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>

147
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not as coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at Duke fucking Rufus,</v>

148
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's going to happen.</v>

172
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much can you possibly expect?</v>

173
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 1>But I would rather see that fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>against these other ones.</v>

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not insecure in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean whether it's through martial arts</v>

211
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:47.291
<v Speaker 1>or any kind of exercise or work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just take pride in getting things</v>

212
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take pride in working,</v>

213
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially working towards things that</v>

214
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 1>are important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's working on set,</v>

215
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>working on my standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's working on a podcast,</v>

216
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:03.921
<v Speaker 1>whether it's working on my martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>or fitness or yoga or whatever I get</v>

217
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>after it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you got to?</v>

219
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for me it's not a matter of whether</v>

220
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 1>or not it's an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like brushing my teeth.</v>

221
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't decide one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

222
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to brush my teeth today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking brushed my teeth.</v>

223
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.290
<v Speaker 1>And when there's days where I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>fasted cardio,</v>

224
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.750
<v Speaker 1>when that alarm goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a matter of whether or not a</v>

225
00:09:23.751 --> 00:09:26.060
<v Speaker 1>shut the alarm off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not an option.</v>

226
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.940
<v Speaker 1>You Get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your fucking shoes on,</v>

227
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.510
<v Speaker 1>you get the dog and you go running</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you do and if you</v>

228
00:09:32.511 --> 00:09:37.430
<v Speaker 1>just decide that's what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get things done and then a</v>

229
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Speaker 1>month later you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you become a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

237
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.270
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

238
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.410
<v Speaker 1>and I got the good type of progressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it gets progressively easier to.</v>

239
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I told you I'm doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't though,</v>

240
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.200
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get ease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.000
<v Speaker 1>think so because can hard every time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that alarm goes off like fuck you for</v>

242
00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:09.380
<v Speaker 1>you now then right when you started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because you know the reward</v>

243
00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:10.340
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

244
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 1>that reward some enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no enforcement in the success</v>

245
00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:18.290
<v Speaker 1>that I've had in completing these tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But every fucking time I go to yoga</v>

246
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:19.760
<v Speaker 1>class and my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

247
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Ninety minutes in a 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four degree temperature with these all</v>

248
00:10:23.301 --> 00:10:24.830
<v Speaker 1>these women that are going to humiliate</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

249
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.740
<v Speaker 1>they can definitely do things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

250
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is tough man.</v>

251
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of these older ladies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are fucking tough.</v>

252
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

253
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:35.780
<v Speaker 1>they just gutted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just one lady that goes there.</v>

254
00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:38.660
<v Speaker 1>She's like 60 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even bring water and this</v>

255
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:41.480
<v Speaker 1>lady's in there for 90 fucking minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweated out.</v>

256
00:10:41.481 --> 00:10:42.650
<v Speaker 1>She's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I go,</v>

257
00:10:42.651 --> 00:10:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

258
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.960
<v Speaker 1>she's not bringing water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sure she's 60.</v>

259
00:10:44.961 --> 00:10:47.920
<v Speaker 1>She can be like 20 and hydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

260
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.920
<v Speaker 1>she's gray haired and tough as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She drinks water before she drinks it</v>

261
00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:53.600
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when she's in that class,</v>

262
00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:55.220
<v Speaker 1>she's just tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

263
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never easy to do.</v>

264
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets a little bit easier when you get</v>

265
00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:02.120
<v Speaker 1>better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you just try harder and it</v>

266
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:04.490
<v Speaker 1>makes it more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're always giving 100 percent</v>

267
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:05.780
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always going to be hard.</v>

268
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take some pride in the fact that now</v>

269
00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I can go two miles through the hills and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:15.020
<v Speaker 1>and reach the point of exhaustion where</v>
<v Speaker 1>before it was one or whatever,</v>

271
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever your little little progress</v>
<v Speaker 1>markers are,</v>

272
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:19.790
<v Speaker 1>you get some satisfaction that.</v>

273
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 1>But it's always difficult to get going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hardest step is the first step is</v>

274
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:26.750
<v Speaker 1>not the 30th staff or the hundredth</v>
<v Speaker 1>step.</v>

275
00:11:26.751 --> 00:11:29.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the fucking first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting on the trail.</v>

276
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Getting going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the hardest thing.</v>

277
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.150
<v Speaker 1>The hardest weight to lift is the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>one because once you get going like,</v>

278
00:11:35.151 --> 00:11:36.710
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a half hour into my workout,</v>

279
00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing things down that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be doing.</v>

280
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:39.374
<v Speaker 1>Now I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Twenty Chin ups and burpees and then all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it,</v>

282
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.000
<v Speaker 1>you just have to do it and so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a hard time doing it.</v>
