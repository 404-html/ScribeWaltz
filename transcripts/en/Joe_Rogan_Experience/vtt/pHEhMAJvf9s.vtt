7
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>then he,</v>

8
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.380
<v Speaker 1>the kid tricks him into taking it while he's driving so he starts</v>

9
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.313

00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 2>And then watch what happens.</v>

16
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.570
<v Speaker 2>This is the part where it starts getting really agony.</v>

17
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking awesome shit.</v>

18
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 2>It's something.</v>

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.383
<v Speaker 2>Where</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's getting inducted by aliens.</v>

24
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Monkeys first and then the alien ship shoots him up into a spaceship.</v>

25
00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 2>This is people in near on the same wavelength.</v>

26
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.490
<v Speaker 2>If they didn't hear them,</v>

27
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 2>if they don't know me and know me when they were coding this,</v>

28
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 2>they need to show to you are you are the herpes that there is no cure for it.</v>

29
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.250
<v Speaker 2>We are on the same wavelength.</v>

30
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.740
<v Speaker 2>We would get along great if they don't know me,</v>

31
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 2>we would get along great if this wasn't inspired by me.</v>

32
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Definitely fucking comic people.</v>

33
00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Everyone you have terminated all of this.</v>

34
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.640
<v Speaker 2>You see that he did this alien given the fucking metal side.</v>

35
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

36
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 2>This is intense shit made this with no underwear though,</v>

37
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.320
<v Speaker 2>but why are you hiding your Dick and an asshole?</v>

38
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.560
<v Speaker 2>You're just flying through space to me.</v>

39
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh you shouldn't.</v>

40
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be holding onto your team.</v>

41
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Your fear and your insecurities.</v>

42
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Let the breeze flow through that left flies this hover on your asshole flying</v>

43
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:19.611
<v Speaker 2>around in space.</v>

44
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:20.091
<v Speaker 2>What do you care?</v>

45
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 2>And you're.</v>

46
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 2>You're one with the universe,</v>

47
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 2>so the trip and you can get high and every time he gets it here,</v>

48
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 2>inner thoughts and it's really trippy.</v>

49
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 2>So like once it goes online first all as comics or I'll just kind of hanging out</v>

50
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:33.261
<v Speaker 2>at the comedy store,</v>

51
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 2>smoke weed together</v>

52
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 2>and gets into the oculus rift.</v>

53
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that this game is the most successful single piece of anything</v>

54
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 2>anybody created over $1,000,000,000 in three days.</v>

55
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Not Amazing.</v>

56
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.920
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing,</v>

57
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:50.870
<v Speaker 2>but there's never been anything that's sold as well as this.</v>

58
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 2>God bless America.</v>

59
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

60
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 2>When you think the economy's down</v>

61
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 2>cocaine or both in a day?</v>

62
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.454
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

63
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.790
<v Speaker 3>It is only so much flow.</v>

64
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.520
