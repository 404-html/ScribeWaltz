00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.443
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fight over like two and three </v>

2
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:07.310
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I can make the weight different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA.</v>

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>In that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA,</v>

5
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a firm middleweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>to light heavyweight,</v>

6
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>which guys jumped back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with 20 fucking pounds.</v>

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's madness.</v>

8
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be more awake </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

9
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying this from the jump.</v>

10
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>There should be a weight class every 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds and they're like,</v>

11
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's too many champions,</v>

12
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>it waters down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely disagree.</v>

13
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.203
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me some of these amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters that you have that are </v>

14
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>superstars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a donald cerrone,</v>

15
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>like a Diego Sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all these different guys,</v>

16
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:38.074
<v Speaker 1>so it was just so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys that never won a title that are </v>

17
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>huge fan favorites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>If you look at all these different guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uriah faber and other ones,</v>

19
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.293
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me those guys couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been champions and you wouldn't </v>

20
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>have had even more champions and an even</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazier thing if there were.</v>

21
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>If there was a weight class every 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds and a better product,</v>

22
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you're getting better performances </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Donald's not destroying his body</v>

23
00:00:58.501 --> 00:00:59.334
<v Speaker 1>and make 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not having these monsters make </v>

24
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>these weight classes and the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>world champions.</v>

25
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>There's the sponsorship classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>

26
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.621
<v Speaker 1>Oh six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

27
00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>two 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>

28
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

29
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.303
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting is the best guy </v>

30
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:21.161
<v Speaker 1>seemed to like flatten out around 2:42.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my thought is let's make a to 40.</v>

31
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.283
<v Speaker 1>Let's make that heavyweight and then two</v>
<v Speaker 1>to to to 40 to 65 or a little champions </v>

32
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>the better or all the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only time you can't.</v>

33
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little bit of a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A problem is with Cyborg,</v>

34
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she's like,</v>

35
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight anyone at 1:40,</v>

36
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>but at 1:40</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard from my source,</v>

37
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>it was a beast for her to get to.</v>

38
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I think she's the 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound invicta champion.</v>

39
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>They have a 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC.</v>

40
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.980
<v Speaker 1>One 45 and I think you can do one for d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why do it?</v>

41
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Why make her make it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the 1:45</v>

42
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>pound champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

43
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a lot of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>superstars at 1:35</v>

44
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>can make 1:40</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make him put on 10 pounds.</v>

45
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Ever build it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will come.</v>

46
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.963
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I would say right now Mr Rowe </v>

47
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.233
<v Speaker 1>breakdown right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You understand she's the invicta </v>

48
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she's fighting people in Invicta.</v>

49
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:14.754
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

51
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>She's better than all of them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter,</v>

52
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't be forcing her to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>

53
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>When 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>is already established.</v>

54
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Misha tate was the 1:45</v>

55
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>pound champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strikeforce.</v>

56
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.483
<v Speaker 1>It's good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Established way that you would fight or </v>

57
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>two w.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an established weight class I think</v>

58
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>at 1:40</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

59
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.643
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holmes fought people in boxing as </v>

60
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>high as 1:52,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 1:45</v>

61
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.030
<v Speaker 1>and established way closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sign up the house.</v>

62
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Speaker 1>How does Holly Holm Doing Cyborg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I matched his.</v>

63
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>She has the best chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Because Cyborg is a ruthless marauder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like a preserve or a tower shoot.</v>

65
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>The box style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not this last fight.</v>

66
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>No more tech related and those hits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

67
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:56.154
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That counter right hand on the counter </v>

68
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>right hands now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Leslie Hicks,</v>

69
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the mastercard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice hard.</v>

70
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Of course she's mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Establish.</v>

71
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>She's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She should be.</v>

72
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.190
<v Speaker 1>She should be celebrating that stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she should.</v>

73
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>She should definitely thank the referee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The referee saved her from herself.</v>

74
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she just so tough fighter.</v>

75
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>She's so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to go out on our shield,</v>

76
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.530
<v Speaker 1>but she was already gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't understand ground and pound.</v>

77
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>That shit is ill fate or days.</v>

78
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>She was punching him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's so much more advanced than anybody</v>

79
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:27.181
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

80
00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:29.880
<v Speaker 1>So much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Get up to Perillo.</v>

81
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's different than holly completely.</v>

82
00:03:32.601 --> 00:03:33.434
<v Speaker 1>Holly is a counter striker and holly </v>
<v Speaker 1>also had a really brutal knockout in </v>

83
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>boxing against a larger woman and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched it.</v>

84
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

85
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.753
<v Speaker 1>Is the kind of knock out that you never </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fight that way again because you </v>

86
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>realize the consequences now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone gets brutally,</v>

87
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:50.584
<v Speaker 1>brutally knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're aware of that as a consequence </v>

88
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>and I think she's become much more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive minded counter striker,</v>

89
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>which was super effective against Rhonda</v>
<v Speaker 1>or better I think for her.</v>

90
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.073
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't look so good against </v>

91
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Meesha because Misha was fighting super </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>

92
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>but it was also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:12.241
<v Speaker 1>it's also because Meesha doesn't brush </v>
<v Speaker 1>after hiring stanley outside flat.</v>

94
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Amazing blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for whatever reason,</v>

95
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>holly didn't fight like herself.</v>

96
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like pulling the trigger.</v>

97
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't like to lead to lead and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's worried about being taken down.</v>

98
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.833
<v Speaker 1>When she got taken down by me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we realized why she doesn't like </v>

99
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 1>delete?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

100
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>They should took her down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of her on the ground,</v>

101
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>like destroyed her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that second round was on top of,</v>

102
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 1>or most of the rounds just beating her </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

103
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>And so we knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look of me,</v>

104
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>she gets her down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's fucked.</v>

105
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.553
<v Speaker 1>So then she fights like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a craftsman to third and fourth </v>

106
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:39.161
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just fights.</v>

107
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Real smarts isn't the outside edges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those rounds.</v>

108
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.993
<v Speaker 1>And then me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's forced to go for broke and the </v>

109
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>fifth and Meesha want up taking her out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and choking her out story,</v>

110
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:47.764
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

111
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyborgs way better on the ground.</v>

112
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean way better on the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong way better way,</v>

113
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>way better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way better.</v>

114
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg wind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight Jujitsu competitions.</v>

115
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>She is fucking strongest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking face.</v>

116
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Suplexes she just made she rampage </v>
<v Speaker 1>dallen bitch.</v>
