15
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's on level playing fields</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you kind of wonder who would be</v>

16
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>champions for people who don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about.</v>

17
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.991
<v Speaker 1>You sought out the US antidoping agency</v>
<v Speaker 1>was hired by the UFC to clean up the</v>

18
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God damn bodies are dropping massive</v>

19
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>massive bodies dropping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the documentary on uh,</v>

20
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cyclist,</v>

21
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>lance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lance Armstrong,</v>

22
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>and just watch how that guy just lied</v>
<v Speaker 1>and manipulated his way and you know,</v>

23
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>people were just calling the smoke and</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time before that.</v>

24
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.591
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here comes a Wicki.</v>

26
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>It was a pretty scary dude if you ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>met him.</v>

27
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>night and Nice is a very nice guy.</v>

28
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Awesome dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

29
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>he means business man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't try to catch the cheaters</v>

30
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

31
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually happy because I've always</v>

32
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>taken pride in being a natural man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I feel like you need to start pumping</v>

33
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's time for you to get out,</v>

34
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.371
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

35
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:23.961
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

36
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Lance Armstrong's defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that entire sport was dirty.</v>

38
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:33.051
<v Speaker 1>That's a different sport because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when it's really crazy because all</v>

39
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>the years he won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like took his titles away,</v>

40
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>And while he still has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been on the podcast,</v>

42
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good dude,</v>

43
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in a bad.</v>

44
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>He was in a bad spot.</v>

45
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>If they took his title away and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave it to the next person that didn't</v>

46
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>test positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be 18th place.</v>

47
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>That's how dirty that supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dirty,</v>

49
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty sport.</v>

50
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was asking him,</v>

51
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:56.851
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

52
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know what they're doing</v>

54
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

55
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>well how are they doing it today if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still breaking records?</v>

56
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll find out one day,</v>

57
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>we'll find out eventually one day that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to figure out what the</v>

58
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>fuck these people are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Novitsky was explaining all the</v>

59
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 1>weird little loopholes that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding like testosterone</v>

60
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>supplementation that comes from animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of from wild yams.</v>

61
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they catch him.</v>

62
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

64
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of people doing stuff like</v>

65
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean that just seems insane.</v>

66
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last time we're going to show you were</v>

67
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>talking about how somebody was pulling</v>
<v Speaker 1>out their blood and refrigerating it and</v>

68
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was at doping basically epo.</v>

69
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

70
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>that is still going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely still going on.</v>

71
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>And apparently the way they're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to test that.</v>

72
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not supposed to use an IV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why you're not supposed</v>

74
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>to use an ivs that somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>through intravenous fluids,</v>

75
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:51.501
<v Speaker 1>you can mask the effects of doping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they also have been able to detect</v>

76
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>minuscule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.840
<v Speaker 1>plastic particles from the tubes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use to put ivy fluids back into</v>

78
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been able to detect those</v>

79
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's ever been caught for that.</v>

80
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

81
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.060
<v Speaker 1>they would either use a blood that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own blood or in Lance Armstrong's</v>

82
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the people that were taking</v>

83
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>epo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes your body produce more</v>

84
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:16.504
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>

85
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>But I think guys to this day are</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably still putting blood back into</v>

86
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

87
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Gives you an advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

89
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>This drastic way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're pulling blood and then</v>

90
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with everything going on.</v>

91
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Well I know a dude that walked into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters' dressing room,</v>

92
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not dressing room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel room and they had bags of blood in</v>

93
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>the hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pulled his blood out so he could</v>

94
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>make weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>You were telling me that last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

96
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's freaky.</v>

97
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>That's freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

98
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>because that's not sanitary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not in the hospital.</v>

99
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>You're in some hotel room where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been farting and shooting loads all</v>

100
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes to shit all over the wall.</v>

101
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>You're just gonna take your blood out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that environment,</v>

102
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>like that's creepy man.</v>

103
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>That was like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like a long time ago too.</v>

104
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a long time ago.</v>

105
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been.</v>

106
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>They've been definitely cheating</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

107
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>but now we're seeing the effects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people's physiques are changing.</v>

108
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>The way they fight is changing the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look there.</v>

109
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Joel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Everything about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their attitude,</v>

111
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>like their confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of these guys,</v>

112
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>like they're becoming different human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

113
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I the level playing field,</v>

115
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>people were getting knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he must be in great shape.</v>

120
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>He's just killing it in the fifth round</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now he can't get past round one,</v>

121
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

123
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the technique is king,</v>

124
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

125
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Technique and training and heart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage and cardio and cardio.</v>

126
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go to a guy like mighty mouse</v>

127
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.320
<v Speaker 1>where he fought a bog routine off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bogatin off he out cardio the guy beat</v>

128
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 1>his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially going into the stretch was</v>

129
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:58.880
<v Speaker 1>just completely out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

130
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>and at the end of the fight back with</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] pops hot for EPO.</v>

131
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though this guy was on drugs,</v>

132
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>mighty mouse is technique and cardio and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as his ability to understand how to</v>

133
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>pace himself through a five round fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mighty mouse is.</v>

135
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's interested in it.</v>

136
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I know you've been a big fan of him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always enjoyed watching that guy.</v>

137
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can't fight like that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to watch some of his techniques and</v>

138
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>the way you use angles and footwork and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he learns you in,</v>

139
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>in his clinch game is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a nasty,</v>

140
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>nasty.</v>

141
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if maybe you could give some</v>

142
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>insight on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you used to fight at 1:55 and now</v>

143
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you've got to cut to get down to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>$45.</v>

144
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>A pretty big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mighty mouse is not a big guy and I</v>

145
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>always wonder like could a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>could a light heavyweight or a</v>

146
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>middleweight even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could they possibly even fight like him?</v>

147
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Or is that a gravity thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is part of what's going on with</v>

148
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he's so light,</v>

149
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>like he can move faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got like more options as far as</v>

150
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.933
<v Speaker 1>equity can do.</v>

151
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Some people are blessed with a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>integrated in their body such as like a</v>

152
00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:04.590
<v Speaker 2>neutral spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have like lumbar</v>

153
00:06:04.591 --> 00:06:07.140
<v Speaker 2>problems in neutral spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever watched mayweather.</v>

154
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.330
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't ever see him lean and he's</v>

155
00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:13.230
<v Speaker 2>just always in constantly good posture</v>
<v Speaker 2>and good position and just like in</v>

156
00:06:13.231 --> 00:06:14.670
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in good position,</v>

157
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.990
<v Speaker 2>more than likely you're going to win the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

158
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Mighty mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just has that type of movement and</v>

159
00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:21.060
<v Speaker 2>integrate his whole body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas body moves as one,</v>

160
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.730
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work against them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a like a lot of rattle and</v>

161
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:25.140
<v Speaker 2>his body safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He throws a kick,</v>

162
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.450
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't land awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't it,</v>

163
00:06:27.451 --> 00:06:30.180
<v Speaker 2>it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes right back to a neutral base and</v>

164
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:34.050
<v Speaker 2>he's able to laterally move and</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly have his body working for</v>

165
00:06:34.051 --> 00:06:35.760
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think him naturally,</v>

166
00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 2>he just has that type of gifts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits of his body.</v>

167
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.410
<v Speaker 2>He's able to integrate his body to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>as one.</v>

168
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Therefore you don't waste a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

169
00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:46.890
<v Speaker 2>He has really fluid movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at a guy like Anderson Silva.</v>

170
00:06:46.891 --> 00:06:49.870
<v Speaker 2>He's able to beat people just by keeping</v>
<v Speaker 2>his range and,</v>

171
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.780
<v Speaker 2>and just his movement of his body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't,</v>

172
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.990
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't swing like a Mark Hunt or or</v>
<v Speaker 2>me where you know,</v>

173
00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:57.210
<v Speaker 2>like I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll throw a lot of powers and normally</v>

174
00:06:57.211 --> 00:06:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I miss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to reach them,</v>

176
00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but them guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just use fluid movement and that's,</v>

177
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.520
<v Speaker 2>I think some people are just blessed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that integrated in their body in a</v>

178
00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:07.740
<v Speaker 2>good neutral spine and a good solid</v>
<v Speaker 2>base.</v>

179
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they're able to connect</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their shots a lot more.</v>

180
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.730
<v Speaker 2>It's as convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnected,</v>

181
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:12.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

182
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.270
<v Speaker 2>say like a short circuit if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's like a small,</v>

183
00:07:15.271 --> 00:07:17.370
<v Speaker 2>like little detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this cord right here,</v>

184
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:20.340
<v Speaker 2>say it's like it's like broken and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting the full amount of</v>

185
00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 2>energy as where if you have a solid base</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a good good spine,</v>

186
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:25.380
<v Speaker 2>you know how to integrate your body to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use as one,</v>

187
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.420
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a lot more of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sturdier connection and more flow.</v>

188
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Fluid movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you brought that up because</v>

190
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought that about like</v>

191
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that efficiency is very important.</v>

192
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And there are fighters that you see like</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasted movement or lot of slop into the</v>

193
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>way they execute techniques and even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have power,</v>

194
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so awkward with the way they do</v>

195
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to think that there's a</v>

196
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>lot of waste as far as like the energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>expenditure.</v>

197
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think that that is a,</v>

198
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 1>you said blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think that that's a natural</v>

199
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 1>ability?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

200
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.550
<v Speaker 2>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it occurs that some people are</v>

201
00:07:59.551 --> 00:08:02.250
<v Speaker 2>able to integrate their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ever just look up people's</v>

202
00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 2>postures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just kinda the they'll</v>

203
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.050
<v Speaker 2>slouch will kind of bend over</v>

204
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.860
<v Speaker 1>posture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this thing is kind of actually is</v>

205
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.620
<v Speaker 1>it popping out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always does that.</v>

206
00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:12.030
<v Speaker 1>We got a tape that down Jamie</v>

207
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 2>and you know that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

208
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of wasted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of wasted movement as some people</v>

209
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>are just more integrated with their body</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they are a lot more efficient,</v>

210
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted then you do,</v>

211
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 2>you've got to have the skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cardio and everything else.</v>

212
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:25.200
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like if you have a good one</v>

213
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.550
<v Speaker 1>base and plus with the fight skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you're going to be a lot</v>

214
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:32.760
<v Speaker 1>more efficient and probably have</v>
<v Speaker 1>longevity in your career as well with</v>

215
00:08:32.761 --> 00:08:35.670
<v Speaker 1>injuries and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's from childhood?</v>

216
00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I've always wondered like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>some children that start off doing like</v>

217
00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:44.631
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics or there's been a lot of guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Jujitsu that have got into it that</v>

218
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:47.340
<v Speaker 1>come from break dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was kind of interesting.</v>

219
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Is a real recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen a lot of guys,</v>

220
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.060
<v Speaker 1>but that ability to minute to move your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body like at a young age,</v>

221
00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 1>you develop like a real sense</v>

222
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 2>of I want to add just coordination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 2>the just dexterity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many different attributes that you</v>

224
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 2>develop when you're young and then your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body grows into it.</v>

225
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an intuition,</v>

226
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you feel it.</v>

227
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work with a,</v>

228
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 2>like a movement guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>functional patterns for the long time</v>

229
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:17.600
<v Speaker 2>and I learned how to integrate my body</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to not waste movement in,</v>

230
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.391
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

231
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 2>to activate my core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my glutes,</v>

232
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 2>my growing all the way to my feet being</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my toes.</v>

233
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 2>If you ever notice people walk like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>duck footed and stuff like that,</v>

234

<v Speaker 2>dysfunction.</v>

240

<v Speaker 2>You may not even know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

<v Speaker 2>my body.</v>

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 2>And this helps out with posture and</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing.</v>

247
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice man Hoff says lot of stuff about</v>

248
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:56.900

<v Speaker 2>that's a controversial subject,</v>

263
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movement coaches,</v>

264
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.360
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot of people that get</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved with movement coaches and some</v>

265
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 2>people mock it and some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

266
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 2>you should just be spending that time</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on your fight training and your</v>

267
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:36.090
<v Speaker 2>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

268
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:39.060
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your skill set and then just do cardio</v>

269
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:41.180
<v Speaker 2>and explosive exercises and then some</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

270
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.430
<v Speaker 2>that's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

272
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 2>the ability to move efficiently in odd</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways and carrier balance.</v>

273
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Now your guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it's a functional patterns.</v>

274
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:53.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

275
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:53.641
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

276
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:54.061
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

277
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 2>McConnell McGregor has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing a lot of stuff with movement</v>

278
00:10:56.821 --> 00:10:57.451
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:10:57.451 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

280
00:10:58.501 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Ido,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ido portal,</v>

281
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.070
<v Speaker 2>that guy's a freak if you ever seen a</v>
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

282
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's what he lacks.</v>

283
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 2>He lacks a integrating your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't understand the integration</v>

284
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 2>part as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a naughty aguilar with functional</v>

285
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He teaches you how to kind of just sit</v>

286
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 2>still integrating your body and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold these positions where I'm just</v>

287
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:19.510
<v Speaker 2>standing still or all my toes without a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

288
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 2>a lumbar extension or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

289
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:22.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if uh,</v>

290
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.770
<v Speaker 2>if I'm slouching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

291
00:11:23.771 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he keeps a neutral spine throughout his</v>

292
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:28.890
<v Speaker 2>whole movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's using his body as one and he has</v>

293
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more of an integrated</v>
<v Speaker 2>system as compared to just no one who</v>

294
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.080
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even having to have a base and then just</v>

295
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:37.680
<v Speaker 2>go into this movement and you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all wrong while you have in Lombard</v>

296
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:40.730
<v Speaker 2>or you're slouching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believes in integrating that</v>

297
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.750
<v Speaker 2>techniques or your body works like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

298
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:45.090
<v Speaker 2>more efficiently instead of working</v>
<v Speaker 2>against you.</v>

299
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think the Connor's doing it</v>

300
00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:47.080
<v Speaker 2>wrong?</v>

301
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What leads you to think that just,</v>

302
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just by his posture,</v>

303
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 2>you can watch his posture or watch his</v>
<v Speaker 2>knee if his knee goes over his toe in</v>

304
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 2>like a certain movement or he has like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lumberyard and a spine as compared to if</v>

305
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 2>you watch like a Naughty Aguilar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll teach you how to do that same type</v>

306
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 2>of movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'll see the little minor details</v>

307
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

308
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 2>in little millimeters of a difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

309
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 2>that makes you integrated your body so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your glutes are working with your,</v>

310
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 2>with your core as you walk in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We walk into everybody just does these</v>

311
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:17.014
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

312
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 2>dead lifts and it's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good rotate.</v>

313
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>As as humans we rotate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we walk,</v>

314
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fighting.</v>

315
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 2>We move and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he integrates everything as far as your</v>

316
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:29.040
<v Speaker 2>core to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're growing to your,</v>

317
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.190
<v Speaker 2>to being on your power to tow so that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep saying that power to like two toes.</v>

318
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.180
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 2>like say how you punched on like your</v>
<v Speaker 2>main two fingers.</v>

320
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.120
<v Speaker 2>The two knuckles that are index finger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the finger,</v>

321
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

322
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.780
<v Speaker 2>And you know how you have like arches on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your feet and you're kind of walking</v>

323
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at my hands and you're walking like</v>

324
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 2>that on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then if I'm walking on the outside,</v>

325
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 2>my knees like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say this,</v>

326
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:51.250
<v Speaker 2>this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm integrating everything up to</v>

327
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 2>my growing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my glutes activated.</v>

328
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:54.990
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm walking on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your knee's gonna,</v>

329
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.790
<v Speaker 2>your knee's gonna your outer part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your knee is going to be taken more of</v>

330
00:12:57.791 --> 00:12:58.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

331
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 2>the load and the damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 2>then you're not integrating or growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how people end up actually.</v>

333
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Is this the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is him.</v>

334
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Functional patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>functional patterns.</v>

335
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.620

336
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.420

<v Speaker 2>He knows a little bit about everything</v>

338
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:16.120
<v Speaker 2>and and right here you notice like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really have any lumbar</v>

339
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 2>extension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a lower back thing.</v>

340
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Everything is really integrated and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>minor details in the corps and he's not</v>

341
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:24.200
<v Speaker 2>shrugging his shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

342
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.900
<v Speaker 2>he's using fluid movement and everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he does is rotational.</v>

350
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 2>once he was able to fix my base I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to start moving and getting into</v>

351
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 2>movements like this.</v>

352
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.620
<v Speaker 2>So what we're looking at folks for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks that are just listening is this</v>

353
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:04.621
<v Speaker 2>guy doing all this crazy movements with</v>
<v Speaker 2>kettlebells and dumbbells and jumping</v>

354
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:09.370
<v Speaker 2>around back and forth and see what all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these flips through the air right now.</v>

355
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting stuff though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can land and they don't,</v>

356
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.650
<v Speaker 2>they don't go out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

357
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 2>they don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have watched a idol.</v>

358
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I think that's his name and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just these little details that</v>

359
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:23.710
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have that he has that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>integrates.</v>

360
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Whereas knees don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his knees don't sway out.</v>

361
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Like everything is seriously in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>functional pattern.</v>

362
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Like everything he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't muscle anything to where like</v>

363
00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:33.131
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're lifting.</v>

364
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Everything is a fluid movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's allowing the swing,</v>

365
00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:38.650
<v Speaker 2>almost like a cheat to allow your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>to rotate.</v>

366
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:39.161
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

367
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:40.450
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

368
00:14:40.451 --> 00:14:41.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really changed my life,</v>

369
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work working with this guy and the</v>

370
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:45.310
<v Speaker 2>things that I've learned and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

371
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:45.970
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

372
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 2>the deficiencies in my body that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>really wasn't aware of back then that</v>

373
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm working with and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've</v>

374
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 3>been fighting for a long time and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been able to keep healthy and</v>

375
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 3>injury free by doing a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>movements,</v>

376
00:14:57.411 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 3>myofascial release and working on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>posture.</v>

377
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

378
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 3>people who are doing sprints at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know your nervous system is still</v>

379
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 3>in like a fight or flight mode and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't fall asleep,</v>

380
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such things as breathing to help that</v>

381
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:12.110
<v Speaker 3>out too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've been here with iceman and</v>

382
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.180
<v Speaker 3>hear his stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean breathing's huge.</v>

383
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:16.130
<v Speaker 3>So I've learned a lot through this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

384
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:20.390
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying is that doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>sprints at night is not a good idea.</v>

385
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

386
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 3>but I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

387
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 3>if you figured out a little calmer self</v>
<v Speaker 3>doubt and that's breathing,</v>

388
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:25.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are like,</v>

389
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:27.680
<v Speaker 3>man I can't sleep at night but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I ran,</v>

390
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like okay,</v>

391
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 3>well you can do that by breathing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kind of calming your nervous system</v>

392
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:33.920
<v Speaker 3>down so that you can get that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that recovery,</v>

393
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 3>because if not you fall asleep.</v>

394
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Your body still thinks it's in fight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>flight mode and that they're still</v>

395
00:15:38.121 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 3>sprinting as where you're able.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're able to breathe,</v>

396
00:15:41.061 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 3>calm yourself down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get better sleep,</v>

397
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 3>better rest recovery and the hormones</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to take over your body and</v>

398
00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 3>repair it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I think about these things is</v>

399
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 3>obviously this guy's very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the way he's moving.</v>

400
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:55.310
<v Speaker 3>He's obviously very athletic and very</v>
<v Speaker 3>coordinated and you see when he throws</v>

401
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 3>punches and kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's obviously had some martial arts</v>

402
00:15:57.561 --> 00:16:00.830
<v Speaker 3>background as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some of these guys though.</v>

403
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 3>I equate it to yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of real yoga people out</v>

404
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:09.110
<v Speaker 3>there that are really good at yoga and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are dedicated to it and it's super</v>

405
00:16:09.111 --> 00:16:12.770
<v Speaker 3>important to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the fuckers that are</v>

406
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 3>fuckery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just fake spiritual people and</v>

407
00:16:17.301 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 3>they talk a lot of the yoga nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're really just fucking Weirdos.</v>

408
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.650
<v Speaker 3>And I see that a lot in these movement</v>
<v Speaker 3>coaches too.</v>

409
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Like I've talked to a few of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

410
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.871
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

411
00:16:26.871 --> 00:16:28.910
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smelled fuckery.</v>

412
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.210
<v Speaker 3>If something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something going on,</v>

413
00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 3>like there's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird Gig,</v>

416
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:36.880

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

417

<v Speaker 3>I went with him with pain management and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it got into correctional exercises.</v>

00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 3>forum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been the underground</v>

465
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:32.850
<v Speaker 3>where someone was talking about lifting</v>
<v Speaker 3>weights and a how all their bad sparring</v>

466
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:34.380
<v Speaker 3>sessions come after lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

467
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.214
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duh,</v>

468
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:38.000
<v Speaker 3>like you probably shouldn't be sparring</v>
<v Speaker 3>after you lift a.</v>

469
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:42.660
<v Speaker 3>like these dudes are talking about doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>like mega squats and deadlifts and power</v>

470
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:45.750
<v Speaker 3>benching and then trying to stay loose</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fluid.</v>

471
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>

472
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.890
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your tissues all broken down and you're</v>

473
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:53.700
<v Speaker 3>exhausted and it's really a bad idea to</v>
<v Speaker 3>spar when you're like that because then</v>

474
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

475
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:56.170
<v Speaker 3>what about mental toughness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't here.</v>

476
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.440
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body's all fucked up.</v>

477
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:01.800
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be resting or if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing anything he should be doing</v>

478
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.620
<v Speaker 3>like light drilling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something where you're forced to</v>

479
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:06.050
<v Speaker 3>react quickly and move.</v>

480
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to get injured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

481
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

482
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do that all the time.</v>

483
00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:13.410
<v Speaker 3>You hear about these guys getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>injured all the time and you know,</v>

484
00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:16.320
<v Speaker 3>just being self sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning about little stuff like this</v>

485
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.400
<v Speaker 3>because it could help you out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

486
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.910
<v Speaker 3>such as thing as just a little bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>foam rolling out and then a little bit</v>

487
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:23.730
<v Speaker 3>of correctional exercises that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>just help you out a lot more</v>

488
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 3>efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no.</v>

489
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've gotten in arguments where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've went out to Arizona to see some of</v>

490
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:31.080
<v Speaker 3>my friends that ended up leaving</v>
<v Speaker 3>alliance and I,</v>

491
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got into an argument a little bit like</v>

492
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Speaker 3>a battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is like trying to tell me to,</v>

493
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I need a my base to do this and I'm like</v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing a fight that I'm going to be,</v>

494
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 feet.</v>

495
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.690
<v Speaker 3>My feet are this far apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

496
00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 3>no bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I got to be within,</v>

497
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be able to rotate,</v>

498
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:47.401
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

499
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:48.980
<v Speaker 3>with if I'm spreading my legs out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

500
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.700
<v Speaker 3>that ain't doing nothing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've,</v>

501
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.920
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see a lot of people doing a lot of</v>

502
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:54.210
<v Speaker 3>meatheads stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

503
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.870
<v Speaker 3>this isn't an interesting because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>

504
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.940
<v Speaker 3>it's a kind of an open ended thing when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fighter because I see these</v>

505
00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 3>guys trying all this different stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no right or wrong way.</v>

506
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Like here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's Robbie lawler who's a world</v>

507
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 3>champion bad motherfucker and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's Stephen Wonderboy Thompson.</v>

508
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Totally different stance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean totally different way of moving.</v>

509
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Both guys super successful and who</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking knows what would happen if they</v>

510
00:20:22.561 --> 00:20:24.570
<v Speaker 3>fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really don't know until they fight,</v>

511
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:25.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

512
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.510
<v Speaker 3>But if wonderboy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt Robbins like,</v>

513
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it all wrong.</v>

514
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

515
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:30.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's trying to coach him,</v>

516
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:32.670
<v Speaker 3>but obviously he's not doing it all</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

517
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.340
<v Speaker 3>He's a world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing it all wrong.</v>

518
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.990
<v Speaker 3>He's doing it perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is it the best way?</v>

519
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately you don't know and you won't</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever know until those two guys go at it.</v>

520
00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 3>And here's what's even crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might</v>

521
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.390
<v Speaker 1>beat wonderboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy might be able to beat a guy</v>

522
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 1>that can beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

523
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I lived that life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

524
00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

525
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:01.620
<v Speaker 1>It is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The home,</v>

526
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.300
<v Speaker 1>we're just watching Holly Holm and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>like shift change.</v>

527
00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 1>She gets beat by mistake and then she'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat Ronda Rousey type deal.</v>

528
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:08.681
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

529
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda Rousey fought the perfect fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>for holly,</v>

530
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>like charging adder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Holly's a great counter striker</v>

531
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.300
<v Speaker 1>where it shift Chenko.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watched that fight,</v>

532
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.570
<v Speaker 1>she did not lead at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just hung back and waited and</v>

533
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.900
<v Speaker 1>enforced highly into her game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

534
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.210
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.340
<v Speaker 1>it was just a bad night for holly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she'll be back.</v>

536
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting tactically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

537
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at it from a strategic</v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint,</v>

538
00:21:32.831 --> 00:21:36.600
<v Speaker 1>like utilizing your skills to the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your ability in,</v>

539
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're inside the octagon and</v>

540
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what about what you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>matches really good against what she</v>

541
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:43.720
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

542
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 1>And Shevchenko just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She figured it out.</v>

543
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy man.</v>

544
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:49.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the fight game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the fight game.</v>

545
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy game man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

546
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting you see people jumping</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one trailer to the other and just</v>

547
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:57.880
<v Speaker 1>looking for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost like you've got a</v>

548
00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:00.700
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're playing musical chairs.</v>

549
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So like how much do you got into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>career?</v>

550
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:06.610
<v Speaker 1>You've got maybe like a good solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really take care of yourself,</v>

551
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:11.611
<v Speaker 1>you've got like 15 years unless you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson is abandoned too and he's</v>

552
00:22:11.771 --> 00:22:14.680
<v Speaker 1>fighting for the fucking title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna fight bisbing for the title</v>

553
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 1>in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be madness.</v>

554
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.470
<v Speaker 1>And he says if he wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna Retire Dawn.</v>

555
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.760
<v Speaker 1>He should drop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk away,</v>

556
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 1>carry out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that he hasn't been able</v>

557
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:26.890
<v Speaker 1>to do is win the UFC gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look man,</v>

558
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.710
<v Speaker 1>he's got as good a shot as anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched that Lombard fight.</v>

559
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he won,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Does it said smoke that Cuban.</v>

569
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

570
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:51.730
<v Speaker 1>that was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

571
00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean Lombard's is scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

572
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.610

575
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henderson heard him first.</v>

576
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Henderson heard him first and he moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in for the kill,</v>

577
00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:04.840
<v Speaker 1>but Lombard wasn't done and Lombard</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracked him in Lombard had them on the</v>

<v Speaker 1>Seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

624
00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

<v Speaker 1>audits and always,</v>

632
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.000
<v Speaker 1>always getting after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

633
00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe after I retired from fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna get on the juice and just</v>

634
00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:03.731
<v Speaker 1>look like that as get back each class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do fucking strong man competitions.</v>

635
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Ankle locks all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carry cars and shit.</v>

636
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever get caught on your car?</v>

637
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Paul Harris might be the guy that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want right there.</v>

638
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.750
<v Speaker 1>He's ridiculously big right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

639
00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:17.090
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent for sure.</v>

640
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.370
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't gain that much weight.</v>

641
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean the last time he fought was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year ago and he was fighting in one 70</v>

642
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.620
<v Speaker 1>now and now.</v>

643
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously a lot of guys would</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight at one 72.</v>

644
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Really weigh the one nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around there and then they cut</v>

645
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:34.060
<v Speaker 1>weight to get down to one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is just gigantic and do this.</v>

646
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.120
<v Speaker 1>That's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

647
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.280
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking awesome Jujitsu player</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

648
00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:41.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not just strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some serious legit technique.</v>

649
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.310
<v Speaker 1>My uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where my guy who gave him a purple belt,</v>

650
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Dean lister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

652
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.830
<v Speaker 1>he's been still going out and competing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he just lost everything.</v>

653
00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:51.050
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just outstanding deeds.</v>

654
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.540
<v Speaker 1>He's very good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big dude,</v>

655
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:57.320
<v Speaker 1>but he rolls like a little guy and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just freakishly strong man.</v>

656
00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very smart dean.</v>

657
00:25:59.111 --> 00:26:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Knows a lot about Jujitsu and he's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why,</v>

658
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole John Danaher,</v>

659
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Henzel Gracie team got so good at leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>locks.</v>

660
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.230
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that was the influence of Dean</v>
<v Speaker 1>lister.</v>

661
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Dean lister went down there and did some</v>
<v Speaker 1>training with them and dean has been a</v>

662
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 1>leg lock master from the old days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was one of those guys that was</v>

663
00:26:16.761 --> 00:26:19.370
<v Speaker 1>leg locking people in the early days of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abu Dhabi.</v>

664
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in the early two thousands.</v>

665
00:26:21.361 --> 00:26:24.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people like the leg lock game has</v>

666
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:27.680
<v Speaker 1>shifted over the last few years and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>become incredibly dominant.</v>

667
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:32.390
<v Speaker 1>There's so many guys that are winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jujitsu has become a largely like a</v>

668
00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:35.480
<v Speaker 1>game of like 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more percent leg locks.</v>

669
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Especially no gate like Eddie Commons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Tonin,</v>

670
00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:43.650
<v Speaker 1>all these guys from John Donohue camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many guys down down there</v>

671
00:26:43.651 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 1>that are just really talented at</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking legs and not a lot of people</v>

672
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:49.340
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sophisticated.</v>

673
00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you start playing with the legs,</v>

674
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:51.744
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>

675
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

676
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Nobody likes getting crippled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

677
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.960
<v Speaker 1>like Eddie Bravo had a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

678
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.441
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

679
00:26:58.441 --> 00:27:00.120
<v Speaker 1>is it okay if someone yanks on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>neck?</v>

680
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay if someone breaks your arm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's.</v>

681
00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just got to tap before you get</v>

682
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.400
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

683
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Which is easier said than done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Harris is on there.</v>

684
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.650
<v Speaker 1>You tap all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

685
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 1>he is tearing people's knees apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

686
00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:15.870
<v Speaker 1>This kind of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

687
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely bullshit when people</v>

688
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:19.860
<v Speaker 1>tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is definitely bullshit.</v>

689
00:27:19.861 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 1>When people tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's anything that</v>

690
00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:24.300
<v Speaker 1>should be changed about the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules?</v>

691
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at MMA rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they stand right now,</v>

692
00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Speaker 1>like there's some people that think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

693
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.710
<v Speaker 1>knees on the ground issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

694
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.720
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know the story of MMA has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rule where you can need someone to the</v>

695
00:27:38.251 --> 00:27:43.050
<v Speaker 1>head if they're standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they put one hand on the ground,</v>

696
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't name in the hat.</v>

697
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.030
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of guys will put a hand on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground just to stop the knee and then</v>

698
00:27:48.031 --> 00:27:50.550
<v Speaker 1>the lift that up and put it down like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they play like a little,</v>

699
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 1>like almost like a game of like now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm safe.</v>

700
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding.</v>

701
00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Remember like old school wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could hold onto the rope and they</v>

702
00:27:57.571 --> 00:27:58.980
<v Speaker 1>would let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let go of a whole.</v>

703
00:27:58.981 --> 00:27:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

704
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:00.403
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

705
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 counts stuff like all that.</v>

706
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they have that in like pancrase</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where in pancreas if someone was hold</v>

707
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 1>onto a submission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could grab the rope and they would</v>

708
00:28:09.661 --> 00:28:11.030
<v Speaker 1>let go of a submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

709
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I've never really watched too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>pancrase fucking feel like that was a</v>

710
00:28:14.761 --> 00:28:16.480
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rope.</v>

711
00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Like oh I'm safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm safe.</v>

712
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It was something about that where if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed a hold of the ropes,</v>

713
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 1>they had to let go.</v>

714
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:25.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's A.</v>

715
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

716
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I actually just watched the fights over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weekend.</v>

717
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Darren Elkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

718
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.270
<v Speaker 2>he just got need heart in the temple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't me as a fucking illegal,</v>

719
00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.720
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy punches him after and</v>

720
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:37.980
<v Speaker 2>he falls down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

721
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.360
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was illegal knee.</v>

722
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.381
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

723
00:28:40.381 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 2>he just shakes it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes back and ends up beating the guy.</v>

724
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.760
<v Speaker 2>But as an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

725
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:45.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking hand on.</v>

726
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.260
<v Speaker 2>I fought that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

727
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.840
<v Speaker 2>he's a tough dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's took,</v>

728
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.990
<v Speaker 2>takes shots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

729
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.920
<v Speaker 2>tough as nails and coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

730
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like you hit him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a Chris leave and he just gets</v>

731
00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 2>more fired up and keeps coming at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

732
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:56.880
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

733
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.430
<v Speaker 2>as far as those rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's kind of fair.</v>

734
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless,</v>

735
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think UFC Fox wants to see</v>

736
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:05.220
<v Speaker 2>people getting head stomped and in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>prior roles,</v>

737
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:05.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

738
00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:07.560
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all them guys were juicing over there so</v>

739
00:29:07.561 --> 00:29:09.840
<v Speaker 2>they're just taking people down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was the case,</v>

740
00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I just go juice uptake people down into</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start soccer,</v>

741
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:13.560
<v Speaker 2>kicking people all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

742
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:14.940
<v Speaker 2>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

743
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Imagine somebody standing over you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're just like,</v>

744
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is trying to stop me out.</v>

745
00:29:19.531 --> 00:29:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

746
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a scary thought to be thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I don't even want to be</v>

747
00:29:23.071 --> 00:29:24.080
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

748
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.930
<v Speaker 1>think that if it was legal that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't think that way.</v>

749
00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of all the stuff that you can do</v>

750
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.280
<v Speaker 1>inside the octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

751
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.760
<v Speaker 1>think of all the techniques that you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>land like,</v>

752
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that knee that you landed on Dennis</v>

753
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Bermudez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about as powerful and knee as you</v>

754
00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:40.550
<v Speaker 1>get hit a dude with on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up.</v>

755
00:29:40.551 --> 00:29:41.790
<v Speaker 1>No matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

756
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.790
<v Speaker 1>that's a goddamn perfect knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You land on it and that was pretty</v>

757
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:47.250
<v Speaker 1>fucking spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

758
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 1>But if that wasn't legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

759
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 1>and then you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody be like,</v>

760
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't be legal.</v>

761
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Like perfect example is a Cyborg Santos</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Page.</v>

762
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Michael Page hit Cyborg Santos with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice so hard that he fractured his</v>

763
00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:07.300
<v Speaker 1>skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His skull caved in and the fucking Mris</v>

764
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:10.090
<v Speaker 1>are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that in all my years of</v>

765
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:13.390
<v Speaker 1>watching fights and being involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts.</v>

766
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody's head caved in.</v>

767
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

768
00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.701
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

769
00:30:16.701 --> 00:30:17.910
<v Speaker 3>that's unfortunate man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

770
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:18.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

771
00:30:18.891 --> 00:30:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I can imagine some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some trauma and some injuries and you</v>

772
00:30:21.021 --> 00:30:21.800
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

773
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.760
<v Speaker 3>I seen sideboard was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

774
00:30:22.761 --> 00:30:24.380
<v Speaker 3>it'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be fine in three months.</v>

775
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you bro.</v>

776
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

777
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.420
<v Speaker 3>No dude like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the skull.</v>

778
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.020
<v Speaker 3>That's escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>

779
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.540
<v Speaker 3>That is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

780
00:30:32.541 --> 00:30:35.510
<v Speaker 3>reminds me of that movie concussion with</v>
<v Speaker 3>will Smith and he's talking about the</v>

781
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.540
<v Speaker 3>football players that are taking these</v>
<v Speaker 3>type of injuries,</v>

782
00:30:38.541 --> 00:30:39.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

783
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.790
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bad man.</v>

784
00:30:40.791 --> 00:30:41.810
<v Speaker 3>This whole fucking skulls.</v>

785
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that.</v>

786
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.880
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

787
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I thought that that area was so hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the area where I,</v>

788
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess like a lot of people break their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

789
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.340
<v Speaker 1>their hand right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really break it on that area.</v>

790
00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean a,</v>

791
00:30:58.771 --> 00:30:59.920
<v Speaker 3>a knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

792
00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:02.080
<v Speaker 3>And you're kind of coming into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is,</v>

793
00:31:02.081 --> 00:31:04.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was moving into it and it was really</v>

794
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.890
<v Speaker 3>just a perfect storm like him moving in</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the take down Michael Page,</v>

795
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 3>leaping up at him and he's a bony dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

796
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:12.980
<v Speaker 3>he's a tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bony dude.</v>

797
00:31:12.981 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 3>So that there's really not a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter muscle that's going to hide that</v>

798
00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:18.480
<v Speaker 3>knee and it's all bone on that dude's</v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

799
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a nasty.</v>

800
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.490
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Congrats to that guy.</v>

801
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:22.470
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty sick.</v>

802
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 3>That guy's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to see that guy in the UFC?</v>

803
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You break dance and shit.</v>

804
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he's just,</v>

805
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 3>he was a point karate guy for a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and I've always said that there's</v>

806
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:34.720
<v Speaker 3>something about that ability to just</v>
<v Speaker 3>jump in real quick and get the fuck out</v>

807
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:38.170
<v Speaker 3>of there that these point karate guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>have their range is way different than</v>

808
00:31:38.171 --> 00:31:40.510
<v Speaker 3>like a boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of interesting that you</v>

809
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.980
<v Speaker 3>mentioned rob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you ever watched Robbie,</v>

810
00:31:42.981 --> 00:31:45.670
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets in that boxing range that way if</v>

811
00:31:45.671 --> 00:31:47.230
<v Speaker 3>you throw a kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's throwing hands.</v>

812
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

813
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 3>a wonder boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know he,</v>

814
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.300
<v Speaker 3>he's a tall rangy dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he keeps,</v>

815
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.130
<v Speaker 3>they keep that distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

816
00:31:54.131 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 3>you're a karate guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that range is a lot different than a</v>

817
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Moitai or a boxing and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>

818
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 3>they're able to move really a</v>
<v Speaker 3>skillfully.</v>

819
00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point karate guys in particular,</v>

820
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the next stage of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elite fighters are the,</v>

821
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.600
<v Speaker 1>like the background they come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen guys that are successful that</v>

822
00:32:11.601 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 1>come from Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen guys that are successful that</v>

823
00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:17.000
<v Speaker 1>come from wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that point karate is going</v>

824
00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:22.001
<v Speaker 1>to be the next stage because these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>like page and Raymond Daniels who fights</v>

825
00:32:22.581 --> 00:32:23.730
<v Speaker 1>out of glory days</v>

826
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.010
<v Speaker 3>are Rodriguez and my buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my buddy Justin Lawrence is like that</v>

827
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.670
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable karate background and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fast and nasty and he keeps that</v>

828
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.040
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird little Joe Rogan sidekicks or</v>

829
00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.870
<v Speaker 3>scoggins who's fighting this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fighting Ian Mccall this weekend.</v>

830
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.943
<v Speaker 3>Always find.</v>

831
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 1>That'd be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

832
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Scoggins is something too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

833
00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 1>He's got that crazy style too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got wrestling as well.</v>

834
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:47.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

835
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I first seen that guy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is good.</v>

836
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Good Cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good wrestling.</v>

837
00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I think if that guy just shows up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right mindset,</v>

838
00:32:52.551 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be one of the top guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a young kid to a young kid.</v>

839
00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I think he's only 25 or 26 and super</v>
<v Speaker 1>technical like his.</v>

840
00:32:59.771 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 1>His karate especially like he's got that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide stance moves in and out real quick.</v>

841
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what's real hard to deal with men</v>
<v Speaker 1>because these karate style like where</v>

842
00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:13.310
<v Speaker 1>they jump in and they're used to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaping in and then they tag each other</v>

843
00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 1>and get the fuck out of there quick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they score a point and then</v>

844
00:33:15.951 --> 00:33:19.130
<v Speaker 1>everything stops and so they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have,</v>

845
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:22.340
<v Speaker 1>like in their sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have to have the kind of</v>

846
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:25.970
<v Speaker 1>endurance that you would need to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>try doing that at a Thai fight.</v>

847
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 1>The ties are going to kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your legs are going,</v>

848
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:31.880
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about it is that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys have developed this incredible</v>

849
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:33.800
<v Speaker 1>ability to close distance really</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

850
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Then they pick up all the other skills</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

851
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.550
<v Speaker 1>but everybody else has to play catch up</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that one thing that they can do the</v>

852
00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.500
<v Speaker 1>leaping in and close the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

853
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.770
<v Speaker 1>and you get a guy like pages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously a gifted athlete has been</v>

854
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 1>doing it his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

855
00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:49.940
<v Speaker 1>he started martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think something before it was five</v>

856
00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:53.730
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's got years and years of</v>

857
00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:57.380
<v Speaker 1>experience plus his body kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed like we were talking about</v>

858
00:33:57.381 --> 00:34:00.140
<v Speaker 1>people that started early with</v>
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics or with break dancing.</v>

859
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.420
<v Speaker 1>His body developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaping in,</v>

860
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.800
<v Speaker 1>throwing kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaping in,</v>

861
00:34:03.801 --> 00:34:06.260
<v Speaker 1>throwing punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some sick dance moves,</v>

862
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's always on rhythm.</v>

863
00:34:07.641 --> 00:34:08.474
<v Speaker 1>So you can't.</v>

864
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.520
<v Speaker 1>He's always on rhythm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

865
00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.051
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

866
00:34:11.051 --> 00:34:13.190
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is interesting.</v>

867
00:34:13.191 --> 00:34:14.510
<v Speaker 1>CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to see that guy in the</v>

868
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:15.180
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

869
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to see a lot of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

870
00:34:17.421 --> 00:34:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Raymond Daniels as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a,</v>

871
00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a great karate match where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of them,</v>

872
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought in a point karate match,</v>

873
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.230
<v Speaker 1>but he took a look at him here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch what page can do like that.</v>

874
00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.690
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's hilarious too.</v>

875
00:34:31.691 --> 00:34:35.450
<v Speaker 1>He just stands there and looks off in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distance as the referee stopped the</v>

876
00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:38.810
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously until he fought cyborg.</v>

877
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting people that have really no</v>
<v Speaker 1>business being in there with A.</v>

878
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on the Cyborg.</v>

879
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Took him down though in that first round</v>
<v Speaker 1>and presented some real problems,</v>

880
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.940
<v Speaker 1>but look at his distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May Look at that.</v>

881
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:54.230
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at his ability to fucking leap</v>

882
00:34:54.231 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as also his ability to get the fuck</v>

883
00:34:56.691 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

884
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.520
<v Speaker 1>It tax off of his back to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He even won by foot lock.</v>

885
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:06.470
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker's got arm bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just mean that a style of a Roy Jones</v>

886
00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:08.050
<v Speaker 1>used to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he would just do that weird.</v>

887
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Let me just real athletic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly where Roy Jones was one of the</v>

888
00:35:12.801 --> 00:35:15.250
<v Speaker 1>greatest boxers of all time and didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really use it.</v>

889
00:35:15.251 --> 00:35:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Jab instead of used a leaping rep took</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up leaping left hook.</v>

890
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Well he used the left Hook in place of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jab,</v>

891
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but you look like pages got crazy shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that right there.</v>

892
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.920
<v Speaker 1>His ability to close the distance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how quickly it gets out of dodge.</v>

893
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.110
<v Speaker 1>He's just so used to that style of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people leaping at him and getting out of</v>

894
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that one too.</v>

895
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

896
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

897
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:45.390
<v Speaker 1>part of me likes the fact that he's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>beltour because I think Bella needs</v>

898
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:48.610
<v Speaker 1>stars because I think UFC needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition and I,</v>

899
00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I liked Scott Coker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked Bella tour,</v>

900
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I liked Jimmy Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that they're doing well</v>

901
00:35:53.431 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 1>and I would like to see like real</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate.</v>

902
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see a real legit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate unification fight,</v>

903
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

904
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Start competing as teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be,</v>

905
00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:03.530
<v Speaker 1>that'd be sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

906
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.620
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>UFC anytime soon or?</v>

908
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:54.480
<v Speaker 1>but for me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just there's too much.</v>

926
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Like if I go to Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's five days out of my life that I</v>

927
00:36:58.411 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 1>can't do this and I can't do all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other stuff that I do.</v>

928
00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that there's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>recovery time.</v>

929
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Like when I come back I'm fucking toast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

930
00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fine just fucks my head.</v>

931
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So I decided to only do per view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more fox.</v>

932
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm cutting down a lot of the events</v>

933
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing at least a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a year by year thing.</v>

934
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.760
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least one more year.</v>

935
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.490
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of fan support and you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

936
00:37:22.491 --> 00:37:23.011
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

937
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:25.140
<v Speaker 1>you probably want to start enjoying life</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit and cut,</v>

938
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.780
<v Speaker 1>cutting down eventually know and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxing and enjoying life a little bit.</v>

939
00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.311
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

940
00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:30.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made me,</v>

941
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tip the other way,</v>

942
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like real convinced that it was</v>

943
00:37:34.591 --> 00:37:35.130
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

944
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to be a fan.</v>

945
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do fight companions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Nate Diaz,</v>

946
00:37:39.181 --> 00:37:43.830
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor fight and Holly Holm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miesha tate fight that night was so</v>

947
00:37:43.831 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 1>crazy and so chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked out of there go,</v>

948
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 1>how could I not do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could I not be like I'm sitting</v>

949
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 1>right there cage side for the craziest</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit in the sporting world ever.</v>

950
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

951
00:37:54.661 --> 00:37:55.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided,</v>

952
00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:57.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was real recent man.</v>

953
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.680
<v Speaker 1>It was touch and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

954
00:37:58.681 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't know what I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

955
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I was one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

956
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next day I'm like,</v>

957
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

958
00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.120
<v Speaker 1>So I think the compromise is do less</v>
<v Speaker 1>events figured out,</v>

959
00:38:09.121 --> 00:38:11.790
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to think that I</v>

960
00:38:11.791 --> 00:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>don't appreciate it or I don't know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky I am or I don't think it's an</v>

961
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 1>amazing job.</v>

962
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I definitely do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just,</v>

963
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost too lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have too many amazing jobs on the road</v>

964
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.240
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of travel and just a lot of</v>

965
00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 1>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of traveling,</v>

966
00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of events and shit.</v>

967
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:30.600
<v Speaker 1>You done seen it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one year was like 23 events.</v>

968
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I was like that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like every other week and they're</v>

969
00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:37.420
<v Speaker 1>gonna get more and more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC is this getting freaking insane,</v>

970
00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:40.210
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the big business deal and a lot of</v>

971
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 1>lot of Shit's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with the steroids.</v>

972
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Mark Hans going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

973
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.140
<v Speaker 1>someone needs to talk to mark man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>give him a call.</v>

974
00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:47.951
<v Speaker 1>Dana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

975
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I feel like someone should have talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to mark immediately and sued that out</v>

976
00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:53.014
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

977
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.420
<v Speaker 1>But here's what I can tell mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If mark is listening,</v>

978
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.020
<v Speaker 1>they tested the shit out of Brock Lesnar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't know.</v>

979
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:01.840
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way they would have known is if</v>

980
00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 1>you told them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you saw tested him.</v>

981
00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:08.830
<v Speaker 1>He tested clean for a bunch of them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he tested positive for the one that</v>

982
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:14.170
<v Speaker 1>was like I think three weeks out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and then there was the other one</v>

983
00:39:14.171 --> 00:39:19.171
<v Speaker 1>that he tested for post fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what was going on.</v>

984
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just speculation,</v>

985
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.240
<v Speaker 1>but it could have been that he was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>really struggling and camp and his a</v>

986
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.700
<v Speaker 1>slick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what he took or allegedly.</v>

987
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took estrogen blockers and the only</v>

988
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:40.381
<v Speaker 1>reason that anybody takes estrogen</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocker on purpose is to restart their</v>

989
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:43.330
<v Speaker 1>testosterone after they do a steroid</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>

990
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:48.480
<v Speaker 1>That's why you take it when you take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>on purpose or unless you have some sort</v>

991
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:51.760
<v Speaker 1>of a biological disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine,</v>

992
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:55.210
<v Speaker 1>where you have some sort of an excess of</v>
<v Speaker 1>estrogen in your body,</v>

993
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:56.770
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know why you would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

994
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor.</v>

995
00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.970
<v Speaker 1>If I need to tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a doctor.</v>

996
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>

997
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what the fuck was going</v>

998
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:05.890
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

999
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 1>With Broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

1000
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Maybe brock was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1001
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm one and done in this bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1002
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.470
<v Speaker 1>just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just gonna make some fucking money.</v>

1003
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.383
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>

1004
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.060
<v Speaker 1>How many weeks do they need to test me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1005
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.770
<v Speaker 1>so we're inside the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

1006
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:19.750
<v Speaker 1>If we test positive after the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we test positive.</v>

1007
00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Like who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knows,</v>

1008
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the third time that's</v>

1009
00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:24.830
<v Speaker 1>happened to Mark Hunt doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1010
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.530
<v Speaker 1>and he's talking about this fighters'</v>
<v Speaker 1>union,</v>

1011
00:40:26.531 --> 00:40:30.870
<v Speaker 1>which makes things very interesting bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the problem with the fighters union</v>

1012
00:40:30.871 --> 00:40:34.360
<v Speaker 1>is fighters have been notoriously single</v>
<v Speaker 1>minded in.</v>

1013
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.910
<v Speaker 1>They think about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be real hard.</v>

1014
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not like baseball players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1015
00:40:38.981 --> 00:40:42.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you could get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's also with baseball players union</v>

1016
00:40:42.971 --> 00:40:45.430
<v Speaker 1>or football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have a team,</v>

1017
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC is the team,</v>

1018
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:50.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not like it's,</v>

1019
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're the elite.</v>

1020
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.253
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1021
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.780
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing like boxing is</v>

1022
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:59.110
<v Speaker 1>not going to have a box or a union</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you're always going to have</v>

1023
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.340
<v Speaker 1>like you have 10 vendors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxers make a shit ton of money doing.</v>

1024
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.530
<v Speaker 1>They do make a shit ton of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that make a shit ton of</v>

1025
00:41:05.531 --> 00:41:07.620
<v Speaker 1>money or the champions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those,</v>

1026
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.110
<v Speaker 1>the high level people in the high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in mma make the same amount of</v>

1027
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:14.320
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real argument is how much money</v>

1028
00:41:14.321 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 1>should the people that are putting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big shows like you,</v>

1029
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 1>the guys who were putting on fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible exciting fights,</v>

1030
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.440
<v Speaker 1>how much should you make the headline of</v>
<v Speaker 1>card?</v>

1031
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I know for me personally for my money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm watching Jeremy Stevens fight,</v>

1032
00:41:28.721 --> 00:41:29.980
<v Speaker 1>conor Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1033
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting out my fucking popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited.</v>

1034
00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying my paper view money for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make that happen.</v>

1035
00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Let's make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40th five.</v>

1036
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to get whooped by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diaz.</v>

1037
00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.800
<v Speaker 1>He thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sodium.</v>

1038
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got whooped the first time,</v>

1039
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:47.570

<v Speaker 1>first round.</v>

1040
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that first round was a big round for</v>

1041

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1077
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:12.080
<v Speaker 1>they could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got rid of it.</v>

1078
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1079
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.430
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't realize when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the sport now and it's gigantic.</v>

1080
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.430
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were first fighting and</v>

1081
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:21.620
<v Speaker 1>competing man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1082
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:23.600
<v Speaker 1>You had to really love what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1083
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.760
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like there was some Ronda</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rousey,</v>

1084
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:27.890
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor pay days that people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

1085
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear about the paydays these</v>

1086
00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:31.760
<v Speaker 1>people are getting now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like John Jones,</v>

1087
00:43:31.761 --> 00:43:35.840
<v Speaker 1>his manager was saying that John missed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out on at least $10,000,000 for his</v>

1088
00:43:35.841 --> 00:43:40.841
<v Speaker 1>fight with Daniel Cormier and then Jon</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anik was saying that over the two years</v>

1089
00:43:40.971 --> 00:43:45.710
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to cost him as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as 30 to $40 million when you factor in</v>

1090
00:43:45.711 --> 00:43:47.990
<v Speaker 1>all the super fights he could have had</v>
<v Speaker 1>in two years,</v>

1091
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.690
<v Speaker 1>which is just fucking crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>manager.</v>

1094
00:43:53.011 --> 00:43:56.900

<v Speaker 3>back off and fade and going to keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

1152
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the true break through break.</v>

1153
00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what I find in running and doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>these long runs and stuff throughout</v>

1154
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:07.490
<v Speaker 3>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a sets a different pace and that</v>

1155
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.620
<v Speaker 3>that is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mental edge that you have from</v>

1156
00:46:10.621 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 3>running and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>

1157
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.550
<v Speaker 3>You almost got to be a madman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you only know that when you actually</v>

1158
00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:21.190
<v Speaker 3>complete that type of a long run and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>endure that type of thing,</v>

1159
00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.790
<v Speaker 3>other everybody else can kind of look</v>
<v Speaker 3>back at me and you're crazy.</v>

1160
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Like we don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you are kind of crazy in your head</v>

1161
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:27.481
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1164
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.320
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put you on another level.</v>

1165
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.570
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things where you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly try to find your limit.</v>

1166
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to hold my breath for a</v>

1167
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:35.790
<v Speaker 3>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm,</v>

1168
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.290
<v Speaker 3>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see if I can do two minutes.</v>

1169
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:38.124

<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1170
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:42.090

<v Speaker 3>And then you start trying for whatever</v>

1171
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:45.210
<v Speaker 3>the fuck the world record is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I have my buddy campaigns,</v>

1174

<v Speaker 3>beliefs.</v>

1182
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.510
<v Speaker 3>Well he's just mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough as it gets.</v>

1183
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 3>And he's just trying to find his limits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:18.150
<v Speaker 3>he's always trying to find his limits</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he can't find his limits at 100</v>

<v Speaker 3>in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bad guys have that extra gear.</v>

1199
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Those guys that are,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they're crying.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So that'd be black guys always.</v>

1206
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Whenever I remember his word it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he see him crying?</v>

1207
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to that in high school,</v>

1208

<v Speaker 3>at a young.</v>

1211
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:15.880

<v Speaker 3>mentally they just don't get it.</v>

1212
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:17.520
<v Speaker 3>And then when they get a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>older and they go through it,</v>

1213
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:18.400
<v Speaker 3>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

1214

<v Speaker 3>you'll never understand what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get your heartbroken.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you feel like the world's over.</v>

1219
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Then you</v>

1234
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:26.251
<v Speaker 1>He put like a gun next to his cheek and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot a hole through his face on camera.</v>

1235
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.110

<v Speaker 1>He's in his car.</v>

1242
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:48.370
<v Speaker 1>This is one thing that leads me to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is a starter pistol because</v>

1243
00:49:48.371 --> 00:49:50.350
<v Speaker 1>he's in his car.</v>

<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

1247
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Did he though didn't go through his</v>
<v Speaker 1>other cheek?</v>

1248

<v Speaker 1>because the sounds like it was a very,</v>

1265
00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:27.510
<v Speaker 1>very low low volume sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that was probably like if</v>

1266
00:51:27.511 --> 00:51:30.300
<v Speaker 1>anything it was a 22 and if he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>swallow the bullet,</v>

1267
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe I guess maybe it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense that looked like it came out</v>

1268
00:51:34.351 --> 00:51:37.950
<v Speaker 1>the other side disturbing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really that you just shot</v>

1269
00:51:37.951 --> 00:51:39.690
<v Speaker 1>himself something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just his attitude,</v>

1270
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.820
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with you man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

1271
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.150
<v Speaker 1>not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>

1272
00:51:45.151 --> 00:51:49.410
<v Speaker 1>That's not a goal in individual with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing is that guy might get</v>

1273
00:51:49.411 --> 00:51:53.970
<v Speaker 1>like success for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he made some posts about it where</v>

1274
00:51:53.971 --> 00:51:56.250
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all got played or something like that.</v>

1275
00:51:56.251 --> 00:51:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1276
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:02.430
<v Speaker 1>You see the post that he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a whole post after it.</v>

1277
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:04.500
<v Speaker 1>A doctor stitched him up.</v>

1278
00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:06.790
<v Speaker 1>A doctor's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay,</v>

1279
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:13.380
<v Speaker 1>know disturbed well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take a starter pistol by the</v>

1280
00:52:13.381 --> 00:52:15.240
<v Speaker 1>way and it will blow a hole through your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

1281
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1282
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:22.380
<v Speaker 1>was an actor when I was on this TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His friend was on the TV show with me</v>

1283
00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>and the guy had died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was playing around with a blank and</v>

1284
00:52:29.251 --> 00:52:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a like for a movie and he put the</v>

1285
00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:35.250
<v Speaker 1>thing up to his head and didn't realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the amount of force that comes out,</v>

1286
00:52:35.251 --> 00:52:38.040
<v Speaker 1>just the air a fractured his skull and</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a blank.</v>

1290
00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.990
<v Speaker 1>There was some sort of a particle that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was inside the blank and it shot him in</v>

1291
00:52:48.991 --> 00:52:52.860
<v Speaker 1>the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the conspiracy theory buckle up</v>

1292
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:56.730
<v Speaker 1>black helicopters that the conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory is the same people that killed</v>

1293
00:52:56.731 --> 00:52:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee wanted to kill brandon Lee</v>

<v Speaker 1>to do movies for the Chinese triad and</v>

1301

<v Speaker 1>he was doing all these movies for them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then left to come America to</v>

1302
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.890

<v Speaker 3>big time movie star,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people come here and they're like,</v>

1379
00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.720
<v Speaker 1>they get in this mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cops trying to like,</v>

1380
00:56:28.721 --> 00:56:29.271
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1381
00:56:29.271 --> 00:56:30.960
<v Speaker 1>like you're coming with us and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1382
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:34.380
<v Speaker 1>people recording and then they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen and the cop has to use force,</v>

1383
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just.</v>

1384
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.080
<v Speaker 1>People just don't really respect her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Granted,</v>

1385
00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 1>there is other sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did,</v>

1386
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 1>did see the guy in Florida that got shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he was lying down with his hands</v>

1387
00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:47.320
<v Speaker 1>up talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a therapist and he's totally</v>

1388
00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:50.200
<v Speaker 1>unarmed lying on his back and the cop</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot him and then he's like,</v>

1389
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:51.130
<v Speaker 1>why'd you shoot me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1390
00:56:51.131 --> 00:56:52.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1391
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 1>and then the cop changed his story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cop completely changed the story</v>

1392
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:57.670
<v Speaker 1>after it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1393
00:56:57.671 --> 00:56:59.380
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's good and bad,</v>

1394
00:56:59.381 --> 00:57:01.570
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't see the full video of this.</v>

1395
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I only saw the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which really makes you think like when</v>

1396
00:57:05.771 --> 00:57:07.640
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a lot of these interactions that</v>

1397
00:57:07.641 --> 00:57:10.360
<v Speaker 1>people have with cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what led the cop to be so fucking</v>

1398
00:57:10.361 --> 00:57:12.820
<v Speaker 1>ramped up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well here now you understand that guy</v>

1399
00:57:12.821 --> 00:57:17.821
<v Speaker 1>was risking all sorts of people's lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives by riding that motorcycle,</v>

1400
00:57:18.431 --> 00:57:21.100
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the cop got ahold of him.</v>

1401
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 1>He bumped him to knock him off the bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that kid was fine,</v>

1402
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:27.520
<v Speaker 1>but that kid got $180,000 for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking the law.</v>

1403
00:57:27.521 --> 00:57:30.880
<v Speaker 1>He gets 180 grand for a weak ass bitch</v>
<v Speaker 1>front kick.</v>

1404
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Terrible front kick too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1405
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:33.124
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1406
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.770
<v Speaker 1>He had a glock though the gangster</v>
<v Speaker 1>glock,</v>

1407
00:57:35.771 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1408
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:37.601
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>

1409
00:57:37.601 --> 00:57:38.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cops that,</v>

1410
00:57:38.911 --> 00:57:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all of them because I have uncles</v>

1411
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 1>that are cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're great people,</v>

1412
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:45.040
<v Speaker 1>but they're just like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1413
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:48.340
<v Speaker 1>And it makes them no different and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I feel like they get a little</v>

1414
00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 1>power power trip</v>

1415
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.140
<v Speaker 2>100 percent times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been polite to cops and I've been</v>

1416
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:55.020
<v Speaker 2>treated very rudely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1417
00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 2>and then there's times where I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>polite and they've been applied or they</v>

1418
00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:59.730
<v Speaker 2>let me off on like a speeding ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was speeding,</v>

1419
00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:01.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's times where I've seen cops</v>

1420
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:05.500
<v Speaker 2>just look like maybe they got bullied in</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school and they take advantage.</v>

1421
00:58:05.501 --> 00:58:07.920
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that's just human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>

1422
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:11.370
<v Speaker 2>It was in an unmarked Camaro that looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

1423
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.140
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't have a siren outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only had his lights on.</v>

1424
00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.960
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even know he was being chased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1425
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:18.920
<v Speaker 2>well that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the motorcycle.</v>

1426
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:22.520
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that makes sort of sense more.</v>

1427
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Send a video of him in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1428
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Got One hundred 80 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's lucky.</v>

1429
00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still driving a Douche bag.</v>

1430
00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you want to drive like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on a fucking raceway man.</v>

1431
00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.840
<v Speaker 1>You can take that bike on a race way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to cut in and out of</v>

1432
00:58:36.841 --> 00:58:40.320
<v Speaker 1>traffic the way he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going ridiculously excessive speeds.</v>

1433
00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.140
<v Speaker 1>The video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when he's cutting off cars and</v>

1434
00:58:43.141 --> 00:58:44.040
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1435
00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:46.770
<v Speaker 1>that's how people die and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily you.</v>

1436
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 2>That happens here in la all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving down here from San Diego</v>

1437
00:58:49.931 --> 00:58:52.060
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I do that all the time at</v>
<v Speaker 2>those bikers,</v>

1438
00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:52.391
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1439
00:58:52.391 --> 00:58:54.640
<v Speaker 2>they zone in and out and I don't hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>him come behind me because they're</v>

1440
00:58:54.641 --> 00:58:58.360
<v Speaker 2>flying and I'm in between traffic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they combine almost like scraped your</v>

1441
00:58:58.361 --> 00:59:00.370
<v Speaker 2>mirrors and then they're getting mad at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you're like,</v>

1442
00:59:00.371 --> 00:59:01.181
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see.</v>

1443
00:59:01.181 --> 00:59:03.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a little bit of music plan.</v>

1444
00:59:03.131 --> 00:59:05.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not like real loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I can't hear you into</v>

1445
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.100
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right there.</v>

1446
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.140
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's sometimes just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>release those.</v>

1447
00:59:08.141 --> 00:59:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Harley Davidson's</v>

1448
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:10.280
<v Speaker 1>are so loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a.</v>

1449
00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I saw a bumper sticker that said loud</v>
<v Speaker 1>pipes save lives.</v>

1450
00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:15.170
<v Speaker 1>They really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes a big difference.</v>

1451
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Make sense that they have those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those loud pipes like that.</v>

1452
00:59:18.561 --> 00:59:19.760
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1453
00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that cops are just like you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and one of the things that I think we</v>

1454
00:59:24.141 --> 00:59:27.380
<v Speaker 1>should all take into consideration is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of people that they deal with</v>

1455
00:59:27.381 --> 00:59:30.980
<v Speaker 1>on a daily basis that are criminals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are violent,</v>

1456
00:59:30.981 --> 00:59:33.950
<v Speaker 1>that are dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's just so much shit they have</v>

1457
00:59:33.951 --> 00:59:36.560
<v Speaker 1>to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think most people are</v>

1458
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:40.550
<v Speaker 1>qualified for that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that job should be for people</v>

1459
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:43.970
<v Speaker 1>that are like ex military that are solid</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a fucking rock,</v>

1460
00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be super high paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it should be a really well respected</v>

1461
00:59:47.481 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think those people should be like</v>

1462
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.340
<v Speaker 1>integrated in whatever community that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're enforcing.</v>

1463
00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:53.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1464
00:59:53.411 --> 00:59:54.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually telling this,</v>

1465
00:59:54.841 --> 00:59:55.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if I told my coach</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

1466
00:59:56.010 --> 00:59:56.821
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1467
00:59:56.821 --> 00:59:58.940
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go and help out the cops in a</v>

1468
00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:02.130
<v Speaker 2>little bit of like candy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like combat and go in and help them out.</v>

1469
01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't know.</v>

1470
01:00:04.151 --> 01:00:05.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you come up to me and I'm not</v>

1471
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:07.650
<v Speaker 2>thinking anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can just quickly pull out a gun</v>

1472
01:00:07.651 --> 01:00:10.080
<v Speaker 2>and shoot you and sometimes those cops</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>

1473
01:00:10.081 --> 01:00:11.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to be nice and then</v>

1474
01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:14.430
<v Speaker 2>they get killed on the spot or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may not know and they killed them</v>

1475
01:00:14.431 --> 01:00:16.350
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it wasn't a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1476
01:00:16.351 --> 01:00:19.980
<v Speaker 2>that's a quick little within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to make a huge decision and</v>

1477
01:00:19.981 --> 01:00:23.280
<v Speaker 2>just such a matter of seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be me going home and,</v>

1478
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:25.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just like a fight,</v>

1479
01:00:25.081 --> 01:00:25.470
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1480
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be me going home in the</v>

1481
01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:29.210
<v Speaker 2>winter and feed my family as compared to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1482
01:00:29.211 --> 01:00:29.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1483
01:00:29.561 --> 01:00:31.830
<v Speaker 2>that's life or death situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1484
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:34.020
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they definitely need a</v>

1485
01:00:34.021 --> 01:00:36.960
<v Speaker 2>little bit better education on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>training and uh,</v>

1486
01:00:36.961 --> 01:00:38.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anybody in San Diego is listening to</v>

1487
01:00:38.731 --> 01:00:39.750
<v Speaker 2>this or any police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1488
01:00:39.751 --> 01:00:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to come help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1489
01:00:40.861 --> 01:00:42.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure like dominick Cruz and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

1490
01:00:42.391 --> 01:00:44.280
<v Speaker 2>we'd love to come help and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>be mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cops have at least some sort of</v>

1494
01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>martial arts training because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
01:00:53.351 --> 01:00:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to big John Mccarthy about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this where he was telling me how few</v>

1496
01:00:57.581 --> 01:01:00.490
<v Speaker 1>police officers can even physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>defend themselves.</v>

1497
01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys that just don't,</v>

1498
01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>they don't know anything and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out at all overweight.</v>

1499
01:01:06.131 --> 01:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

1500
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>if shit goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're helpless.</v>

1501
01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.920
<v Speaker 1>And these are the supposed to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are supposed to serve and</v>

1502
01:01:11.921 --> 01:01:12.754
<v Speaker 1>protect.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and been around martial arts alive.</v>

1505
01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.600
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with someone who is</v>

1506
01:01:22.601 --> 01:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>a explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous person that might be a felon</v>

1507
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>their whole life and you're someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>has no experience at all in any kind of</v>

1508
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>hand to hand combat situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1512
01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.160
<v Speaker 2>like a training with the army and</v>
<v Speaker 2>military and wounded warriors praying.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't even know the</v>

1514
01:01:44.761 --> 01:01:47.730
<v Speaker 2>basis of just hand fighting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bellingham fighting is very important.</v>

1515
01:01:47.731 --> 01:01:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Especially if someone's holding a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1516
01:01:49.861 --> 01:01:51.990

<v Speaker 2>your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1542
01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:41.010

<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he still does or not,</v>

1543

<v Speaker 3>I was watching pat today.</v>

1544
01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:46.830
<v Speaker 3>I was watching him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He was doing commentary for lion fight.</v>

1547
01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.640
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat was saying that he was about to do</v>

1548
01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:56.370
<v Speaker 3>100 mile run and I was asking him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to mention that.</v>

1549
01:02:56.371 --> 01:02:56.601
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1550
01:02:56.601 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I seen him on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I follow them and I guess he put out</v>

1551
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:00.930
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little lists,</v>

1552
01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 3>like he's going to do like do a four</v>
<v Speaker 3>mile,</v>

1553
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.200
<v Speaker 3>10 mile and then he's basically like</v>
<v Speaker 3>building up like 15,</v>

1554
01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 3>20 miles that he's going to do 100 mile</v>
<v Speaker 3>run.</v>

1555
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.780
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just do that slowly just by building</v>

1556
01:03:10.781 --> 01:03:13.440
<v Speaker 3>like a little base and getting himself</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready for that.</v>

1557
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:14.870
<v Speaker 3>But that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why was he doing that?</v>

1558
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1559
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 3>he's getting older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just fucking with divorce or I don't</v>

1560
01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:21.504
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1561
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:24.510
<v Speaker 3>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's just looking for a new</v>

1562
01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:25.344
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Retired from fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1564
01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1565
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:30.060
<v Speaker 3>I seen Don Frye recently just get</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked out recently,</v>

1566
01:03:30.061 --> 01:03:32.520
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I feel like yeah,</v>

1567
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:35.190
<v Speaker 3>he got knocked out by one of A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it dog?</v>

1568
01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:38.460
<v Speaker 3>The bounty hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a security guys that was really old.</v>

1569
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:43.080
<v Speaker 3>Video was from a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don Don was really drunk.</v>

1570
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.153
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.040
<v Speaker 3>And he got into some sort of a fight in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hotel with some dude seen that,</v>

1572
01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I think that was really old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always that dog in you,</v>

1573
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:53.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've probably been away from</v>

1574
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 3>competition for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still like to grapple and just</v>

1575
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:57.960
<v Speaker 3>get after it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in your gym,</v>

1576
01:03:57.961 --> 01:03:58.650
<v Speaker 3>always see you hitting it.</v>

1577
01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:00.930
<v Speaker 3>But I mean just as a man or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>competitor,</v>

1578
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:04.410
<v Speaker 3>you always have that type of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean eventually you gotta let it go</v>

1579
01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:05.700
<v Speaker 3>and eventually your time's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>pass.</v>

1580
01:04:05.701 --> 01:04:08.010
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you're always gonna have that</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive and you know,</v>

1581
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:11.640
<v Speaker 3>running or doing something like that or</v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming is always going to probably</v>

1582
01:04:11.641 --> 01:04:13.410
<v Speaker 3>keep that passion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that drive,</v>

1583
01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:15.800
<v Speaker 3>that still in use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's probably good to kind of release</v>

1584
01:04:15.801 --> 01:04:17.900
<v Speaker 3>that and go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean definitely.</v>

1585
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:20.850
<v Speaker 3>I think it's definitely good to push</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in some sort of a way because I</v>

1586
01:04:20.851 --> 01:04:22.450
<v Speaker 3>think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys were,</v>

1587
01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:26.160
<v Speaker 3>it's really a classic story with boxers</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially.</v>

1588
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:30.480
<v Speaker 3>They stopped competing and then they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into hard drugs and it happened with Joe</v>

1589
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Lewis had happened with um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a set white guy.</v>

1590
01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:37.200
<v Speaker 3>I understood which one fluid done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked him out.</v>

1591
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:39.060
<v Speaker 3>He was doing cocaine with some hookers.</v>

1592
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.970
<v Speaker 3>You got them on video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>

1593
01:04:41.971 --> 01:04:42.571
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1594
01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Ricky Hatton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ricky Hatton.</v>

1595
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking of um,</v>

1596
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 3>goddammit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dude who,</v>

1597
01:04:47.461 --> 01:04:49.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cassius clay beat Sonny Liston,</v>

1598
01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Sonny Liston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he died of a drug overdose to.</v>

1599
01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:55.850
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know a lot of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1600
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:57.600
<v Speaker 3>they stopped fighting and there's also</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1601
01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thought of,</v>

1602
01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a long career of getting hit in</v>

1603
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:06.720
<v Speaker 3>the head and then you want to self</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicate efforts over like a lot of</v>

1604
01:05:06.721 --> 01:05:08.110
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have um,</v>

1605
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:09.920
<v Speaker 3>issues with their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1606
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.320
<v Speaker 3>their systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the endocrine systems,</v>

1607
01:05:13.321 --> 01:05:14.820
<v Speaker 3>they have issues with the pituitary</v>
<v Speaker 3>gland.</v>

1608
01:05:14.821 --> 01:05:17.740
<v Speaker 3>A lot of depression comes in and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>start,</v>

1609
01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:22.890
<v Speaker 3>they start trying to fix that without</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol or fix that feeling with cocaine</v>

1610
01:05:23.551 --> 01:05:26.020
<v Speaker 3>or prescription and prescription drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1611
01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the worst.</v>

1612
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.190
<v Speaker 3>What prescription drugs are a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem because a lot of guys get</v>

1613
01:05:30.191 --> 01:05:31.670
<v Speaker 3>injured and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1614
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 3>they go to a doctor or they got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

1615
01:05:34.121 --> 01:05:37.350
<v Speaker 3>their lumbar or something like that or</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to imagine the disc.</v>

1616
01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1617
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:40.090
<v Speaker 3>It's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1618
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I watched that episode ballers and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Rock Johnson,</v>

1619
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:45.590
<v Speaker 3>he's always smashing them vicodins and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1620
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:48.370
<v Speaker 3>those nfl guys talks about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've seen that show.</v>

1621
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.160
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show the rocks man.</v>

1622
01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.790
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of see that and you're like,</v>

1623
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:52.840
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of makes sense that,</v>

1624
01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely that they are shooting them</v>

1625
01:05:54.581 --> 01:05:57.760
<v Speaker 3>up and get back on the field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to win the game and you know,</v>

1626
01:05:57.761 --> 01:05:59.200
<v Speaker 3>when you're in that moment you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it.</v>

1627
01:05:59.201 --> 01:06:01.120
<v Speaker 3>But then in the longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1628
01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:02.540
<v Speaker 3>like that movie concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1629
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.180
<v Speaker 3>the one guy from the steelers was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>down the opposite way and then smashed</v>

1630
01:06:06.181 --> 01:06:09.020
<v Speaker 3>it into a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was wanting to kill his family and</v>

1631
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 3>just snaps out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1632
01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just crazy men.</v>

1633
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.331
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1634

<v Speaker 3>head injuries or no fucking joke man.</v>

1635
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:20.190
<v Speaker 3>And that was one of the things that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>brock was talking about with wwe that</v>

1636
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.490
<v Speaker 3>earlier in his career he had issues</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he was,</v>

1637
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:26.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys are fucking flipping each</v>

1638
01:06:26.531 --> 01:06:29.530
<v Speaker 3>other and landing on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People could say that's fake wrestling</v>

1639
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:30.101
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that term,</v>

<v Speaker 3>fake wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those fucking flips a real man.</v>

1641
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:35.590
<v Speaker 3>The impact is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys getting body slammed,</v>

1642
01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:37.660
<v Speaker 3>that's all that all counts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cutting themselves.</v>

1643
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:38.320
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1644
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.550
<v Speaker 3>tax like mankind used to do and fallen</v>
<v Speaker 3>off the cages and the tables and then</v>

1645
01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:43.600
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1646
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.440
<v Speaker 3>those metal chairs and they would just</v>
<v Speaker 3>bash them over.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And you see that a lot of those guys are</v>

1653
01:06:52.661 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 3>suing the wwe now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Jimmy superfly snooker was wearing</v>

1654
01:06:56.501 --> 01:07:01.180
<v Speaker 3>a suit and going to court and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>suing the wwe for still around.</v>

1655
01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Superfly still around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess probably got some head injuries.</v>

1656
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.580
<v Speaker 3>Didn't use to jump off the rope and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head.</v>

1657
01:07:05.581 --> 01:07:06.760
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was his thing.</v>

1658
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:09.760
<v Speaker 3>One of the most dangerous moves to would</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the super fly.</v>

1659
01:07:09.761 --> 01:07:14.170
<v Speaker 3>He would stand on the top ring and fly</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the air jungle show days.</v>

1660
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your fucking brain.</v>

1661
01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Jostling around inside is coconut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1662
01:07:19.271 --> 01:07:20.890
<v Speaker 3>He had that gene simmons hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1663
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.540
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was my favorite man.</v>

1664
01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.660
<v Speaker 3>My manager was just telling me about</v>
<v Speaker 3>jake the snake.</v>

1665
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a documentary on Netflix and</v>

1666
01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:33.850
<v Speaker 3>it's just sad that that guy he went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcoholism to depression was in a</v>

1667
01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:37.610
<v Speaker 3>trailer just from having everything to</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1668
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:42.190
<v Speaker 3>those injuries and self-medication into</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug and alcohol addiction and stuff.</v>

1669
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hard road.</v>

1670
01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:49.090
<v Speaker 3>That's that life of being a pro wrestler</v>
<v Speaker 3>is so fucking difficult.</v>

1671
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.370
<v Speaker 3>They don't get nearly enough credit for</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do.</v>

1672
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Those guys were on the road sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>260 plus days a year and they are</v>

1673
01:07:56.831 --> 01:08:01.831
<v Speaker 3>throwing each other through fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>doors and smashing you over the head and</v>

1674
01:08:01.871 --> 01:08:06.040
<v Speaker 3>fucking all the stunts that they have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do all the flips and all the craziness</v>

1675
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:08.180
<v Speaker 3>while lifting like meat heads to</v>
<v Speaker 3>juicing,</v>

1676
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:10.160
<v Speaker 3>juicing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting like crazy.</v>

1677
01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:10.920
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1678
01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is crazy.</v>

1679
01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:15.470
<v Speaker 3>But</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lifestyle.</v>

1680
01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

1681
01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>they chose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1682
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:18.350
<v Speaker 2>GotTa love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1683
01:08:18.351 --> 01:08:19.630
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you got,</v>

1684
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:22.310
<v Speaker 2>you got to love it and that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ultimately their decision.</v>

1685
01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:23.760
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

1686
01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:27.530
<v Speaker 1>but I think super fly was saying that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see.</v>

1687
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy.</v>

1688
01:08:30.391 --> 01:08:32.340
<v Speaker 1>This is really recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1689
01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:36.390
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid I was in high school in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties and super fly was the man,</v>

1690
01:08:36.391 --> 01:08:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like the big deal and when I was</v>

1691
01:08:38.731 --> 01:08:42.060
<v Speaker 1>in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no one knew shit about concussions</v>

1692
01:08:42.061 --> 01:08:42.894
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1693
01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:45.840
<v Speaker 1>no one knew anything about cte.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never heard of that term.</v>

1694
01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:49.110
<v Speaker 1>We heard of brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sky's get punched drunk.</v>

1695
01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:50.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what we heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

1696
01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:52.440
<v Speaker 1>but we always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1697
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>you could kind of tell see a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to slur his words.</v>

1698
01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>It's time stop and you'll get better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1699
01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's why we didn't know that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it from playing football.</v>

1700
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:04.180
<v Speaker 1>You never heard of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1701
01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but that's what it's based on.</v>

1705
01:09:11.131 --> 01:09:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1706
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:12.360

<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1713
01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.690

<v Speaker 2>out of here and get in a car accident</v>

1714

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.470
<v Speaker 3>way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's got some issues in the Josh</v>

1834
01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.890
<v Speaker 3>for like 55,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight 70 to 75,</v>

1835
01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:34.230
<v Speaker 3>72 towards the end to 20 at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1836
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Big enormous dude and he comes in and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess Josh like sparked a little bit but</v>

1837
01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:39.510
<v Speaker 3>he's Kinda like conserving and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1838
01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.360
<v Speaker 3>because I figured this guy was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come in and he said he came in and then</v>

1839
01:13:42.361 --> 01:13:44.490
<v Speaker 3>he's like let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>

1840
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:46.320
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they laced up and then they fought and</v>

1841
01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:49.590
<v Speaker 3>then josh is kind of just walk forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just kept his hands up,</v>

1842
01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:52.350
<v Speaker 3>let the guy kind of bomb and get tired</v>
<v Speaker 3>and eventually took them down and</v>

1843
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:55.350
<v Speaker 3>started putting it on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beat the shit out of him but it</v>

1844
01:13:55.351 --> 01:13:57.420
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy had boxing gloves on when</v>

1845
01:13:57.421 --> 01:14:00.920
<v Speaker 3>there's something because he's on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller bought and he,</v>

1846
01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 3>the guy chose the boxing so he chose</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he wanted to do.</v>

1847
01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:08.940
<v Speaker 3>So it was like an old school ufc event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like going down and the guy</v>

1848
01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.310
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't someone.</v>

1849
01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't someone trying to press charges</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Josh?</v>

1850
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no weirdness going on because it was all</v>

1851
01:14:15.881 --> 01:14:20.280
<v Speaker 1>over the internet and everybody was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the what near did was kind</v>

1852
01:14:20.281 --> 01:14:21.640
<v Speaker 1>of fucked up and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1853
01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a guy comes to your gym and wants</v>

1854
01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>to fight like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird predicament for a</v>

1855
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:30.010
<v Speaker 1>professional fighter to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's real common.</v>

1856
01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Like Dojo wars have always been common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diaz was in them.</v>

1857
01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they say the gracies back in</v>

1858
01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:36.740
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

1859
01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:39.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these boxers and a weight lifters.</v>

1860
01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of old school videos of</v>

1861
01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:43.340
<v Speaker 1>guys would just come in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're the man with his</v>

1862
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1863
01:14:44.791 --> 01:14:47.260
<v Speaker 1>let's see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they would get beat up and tapped</v>

1864
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:47.820
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1865
01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:51.850
<v Speaker 1>And then that they had a respect for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens in all sorts of martial</v>

1866
01:14:51.851 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 1>arts schools that happened in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo school all the time.</v>

1867
01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Once or twice a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy would come in out of nowhere</v>

1868
01:14:59.171 --> 01:15:02.470
<v Speaker 1>that wanted to fight and then they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>put him in there with a black belt and</v>

1869
01:15:02.471 --> 01:15:03.990
<v Speaker 1>you'd get kicked in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1870
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:05.740
<v Speaker 1>it was common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was super cool.</v>

1871
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:07.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's always going to be the</v>

1872
01:15:07.931 --> 01:15:10.870
<v Speaker 1>case if you have a place that teaches</v>
<v Speaker 1>people how to fight,</v>

1873
01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:14.440
<v Speaker 1>there's always getting me some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wackadoo who thinks he knows how to</v>

1874
01:15:14.441 --> 01:15:15.570
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to go in there.</v>

1875
01:15:15.571 --> 01:15:17.530
<v Speaker 1>And the street guys who get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

1876
01:15:17.531 --> 01:15:20.140
<v Speaker 1>And I seen dominant cruise on a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that long ago.</v>

1877
01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old school video.</v>

1878
01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:25.240
<v Speaker 1>When I saw that dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes in and then he's like,</v>

1879
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just stand with me and this and that.</v>

1880
01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of a Dojo war where this</v>

1881
01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:35.740
<v Speaker 1>karate guys beat this homeless guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost to death.</v>

1882
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:38.260
<v Speaker 1>And the word was that they beat him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

1883
01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.170
<v Speaker 1>but they dragged the guy out and threw</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a dumpster.</v>

1884
01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.270
<v Speaker 1>But this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1885
01:15:43.271 --> 01:15:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anybody ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitively,</v>

1886
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:50.740
<v Speaker 1>because this was something that took</v>
<v Speaker 1>place in the 19 eighties and I don't</v>

1887
01:15:50.741 --> 01:15:53.860
<v Speaker 1>know if they ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking very disturbing video to</v>

1888
01:15:53.861 --> 01:15:58.360
<v Speaker 1>watch because the guy like he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting his ass kicked and the guy kept</v>

1889
01:15:58.361 --> 01:15:59.350
<v Speaker 1>beating them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

1890
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the guy who's the homeless</v>

1891
01:16:03.071 --> 01:16:06.580
<v Speaker 1>guy who's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he wearing the bell bottoms right</v>

1892
01:16:06.581 --> 01:16:07.130
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1893
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:09.670
<v Speaker 1>That dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude see it says right there</v>

1894
01:16:09.671 --> 01:16:11.140
<v Speaker 1>mentally challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1895
01:16:11.141 --> 01:16:16.141
<v Speaker 1>Beaten to death by MMA fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See was an mma because there wasn't even</v>

1896
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.210
<v Speaker 1>mma back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1897
01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy behind him,</v>

1898
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:24.130
<v Speaker 1>the black guy with the black belt in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>white guy is the guy beat,</v>

1899
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:25.450
<v Speaker 1>beat the fuck out of him.</v>

1900
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:30.430
<v Speaker 1>And this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he was just a crazy person and</v>

1901
01:16:30.431 --> 01:16:35.431
<v Speaker 1>these guys exist that pretended he knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and I think he thought he</v>

1902
01:16:35.861 --> 01:16:38.140
<v Speaker 1>was just going to go in there and work</v>
<v Speaker 1>out or something.</v>

1903
01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like throwing these little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got like a little something</v>

1904
01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.630
<v Speaker 1>throwing some kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

1905
01:16:43.631 --> 01:16:45.910
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even like he's really trying to</v>

1906
01:16:45.911 --> 01:16:46.990
<v Speaker 1>hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems.</v>

1907
01:16:46.991 --> 01:16:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of crazy.</v>

1908
01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:55.050
<v Speaker 1>But the other guy is like taking his</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and he winds up beating the fuck</v>

1909
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:57.790
<v Speaker 1>out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside,</v>

1910
01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:01.420
<v Speaker 1>inside like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what style of karate it</v>

1911
01:17:01.421 --> 01:17:03.490
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is super old school.</v>

1912
01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video is shitty as fuck.</v>

1913
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:08.550
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1914
01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:13.250
<v Speaker 1>but he's throwing the other guys throne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like two and like karate,</v>

1915
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:14.540
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1916
01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:15.950
<v Speaker 1>let me try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll kick to the leg,</v>

1917
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:18.500
<v Speaker 1>sweep the look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

1918
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because it's not,</v>

1919
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:21.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO,</v>

1920
01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:25.700
<v Speaker 1>you just connect it to the guy just</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really know how to fight.</v>

1921
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:27.860
<v Speaker 1>But he sort of knows how to look like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting.</v>

1922
01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:31.340
<v Speaker 1>He just crushed to keep pounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1923
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:33.950
<v Speaker 1>he beats the fuck out of this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way worse than this.</v>

1924
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had kicks others.</v>

1925
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.270
<v Speaker 1>The Nita down opponent is that black</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamite.</v>

1926
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

1927
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

1928
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.273
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

1929
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:45.350
<v Speaker 1>So then he comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost,</v>

1930
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.780
<v Speaker 1>see now he's almost kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting for his life.</v>

1931
01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 1>But he's fighting a guy that's a trained</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial artists that's probably been</v>

1932
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:53.600
<v Speaker 1>doing this forever because he's a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>

1933
01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.360
<v Speaker 1>He should've just kinda knocked him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it.</v>

1934
01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Let it be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1935
01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:58.193

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got sound effects.</v>

1937
01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.520
<v Speaker 3>It's unnecessarily there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out.</v>

1938
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:04.960
<v Speaker 3>He's out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>his head.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1946
01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the story is behind</v>

1947
01:18:29.821 --> 01:18:30.654
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

1948
01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:36.650
<v Speaker 4>is the trail of the conflict.</v>

1949
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:38.590
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is snapchat today where you're</v>

1950
01:18:38.591 --> 01:18:40.580
<v Speaker 1>snitching on yourself right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

1951
01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the blood.</v>

1952
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:50.460
<v Speaker 4>My dojo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow Man.</v>

1953
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:52.380
<v Speaker 4>That's Kinda messed up.</v>

1954
01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 84.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That goes.</v>

1955
01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:02.520
<v Speaker 1>He told the date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven trying to get a judge.</v>

1956
01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:08.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean snapchat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could kind of make the</v>

1957
01:19:08.521 --> 01:19:10.760
<v Speaker 1>argument that it was a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened?</v>

1958
01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.860
<v Speaker 1>They show where they put the guy this</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

1959
01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.610
<v Speaker 1>It is just blood on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy to die or no,</v>

1960
01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.280
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1961
01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anybody's ever.</v>

1962
01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:22.080
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find out whatever data is</v>

1963
01:19:22.081 --> 01:19:24.480
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my point is like those kinds of</v>

1964
01:19:24.481 --> 01:19:27.000
<v Speaker 1>things they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've happened throughout the history</v>

1965
01:19:27.001 --> 01:19:32.001
<v Speaker 1>of martial arts schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a bunch of Dojo wars back in my</v>

1966
01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:34.260
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never saw anybody get beaten to</v>

1967
01:19:34.261 --> 01:19:38.310
<v Speaker 1>death like that or if the guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could have easily died.</v>

1968
01:19:38.311 --> 01:19:42.510
<v Speaker 1>He got stomped on the head twice while</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was unconscious and that was a big</v>

1969
01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:45.270
<v Speaker 1>guy that stomped him and he stomped him</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the temple.</v>

1970
01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:47.190
<v Speaker 1>He could die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was knocked out with,</v>

1971
01:19:47.191 --> 01:19:49.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knees on the ground and then he was</v>

1972
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:52.830
<v Speaker 1>just like trying to get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can just clear as day the guy's</v>

1973
01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:54.700
<v Speaker 1>out of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he's Naeem in the back of the head</v>

1974
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.140
<v Speaker 1>a couple Sundays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1975
01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Well the stomps to was his head was flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely on the ground.</v>

1976
01:20:00.331 --> 01:20:02.480
<v Speaker 1>That guy just stomped his head.</v>

<v Speaker 1>obviously a karate guy who knows how to</v>

1979
01:20:05.971 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>kick and he stopping you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not like</v>

1980
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 3>a regular person stomping you guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting to get some force behind those</v>

1981
01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:12.900
<v Speaker 3>stumps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

1985
01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:25.370
<v Speaker 3>We want the big fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and they haven't even though you</v>

1986
01:20:25.371 --> 01:20:26.204
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know.</v>

1987
01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I know Max Holloway's in front of me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys who are in front of you right</v>

1988
01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:31.960
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the mix coming off last.</v>

1989
01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:32.361
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1990
01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:33.194
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they?</v>

1991
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the rankings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1992
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:36.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to fight,</v>

1993
01:20:36.571 --> 01:20:37.170
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>

1994
01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I've been dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the type of guy that I just go up.</v>

1995
01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Sean Shelby sees me and he looks at me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he just runs the other way.</v>

1996
01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:46.590
<v Speaker 3>What are the rankings?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm number like seven,</v>

1997
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.440
<v Speaker 3>but like Dennis Bermudez number six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's in front of me.</v>

1998
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:50.800
<v Speaker 3>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a.</v>

1999
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:53.310
<v Speaker 3>that's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't pay attention to that man.</v>

2000
01:20:53.311 --> 01:20:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been fighting everybody in the 55</v>

2001
01:20:55.741 --> 01:20:57.000
<v Speaker 3>and 45 division.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2002
01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:01.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rankings are based on per employee,</v>

2003
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:02.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2004
01:21:02.911 --> 01:21:05.130
<v Speaker 3>it's the input output of writers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2005
01:21:05.131 --> 01:21:08.640
<v Speaker 3>like here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When conor mcgregor knocked out Josie,</v>

2006
01:21:08.641 --> 01:21:13.641
<v Speaker 3>although some Brazilian writer put him</v>
<v Speaker 3>lower on the list than he was before,</v>

2007
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.270
<v Speaker 3>he's just jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot another other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2009
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Like here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you buy a hall,</v>

2010
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.930
<v Speaker 3>knocked out Gig Arpu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saucy.</v>

2011
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 3>He was ranked below him after the fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>below him on the fucking rankings.</v>

2012
01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the.</v>

2013
01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:30.390
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is the point of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rankings?</v>

2014
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:33.150
<v Speaker 3>If you fight a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knock him out,</v>

2015
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 3>you stop him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He jumped,</v>

2016
01:21:34.921 --> 01:21:37.470
<v Speaker 3>spinning back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked him in the head and then put them</v>

2017
01:21:37.471 --> 01:21:38.304
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2018
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:42.000
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What more does a guy have to do to get</v>

2019
01:21:42.001 --> 01:21:45.810
<v Speaker 3>ranked ahead of a guy you don't like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess their ideas that most Sasaki has</v>

2020
01:21:45.811 --> 01:21:49.320
<v Speaker 3>more experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you watch uriah hall fight,</v>

2021
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.240
<v Speaker 3>you can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a motherfucker.</v>

2022
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2023
01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:53.460
<v Speaker 3>He's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then stop.</v>

2024
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Stop watching fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stopped commenting.</v>

2025
01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped writing shit.</v>

2026
01:21:57.970 --> 01:21:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2027
01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:00.300
<v Speaker 3>He want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted.</v>

2028
01:22:00.301 --> 01:22:01.740
<v Speaker 3>He moves ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2029
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that two men.</v>

2030
01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:05.130
<v Speaker 3>The fuck is Dennis Bermudez ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2031
01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think because maybe he beat me.</v>

2032
01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.010
<v Speaker 3>He beat Max and then I lost a Max,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2033
01:22:11.011 --> 01:22:13.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did he beat Max Holloway?</v>

2034
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:16.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be Holloway Holloway couple of</v>

2035
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.820
<v Speaker 3>years ago before conor did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2036
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Bermudez is a beast dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was very good.</v>

2037
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No doubt about it.</v>

2038
01:22:22.501 --> 01:22:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying we're the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott says anything wrong with Bermuda.</v>

2039
01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:28.050
<v Speaker 3>He's an awesome fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did not know that he beat</v>

2040
01:22:28.051 --> 01:22:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Holloway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought Halloween's only last was to</v>

2041
01:22:29.901 --> 01:22:34.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>connor caught her in a dentist's last</v>

2042
01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will.</v>

2043
01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alto Holloway's really young,</v>

2044
01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2045
01:22:38.191 --> 01:22:40.530
<v Speaker 3>you think when he fought Dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2046
01:22:40.531 --> 01:22:42.390
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know he fought down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm trying to remember that.</v>

2047
01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:44.670
<v Speaker 3>But when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your honor,</v>

2048
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:47.010
<v Speaker 3>he was really young too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2049
01:22:47.011 --> 01:22:48.230
<v Speaker 3>he's a young kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.910
<v Speaker 3>He used to train with that guy back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

2051
01:22:50.911 --> 01:22:53.420
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of weird fighting him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why maybe the fight with distant</v>

2052
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:56.100
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew I had the power and then he just</v>

2053
01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:59.460
<v Speaker 3>kind of played the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just moving around game and it was just</v>

2054
01:22:59.461 --> 01:22:59.911
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2055
01:22:59.911 --> 01:23:01.840
<v Speaker 3>I really couldn't get into a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2056
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:04.980
<v Speaker 3>my style of fighting my rhythm and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just kinda like,</v>

2057
01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 3>he's clever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2058
01:23:06.221 --> 01:23:06.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

2059
01:23:06.921 --> 01:23:07.754
<v Speaker 3>he moves a lot.</v>

2060
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's clever and not being there for the</v>

2061
01:23:10.901 --> 01:23:13.870
<v Speaker 3>big shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He rarely gets hit with big shot mixes.</v>

2062
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Good with switch stances and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just overall we never really gotten</v>

2063
01:23:18.301 --> 01:23:21.140
<v Speaker 3>into a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like we just really didn't get</v>

2064
01:23:21.141 --> 01:23:22.930
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting that type of engagement and it</v>

2065
01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:25.630
<v Speaker 3>was just weird because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I trained with this guy before,</v>

2066
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:29.470
<v Speaker 3>I like I knew who he was and like I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and things are going so slow that</v>

2067
01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:33.010
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly everything's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really just couldn't be in the moment.</v>

2068
01:23:33.011 --> 01:23:33.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2069
01:23:33.851 --> 01:23:37.060
<v Speaker 3>like I know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm seeing people in the front row.</v>

2070
01:23:37.061 --> 01:23:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just felt really weird.</v>

2071
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like you weren't zoned in.</v>

2072
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just didn't have the,</v>

2073
01:23:42.311 --> 01:23:43.630
<v Speaker 3>like the focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2074
01:23:43.631 --> 01:23:48.631
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was just handled a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>little tattoos had I'm in the zone or</v>

2075
01:23:50.021 --> 01:23:50.390
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2076
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:52.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that was just a weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart for him.</v>

2077
01:23:52.871 --> 01:23:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very clever guy.</v>

2078
01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I liked the way he fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the way fuck cups wants and I</v>

2079
01:23:57.551 --> 01:24:00.340
<v Speaker 3>was super impressed with that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>copd is dangerous as fuck.</v>

2080
01:24:00.341 --> 01:24:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another good one.</v>

2081
01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 3>A way fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2082
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:05.410
<v Speaker 3>Ricardo Lamas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2083
01:24:05.411 --> 01:24:06.380
<v Speaker 3>let's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2084
01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.910
<v Speaker 3>that was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight on my bra.</v>

2085
01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:13.180
<v Speaker 3>What can we do that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

2086
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's certain levels of knockout</v>

2087
01:24:17.201 --> 01:24:18.034
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2088
01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:20.260
<v Speaker 3>You're a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to,</v>

2089
01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:21.690
<v Speaker 3>I used to throw them around a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he,</v>

2090
01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:25.300
<v Speaker 3>I think he just knew that he just wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to try to engage with me and then</v>

2091
01:24:25.301 --> 01:24:27.850
<v Speaker 3>he just was going to stay away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Power is a weird thing,</v>

2092
01:24:27.851 --> 01:24:30.310
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like some guys like,</v>

2093
01:24:30.311 --> 01:24:32.490
<v Speaker 3>you just have certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2094
01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:35.430
<v Speaker 3>there's just no getting around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like,</v>

2095
01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:37.330
<v Speaker 3>there's certain guys that no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do,</v>

2096
01:24:37.331 --> 01:24:38.470
<v Speaker 3>they'll have great technique.</v>

2097
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:40.450
<v Speaker 3>They'll win fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll even knock guys out,</v>

2098
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:43.720
<v Speaker 3>but they'll never be able to just step</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and rumble.</v>

2099
01:24:43.721 --> 01:24:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Johnson somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2100
01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Savage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2101
01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.860
<v Speaker 3>that's just what makes rumble Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2102
01:24:47.861 --> 01:24:50.680
<v Speaker 3>And that's what makes him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and Robbie lawler reprise three in</v>

2103
01:24:50.681 --> 01:24:53.740
<v Speaker 3>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't try to be a movement guy,</v>

2104
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:57.310
<v Speaker 3>don't try to do this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to be in the fight getting after</v>

2105
01:24:57.311 --> 01:24:59.840
<v Speaker 3>it because I feel like I can break</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are.</v>

2106
01:24:59.841 --> 01:25:01.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm a knock you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If not,</v>

2107
01:25:01.421 --> 01:25:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be in shape to go all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rounds.</v>

2108
01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever think that maybe if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be a movement guy and could do all</v>

2109
01:25:07.721 --> 01:25:09.940
<v Speaker 3>those other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have that as well because it's</v>

2110
01:25:09.941 --> 01:25:11.950
<v Speaker 3>not like your power is ever going to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2111
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.890
<v Speaker 3>You're always going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you knocked out dos Anjos with</v>

2112
01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:16.030
<v Speaker 3>that upper cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's,</v>

2113
01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:19.990
<v Speaker 3>that's classic Jeremy Stevens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you knocked out Bermuda's</v>

2114
01:25:19.991 --> 01:25:22.060
<v Speaker 3>with that flying knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got that power.</v>

2115
01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Like if you incorporate it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those other techniques that you see</v>

2116
01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:27.910
<v Speaker 3>these other guys doing as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

2117
01:25:27.911 --> 01:25:31.750
<v Speaker 3>if you ever thought of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe just expanding what you do.</v>

2118
01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:34.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also I work on that too because</v>

2119
01:25:34.751 --> 01:25:38.600
<v Speaker 3>people expect a certain kind of fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>from you because you're so aggressive.</v>

2120
01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:41.860
<v Speaker 3>You so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving forward all the time that if you</v>

2121
01:25:41.861 --> 01:25:44.530
<v Speaker 3>fought in a different way it would</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably fuck people up.</v>

2122
01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm always trying to work on</v>

2123
01:25:46.331 --> 01:25:49.670
<v Speaker 3>everything because I feel like you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be adapted using the Charles Darwin</v>

2124
01:25:49.671 --> 01:25:51.370
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the strongest or the smartest</v>

2125
01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.910
<v Speaker 3>person who's willing to adapt to change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be around the longest.</v>

2126
01:25:54.911 --> 01:25:58.150
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got so many young talented kids</v>

2127
01:25:58.151 --> 01:25:59.200
<v Speaker 3>coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2128

2132
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:08.840

<v Speaker 3>you got this talent.</v>

2133
01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.890
<v Speaker 3>You have to constantly be evolving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting better work on your game and all</v>

2134
01:26:12.891 --> 01:26:13.910
<v Speaker 3>angles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

2135
01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:17.600

<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2151
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:54.270
<v Speaker 3>he practices that shit so often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you ever see him hit pads?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2153
01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.070
<v Speaker 3>He'll throw like all that spinning shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>in practice all the time.</v>

2154
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a part of his normal comments</v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

2155
01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.200
<v Speaker 3>First Nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just trying to do that shit or try</v>

2156
01:27:06.201 --> 01:27:08.980
<v Speaker 3>to try not to be or try to be exciting</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

2157
01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.810
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of harnesses his own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you think of Aldo versus edgar?</v>

2158
01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.930
<v Speaker 3>This the second fight was boring dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it was boring?</v>

2159
01:27:17.931 --> 01:27:19.670
<v Speaker 3>It was boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as as a,</v>

2160
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:22.850
<v Speaker 3>as a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of stuff going on as at</v>

2161
01:27:22.851 --> 01:27:27.350
<v Speaker 3>a high level and a good stuff going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just thought it was boring.</v>

2162
01:27:27.351 --> 01:27:31.850
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like Aldo just fought to</v>
<v Speaker 3>just get by and when man,</v>

2163
01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.550
<v Speaker 3>but I'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or Frankie didn't look like himself.</v>

2164
01:27:34.551 --> 01:27:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he got caught a bunch of times.</v>

2165
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.890
<v Speaker 3>I think although look masterful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a brilliant fight.</v>

2166
01:27:39.891 --> 01:27:41.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're going to fight frankie,</v>

2167
01:27:41.481 --> 01:27:42.530
<v Speaker 3>that's the way to fight him.</v>

2168
01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:46.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean he threw very little kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>countered with punches and movement and</v>

2169
01:27:46.481 --> 01:27:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I thought he looked great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2170
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:50.390
<v Speaker 3>As far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that's what,</v>

2171
01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:53.150
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying is as I look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and I'm like,</v>

2172
01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:54.830
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the type of level that that is</v>

2173
01:27:54.831 --> 01:27:56.930
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like it was a boring</v>

2174
01:27:56.931 --> 01:27:58.460
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I also felt like it was,</v>

2175
01:27:58.461 --> 01:28:00.770
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see frankie moving like he did.</v>

2176
01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.840
<v Speaker 3>It made me kind of think maybe he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>injured.</v>

2177
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.910
<v Speaker 3>I think he just got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking God,</v>

2178
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.630
<v Speaker 3>he got his and Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2179
01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Joe José's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot bigger than him and he's had his</v>

2180
01:28:09.711 --> 01:28:12.890
<v Speaker 3>number and Waldo looked big in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight too.</v>

2181
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Like he looked smaller for the Mcgregor</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and I think concentrated a lot on</v>

2182
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:18.680
<v Speaker 3>strength conditioning for this fight.</v>

2183
01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:22.400
<v Speaker 3>And he looked like although of old feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they all looked like the older that</v>

2184
01:28:22.401 --> 01:28:25.070
<v Speaker 3>knocked out Mendez in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll look thick.</v>

2185
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:26.240
<v Speaker 3>We'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>

2186
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:27.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe,</v>

2187
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:30.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's had issues back and forth with</v>

2188
01:28:30.261 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 3>making 1:45,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe he's got it dialed in better.</v>

2189
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Bet I bet he did because he did look</v>

2190
01:28:36.141 --> 01:28:39.860
<v Speaker 3>great that fight and he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did find a smart fight and I just,</v>

2191
01:28:39.861 --> 01:28:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like he could have finished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finished frankie.</v>

2192
01:28:42.091 --> 01:28:43.820
<v Speaker 3>He felt like he could have done a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit more,</v>

2193
01:28:43.821 --> 01:28:47.320
<v Speaker 3>but then I also heard that he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to throw kicks and he only used his</v>

2194
01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:51.380
<v Speaker 3>left hand because he had like some</v>
<v Speaker 3>snitches telling them like that Frankie</v>

2195
01:28:51.381 --> 01:28:53.390
<v Speaker 3>was going to take them down off kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2196
01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.890
<v Speaker 3>which.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's obvious,</v>

2197
01:28:54.891 --> 01:28:56.930
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously frank is going to try</v>

2198
01:28:56.931 --> 01:29:00.080
<v Speaker 3>to take him down off cakes because all</v>
<v Speaker 3>those got that nasty left right leg</v>

2199
01:29:00.081 --> 01:29:00.820
<v Speaker 3>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2200
01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's always throwing kicks.</v>

2201
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:03.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's ever really took them</v>

2202
01:29:03.781 --> 01:29:05.970
<v Speaker 3>down to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be right back up.</v>

2203
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:06.833
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

2204
01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:10.740
<v Speaker 3>Well I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just fought a great fight.</v>

2205
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:12.470
<v Speaker 3>If you want to beat Frankie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2206
01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2207
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:14.640
<v Speaker 3>I liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed it.</v>

2208
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a really good fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I see your point.</v>

2209
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:18.630
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>

2210
01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 3>that was just stylistically that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't really play it play out</v>

2211
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:28.380
<v Speaker 2>with Frankie and in him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he put me in Aldo in there or me</v>

2212
01:29:28.381 --> 01:29:30.770
<v Speaker 2>and mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to see a lot of</v>

2213
01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.840
<v Speaker 2>high level action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be kicking and punching</v>

2214
01:29:32.841 --> 01:29:35.870
<v Speaker 2>each other and knew each other in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>face and it's going to be exciting,</v>

2215
01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time,</v>

2216
01:29:37.131 --> 01:29:38.630
<v Speaker 2>but still very skilled in a</v>

2217
01:29:39.010 --> 01:29:40.910
<v Speaker 3>method of madness type of way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:42.370
<v Speaker 3>How old are you now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

2219
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:43.870
<v Speaker 3>30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just 30.</v>

2220
01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:48.250
<v Speaker 3>So when you think about your career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have it mapped out like what</v>

2221
01:29:48.251 --> 01:29:51.000
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to accomplish and when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when do you have an exit strategy?</v>

2222
01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you know when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're going to be done prime right</v>

2223
01:29:54.071 --> 01:29:57.400
<v Speaker 3>now it seems like 30 to 34,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2224
01:29:57.490 --> 01:29:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2225
01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Robbie lawler.</v>

2226
01:29:59.131 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 2>I look up to that guy a lot in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he's Kinda handled his career</v>

2227
01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:03.940
<v Speaker 2>and who's to say within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2228
01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:07.650
<v Speaker 2>what if I go in there and the next three</v>
<v Speaker 2>or four fights on skin Kao and then it's</v>

2229
01:30:07.651 --> 01:30:08.101
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2230
01:30:08.101 --> 01:30:09.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like Sam Sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2231
01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:10.470
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's time for me to hang up,</v>

2232
01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:12.410
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then then I would definitely,</v>

2233
01:30:12.650 --> 01:30:15.210
<v Speaker 2>if I'm getting ruined like that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting myself,</v>

2234
01:30:15.211 --> 01:30:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be brain dead or talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about killing my family because I have</v>

2235
01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:21.390
<v Speaker 2>trauma injuries or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So definitely not.</v>

2236
01:30:21.391 --> 01:30:25.140
<v Speaker 2>But I definitely want to have an exit</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy and things that I want to do.</v>

2237
01:30:25.141 --> 01:30:27.270
<v Speaker 2>But as of right now,</v>

<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd tell Sean Shelby on my man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know that that's,</v>

2242
01:30:33.631 --> 01:30:37.200
<v Speaker 2>that's rough to live off of and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to keep fighting because I just</v>

2243
01:30:37.201 --> 01:30:39.390
<v Speaker 2>want to be right back in the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I had to go out of the top 10</v>

2244
01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:41.100
<v Speaker 2>right now because everybody else has</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of lost.</v>

2245
01:30:41.101 --> 01:30:42.960
<v Speaker 2>I've already fought people where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>already got fights,</v>

2246
01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:45.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let somebody else from like the 11 or</v>

<v Speaker 2>like a lot more athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive and I want those exciting</v>

2253
01:31:03.811 --> 01:31:06.600
<v Speaker 2>like those are great fights for me to go</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've preached this guy and uh,</v>

2287
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:13.870
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an amazing man.</v>

2288
01:32:13.890 --> 01:32:16.000
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really actually had him a lot in my</v>

2289
01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:19.660
<v Speaker 2>corner and him coming to the last fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen me work out and he's just like,</v>

2290
01:32:19.661 --> 01:32:20.260
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2291
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.920
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on your stuff dude.</v>

2292
01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And everything that he gives me the Diet</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just,</v>

2293
01:32:25.211 --> 01:32:26.920
<v Speaker 2>I feel good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel good at further away.</v>

2294
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:28.930
<v Speaker 2>So when you work with a guy like George</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lockhart,</v>

2295
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.950
<v Speaker 2>what is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the protocol?</v>

2296
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Has these set up your camp?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's all computerized.</v>

2297
01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.780
<v Speaker 2>I can basically go into the computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>type in my weight.</v>

2298
01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Times that I'm training the hours</v>

2299
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:43.650
<v Speaker 2>that I'm training to the intensity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I type in my weight.</v>

2300
01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weigh myself,</v>

2301
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:49.030
<v Speaker 2>and then I tied that into the computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the computer just goes off of day to</v>

2302
01:32:49.031 --> 01:32:51.280
<v Speaker 2>day basics gives me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say if I don't have Kefir,</v>

2303
01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:54.550
<v Speaker 2>I can substitute for egg whites and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all computerized.</v>

2304
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:56.140
<v Speaker 2>If I need any help or I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2305
01:32:56.141 --> 01:32:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll,</v>

2306
01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.870
<v Speaker 2>he'll adjust a little bit of things for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2307
01:32:59.150 --> 01:33:00.580
<v Speaker 2>It's basically right there on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

2308
01:33:00.670 --> 01:33:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Do you get blood work done where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>find your nutrient levels or find what</v>

2309
01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:05.970
<v Speaker 2>you need or what you need to sign?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2310
01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:09.220
<v Speaker 2>I have a long time ago and I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>done that recently,</v>

2311
01:33:09.221 --> 01:33:10.054
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2312
01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:13.150
<v Speaker 2>it's nutritionists like George Lockhart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel great.</v>

2313
01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:13.751
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly,</v>

2314
01:33:13.751 --> 01:33:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I feel amazing when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm feeling good and I'm in that</v>

2315
01:33:16.121 --> 01:33:17.420
<v Speaker 2>right mindset and training hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2316
01:33:17.421 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

2317
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:20.300
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gotten the bloodwork done in</v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile,</v>

2318
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:21.460
<v Speaker 2>but I did do that.</v>

2319
01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:23.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all computerized.</v>

2320
01:33:23.801 --> 01:33:24.520
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2321
01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:27.880
<v Speaker 2>you write your weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you type your weight in and you type</v>

2322
01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:31.180
<v Speaker 2>like what you're saying if you've got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning day and he</v>

2323
01:33:31.181 --> 01:33:34.690
<v Speaker 2>adjusts your caloric intake accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calorie intake,</v>

2324
01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on the program.</v>

2325
01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:39.430
<v Speaker 2>He has it all program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2326
01:33:39.431 --> 01:33:41.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not for sure the exact details how</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does that,</v>

2327
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:44.230
<v Speaker 2>that's his thing and why he makes his</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2328
01:33:44.231 --> 01:33:46.300
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So does it show you immediately or do</v>

2329
01:33:46.301 --> 01:33:48.550
<v Speaker 2>you send him the information?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he sends it back to you</v>

2330
01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:51.550
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just click it in and then it shows you</v>

2331
01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.230
<v Speaker 2>showed me right there and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2332
01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:57.130
<v Speaker 2>then like by like Saturday or Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just for like the work week so they</v>

2333
01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:59.710
<v Speaker 2>can see how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much I'm losing if I need to,</v>

2334
01:33:59.970 --> 01:34:02.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower the calorie intake or if like</v>

2335
01:34:02.831 --> 01:34:05.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe like I'm feeling kind of lethargic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my weight's good.</v>

2336
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Heal up a little bit of carbs for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2337
01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.590
<v Speaker 2>if I call him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2338
01:34:08.591 --> 01:34:09.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing good.</v>

2339
01:34:09.971 --> 01:34:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I've been killing to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2340
01:34:11.171 --> 01:34:12.004
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2341
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.940
<v Speaker 2>my weights down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2342
01:34:12.941 --> 01:34:13.481
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

2343
01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2344
01:34:13.890 --> 01:34:14.860
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get a little bit more,</v>

2345
01:34:14.861 --> 01:34:18.640
<v Speaker 2>a half of a sweet potato or a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>more oatmeal before practice or</v>

2346
01:34:18.641 --> 01:34:20.390
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a,</v>

2347
01:34:20.410 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 2>he's very smart man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very real calculated in his</v>

2348
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:24.450
<v Speaker 2>approach and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2349
01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:28.000
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to learn from in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and everything that I get all</v>

2350
01:34:28.001 --> 01:34:30.040
<v Speaker 2>natural on that stuff or just</v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

2351
01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:33.190
<v Speaker 2>He's a military guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually used to be a,</v>

2352
01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:34.900
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me that he was actually a</v>

2353
01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:39.930
<v Speaker 2>chunkier kid growing up and then he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>got into diet and nutrition and losing</v>

2354
01:34:40.391 --> 01:34:44.410
<v Speaker 2>weight and then he got into the military</v>
<v Speaker 2>and helping out the military with a</v>

2355
01:34:44.411 --> 01:34:47.020
<v Speaker 2>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting that he's devised a</v>

2356
01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:49.270
<v Speaker 2>computer program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard of anybody else that</v>

2357
01:34:49.271 --> 01:34:53.260

<v Speaker 2>data and it gives you instant results.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like after say say we do like 75 minutes</v>

2401
01:36:18.021 --> 01:36:19.930
<v Speaker 2>of just straight wrestling and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

2402
01:36:19.931 --> 01:36:24.200
<v Speaker 2>I'll go run another 45 to an hour just</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a real low pace that I'm just burning</v>

2403
01:36:24.201 --> 01:36:28.060
<v Speaker 2>fat burning calories and like throughout</v>
<v Speaker 2>the week I'm burning like a,</v>

2404
01:36:28.090 --> 01:36:31.580
<v Speaker 2>like a pound and a half to two pounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>per week just depending on my body fat.</v>

2405
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:34.550
<v Speaker 2>And as slowly I get down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just keep niching niche and niching</v>

2406
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:36.470
<v Speaker 2>and then come time to double the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cut.</v>

2407
01:36:36.471 --> 01:36:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only cutting,</v>

2408
01:36:37.551 --> 01:36:38.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 pounds.</v>

2409
01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted I've cut a lot over the time but</v>

2410
01:36:41.241 --> 01:36:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I've burned a lot of body fat and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point your body starts to just</v>

2411
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:47.600
<v Speaker 2>rejuvenate and you're recovering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're burning more than you're eating.</v>

2412
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:49.450
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm dropping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping weight.</v>

2413
01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:52.220
<v Speaker 2>It makes the weight cut a lot easier</v>
<v Speaker 2>than once I do the water loads and,</v>

2414
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:56.000
<v Speaker 2>and more towards the way cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that much easier and it's a</v>

2415
01:36:56.001 --> 01:36:58.060
<v Speaker 2>lot easier going in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We not like,</v>

2416
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:59.100
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2421
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.100
<v Speaker 1>like if I wasn't involved in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2426
01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have any fat to lose.</v>

2427
01:37:20.331 --> 01:37:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm looking at you like you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I've always been solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been like a real fluffed up</v>

2430
01:37:28.561 --> 01:37:31.380
<v Speaker 2>or anything or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always just been like one of those</v>

2431
01:37:31.381 --> 01:37:32.640
<v Speaker 2>solid guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been.</v>

2434
01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why it's crazy to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could even get down to 1:45.</v>

2435
01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:42.090

<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of more footwork explosions</v>

2437
01:37:45.091 --> 01:37:47.320
<v Speaker 2>with medicine balls and kettle bells</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>

2441
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:58.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just train,</v>

2442
01:37:58.261 --> 01:37:59.310
<v Speaker 2>train,</v>

2443
01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.950
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they go to cut all that weight</v>

<v Speaker 2>and they don't understand that cardio</v>

<v Speaker 2>The runs and the weight cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2447
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:09.293
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2448
01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just go through breakthroughs like</v>

2449
01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:14.460
<v Speaker 2>when you don't want to run and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tired after 75 minutes and you're</v>

2450
01:38:14.461 --> 01:38:14.851
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2451
01:38:14.851 --> 01:38:16.230
<v Speaker 2>fuck dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to do this run.</v>

2452
01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:17.970
<v Speaker 2>But then when you do it and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2453
01:38:17.971 --> 01:38:19.440
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it like you got 20 more</v>

2454
01:38:19.441 --> 01:38:21.300
<v Speaker 2>minutes and you just like 20 more</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and I okay,</v>

2455
01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pick up the pace a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit or I'm gonna keep going through.</v>

2456
01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you'll just kind of get ran</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2457
01:38:25.561 --> 01:38:27.630
<v Speaker 2>ran down and then like all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll hit that,</v>

2458
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:30.150
<v Speaker 2>that final runner or next run and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

2459
01:38:30.151 --> 01:38:31.830
<v Speaker 2>you have a breakthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

2460
01:38:31.831 --> 01:38:34.650
<v Speaker 2>next week you're recovering a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>

2461
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:37.260
<v Speaker 2>He noticed that the fresh guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in,</v>

2462
01:38:37.261 --> 01:38:40.350
<v Speaker 2>they're getting more tired than you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one round and you started having</v>

2463
01:38:40.351 --> 01:38:44.910
<v Speaker 2>these little mental breakthroughs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little psychological steps.</v>

2464
01:38:44.911 --> 01:38:48.090
<v Speaker 2>You ever read the art of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like little little moves like</v>

2465
01:38:48.091 --> 01:38:51.270
<v Speaker 2>that that you can kind of see that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are that are approaching your game</v>

2466
01:38:51.271 --> 01:38:53.880
<v Speaker 2>and it's just the psychological effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>

2467
01:38:53.881 --> 01:38:54.511
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2468
01:38:54.511 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 2>I've done this cardio and then I ran for</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amount.</v>

2469
01:38:57.330 --> 01:39:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last camp I ran to Brazil and back.</v>

2470
01:39:00.121 --> 01:39:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Basically it's how much I ran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

2471
01:39:02.221 --> 01:39:04.200
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way that this guy is going to</v>

2472
01:39:04.201 --> 01:39:06.440
<v Speaker 2>push a pace that I can't handle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2473
01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:10.110
<v Speaker 2>and it's just these mental breakthroughs</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the runs really help.</v>

2474
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:11.730
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

2475
01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.420
<v Speaker 2>what kind of strength and conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what kind of cardio do you do</v>

<v Speaker 2>live in another.</v>

2555
01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Do you monitor your heart rate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2556
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sure do.</v>

2557
01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do the vo two Max and,</v>

2558
01:41:48.111 --> 01:41:50.070
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2559
01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I know what zones to kind of stay in</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm like,</v>

2560
01:41:52.611 --> 01:41:56.420
<v Speaker 2>just kind of slowly doing my runs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then at the same time you can't be a</v>

2561
01:41:56.421 --> 01:41:58.820
<v Speaker 2>pussy and manage your heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to fucking get after it.</v>

2562
01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you gotta break yourself,</v>

2563
01:42:00.861 --> 01:42:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are so many times that I</v>

2564
01:42:02.961 --> 01:42:05.960
<v Speaker 2>wanted to quit and that I just felt like</v>
<v Speaker 2>crying and it was just done.</v>

2565
01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I pushed myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then boom,</v>

2566
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:09.410
<v Speaker 2>I had those mental breakthroughs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2567
01:42:09.411 --> 01:42:10.460
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking finished.</v>

2568
01:42:10.461 --> 01:42:11.294
<v Speaker 2>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

2569
01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Most people went home after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after wrestling.</v>

2570
01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's times where I find myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the gym still running on the</v>

2571
01:42:16.791 --> 01:42:20.330
<v Speaker 2>treadmill or running at the beach and no</v>
<v Speaker 2>one's around,</v>

2572
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:21.500
<v Speaker 2>no one I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll hit up.</v>

2573
01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Some of my friends were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

2574
01:42:22.761 --> 01:42:23.594
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2575
01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll have like one guy come in and run</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me a few times.</v>

2576
01:42:26.031 --> 01:42:29.540
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes I find myself alone or my</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength conditioning coach will put us</v>

2577
01:42:29.541 --> 01:42:32.230
<v Speaker 2>through a workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll go run like another 45</v>

2578
01:42:32.231 --> 01:42:35.150
<v Speaker 2>slash 75 or an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll look to my left,</v>

2579
01:42:35.151 --> 01:42:38.230
<v Speaker 2>looked to my right and no one's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like my coach and I'll be like,</v>

2580
01:42:38.231 --> 01:42:39.300
<v Speaker 2>where are they at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George,</v>

2581
01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:40.490
<v Speaker 2>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the Diaz,</v>

2582
01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because his name is George George.</v>

2583
01:42:43.670 --> 01:42:45.260
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you're fucking savages you,</v>

2584
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:47.810
<v Speaker 2>that's why you're going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what it comes down to.</v>

2585
01:42:47.811 --> 01:42:49.430
<v Speaker 2>But as far as the heart rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

2586
01:42:49.431 --> 01:42:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I followed that program.</v>

2587
01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.130
<v Speaker 2>But then there's also a time to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself on sprints,</v>

2588
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2589
01:42:55.821 --> 01:42:57.620
<v Speaker 2>not like spar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spar all the time.</v>

2590

<v Speaker 2>I spar probably once a week right now I</v>

<v Speaker 2>wrestling and strength conditioning.</v>

2593

<v Speaker 2>I've already been doing sprints and</v>
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>

2597
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:16.670

<v Speaker 2>You can only get hit so many times</v>

2598
01:43:16.671 --> 01:43:19.120
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already know a fight,</v>

2599

01:44:25.281 --> 01:44:27.320
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ross is moving to one 70?</v>

2629
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:29.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think dollars.</v>

2630
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:33.170
<v Speaker 2>$70 go down to 55 again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2631
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.330
<v Speaker 2>he's fine at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2632
01:44:35.331 --> 01:44:37.450
<v Speaker 2>because he just had that close fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with or you know,</v>

2633
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:40.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it would maybe last the first or</v>
<v Speaker 2>two rounds and then at the end,</v>

2634
01:44:40.491 --> 01:44:41.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ross has putting it on him.</v>

2635
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:43.910
<v Speaker 2>I guess he just hit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe was like,</v>

2636
01:44:43.911 --> 01:44:44.631
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard,</v>

2637
01:44:44.631 --> 01:44:45.560
<v Speaker 2>oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Backed out.</v>

2638
01:44:45.561 --> 01:44:46.351
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to go.</v>

2639
01:44:46.351 --> 01:44:46.891
<v Speaker 2>Awaits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2640
01:44:46.891 --> 01:44:47.910
<v Speaker 2>And just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2641
01:44:48.230 --> 01:44:51.020
<v Speaker 2>because Ross was fighting at 45 for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

2642
01:44:51.021 --> 01:44:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Tried 45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

2643
01:44:52.731 --> 01:44:54.020
<v Speaker 2>He was skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't like that.</v>

2644
01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like that at all.</v>

2645
01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:58.280
<v Speaker 2>He's cutting a lot of weight and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know if he was doing it properly or</v>

2646
01:44:58.281 --> 01:45:00.260
<v Speaker 2>whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he just didn't like it and he likes</v>

2647
01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:03.350
<v Speaker 2>finding 55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ross likes to lift and he's a big dude.</v>

2648
01:45:03.351 --> 01:45:06.670
<v Speaker 2>He's got some big legs on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a power guy and uh,</v>

2649
01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:08.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 stuff,</v>

2650
01:45:08.121 --> 01:45:09.020
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2651
01:45:09.021 --> 01:45:11.750
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine it's a takes everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

2652
01:45:11.751 --> 01:45:13.640
<v Speaker 2>but I kinda liked putting into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where it's,</v>

2653
01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:15.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's breaking the edge,</v>

2654
01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:17.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a point where like,</v>

2655
01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2656
01:45:18.150 --> 01:45:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine,</v>

2657
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:21.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fight the whole way in thing.</v>

2658
01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.400
<v Speaker 2>We'll get into that a little bit later</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how you can weigh in early and</v>

2659
01:45:25.401 --> 01:45:28.160
<v Speaker 2>then you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of liked that edge where I feel</v>

2660
01:45:28.161 --> 01:45:30.620
<v Speaker 2>like I'm dying and then like I looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy in the eye who's,</v>

2661
01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about who he could beat me or</v>

2662
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:33.651
<v Speaker 2>this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2663
01:45:33.651 --> 01:45:36.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm training from the whole camp and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of liked that,</v>

2664
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:37.340
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that edge,</v>

2665
01:45:37.341 --> 01:45:38.390
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that switch of that,</v>

2666
01:45:38.391 --> 01:45:40.830
<v Speaker 2>that meanness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on motherfucker.</v>

2667
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been trained in long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2668
01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:45.110
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've put everything into this and it</v>

2669
01:45:45.111 --> 01:45:46.880
<v Speaker 2>really takes all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to make 45,</v>

2670
01:45:46.881 --> 01:45:50.410
<v Speaker 2>so I kinda like this which for me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people may be different.</v>

2671
01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you like the fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's got to go through that as</v>

2672
01:45:53.691 --> 01:45:56.030
<v Speaker 2>well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I like the fact that I have to,</v>

2673
01:45:56.210 --> 01:46:00.800
<v Speaker 2>it takes everything I have in all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline and all hard training to make</v>

2674
01:46:00.801 --> 01:46:04.910
<v Speaker 2>145 pounds and once I'm there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I feel ferocious.</v>

2675
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I feel mentally strong and it takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I got and I like doing that</v>

2676
01:46:09.561 --> 01:46:13.900
<v Speaker 2>because I'm going to be at my best and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to perform at my best when</v>

2677
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:15.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good mental switch for me to</v>

2678
01:46:15.771 --> 01:46:16.640
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

2679
01:46:16.641 --> 01:46:18.560
<v Speaker 2>That's my style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2680
01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:21.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conor Mcgregor's coach was talking about</v>

2681
01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:25.100
<v Speaker 2>that he thinks that connor not cutting</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight was probably a bad thing for them</v>

2682
01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.210
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2683
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:29.150
<v Speaker 2>fighting Diaz and just being able to eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever he wanted.</v>

2684
01:46:29.151 --> 01:46:33.530
<v Speaker 2>It not go through the grueling pattern</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's gone through all his other</v>

2685
01:46:33.531 --> 01:46:35.390
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at his demeanor though,</v>

2686
01:46:35.391 --> 01:46:39.260
<v Speaker 2>at the winds were at 45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like a savage.</v>

2687
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean he looks like death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2688
01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:42.770
<v Speaker 2>like we all do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he looks like he's like,</v>

2689
01:46:42.771 --> 01:46:44.090
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready.</v>

2690
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:45.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to get after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2691
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:46.310
<v Speaker 2>he looks mean.</v>

2692
01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:50.250
<v Speaker 2>When he came in and fought Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's smiling and he's all happy.</v>

2693
01:46:50.251 --> 01:46:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Bonnie fast.</v>

2694
01:46:52.230 --> 01:46:53.250
<v Speaker 2>See his demeanor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2695
01:46:53.251 --> 01:46:54.990
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's going on.</v>

2696
01:46:55.410 --> 01:46:56.131
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2697
01:46:56.131 --> 01:46:57.710
<v Speaker 2>now these guys that are weighing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that,</v>

2698
01:46:57.711 --> 01:46:58.950
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that take away a little bit of the</v>

2699
01:46:58.951 --> 01:46:59.741
<v Speaker 2>intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2700
01:46:59.741 --> 01:47:01.980
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of asking dominic that</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and he's just like,</v>

2701
01:47:01.981 --> 01:47:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still going to get after it,</v>

2702
01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:04.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>

2703
01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:06.640
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I go back and already you just stay,</v>

2704
01:47:06.641 --> 01:47:07.411
<v Speaker 2>can I come in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2705
01:47:07.411 --> 01:47:09.660
<v Speaker 2>am I going to be that intense at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

2706
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:13.960
<v Speaker 1>do you mean what you're saying is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's new way in rules where</v>

2707
01:47:13.961 --> 01:47:15.910
<v Speaker 1>you can weigh in way earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2708
01:47:15.911 --> 01:47:18.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they announced the weigh ins now,</v>

2709
01:47:18.161 --> 01:47:20.950
<v Speaker 1>like say if the fighters weigh in at</v>
<v Speaker 1>4:00,</v>

2710
01:47:20.951 --> 01:47:23.590
<v Speaker 1>you've already weighed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wait in 10:00 in the morning,</v>

2711
01:47:23.591 --> 01:47:25.450
<v Speaker 1>so you've already had a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rehydrate,</v>

2712
01:47:25.630 --> 01:47:27.490
<v Speaker 1>get some food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get back on.</v>

2713
01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:30.850
<v Speaker 1>The good thing is everybody looks way</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier when they weigh in because</v>

2714
01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:33.280
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some like connor's perfect example.</v>

2715
01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Some guys would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wayne,</v>

2716
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:36.940
<v Speaker 1>James Irvin was probably the worst ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Irvin,</v>

2717
01:47:36.941 --> 01:47:39.630
<v Speaker 1>when you would fight at one 85,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jesus Christ,</v>

2718
01:47:39.631 --> 01:47:44.020
<v Speaker 1>you see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so drunk and Oh my God,</v>

2719
01:47:44.021 --> 01:47:45.250
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so drained.</v>

2720
01:47:45.251 --> 01:47:46.510
<v Speaker 1>He looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked crazy.</v>

2721
01:47:47.130 --> 01:47:49.150
<v Speaker 1>It looked like he was about to die.</v>

2722
01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:52.780
<v Speaker 2>First Time I made 45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember seeing you and Dana and you</v>

2723
01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:53.950
<v Speaker 2>like Dana was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2724
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:55.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2725
01:47:58.150 --> 01:47:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And that was ivy days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2726
01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of a difference is it using the</v>

2727
01:48:01.501 --> 01:48:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Nivea and not using an IV?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't really feel a difference to</v>

2728
01:48:03.921 --> 01:48:04.820
<v Speaker 1>be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2729
01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Lockhart,</v>

2730
01:48:06.301 --> 01:48:09.520
<v Speaker 2>you may be changing that for me because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the nutrition that he,</v>

2731
01:48:09.521 --> 01:48:10.640
<v Speaker 2>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's there,</v>

2732
01:48:10.670 --> 01:48:13.200
<v Speaker 2>his whole teams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just feed me coming in and</v>

2733
01:48:13.201 --> 01:48:15.800
<v Speaker 2>knocking on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hotel room and like,</v>

2734
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.430
<v Speaker 2>eat this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this at this time,</v>

2735
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.870
<v Speaker 2>and it just makes it easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2736
01:48:18.871 --> 01:48:19.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2737
01:48:19.681 --> 01:48:23.160
<v Speaker 2>they rehydrate me properly and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe in those guys in my team</v>

2738
01:48:23.161 --> 01:48:25.950
<v Speaker 2>and the rehydration and I feel the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>

2739
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel better.</v>

2740
01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.820
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel better?</v>

2741
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2742
01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Some guys have said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Joe Silva was actually telling me</v>

2743
01:48:32.331 --> 01:48:34.810
<v Speaker 1>that it's actually more effective to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it orally,</v>

2744
01:48:35.010 --> 01:48:36.410
<v Speaker 1>orally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of doctors</v>

2745
01:48:36.450 --> 01:48:37.283
<v Speaker 2>trusted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2746
01:48:37.410 --> 01:48:39.660
<v Speaker 2>one of my doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Brad Arches back home said that,</v>

2747
01:48:39.670 --> 01:48:42.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave me a lot of tips because when</v>

2748
01:48:42.631 --> 01:48:43.860
<v Speaker 2>this came in I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm freaking out.</v>

2749
01:48:43.861 --> 01:48:44.671
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck dude,</v>

2750
01:48:44.671 --> 01:48:45.650
<v Speaker 2>they're taken with these ivs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

2751
01:48:45.651 --> 01:48:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Have to go back 55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No freaking out,</v>

2752
01:48:47.851 --> 01:48:50.520
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were sending me all this stuff,</v>

2753
01:48:50.521 --> 01:48:50.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2754
01:48:50.821 --> 01:48:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot about it because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2755
01:48:52.261 --> 01:48:53.340
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well do this.</v>

2756
01:48:53.341 --> 01:48:56.970
<v Speaker 2>And then I met Daryl Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my wrestling coaches who's a</v>

2757
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.130
<v Speaker 2>WHO's a phenom Olympian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2758
01:48:59.131 --> 01:49:01.140
<v Speaker 2>he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to put in this robot dude.</v>

2759
01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:02.700
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to start building your cardio</v>

2760
01:49:02.701 --> 01:49:03.181
<v Speaker 2>base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2761
01:49:03.181 --> 01:49:05.430
<v Speaker 2>you've always just killed yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed yourself.</v>

2762
01:49:05.431 --> 01:49:07.530
<v Speaker 2>And then had a kid yourself making</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

2763
01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:09.570
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never build a cardio base.</v>

2764
01:49:09.571 --> 01:49:12.660
<v Speaker 2>He never had a solid foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we started these heart rate</v>

2765
01:49:12.661 --> 01:49:15.420
<v Speaker 2>monitors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vo twos and put in these broad programs,</v>

2766
01:49:15.421 --> 01:49:17.160
<v Speaker 2>putting these different sprints.</v>

2767
01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:18.630
<v Speaker 1>But you were always in good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2768
01:49:18.631 --> 01:49:20.400
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by you didn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardio base?</v>

2769
01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was more or less to sprint.</v>

2770
01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:25.180
<v Speaker 2>It was just top heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really had a low intensity.</v>

2771
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:28.710
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it like the vo two Max?</v>

2772
01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:32.560
<v Speaker 2>The reason why people do that is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people wanted to know how they</v>

2773
01:49:32.561 --> 01:49:34.930
<v Speaker 2>would build endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people think that you just need to</v>

2774
01:49:34.931 --> 01:49:35.531
<v Speaker 2>sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprint,</v>

2775
01:49:35.531 --> 01:49:36.041
<v Speaker 2>sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprint,</v>

2776
01:49:36.041 --> 01:49:37.180
<v Speaker 2>sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're gonna be in good shape.</v>

2777
01:49:37.181 --> 01:49:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be in good shape,</v>

2778
01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:42.400
<v Speaker 2>but none of them had a low base cardio</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they would just run that like say</v>

2779
01:49:42.401 --> 01:49:44.610
<v Speaker 2>like a four point eight or five point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2780
01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:46.570
<v Speaker 2>on a treadmill for a long period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2781
01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:50.710
<v Speaker 2>And actually how you build the anaerobic</v>
<v Speaker 2>system a lot better is through low base</v>

2782
01:49:50.711 --> 01:49:52.900
<v Speaker 2>cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's done based system or is it</v>

2783
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.160
<v Speaker 2>aerobics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aerobics,</v>

2784
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:57.820
<v Speaker 2>aerobics system is exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2785
01:49:57.980 --> 01:49:58.690
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

2786
01:49:58.690 --> 01:50:02.970
<v Speaker 2>they find that you can expand recovery</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2787
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:05.560
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work harder and a lactic threshold by</v>

2788
01:50:05.561 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 2>doing the low base cardio like Diaz</v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

2789
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just constant pressure because you</v>

2790
01:50:11.091 --> 01:50:14.160
<v Speaker 2>got that guy who's going to sprint and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna head out and then like he's</v>

2791
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:15.380
<v Speaker 2>going to drop down in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2792
01:50:15.381 --> 01:50:17.020
<v Speaker 2>in that round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy might be here,</v>

2793
01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:18.780
<v Speaker 2>but then he's going to sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then he just,</v>

2794
01:50:18.850 --> 01:50:20.680
<v Speaker 2>he just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just gonna slowly start to pull in.</v>

2795
01:50:20.681 --> 01:50:23.620
<v Speaker 2>That's how diaz he slowly just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>just passes you.</v>

2796
01:50:23.621 --> 01:50:25.810
<v Speaker 2>The guy may sprint and be punching a</v>
<v Speaker 2>punching him.</v>

2797
01:50:25.811 --> 01:50:26.910
<v Speaker 2>And he just sticks pow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>POW,</v>

2798
01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:27.390
<v Speaker 2>POW.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2799
01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:29.620
<v Speaker 2>well Diaz is hitting you with 50 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>punches,</v>

2800
01:50:29.621 --> 01:50:34.390
<v Speaker 2>but he's hitting you with 30 times more</v>
<v Speaker 2>constants and then in the round he's</v>

2801
01:50:34.391 --> 01:50:37.210
<v Speaker 2>able to recover even better while you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>already at lactic threshold.</v>

2802
01:50:37.450 --> 01:50:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Then you try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to fire up the heart rate again.</v>

2803
01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:42.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's like managed to shot and</v>

2804
01:50:42.090 --> 01:50:46.300
<v Speaker 2>they found out through those video and</v>
<v Speaker 2>those runs that the aerobic base is</v>

2805
01:50:46.301 --> 01:50:50.020
<v Speaker 2>built more through low base cardio and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's talking about building</v>

2806
01:50:50.021 --> 01:50:52.840
<v Speaker 2>the base because you can't slow pace</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio low,</v>

2807
01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:53.733
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>

2808
01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:56.710
<v Speaker 2>low pace and that you can't just build a</v>
<v Speaker 2>house without a base.</v>

2809
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Need that base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I really started</v>

2810
01:50:58.451 --> 01:51:01.570
<v Speaker 2>learning and honestly I feel a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>

2811
01:51:01.571 --> 01:51:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I feel a lot more healthier and in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio even a lot better in the fights I</v>

2812
01:51:05.861 --> 01:51:06.620
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

2813
01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:11.180
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the long runs and the long cardio,</v>

2814
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:16.130
<v Speaker 1>it sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a solid foundation and then sprints on</v>

2815
01:51:16.131 --> 01:51:19.610
<v Speaker 1>top of that explosion on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got To do it all.</v>

2816
01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you follow like a Tabata protocol or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that?</v>

2817
01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't know was to butter Tabata is a,</v>

2818
01:51:25.301 --> 01:51:28.750
<v Speaker 1>an endurance protocol that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>

2819
01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:33.940
<v Speaker 1>why it's called Tabata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe it's like a 22nd sprints</v>

2820
01:51:34.670 --> 01:51:37.550
<v Speaker 1>followed by 10 seconds of rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 seconds sprints.</v>

2821
01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:38.810
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of.</v>

2822
01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.960
<v Speaker 1>My friend John Rollo told me about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of athletes apparently follow</v>

2823
01:51:44.001 --> 01:51:44.870
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

2824
01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:47.990
<v Speaker 1>What is Tabata Tabata training is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most popular one of the most popular</v>

2825
01:51:47.991 --> 01:51:51.860
<v Speaker 1>forms of high intensity interval</v>
<v Speaker 1>training consists of eight rounds of</v>

2826
01:51:51.861 --> 01:51:56.420
<v Speaker 1>ultra high intensity exercises in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific 20 seconds on 10 seconds off</v>

2827
01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:57.530
<v Speaker 1>interval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2828
01:51:57.590 --> 01:52:00.700
<v Speaker 1>So when it says eight rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I guess eight,</v>

2829
01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:04.740
<v Speaker 1>22nd sprints and eight ten second rests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2830
01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:06.560
<v Speaker 2>I do a little bit of Tabata training for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2831
01:52:06.650 --> 01:52:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean we even go even doing 30 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 seconds and then you know,</v>

2832
01:52:10.941 --> 01:52:15.770
<v Speaker 2>eventually it peaks off in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for sure 100 percent and be be doing</v>

2833
01:52:15.771 --> 01:52:17.240
<v Speaker 2>that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then low based training.</v>

2834
01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:18.370
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2835
01:52:18.370 --> 01:52:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Interesting that you're a big proponent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that long slow style because that was</v>

2836
01:52:23.711 --> 01:52:26.920
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that some people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't fighters,</v>

2837
01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but we're a strength and conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would say that that's not going</v>

2838
01:52:30.081 --> 01:52:31.860
<v Speaker 1>to benefit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2839
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:34.690
<v Speaker 1>they would say that's not what you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do in a fight because a fight is</v>

2840
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:37.690
<v Speaker 1>explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fast and you don't have that slow</v>

2841
01:52:37.691 --> 01:52:39.940
<v Speaker 1>running thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But old school,</v>

2842
01:52:40.090 --> 01:52:42.970
<v Speaker 1>like old school boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all ran like that.</v>

2843
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.320
<v Speaker 1>They all ran long miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2844
01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>And they ran</v>

2845
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 3>slower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see Mike Tyson in his early</v>

2846
01:52:48.110 --> 01:52:50.520
<v Speaker 3>days?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just slowly running for him?</v>

2847
01:52:50.590 --> 01:52:52.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was running five miles,</v>

2848
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:54.710
<v Speaker 3>five miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could probably get done within low,</v>

2849
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:55.581
<v Speaker 3>low pace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2850
01:52:55.581 --> 01:52:56.930
<v Speaker 3>35,</v>
<v Speaker 3>45 minutes.</v>

2851
01:52:57.460 --> 01:52:58.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda interesting because my</v>

2852
01:52:58.581 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 3>strength conditioning coach now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Castro,</v>

2853
01:53:00.471 --> 01:53:02.450
<v Speaker 3>he used to workout with Don Frye and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be like,</v>

2854
01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:03.471
<v Speaker 3>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2855
01:53:03.471 --> 01:53:06.170
<v Speaker 3>one day I was stretching into the like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what the fuck you do get,</v>

<v Speaker 3>get in the ring.</v>

2857
01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:09.110
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take off your shirt,</v>

2858
01:53:09.111 --> 01:53:09.950
<v Speaker 3>let's do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2859
01:53:09.951 --> 01:53:11.930
<v Speaker 3>And then like they just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was no,</v>

2860
01:53:11.931 --> 01:53:13.930
<v Speaker 3>there was no structure to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now you know,</v>

2861
01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:15.500
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're meeting these coaches and the,</v>

2862
01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scientists and behind it,</v>

2863
01:53:17.091 --> 01:53:17.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2864
01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:18.380
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2865
01:53:18.381 --> 01:53:20.360
<v Speaker 3>my only a Olympian coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darrell Christian,</v>

2866
01:53:20.361 --> 01:53:21.290
<v Speaker 3>he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2867
01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.480
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot build high based cardio,</v>

2868
01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:24.410
<v Speaker 3>bike sprints,</v>
<v Speaker 3>press print,</v>

2869
01:53:24.411 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 3>killing herself.</v>

2870
01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:27.310
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to build this low base and he's</v>

2871
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:29.300
<v Speaker 3>also a spinal surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2872
01:53:29.301 --> 01:53:31.880
<v Speaker 3>and he's also been in the game for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time and he's like,</v>

2873
01:53:31.881 --> 01:53:35.690
<v Speaker 3>that's how all these fighters and top</v>
<v Speaker 3>notch guys would stay in shape all year</v>

2874
01:53:35.691 --> 01:53:36.920
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was drilling,</v>

2875
01:53:36.921 --> 01:53:37.551
<v Speaker 3>drilling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drilling,</v>

2876
01:53:37.551 --> 01:53:38.510
<v Speaker 3>drilling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>

2877
01:53:38.511 --> 01:53:41.240
<v Speaker 3>we would just do long runs anytime we</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a break.</v>

2878
01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.400
<v Speaker 3>We had to be doing long runs like every</v>
<v Speaker 3>other day.</v>

2879
01:53:43.401 --> 01:53:45.080
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why we were able to make weight,</v>

2880
01:53:45.081 --> 01:53:47.900
<v Speaker 3>stay on task and be in shape all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2881
01:53:48.330 --> 01:53:51.500
<v Speaker 3>And he's to make sense man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it really makes sense when you talk</v>

2882
01:53:51.501 --> 01:53:52.960
<v Speaker 3>about the Diaz brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2883
01:53:52.961 --> 01:53:54.110
<v Speaker 3>as I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diaz,</v>

2884
01:53:54.111 --> 01:53:57.730
<v Speaker 3>but really both the Diaz brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But nate is a little different than NEC</v>

2885
01:53:57.740 --> 01:53:59.780
<v Speaker 3>has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nate will explode more than nick.</v>

2886
01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:03.380
<v Speaker 3>Nate has a little more fire power when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes after dudes,</v>

2887
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:08.270
<v Speaker 3>but both those guys are known for doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>triathlons and you know,</v>

2888
01:54:08.271 --> 01:54:13.271
<v Speaker 3>nick even more so than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what they smoke weed to do</v>

2889
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:17.540
<v Speaker 3>and then they and then they go out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they'll just run forever and that's</v>

2890
01:54:17.541 --> 01:54:18.374
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2891
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:20.540
<v Speaker 3>You're just building that base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>building that car to you and they,</v>

2892
01:54:20.541 --> 01:54:23.090
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had those mental breakthroughs.</v>

2893
01:54:23.091 --> 01:54:23.451
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2894
01:54:23.451 --> 01:54:28.280
<v Speaker 3>I ran three hours after practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck are you going to do</v>

2895
01:54:28.281 --> 01:54:30.380
<v Speaker 3>to me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to keep pacing on you and</v>

2896
01:54:30.381 --> 01:54:31.021
<v Speaker 3>you'll see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2897
01:54:31.021 --> 01:54:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I can break people in the gym by</v>
<v Speaker 3>constant pressure pace and then like I</v>

2898
01:54:35.601 --> 01:54:37.640
<v Speaker 3>can recover within 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 seconds.</v>

2899
01:54:37.641 --> 01:54:38.474
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2900
01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:39.790
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2901
01:54:39.810 --> 01:54:42.500

2902
01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:45.260
<v Speaker 3>truly does work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just a simple science.</v>

2903
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it funny because the glamor stuff</v>

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Throwing fucking tires around a parking</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot and sledge hammer in a tire on it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The glamorous shit is ridiculous,</v>

2932
01:56:01.590 --> 01:56:04.270
<v Speaker 1>but hitting the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2933
01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:06.420
<v Speaker 1>that's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more fun to do anyway.</v>

2934
01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this it?</v>

2935
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:10.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2936
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it seems like not that big</v>

2937
01:56:15.511 --> 01:56:16.470
<v Speaker 1>a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get this little bitch ass.</v>

2939
01:56:18.451 --> 01:56:23.451
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only doing 35 pounds but my long</v>

2940
01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:29.120
<v Speaker 1>periods of time doing just difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like this and just constantly</v>

2941
01:56:30.091 --> 01:56:33.420
<v Speaker 1>moving and squad and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something real to</v>

2942
01:56:33.421 --> 01:56:34.170
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2943
01:56:34.170 --> 01:56:38.190
<v Speaker 1>I think running is something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about long slow</v>

2944
01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:39.390
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mental,</v>

2945
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it is that right</v>

2946
01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:43.420
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody go out on a run and don't take</v>

2947
01:56:43.421 --> 01:56:45.550
<v Speaker 2>your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go out on a run where you have to</v>

2948
01:56:45.551 --> 01:56:46.810
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like say you run two,</v>

2949
01:56:46.811 --> 01:56:49.330
<v Speaker 2>two and a half miles and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to music and you have to go back.</v>

2950
01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people they just,</v>

2951
01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:53.580
<v Speaker 2>they'll run like 15 minutes and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2952
01:56:53.590 --> 01:56:55.870
<v Speaker 2>they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say don't take your phone,</v>

2953
01:56:56.230 --> 01:56:58.660
<v Speaker 2>what do you really try to challenge</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself like one time?</v>

2954
01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Just because sometimes I listen to music</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes I just like to listen to</v>

2955
01:57:01.631 --> 01:57:03.160
<v Speaker 2>my thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what am I thinking right now?</v>

2956
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:06.710
<v Speaker 2>What are my thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are my thoughts bringing me and uh,</v>

2957
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:10.630
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's meant it's mentally you'll find</v>

2958
01:57:10.631 --> 01:57:12.220
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more mentally,</v>

2959
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:14.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything than the physical.</v>

2960
01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you get addicted to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Runner's high.</v>

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what sex is better?</v>

2962
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.480

2964
01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Sleep dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially inclined sprints.</v>

2965
01:57:24.850 --> 01:57:26.650

<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

2966
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:30.100
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely is a good sprint hollow.</v>

2967
01:57:32.230 --> 01:57:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you're doing like real intense</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

2968
01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:38.080
<v Speaker 2>like high intensity things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprinting they say is really good for</v>

2969
01:57:38.081 --> 01:57:39.250
<v Speaker 2>your testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2970
01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Hill sprints in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2971
01:57:41.650 --> 01:57:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hill sprints or inclines a treadmill's</v>

2972
01:57:45.250 --> 01:57:46.083
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2973
01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:50.020
<v Speaker 2>even working with kettlebells ever hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a good kettlebell session.</v>

2974
01:57:50.021 --> 01:57:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Then we can just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2975
01:57:51.071 --> 01:57:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I feel freaking good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your testosterone's moving,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you just feel a lot more BC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2977
01:57:57.281 --> 01:58:00.580
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting how high intensity</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff does that spikes your endocrine</v>

2978
01:58:00.581 --> 01:58:01.810
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2979
01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to feel bad and say it's a</v>

2980
01:58:03.971 --> 01:58:06.970
<v Speaker 2>natural good feeling that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 30 years old and never injected</v>

2981
01:58:06.971 --> 01:58:09.060
<v Speaker 2>anything in my life and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2982
01:58:09.090 --> 01:58:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I like that high and the mental aspect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

2983
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:16.150
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of interesting too because</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do take steroids just like man</v>

2984
01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:17.230
<v Speaker 2>now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little,</v>

2985
01:58:17.230 --> 01:58:19.710
<v Speaker 2>that little edge that they got the</v>
<v Speaker 2>little high than they were getting in.</v>

2986
01:58:19.711 --> 01:58:20.381
<v Speaker 2>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2987
01:58:20.381 --> 01:58:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when they stopped doing that,</v>

2988
01:58:22.810 --> 01:58:24.690
<v Speaker 2>mentally they get fucked dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2989
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:27.130
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like man must still the same guy.</v>

2990
01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:30.250
<v Speaker 2>My Body looks different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really put in the work with.</v>

2991
01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.020
<v Speaker 2>He used to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2992
01:58:32.021 --> 01:58:33.340
<v Speaker 2>and then like what you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're like,</v>

2993
01:58:33.341 --> 01:58:35.200
<v Speaker 2>man is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental has got to be broken,</v>

2994
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:37.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what the hell</v>

2995
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you ever see Dan Gable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2996
01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 1>or hear him talking about that when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was competing against the back</v>

2997
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.960
<v Speaker 3>during the doping days where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians,</v>

2998
01:58:44.110 --> 01:58:48.100
<v Speaker 3>he knew they were all on steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his philosophy was banned from the</v>

2999
01:58:48.101 --> 01:58:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't actually,</v>

3000
01:58:49.901 --> 01:58:52.810
<v Speaker 3>they didn't change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were about to get banned totally,</v>

3001
01:58:52.811 --> 01:58:56.680
<v Speaker 3>but they pulled back and they got a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with Brazil.</v>

3002
01:58:56.681 --> 01:58:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Do you hear those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3003
01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:01.690
<v Speaker 3>those Australian people were staying in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Olympic village like this fucking</v>

3004
01:59:01.691 --> 01:59:03.190
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The toilets were all backed up.</v>

3005
01:59:03.191 --> 01:59:06.040
<v Speaker 3>His electrical wires hanging out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking walls.</v>

3006
01:59:06.041 --> 01:59:08.920
<v Speaker 3>It's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was over the Dan Gable thing</v>

3007
01:59:08.930 --> 01:59:11.680
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Gable is a fucking animal,</v>

3008
01:59:11.681 --> 01:59:13.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the best wrestlers ever.</v>

3009
01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Dan said that when he was competing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he felt like it didn't matter if those</v>

3010
01:59:18.941 --> 01:59:21.880
<v Speaker 3>guys did steroids because they didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>the work.</v>

3011
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:23.710
<v Speaker 3>So they knew that they didn't do the</v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

3012
01:59:23.711 --> 01:59:26.440
<v Speaker 3>So in their head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if one thing went wrong,</v>

3013
01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.780
<v Speaker 3>they would unfold and fall apart and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>will break them.</v>

3014
01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:33.100
<v Speaker 3>He felt like he had a mental advantage</v>
<v Speaker 3>over guys that did steroids.</v>

3015
01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:36.580
<v Speaker 3>The guys that cheated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were not going to be able to</v>

3016
01:59:36.581 --> 01:59:37.810
<v Speaker 3>beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't matter.</v>

3017
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:38.980
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was right.</v>

3018
01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:42.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean he beat everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that when,</v>

3019
01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:44.350
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing these runs and he's</v>

3020
01:59:44.351 --> 01:59:46.930
<v Speaker 3>mental breakthroughs and you're really</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting in the work and when it's all</v>

3021
01:59:46.931 --> 01:59:49.390
<v Speaker 3>said and done and then you're peaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything kind of wears off and</v>

3022
01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:50.590
<v Speaker 3>everything's just flowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3023
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:53.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like you just look in the mirror</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

3024
01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:55.360
<v Speaker 3>look at that guy and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3025
01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:57.580
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing that you can do that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to break me.</v>

3026
01:59:57.610 --> 01:59:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I've already been broken down many of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

3027
01:59:59.491 --> 02:00:02.680
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing the army does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They break you down to build you up and</v>

3028
02:00:02.681 --> 02:00:04.930
<v Speaker 3>then when you're in that complete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've,</v>

3029
02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:07.390
<v Speaker 3>when you've pushed yourself passionate</v>
<v Speaker 3>limits and you've had those mental</v>

3030
02:00:07.391 --> 02:00:09.640
<v Speaker 3>breakthroughs of where you thought about</v>
<v Speaker 3>quitting,</v>

3031
02:00:09.641 --> 02:00:12.850
<v Speaker 3>but then you kept going and then you did</v>
<v Speaker 3>it again and again and again,</v>

3032
02:00:12.851 --> 02:00:15.220
<v Speaker 3>and you keep pushing like your boy did</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 100 miles.</v>

3033
02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Now he's going to do 200.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3034
02:00:17.051 --> 02:00:20.650
<v Speaker 3>just mentally he has an advantage over a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people.</v>

3035
02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:22.780
<v Speaker 3>You get comfortable in that horrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

3036
02:00:23.050 --> 02:00:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being uncomfortable.</v>

3037
02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3038
02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:27.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan gambled those.</v>

3039
02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:31.180
<v Speaker 3>There's a cautionary tale on that as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well because Dan Gables had two hip</v>

3040
02:00:31.181 --> 02:00:32.980
<v Speaker 3>replacements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knee replacements,</v>

3041
02:00:32.981 --> 02:00:34.030
<v Speaker 3>like his body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

3042
02:00:34.150 --> 02:00:37.200
<v Speaker 3>He's so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He broke his body and that's uh,</v>

3043
02:00:37.230 --> 02:00:38.063
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

3044
02:00:38.210 --> 02:00:39.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered about guys like</v>

3045
02:00:39.881 --> 02:00:42.940
<v Speaker 3>maybe Cain Velasquez or these guys that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are constantly getting injured.</v>

3046
02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Like they're almost too tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3047
02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're not training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3085
02:01:58.160 --> 02:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got one of supernovas that's,</v>

3086
02:01:59.931 --> 02:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I liked that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like the big one even better.</v>

3087
02:02:02.630 --> 02:02:06.620
<v Speaker 1>The Wad supernova from a rogue fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have those.</v>

3088
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I live by that big one man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the little one,</v>

3089
02:02:09.351 --> 02:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>but honestly more pinpoint the ones will</v>
<v Speaker 1>break up like the bigger areas and it's</v>

3090
02:02:13.581 --> 02:02:14.414
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when she,</v>

3091
02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>once you break that down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get even more pinpoint.</v>

3092
02:02:17.090 --> 02:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In lacrosse ball,</v>

3093
02:02:18.591 --> 02:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>he didn't use you loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lacrosse balls just as good and a lot of</v>

3094
02:02:22.221 --> 02:02:24.440
<v Speaker 1>ways that one's got a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>texture to it.</v>

3095
02:02:24.441 --> 02:02:25.940
<v Speaker 1>So some people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3096
02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is legitimate here.</v>

3097
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Rogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3098
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>So when you broke fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a lot of great shit man.</v>

3099
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I got one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a reverse hyper machines from them</v>

3100
02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>two in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever used that reverse hyper,</v>

3101
02:02:38.370 --> 02:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>hyper ice fibrates sort of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3102
02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:40.791
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3103
02:02:40.791 --> 02:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reverse hypers.</v>

3104
02:02:41.751 --> 02:02:42.581
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3105
02:02:42.581 --> 02:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a decompression machine.</v>

3106
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3107
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:47.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lift with it.</v>

3108
02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It's Louie Simmons from west side</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbell invented it.</v>

3109
02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:51.320
<v Speaker 1>And what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3110
02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can show it right here.</v>

3111
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:56.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

3112
02:02:56.700 --> 02:02:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it pulls you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show them in a video if you can,</v>

3113
02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you lean your body over this platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you let the weight down,</v>

3114
02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:09.330
<v Speaker 1>it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

3115
02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:12.620
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the active decompression for your</v>

3116
02:03:12.621 --> 02:03:14.210
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Louie Simmons.</v>

3117
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:17.240
<v Speaker 1>He's a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much a legendary power lifter</v>

3118
02:03:17.241 --> 02:03:20.540
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also super smart dude and so like</v>

3119
02:03:20.541 --> 02:03:22.910
<v Speaker 1>when she's lifting it up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's going down,</v>

3120
02:03:22.911 --> 02:03:27.911
<v Speaker 1>it's decompressing her spine so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's strengthening it on the up,</v>

3121
02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but on the down it's pulling it apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so because the distance that the</v>

3122
02:03:32.661 --> 02:03:37.661
<v Speaker 1>weight travels underneath you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it asks for an active decompression of</v>

3123
02:03:37.821 --> 02:03:38.960
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's phenomenal,</v>

3124
02:03:38.961 --> 02:03:41.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having some back issues.</v>

3125
02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Nothing helped me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3126
02:03:44.210 --> 02:03:46.910

<v Speaker 2>Friday I like at 4:30.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I go and do a hot yoga and I do an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half and that in itself is a</v>

3129

<v Speaker 2>mental thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>through them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn things.</v>

3139
02:04:13.290 --> 02:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that twice a week and I've done it,</v>

3140
02:04:15.521 --> 02:04:17.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to lay on my back and just</v>

3141
02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>focus on breathing because all my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my job,</v>

3142
02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:22.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're already cutting weight and</v>

3143
02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:24.910
<v Speaker 2>got a full week of training and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably dehydrated too.</v>

3144
02:04:25.670 --> 02:04:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I always try to drink a lot of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>

3145
02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm drinking water constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to get over a gallon a day.</v>

3146
02:04:30.491 --> 02:04:34.200
<v Speaker 2>I got to alkaline machine machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3147
02:04:34.650 --> 02:04:36.700
<v Speaker 2>What does that shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It keeps your body in higher alkaline</v>

3148
02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:38.400
<v Speaker 2>which your body naturally</v>

3149
02:04:38.410 --> 02:04:42.930
<v Speaker 3>he's got like a five or whatever they</v>
<v Speaker 3>say to be over a five or better because</v>

3150
02:04:42.931 --> 02:04:46.290
<v Speaker 3>you're a cancer cannot survive in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher alkaline,</v>

3151
02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:49.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost acs type stuff.</v>

3152
02:04:49.591 --> 02:04:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Like if your body's like broken down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you're able to get sick as if</v>

3153
02:04:52.710 --> 02:04:54.510
<v Speaker 3>your immune system is broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3154
02:04:54.511 --> 02:04:57.750
<v Speaker 3>this actually helps with a faster</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehydration recovery and keeps your body</v>

3155
02:04:57.751 --> 02:05:01.950
<v Speaker 3>in a higher alkaline state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's harder to get shit done.</v>

3156
02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3157
02:05:04.410 --> 02:05:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Jamie looked that up because I've heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you really can't change the</v>

3158
02:05:08.461 --> 02:05:11.490
<v Speaker 3>alkaline state of your body or of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood.</v>

3159
02:05:11.491 --> 02:05:12.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that you can do it.</v>

3160
02:05:12.900 --> 02:05:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wheat Grass keeps you in higher alkaline</v>

3161
02:05:15.271 --> 02:05:16.890
<v Speaker 3>and I mean I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3162
02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:19.470
<v Speaker 3>but is it a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your blood more alkaline?</v>

3163
02:05:19.471 --> 02:05:20.304
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

3164
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:22.560
<v Speaker 3>what is getting more alkaline?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your blood?</v>

3165
02:05:23.010 --> 02:05:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true,</v>

3166
02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:27.060
<v Speaker 3>but what about the honest supplement</v>
<v Speaker 3>says say that uh,</v>

3167
02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:28.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're from higher,</v>

3168
02:05:28.531 --> 02:05:32.790
<v Speaker 3>a higher altitude and that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting it from these grounds.</v>

3169
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:34.110
<v Speaker 3>That's cordyceps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms,</v>

3170
02:05:34.111 --> 02:05:37.440
<v Speaker 3>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cordyceps mushroom is a mushroom that</v>

3171
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:41.610
<v Speaker 3>aids and oxygen utilization that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have anything to do with see what,</v>

3172
02:05:41.611 --> 02:05:43.270
<v Speaker 3>what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3173
02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:46.170
<v Speaker 3>there's like a lot of talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>alkaline,</v>

3174
02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:49.130
<v Speaker 3>like making your blood alkaline and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>it changes.</v>

3175
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:52.260
<v Speaker 3>But I remember reading something that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Horseshit,</v>

3176
02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:55.380
<v Speaker 3>but first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is all healthy.</v>

3177
02:05:55.410 --> 02:05:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're telling me you'd taken</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheat grass juice,</v>

3178
02:05:57.780 --> 02:05:59.790
<v Speaker 3>you're getting fido nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting,</v>

3179
02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:01.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of minerals that you're</v>

3180
02:06:01.591 --> 02:06:05.580
<v Speaker 3>getting healthy vitamins for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely really good for you.</v>

3181
02:06:05.581 --> 02:06:08.070
<v Speaker 3>So wheat grass juice is phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3182
02:06:08.071 --> 02:06:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to eat my body and in the state</v>

3183
02:06:10.411 --> 02:06:12.930
<v Speaker 3>and I'm always drinking that water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Test your blood.</v>

3184
02:06:12.931 --> 02:06:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know that you're in an</v>

3185
02:06:14.431 --> 02:06:16.620
<v Speaker 3>alkaline state?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you testing yourself?</v>

3186
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have tested,</v>

3187
02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:20.730
<v Speaker 3>I've tested the water of life taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>strips and test it out,</v>

3188
02:06:20.731 --> 02:06:21.330
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>

3189
02:06:21.330 --> 02:06:23.100
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tested my blood to see if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>am.</v>

3190
02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:24.840
<v Speaker 3>The only time I've done that was with</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3191
02:06:25.290 --> 02:06:27.060
<v Speaker 3>when I took like the Piss test is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>test,</v>

3192
02:06:27.061 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 3>my rehydration and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy he lives let you look it in the</v>

3193
02:06:30.331 --> 02:06:31.280
<v Speaker 3>scope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Usada Guy,</v>

3194
02:06:31.281 --> 02:06:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he comes in and he's like,</v>

3195
02:06:32.331 --> 02:06:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3196
02:06:33.710 --> 02:06:36.120

<v Speaker 3>And then he'll put it in there.</v>

3197
02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:37.650
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy he was,</v>

3198
02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.060
<v Speaker 3>the last time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

3199
02:06:39.061 --> 02:06:39.990
<v Speaker 3>look at the light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that?</v>

3200
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:42.000
<v Speaker 3>And like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty high and he's like,</v>

3201
02:06:42.001 --> 02:06:42.750
<v Speaker 3>this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3202
02:06:42.750 --> 02:06:44.220
<v Speaker 3>that means you're really hydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3203
02:06:44.221 --> 02:06:46.590
<v Speaker 3>that's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely good to be hydrated.</v>

3204
02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Drinking a lot of water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're training as much</v>

3205
02:06:49.771 --> 02:06:51.750
<v Speaker 3>as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

3206
02:06:51.751 --> 02:06:52.920
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>

3207
02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:57.960
<v Speaker 3>They say that just a small percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dehydration has a big impact on I fletc</v>

3208
02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:59.480
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3209
02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:00.353
<v Speaker 3>Thirty percent.</v>

3210
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Really a little bit dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3211
02:07:02.530 --> 02:07:06.840
<v Speaker 3>A decrease it by 30 percent towing a fax</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

3212
02:07:06.841 --> 02:07:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I've learned in the Fitness Vet</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lockhart,</v>

3213
02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:10.613
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3214
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:13.500
<v Speaker 3>the sumo wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only twice a day,</v>

3215
02:07:13.501 --> 02:07:17.130
<v Speaker 3>but they're eating only twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their body conserves a lot more because</v>

3216
02:07:17.131 --> 02:07:17.521
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3217
02:07:17.521 --> 02:07:18.810
<v Speaker 3>this is the only food that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get.</v>

3218
02:07:19.170 --> 02:07:23.670
<v Speaker 3>And they hold onto it as competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we eat a $45 wheat like five,</v>

3219
02:07:23.671 --> 02:07:26.610
<v Speaker 3>six times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our body constantly pushing it out.</v>

3220
02:07:26.611 --> 02:07:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3221
02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:29.780
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get more than with just like water,</v>

3222
02:07:29.781 --> 02:07:32.460
<v Speaker 3>water's like gas and where you put in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you're going to burn off.</v>

3223
02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:33.271
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

3224
02:07:33.271 --> 02:07:37.630
<v Speaker 3>that's a counter intuitive thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear about guys cutting weight.</v>

3225
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:40.960
<v Speaker 3>They drink a ton of water before they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to dehydrate themselves,</v>

3226
02:07:40.961 --> 02:07:42.940
<v Speaker 3>so your body's used to extending that</v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

3227
02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:45.400
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't try to hold onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the idea behind it?</v>

3228
02:07:45.401 --> 02:07:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse.</v>

3229
02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:47.321
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3230
02:07:47.321 --> 02:07:50.140
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get more and more so just</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll just keep expanding out,</v>

3231
02:07:50.290 --> 02:07:51.370
<v Speaker 3>push it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push it out.</v>

3232
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Do you fuck around with distilled water</v>
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

3233
02:07:55.541 --> 02:07:57.470
<v Speaker 3>I haven't in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't heard that.</v>

3234
02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:59.440
<v Speaker 3>It's of dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not good for your body,</v>

3235
02:07:59.441 --> 02:08:01.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because your body can actually be.</v>

3236
02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:06.940
<v Speaker 3>It strips you of minerals because you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your water's supposed to be attached to</v>

3237
02:08:06.941 --> 02:08:09.670
<v Speaker 3>all these minerals and when you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking only distilled water,</v>

3238
02:08:09.671 --> 02:08:11.130
<v Speaker 3>your body kind of freaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3239
02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:12.940
<v Speaker 3>That can be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too much of that.</v>

3240
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:16.840
<v Speaker 3>And I've heard of people kinda like</v>
<v Speaker 3>convulsing.</v>

3241
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:19.060
<v Speaker 3>I think I sent somebody from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate fighter show one time,</v>

3242
02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:21.820
<v Speaker 3>like water load and then fell asleep and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he was like,</v>

3243
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:25.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that probably freaked me out a little</v>

3244
02:08:25.181 --> 02:08:26.880
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's fucked up is if you could</v>

3245
02:08:26.881 --> 02:08:28.450
<v Speaker 3>drink too much water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can die.</v>

3246
02:08:28.630 --> 02:08:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

3247
02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:30.970
<v Speaker 3>I saw our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember,</v>

3248
02:08:30.971 --> 02:08:34.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Sacramento I think.</v>

3249
02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.610
<v Speaker 3>And there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a San Jose,</v>

3250
02:08:36.611 --> 02:08:38.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember if it was a local radio</v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

3251
02:08:38.981 --> 02:08:41.680
<v Speaker 3>had a contest to drink the most water to</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a playstation.</v>

3252
02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:44.080
<v Speaker 3>And this lady drank so much water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She died.</v>

3253
02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3254
02:08:45.431 --> 02:08:47.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know you could fucking die from</v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

3255
02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like frats,</v>

3256
02:08:49.991 --> 02:08:54.970
<v Speaker 3>like people like pledging for frats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have died from it to a hazing</v>

3257
02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:55.951
<v Speaker 3>type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3258
02:08:55.951 --> 02:08:56.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3259
02:08:56.681 --> 02:08:58.600
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funny thing about alkaline.</v>

3260
02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:02.180
<v Speaker 5>I found a website talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if this is how legit said</v>

3261
02:09:02.181 --> 02:09:05.260
<v Speaker 5>per precise nutrition.com.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just talks about the claims of</v>

3262
02:09:05.261 --> 02:09:10.261
<v Speaker 5>alkaline water and it really says</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no legit studies that even said</v>

3263
02:09:10.951 --> 02:09:13.150
<v Speaker 5>that it'll do anything to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did that,</v>

3264
02:09:13.151 --> 02:09:16.390
<v Speaker 5>you were that you can even make it</v>
<v Speaker 5>change to an alkaline state.</v>

3265
02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:16.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3266
02:09:16.861 --> 02:09:19.680
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was seeing that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>variables,</v>

3267
02:09:19.710 --> 02:09:24.710
<v Speaker 3>the variation is so small that that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're not going to get that from</v>

3268
02:09:26.250 --> 02:09:30.530
<v Speaker 3>like water tested the water before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never tested my own blood and I've</v>

3269
02:09:30.570 --> 02:09:32.790
<v Speaker 3>only seen the that I was rehydrated at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3270
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:35.430
<v Speaker 3>at a high alkaline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean there might be some sort of</v>

3271
02:09:35.431 --> 02:09:39.630
<v Speaker 3>benefit to it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you can't like change the actual</v>

3272
02:09:39.631 --> 02:09:42.180
<v Speaker 3>state of your blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's some sort of benefit for</v>

3273
02:09:42.181 --> 02:09:44.520
<v Speaker 3>it biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One maybe ask George.</v>

3274
02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he would know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably know more than we would.</v>

3275
02:09:47.770 --> 02:09:51.170
<v Speaker 5>The only thing it does say that might be</v>
<v Speaker 5>why it's his kidney.</v>

3276
02:09:51.171 --> 02:09:55.190
<v Speaker 5>Patients should avoid alkaline water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why athletes and exercises are</v>

3277
02:09:55.191 --> 02:09:57.440
<v Speaker 5>one subgroup who might benefit from</v>
<v Speaker 5>drinking it.</v>

3278
02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:59.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that statement really</v>
<v Speaker 5>means,</v>

3279
02:09:59.691 --> 02:10:03.710
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the only thing really adds in</v>

3280
02:10:03.711 --> 02:10:04.220
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3281
02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever fuck around with</v>
<v Speaker 3>cryotherapy?</v>

3282
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:07.250
<v Speaker 3>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3283
02:10:07.251 --> 02:10:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I really find that fund the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find more or less a mile fashion.</v>

3284
02:10:10.221 --> 02:10:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Having somebody digging in with like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>elbow or something,</v>

3285
02:10:12.381 --> 02:10:14.510
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot more beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done cryotherapy.</v>

3286
02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:16.790
<v Speaker 3>What about both?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3287
02:10:16.850 --> 02:10:19.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do for Rehab.</v>

3288
02:10:19.011 --> 02:10:19.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3289
02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:21.850
<v Speaker 3>I've done the float tanks and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3290
02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Just time to where I'd get my mind at</v>
<v Speaker 3>ease and it's pitch black.</v>

3291
02:10:24.501 --> 02:10:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't have my kids running around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3292
02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:29.210
<v Speaker 3>ask him for juice and take me here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take me there,</v>

3293
02:10:29.211 --> 02:10:30.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of that.</v>

3294
02:10:30.621 --> 02:10:31.730
<v Speaker 3>So it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3295
02:10:31.731 --> 02:10:33.950
<v Speaker 3>any type of recovery that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

3296
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.590
<v Speaker 1>if you're a high level athlete and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out there just banging on your</v>

3297
02:10:36.591 --> 02:10:38.540
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean any mile Fascia,</v>

3298
02:10:38.541 --> 02:10:41.540
<v Speaker 1>release a cryotherapy flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3299
02:10:41.541 --> 02:10:44.660
<v Speaker 1>any type of meditation floats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal for um,</v>

3300
02:10:44.710 --> 02:10:47.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnesium too because that like epsom</v>

3301
02:10:47.421 --> 02:10:49.640
<v Speaker 1>salts bath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the floating is great because your</v>

3302
02:10:49.641 --> 02:10:53.270
<v Speaker 1>body absorbs magnesium but float tanks</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with epsom salts.</v>

3303
02:10:53.271 --> 02:10:55.200
<v Speaker 1>You get a lot of magnesium from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

3304
02:10:55.590 --> 02:10:57.200
<v Speaker 1>And you're able to relax too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3305
02:10:57.201 --> 02:10:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of calm down.</v>

3306
02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Let me crazy way because it's like zero</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity.</v>

3307
02:11:00.981 --> 02:11:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Like you feel everything sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching out and unwinding.</v>

3308
02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got one of those in your house,</v>

3309
02:11:04.971 --> 02:11:05.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3310
02:11:05.421 --> 02:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>my basement too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3311

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3357
02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:51.440
<v Speaker 1>the good thing about these as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in little packets so you can</v>

3358
02:12:51.441 --> 02:12:53.210
<v Speaker 1>take them with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

02:12:57.831 --> 02:13:01.040
<v Speaker 1>off the substrate that's in the packets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

3361
02:13:01.041 --> 02:13:02.900
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a little ecosystem.</v>

<v Speaker 1>mind and we're doing these runs the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other day and he's just like,</v>

3365
02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:11.360
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3370
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:19.240

<v Speaker 1>And it's also a,</v>

3371
02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that is also a trip to fan trip</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fan which produces,</v>

3372
02:13:23.451 --> 02:13:24.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3373
02:13:24.070 --> 02:13:27.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the building block for Serotonin</v>
<v Speaker 1>trip to Fan,</v>

3374
02:13:27.230 --> 02:13:31.920
<v Speaker 1>which your body converts to five htp and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a five htp.</v>

3375
02:13:31.921 --> 02:13:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Your body converts to Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's big for dreams.</v>

02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you wake up a lot happier,</v>

3377
02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:40.710
<v Speaker 1>motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that are into lucid</v>

3378
02:13:40.711 --> 02:13:42.060
<v Speaker 1>dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take that Shit.</v>

3379
02:13:42.090 --> 02:13:47.090

<v Speaker 1>or Alpha brain which contains coleen.</v>

3380
02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:51.840
<v Speaker 1>It'll take these different nootropics</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they go to sleep and purpose so</v>

3381

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3403
02:14:44.741 --> 02:14:45.120
<v Speaker 2>you can</v>

3404
02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.230
<v Speaker 1>definitely adjust the way you approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain situations,</v>

3405
02:14:49.231 --> 02:14:51.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look at things in a positive</v>

3406
02:14:51.061 --> 02:14:53.640
<v Speaker 1>way or we all know people that look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>

3407
02:14:53.641 --> 02:14:55.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world fucking closing in on me,</v>

3408
02:14:55.650 --> 02:14:56.161
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

3409
02:14:56.161 --> 02:14:56.550
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

3410
02:14:56.550 --> 02:14:58.920
<v Speaker 1>You live in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not in Ethiopia.</v>

3411
02:14:59.010 --> 02:15:01.170
<v Speaker 1>You have both your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not paralyzed.</v>

3412

<v Speaker 1>You don't have malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you complaining about?</v>

3413
02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Exactly like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3414
02:15:05.410 --> 02:15:07.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a perspective issue with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3415
02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:12.800
<v Speaker 1>but the way you approach different</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios in your life has a huge impact</v>

3416
02:15:13.441 --> 02:15:18.060
<v Speaker 1>on how you feel and as an athlete</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially I would imagine as a fighter,</v>

3417
02:15:18.330 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 1>it's very important to maintain a</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy mindset and to keep your stress</v>

3418
02:15:22.801 --> 02:15:26.760
<v Speaker 1>levels at a very low level while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>training and while you're going through</v>

3419
02:15:26.761 --> 02:15:30.750
<v Speaker 1>camp and like the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we've all seen fighters that go</v>

3420
02:15:30.751 --> 02:15:35.040
<v Speaker 1>through camps and they have fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy relationship problems at the same</v>

3421
02:15:35.041 --> 02:15:37.230
<v Speaker 1>time and it fucks them up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

3426
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:44.611
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my girls just say,</v>

3427
02:15:44.611 --> 02:15:45.590
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta stay away from him.</v>

3428
02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's get him some food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's reasonable,</v>

3429
02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:50.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just crankiness from cutting</v>

3430
02:15:50.821 --> 02:15:53.370
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like crazy people in your life,</v>

3431
02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:56.370
<v Speaker 1>like if you date and some crazy girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a girl and you're dating a</v>

3432
02:15:56.371 --> 02:15:59.070
<v Speaker 1>crazy guy and they cry like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3433
02:15:59.071 --> 02:16:00.780
<v Speaker 1>if they're not getting enough attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>from you,</v>

3434
02:16:00.781 --> 02:16:04.350
<v Speaker 1>they start drama because issues like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're focusing too much on other</v>

3435
02:16:04.351 --> 02:16:05.910
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get upset at.</v>

3436
02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:09.270
<v Speaker 1>You cut those people along awful long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago,</v>

3437
02:16:09.271 --> 02:16:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3438
02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very important,</v>

3439
02:16:11.251 --> 02:16:11.881
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3440
02:16:11.881 --> 02:16:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3441
02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:13.081
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta ask you,</v>

3442
02:16:13.081 --> 02:16:13.370
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3443
02:16:13.370 --> 02:16:15.060
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think about God.</v>

3444
02:16:15.150 --> 02:16:16.830
<v Speaker 2>What is your theory on that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe,</v>

3445
02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:18.680
<v Speaker 1>believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know him?</v>

3446
02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:19.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3447
02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe omnipresent in everything I am.</v>

3448
02:16:22.810 --> 02:16:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I definitely am open to all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

3449
02:16:27.281 --> 02:16:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Post life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't that I have any sort of lock on</v>

3450
02:16:31.901 --> 02:16:36.850
<v Speaker 1>what happens that I haven't experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me to say that there's no god or</v>

3451
02:16:36.851 --> 02:16:41.851
<v Speaker 1>that there isn't some omnipresent entity</v>
<v Speaker 1>or or energy or something that is the</v>

3452
02:16:44.321 --> 02:16:47.590
<v Speaker 1>guiding force of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be ridiculous.</v>

3453
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:49.540
<v Speaker 1>What do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3454
02:16:49.630 --> 02:16:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are in some sort of strange state of</v>

3455
02:16:54.491 --> 02:16:58.030
<v Speaker 1>development where we're aware of our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

3456
02:16:58.300 --> 02:17:01.180
<v Speaker 1>We're aware of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're aware of certain rules of the</v>

3457
02:17:01.181 --> 02:17:04.900
<v Speaker 1>universe seems to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the universe seems to be,</v>

3458
02:17:05.130 --> 02:17:08.050
<v Speaker 1>if everything seems to be constantly in</v>
<v Speaker 1>motion and changing,</v>

3459
02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:09.970
<v Speaker 1>know whether it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3460
02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:12.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3461
02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:16.540
<v Speaker 1>the orbit of planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it is the biological life on</v>

3462
02:17:16.541 --> 02:17:18.550
<v Speaker 1>planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the life of stars,</v>

3463
02:17:18.850 --> 02:17:19.810
<v Speaker 1>things have a life.</v>

3464
02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:21.820
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come and they go,</v>

3465
02:17:21.821 --> 02:17:24.820
<v Speaker 1>and then even you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the galaxies themselves,</v>

3466
02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:28.450
<v Speaker 1>every galaxy in the center of every</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy has a supermassive black hole</v>

3467
02:17:28.451 --> 02:17:31.270
<v Speaker 1>that's one half of one percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire mass of the galaxy.</v>

3468
02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:36.510
<v Speaker 1>And that supermassive black hole is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking that galaxy into it's fucking</v>

3469
02:17:36.701 --> 02:17:41.701
<v Speaker 1>center into the event horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see these spiral galaxies at</v>

3470
02:17:41.711 --> 02:17:45.490
<v Speaker 1>the center of those spiral galaxies is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>black hole that's absorbing all the</v>

3471
02:17:45.491 --> 02:17:50.491
<v Speaker 1>matter slowly but surely of that galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then no one knows what is going on</v>

3472
02:17:51.521 --> 02:17:52.870
<v Speaker 1>in that black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

3473
02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:55.690
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have theories,</v>

3474
02:17:55.930 --> 02:18:00.930
<v Speaker 1>but one of the theories of black holes</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that inside every black hole is</v>

3475
02:18:01.361 --> 02:18:06.361
<v Speaker 1>potentially a whole nother universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's hundreds of billions of</v>

3476
02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:09.610
<v Speaker 1>galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each galaxy has a super massive black</v>

3477
02:18:09.611 --> 02:18:13.330
<v Speaker 1>hole in the center of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inside each one of those galaxies</v>

3478
02:18:13.331 --> 02:18:16.900
<v Speaker 1>may be hundreds of millions of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies,</v>

3479
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:19.060
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

3480
02:18:19.510 --> 02:18:23.020
<v Speaker 1>so the the idea that anybody could sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and tell you there's no god,</v>

3481
02:18:23.021 --> 02:18:24.430
<v Speaker 1>man of God.</v>

3482
02:18:24.670 --> 02:18:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's incredibly arrogant when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say there is no god.</v>

3483
02:18:28.630 --> 02:18:33.630
<v Speaker 1>What I think is that religion clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows the hand of man.</v>

3484
02:18:34.090 --> 02:18:39.090
<v Speaker 1>It clearly shows the manipulation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other human beings where they have taken</v>

3485
02:18:39.730 --> 02:18:44.140
<v Speaker 1>some universal rules are there are some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some universal golden rule is treat</v>

3486
02:18:44.170 --> 02:18:47.710
<v Speaker 1>others the way you would like to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated and understanding that loving</v>

3487
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:50.650
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brothers and sisters and friends and</v>

3488
02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:54.730
<v Speaker 1>community has massive benefits and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel connected to each other and it is</v>

3489
02:18:54.731 --> 02:18:56.780
<v Speaker 1>the right way to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there's,</v>

3490
02:18:56.840 --> 02:18:58.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a benefit to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all feel it.</v>

3491
02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:01.150
<v Speaker 1>We know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The love that you have for your</v>

3492
02:19:01.151 --> 02:19:03.190
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know the love that I have for my</v>

3493
02:19:03.191 --> 02:19:08.110
<v Speaker 1>children and the love that I have for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife or my friends or people that are</v>

3494
02:19:08.111 --> 02:19:09.870
<v Speaker 1>close to me when I see there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3495
02:19:09.970 --> 02:19:14.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a beauty in that that is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>magical and I don't know if that beauty</v>

3496
02:19:14.891 --> 02:19:19.891
<v Speaker 1>and that magic is to in its to enforce a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of community so that we can</v>

3497
02:19:20.021 --> 02:19:23.590
<v Speaker 1>continue to breed so that we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>rewarded a,</v>

3498
02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:28.310
<v Speaker 1>these natural reward systems so that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can continue to foster life and that we</v>

3499
02:19:28.311 --> 02:19:30.350
<v Speaker 1>can continue to evolve and grow.</v>

3500
02:19:30.350 --> 02:19:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

3501
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:37.030
<v Speaker 1>but I know that the best things in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they're connected to love and I</v>

3502
02:19:38.091 --> 02:19:40.490
<v Speaker 1>would think that if there's any guiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>

3503
02:19:40.491 --> 02:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>any beautiful force of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that love and even the love of the</v>

3504
02:19:44.811 --> 02:19:49.790
<v Speaker 1>beauty of the universe itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a love that I get when I last</v>

3505
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:53.390
<v Speaker 1>night went out on my porch and I smoked</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little tube and I looked up at the</v>

3506
02:19:53.391 --> 02:19:56.600
<v Speaker 1>stars and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fell in love with the stars.</v>

3507
02:19:56.601 --> 02:19:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel love when I look out into the</v>

3508
02:19:58.821 --> 02:19:59.511
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3509
02:19:59.511 --> 02:20:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I think I was one of my favorite things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is look at stars.</v>

3510
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Just look up and go fuck big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same Way I do my.</v>

3511
02:20:07.390 --> 02:20:09.560
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always looking at the moon like,</v>

3512
02:20:09.561 --> 02:20:13.490
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's full moon and the stars in the sky,</v>

3513
02:20:13.491 --> 02:20:16.940
<v Speaker 1>one quarter the size of the earth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just floating up there.</v>

3514
02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're out in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere.</v>

3515
02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Like it sounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look up,</v>

3516
02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Mrs. Pure dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that dude,</v>

3517
02:20:23.330 --> 02:20:24.470
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sick.</v>

3518
02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.070
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3519
02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I was in camp once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A boy scout camp in New Hampshire.</v>

3520
02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3521
02:20:31.050 --> 02:20:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I used to for a little while to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking kids.</v>

3522
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I went to boy scout camp with criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3523
02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:37.460
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was A.</v>

3524
02:20:37.461 --> 02:20:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Jamaica plain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of a sketchy.</v>

3525
02:20:40.390 --> 02:20:43.040
<v Speaker 1>It's gentrified now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the 19,</v>

3526
02:20:43.041 --> 02:20:45.140
<v Speaker 1>late 19 seventies it was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sketchy.</v>

3527
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Where's it at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamaica plains is a suburb of Boston.</v>

3528
02:20:48.010 --> 02:20:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston.</v>

3529
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:50.570
<v Speaker 1>And it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just not a good neighborhood.</v>

3530
02:20:50.610 --> 02:20:53.120
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have any money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kids that I went to,</v>

3531
02:20:53.121 --> 02:20:56.120
<v Speaker 1>boy scout camp with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would like take other kids and</v>

3532
02:20:56.121 --> 02:20:58.730
<v Speaker 1>fucking tie him up and leave him in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woods and shed.</v>

3533
02:20:59.850 --> 02:21:02.690
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so sketchy,</v>

3534
02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:07.100
<v Speaker 1>but they gave us rifles to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have 20 twos and bows and arrows,</v>

3535
02:21:07.310 --> 02:21:10.400
<v Speaker 1>so we're out there and it was not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized.</v>

3536
02:21:10.401 --> 02:21:12.830
<v Speaker 1>It was weird because I remember I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

3537
02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:16.280
<v Speaker 1>we were doing something and I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3538
02:21:16.281 --> 02:21:18.070
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy goes,</v>

3539
02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I was a ricochet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go ricochet.</v>

3540
02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Like as in a bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess someone hit a rock and it</v>

3541
02:21:22.971 --> 02:21:23.804
<v Speaker 1>ricocheted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3542
02:21:23.960 --> 02:21:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3543
02:21:25.131 --> 02:21:28.310
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just from the rest of the time I was</v>

3544
02:21:28.311 --> 02:21:29.960
<v Speaker 1>there for two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just went fishing.</v>

3545
02:21:29.961 --> 02:21:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I just abandoned everybody went fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know I was gone.</v>

3546
02:21:33.230 --> 02:21:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I could've drowned out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one cared.</v>

3547
02:21:35.930 --> 02:21:40.930
<v Speaker 1>But I remember going outside and for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time in my life being in a place</v>

3548
02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:44.480
<v Speaker 1>where there was no lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no city,</v>

3549
02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:45.290
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing.</v>

3550
02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:47.660
<v Speaker 1>We were just in the woods and you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and just be like,</v>

3551
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:49.340
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3552
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:52.580
<v Speaker 1>like look at all those stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are out there all the time.</v>

3553
02:21:53.370 --> 02:21:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't see them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3554
02:21:55.450 --> 02:21:56.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3555
02:21:56.391 --> 02:21:58.190
<v Speaker 1>kids these days probably don't even see</v>
<v Speaker 1>them at all.</v>

3556
02:21:58.470 --> 02:21:59.540
<v Speaker 1>IPADS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's going on.</v>

3557
02:21:59.541 --> 02:22:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Have you been to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they don't even bother.</v>

3558
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Have you been to the Big Island?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3559
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3560
02:22:05.931 --> 02:22:09.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an observatory at the top of a</v>

3561
02:22:09.690 --> 02:22:12.290
<v Speaker 1>model isn't Maunaloa the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3562
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:16.190
<v Speaker 1>the Keck observatory in the big island</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way the big island is set up,</v>

3563
02:22:16.220 --> 02:22:21.220
<v Speaker 1>they have special diffused lighting so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the street lights don't provide</v>

3564
02:22:22.010 --> 02:22:24.980
<v Speaker 1>light pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could see everything and you go</v>

3565
02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:27.980
<v Speaker 1>through the clouds and dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like that when you,</v>

3566
02:22:27.981 --> 02:22:29.710
<v Speaker 1>when you're up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like,</v>

3567
02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like 13,000 feet above sea</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

3568
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:37.770
<v Speaker 1>But when you look up at the sky dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the Milky Way,</v>

3569
02:22:37.771 --> 02:22:41.010
<v Speaker 1>like the full Milky Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

3570
02:22:41.070 --> 02:22:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Like see if you find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go do google images of from the</v>

3571
02:22:44.071 --> 02:22:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Keck observatory because maybe that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good one.</v>

3572
02:22:47.250 --> 02:22:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what exactly what it looks like.</v>

3573
02:22:49.530 --> 02:22:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sit up there and you look up and you</v>

3574
02:22:51.790 --> 02:22:53.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're going to go there,</v>

3575
02:22:54.050 --> 02:22:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go when it's no moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I went the last time I went,</v>

3576
02:22:58.501 --> 02:23:01.350
<v Speaker 1>we fucked up and it was a full moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still beautiful,</v>

3577
02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:04.110
<v Speaker 1>but it was a full moon and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see as many stars.</v>

3578
02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3579
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:08.040
<v Speaker 1>If you can get up there and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go to the very top you go to.</v>

3580
02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:10.110
<v Speaker 1>There's like a visitor center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need to do.</v>

3581
02:23:10.111 --> 02:23:12.060
<v Speaker 1>They have some telescopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't even want to look at the</v>

3582
02:23:12.061 --> 02:23:12.810
<v Speaker 1>telescope.</v>

3583
02:23:12.810 --> 02:23:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Just look up man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up and enjoy.</v>

3584
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:16.110
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

3585
02:23:17.130 --> 02:23:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I really feel like there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with people today.</v>

3586
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:25.500
<v Speaker 1>One of the things with the arrogance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings and the ridiculous way we</v>

3587
02:23:25.501 --> 02:23:28.050
<v Speaker 1>behave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is connected to the</v>

3588
02:23:28.051 --> 02:23:32.580
<v Speaker 1>fact that we don't see space anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think space is so humbling and it,</v>

3589
02:23:32.610 --> 02:23:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's psychedelic when I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even have to do.</v>

3590
02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to smoke pot and have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

3591
02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:40.590
<v Speaker 1>When I go to Hawaii and I look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get high.</v>

3592
02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it puts me in perspective.</v>

3593
02:23:43.441 --> 02:23:46.320
<v Speaker 1>It lets me know like you're in a magical</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

3594
02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 1>You're on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this strange circular spaceship that's</v>

3595
02:23:50.731 --> 02:23:55.731
<v Speaker 1>hurling through infinity and above you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an infinite number of giant</v>

3596
02:23:55.771 --> 02:23:59.100
<v Speaker 1>explosions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge fireballs in the sky.</v>

3597
02:23:59.101 --> 02:24:01.500
<v Speaker 1>We have floating there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows why.</v>

3598
02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:04.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I think about God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3599
02:24:04.891 --> 02:24:05.790
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3600
02:24:06.030 --> 02:24:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I just think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use religion and God as a</v>

3601
02:24:10.411 --> 02:24:15.411
<v Speaker 1>scaffolding to try to be a good person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to try to have rules and to try to</v>

3602
02:24:15.811 --> 02:24:19.170
<v Speaker 1>have structure in their life and to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give themselves something to look</v>

3603
02:24:19.171 --> 02:24:21.150
<v Speaker 1>forward to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a good thing.</v>

3604
02:24:21.330 --> 02:24:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of good things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that religion provides people,</v>

3605
02:24:26.610 --> 02:24:30.510
<v Speaker 1>but I also think it provides people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of excuses to be shitty to people.</v>

3606
02:24:30.750 --> 02:24:32.250
<v Speaker 1>A lot of hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3607
02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:35.130
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean especially ancient religions that</v>

3608
02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:40.160
<v Speaker 1>suppress women or suppress gay people or</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppress people's rights in any way,</v>

3609
02:24:41.911 --> 02:24:44.970
<v Speaker 1>shape or form based on this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3610
02:24:44.971 --> 02:24:47.700
<v Speaker 1>it's ancient scripture tells them</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not supposed to do certain</v>

3611
02:24:47.701 --> 02:24:48.480
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3612
02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that's all ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's not really God.</v>

3613
02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:56.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the hand of man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it's the.</v>

3614
02:24:56.430 --> 02:25:01.430
<v Speaker 1>The problem with even the term God is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's Kinda been co opted by</v>

3615
02:25:01.561 --> 02:25:03.810
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has definitely been co opted by,</v>

3616
02:25:03.811 --> 02:25:05.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn.</v>

3617
02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:10.340
<v Speaker 1>You can learn a lot from ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious texts and ancient knowledge</v>

3618
02:25:10.381 --> 02:25:14.100
<v Speaker 1>that people knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured things out a long time ago</v>

3619
02:25:14.101 --> 02:25:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and they were trying to figure out a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pass that down onto other people.</v>

3620
02:25:17.730 --> 02:25:22.350
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is in the translation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like none of the ancient religions were</v>

3621
02:25:22.351 --> 02:25:25.600
<v Speaker 1>ever written in English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them know they were written all</v>

3622
02:25:25.601 --> 02:25:27.820
<v Speaker 1>sorts of different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Bible for here is a perfect</v>

3623
02:25:27.821 --> 02:25:30.790
<v Speaker 1>example of the original Bible was</v>
<v Speaker 1>written in ancient Hebrew.</v>

3624
02:25:31.270 --> 02:25:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Well actually Aramaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to the Dead Sea scrolls were</v>

3625
02:25:35.561 --> 02:25:40.180
<v Speaker 1>in Aramaic and the Dead Sea scrolls</v>
<v Speaker 1>contain a lot of the stories that are in</v>

3626
02:25:40.210 --> 02:25:43.660
<v Speaker 1>the ancient bibles and it's like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really convoluted.</v>

3627
02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:48.660
<v Speaker 1>The translation between Aramaic to Latin</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Greek to back to English.</v>

3628
02:25:50.261 --> 02:25:54.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like you lose a lot and then an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Hebrew and in ancient Hebrew</v>

3629
02:25:54.791 --> 02:25:59.320
<v Speaker 1>also words double is numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters double his numbers.</v>

3630
02:25:59.450 --> 02:26:03.460
<v Speaker 1>There's no numbers in ancient Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the letter a is also the number</v>

3631
02:26:03.461 --> 02:26:04.560
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3632
02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:09.660
<v Speaker 1>So words also have numerical value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the word God and the word love.</v>

3633
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:15.370
<v Speaker 1>They have the same numerical value</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the numbers in the letters like</v>

3634
02:26:15.371 --> 02:26:18.940
<v Speaker 1>what it means something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you can say,</v>

3635
02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:21.160
<v Speaker 1>oh go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not,</v>

3636
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:24.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not like just a phonetic language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a language that also has</v>

3637
02:26:24.821 --> 02:26:28.480
<v Speaker 1>mathematics incorporated to it and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant something.</v>

3638
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:32.080
<v Speaker 1>It was a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you take these ancient Hebrew</v>

3639
02:26:32.081 --> 02:26:36.530
<v Speaker 1>sentences and you translate them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>English and you don't just translate it</v>

3640
02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:39.760
<v Speaker 1>to English and translate them to Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he translate them to Greek and then you</v>

3641
02:26:39.761 --> 02:26:42.520
<v Speaker 1>translate into English a lot lost in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

3642
02:26:42.730 --> 02:26:46.990
<v Speaker 1>but I think these people were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure some things out about life and I</v>

3643
02:26:46.991 --> 02:26:48.730
<v Speaker 1>think we could probably learn something</v>
<v Speaker 1>from them,</v>

3644
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.770
<v Speaker 1>but for sure a lot of it was people</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulating the other people around</v>

3645
02:26:53.771 --> 02:26:55.690
<v Speaker 1>them and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God says this,</v>

3646
02:26:55.691 --> 02:26:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to do that or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you will die in a fiery fucking pit</v>

3647
02:26:59.381 --> 02:27:01.700
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the earth and oral just</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the teacher.</v>

3648
02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:04.300
<v Speaker 1>So there was a lot of horseshit involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in religion.</v>

3649
02:27:04.301 --> 02:27:07.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll get you some.</v>

3674
02:27:43.470 --> 02:27:45.060
<v Speaker 2>But the division is kind of in a funk</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

3675
02:27:45.061 --> 02:27:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Either everybody's got fights or I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>already fought people or you know,</v>

3676
02:27:48.751 --> 02:27:51.210
<v Speaker 2>they're coming off losses normally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they try to prepare you with the</v>

3677
02:27:51.211 --> 02:27:52.140
<v Speaker 2>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I told Shawn,</v>

3678
02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

3679
02:27:52.970 --> 02:27:55.740
<v Speaker 2>if I ain't going to get like a frankie</v>
<v Speaker 2>or an Aldo fight,</v>

3680
02:27:56.010 --> 02:27:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me somebody outside real quick.</v>

3681
02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:00.030
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just go get a good wind.</v>

3682
02:28:00.031 --> 02:28:01.980
<v Speaker 2>And like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still right there in the mix.</v>

3683
02:28:01.981 --> 02:28:04.470
<v Speaker 2>So then when it all pans out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right there</v>

3684
02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:07.270
<v Speaker 1>big though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my question.</v>

3685
02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a big title fight</v>

3686
02:28:09.461 --> 02:28:11.200
<v Speaker 1>coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if,</v>

3687
02:28:11.210 --> 02:28:13.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although who just won the interim title</v>

3688
02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:17.980
<v Speaker 1>is going to defend his title against</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else in the top 10 and you know,</v>

3689
02:28:17.981 --> 02:28:20.530
<v Speaker 1>you see that coming up to you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a fight scheduled.</v>

3690
02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you start thinking</v>

3691
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:24.230
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can get injured and you might</v>

3692
02:28:24.231 --> 02:28:29.231
<v Speaker 2>get that call because mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly the UFC is notorious for</v>

3693
02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:31.640
<v Speaker 2>last minute fallouts or guys get</v>
<v Speaker 2>injured.</v>

3694
02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right after my fight was a right before</v>

3695
02:28:34.971 --> 02:28:36.350
<v Speaker 2>UFC 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

3696
02:28:37.180 --> 02:28:38.420
<v Speaker 2>right as I got done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3697
02:28:38.421 --> 02:28:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I was 100 percent healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no injuries.</v>

3698
02:28:40.731 --> 02:28:41.564
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3699
02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:42.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3700
02:28:42.351 --> 02:28:43.140
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to let you know,</v>

3701
02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:45.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know maybe some people were ahead of</v>

3702
02:28:45.711 --> 02:28:47.210
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll let you know I'm going to be</v>

3703
02:28:47.211 --> 02:28:50.300
<v Speaker 2>ready in 100 percent focused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3704
02:28:50.301 --> 02:28:51.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do anything.</v>

3705
02:28:51.411 --> 02:28:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I went out and joined myself one time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I was,</v>

3706
02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I was training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was back to doing sprints strike right</v>

3707
02:28:55.971 --> 02:28:58.250
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then about two weeks before that</v>

3708
02:28:58.251 --> 02:29:00.680
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up going to Mexico on</v>

3709
02:29:00.690 --> 02:29:02.660
<v Speaker 2>vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my cousin got married and then I just</v>

3710
02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:03.860
<v Speaker 2>went out and enjoyed myself.</v>

3711
02:29:03.860 --> 02:29:07.280
<v Speaker 2>But for like two weeks straight I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>continuing to stay on point.</v>

3712
02:29:07.281 --> 02:29:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stayed on just in case.</v>

3713
02:29:08.650 --> 02:29:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because things happen,</v>

3714
02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:13.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can be that guy to step up and I</v>

3715
02:29:13.281 --> 02:29:15.470
<v Speaker 2>let them know and I let it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let everybody else know that,</v>

3716
02:29:15.471 --> 02:29:15.891
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3717
02:29:15.891 --> 02:29:18.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to take that next step and you</v>

3718
02:29:18.351 --> 02:29:21.020
<v Speaker 2>can rely on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's tricky though because you're so</v>

3719
02:29:21.021 --> 02:29:21.920
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3720
02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:25.070
<v Speaker 2>if like if something was scheduled for</v>
<v Speaker 2>two weeks from now and then all the</v>

3721
02:29:25.071 --> 02:29:27.410
<v Speaker 2>sudden you got this call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really can't make weight in two</v>

3722
02:29:27.411 --> 02:29:27.981
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3723
02:29:27.981 --> 02:29:29.120
<v Speaker 2>not now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3724
02:29:29.121 --> 02:29:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3725

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3726
02:29:30.621 --> 02:29:32.480
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was preparing for $200 and it didn't</v>

3727
02:29:32.481 --> 02:29:33.350
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I've,</v>

3728
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've taken my time off,</v>

3729
02:29:34.971 --> 02:29:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I've enjoyed myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've traveled and uh,</v>

3730
02:29:37.611 --> 02:29:39.200

<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed yourself,</v>

3731
02:29:39.201 --> 02:29:40.040
<v Speaker 2>but you're not fat.</v>

3732
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:42.890
<v Speaker 2>This is where it's so confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm looking at you right now.</v>

3733
02:29:42.891 --> 02:29:45.200

<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

3735
02:29:47.361 --> 02:29:48.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3736
02:29:48.290 --> 02:29:49.280
<v Speaker 2>my coach,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I stay on my diet.</v>

3738
02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I've been enjoying myself like on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekends and I love lava cakes and ice</v>

3739
02:29:54.591 --> 02:29:56.850
<v Speaker 2>cream and a who doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3742
02:29:57.870 --> 02:30:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to enjoy myself a little bit</v>

3743
02:30:00.021 --> 02:30:01.310
<v Speaker 2>because there's got to be a Yin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yang.</v>

3744
02:30:01.311 --> 02:30:03.730
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be a dark side and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's got to be the good side.</v>

3745
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:06.620
<v Speaker 2>It as of right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been back on the Diet and</v>

3746
02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:07.820
<v Speaker 2>everything is going good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

3747
02:30:07.850 --> 02:30:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing my runs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just really haven't been that dialed</v>

3748
02:30:11.091 --> 02:30:11.600
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3749
02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a set date and I'm doing things</v>

3750
02:30:13.521 --> 02:30:17.470
<v Speaker 2>in particular as I was training right</v>
<v Speaker 2>after my fight I was ready and set and</v>

3751
02:30:17.820 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 2>still striving toward that goal.</v>

3752
02:30:19.340 --> 02:30:21.020
<v Speaker 2>It just didn't happen that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine,</v>

3753
02:30:21.021 --> 02:30:23.870
<v Speaker 2>but give me a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need Sean Shelby,</v>

3754
02:30:23.871 --> 02:30:26.210
<v Speaker 2>do you get me a fight night?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want those exciting fights.</v>

3755
02:30:26.211 --> 02:30:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people want to see me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Josie auto get after it.</v>

3756
02:30:30.021 --> 02:30:32.630
<v Speaker 2>They want to see me and conor mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a heavy handed guy.</v>

3757
02:30:32.631 --> 02:30:35.390
<v Speaker 2>He's an exciting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting dude and people want</v>

3758
02:30:35.391 --> 02:30:39.620
<v Speaker 2>to see the one test that they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the live fights.</v>

3759
02:30:39.621 --> 02:30:41.050
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3760
02:30:41.060 --> 02:30:42.740
<v Speaker 2>the land pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

3761
02:30:42.741 --> 02:30:44.660
<v Speaker 2>You gotta win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that people got to provide</v>

3762
02:30:44.661 --> 02:30:47.870
<v Speaker 2>for their family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like to personally get into legit</v>

3763
02:30:47.871 --> 02:30:51.890
<v Speaker 2>fistfights to where I liked to scrap it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter where the fight goes.</v>

3764
02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:54.080
