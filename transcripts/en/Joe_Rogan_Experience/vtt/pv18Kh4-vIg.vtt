WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Person to do it on their thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're plugging into it.</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just discussing a very critical,</v>

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound engineering issues.</v>

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>We will take care of on the next version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this studio.</v>

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to build something either in </v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown or near here and we haven't </v>

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>decided.</v>

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always figured you'd had it here </v>

8
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.810
<v Speaker 2>because you live here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.810
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

10
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>but I like downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea of being on the top of a</v>

11
00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:29.771
<v Speaker 1>big building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My other option and I had been looking </v>

12
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:31.991
<v Speaker 1>at land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My other option is in Topanga Canyon to </v>

13
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:35.651
<v Speaker 1>build an actual compound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My problem is I'm afraid because I know </v>

14
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily trust me.</v>

15
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid I'll go whole hog Colonel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurtz and start a real compound once I </v>

16
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:49.001
<v Speaker 1>have the actual land and start putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in and realize I'm not really </v>

17
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>that restricted financially from </v>
<v Speaker 1>building shit.</v>

18
00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:55.241
<v Speaker 1>I might just start getting crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can put all your followers </v>

19
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:55.241
<v Speaker 1>could work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

20
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Then that becomes a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unstable ones shows up with the </v>

21
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking suicide vest.</v>

22
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Downtown's a bit of a pain in the ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

23
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 2>Getting theirs sucks and I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone had a show down there and I had </v>

24
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.231
<v Speaker 2>to park like in this weird thing and cut</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a macy's to get to the where the</v>

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Speaker 2>thing was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Downtown can be a little tricky unless </v>

26
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.730
<v Speaker 2>you get a cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so ho kind of loft space.</v>

27
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was thinking of is getting a high</v>

28
00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 1>rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a top floor on a high rise.</v>

29
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Get crazy and get something with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most dope,</v>

30
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous view and have that view be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the background when we do shows those</v>

31
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 2>especially nighttime shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be pretty sweet.</v>

32
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 2>And a good vantage point when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earthquake comes.</v>

33
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been in a high rise during</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quake?</v>

34
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a parachute for you </v>

35
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 2>and for Jamie and for all of us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to shoot through one of</v>

36
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 2>the windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a shotgun blast through one of</v>

37
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 2>the windows and they were just going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump.</v>

38
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I was in San Francisco two summers ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not last summer.</v>

39
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:59.381
<v Speaker 2>The one before during that earthquake </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a little up in Napa was napa </v>

40
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

41
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.860
<v Speaker 2>I had a show there that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a high rise,</v>

42
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 2>get up to go to the bathroom at around </v>
<v Speaker 2>two in the morning on my way back.</v>

43
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.880
<v Speaker 2>But the whole building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a rubber band just back,</v>

44
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the.</v>

45
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were on rollers and that thing just</v>

46
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 2>scariest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just laid on the bed and it was like,</v>

47
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is going down.</v>

48
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's laid on the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laid on the bed.</v>

49
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

50
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kinda collapsed on the bed.</v>

51
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Like you're supposed to get into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doorframe there was,</v>

52
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.500
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing but just tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

53
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.680
<v Speaker 2>that's completely really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

54
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

55
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go to the airport,</v>

56
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 2>actually just get the hell out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

57
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Start running towards the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

58
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Brassica that was my instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked out the window.</v>

59
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see people like running and </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove.</v>

60
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:57.570
<v Speaker 2>So I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this,</v>

61
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>we'll see how freaked out I am if I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

62
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>go back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did just fell asleep.</v>

63
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever read the article?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was It in New Yorker?</v>

64
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what magazine it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

65
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 1>There was an article that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially saying the Pacific </v>

66
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Seattle is a ticking time bomb.</v>

67
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:19.531
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of time before it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets hit by a massive tsunami and an </v>

68
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:23.311
<v Speaker 1>earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent going to happen </v>

69
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>might happen in 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might happen into who knows?</v>

70
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

71
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm going there this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Parlor,</v>

72
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love that place.</v>

73
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:35.071
<v Speaker 1>Good Club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That combines my two favorite things in </v>

74
00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool playing pool and the comedy club.</v>

75
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they designed it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

76
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>It is pretty perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been there in awhile.</v>

77
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

78
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:45.961
<v Speaker 1>Like when they say like at that level </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they say it'll hit what happens to </v>

79
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:51.241
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean like Seattle goes into </v>

80
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:51.241
<v Speaker 1>the ocean?</v>

81
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>The Article?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the New Yorker,</v>

82
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>the really big ones by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>received so much hate and I think </v>

83
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>fucking threats and all kinds of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that she had to.</v>

84
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I think she had to make an amendment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

85
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>but not so big one to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey fuckers relaxed.</v>

86
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:11.791
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to scare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a notice like Mexico seems </v>

87
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:12.380
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

88
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.390
<v Speaker 1>it goes all the way down to California </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the see the appeal that </v>

89
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>they're showing in the illustration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think Mexico's our move.</v>

<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

93
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like falling off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Six days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

119
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

120
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>but then once you smoke it and then cook</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

121
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>like right out of the smoker and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve it.</v>

122
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

123
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.970
<v Speaker 1>My kids scream when they eat it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it just melt in your mouth.</v>

124
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just so tender and moist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>

125
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 1>So where's the cooler?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come in?</v>

126
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leave it in the cooler for six days by</v>

127
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>itself in a bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

128
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Brian the ham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take the ham,</v>

129
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I put a bucket of water with salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic,</v>

130
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>some brown sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a few other spices.</v>

131
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:54.271
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some Himalayan pink salt and then it </v>

132
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:58.261
<v Speaker 1>sits in this cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I surround the cooler with ice or </v>

133
00:05:58.261 --> 00:05:58.261
<v Speaker 1>surround the bucket with ice.</v>

134
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 3>And I lock it down and I just leave it </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside for days.</v>

135
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 3>She's six days later I opened up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still got ice in it and really see </v>

136
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one that I cook.</v>

137
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks good.</v>

138
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five hours.</v>

139
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred 50 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many pounds is that?</v>

140
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.560
<v Speaker 3>That was about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanna say like a three pound one </v>

141
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was so good.</v>

142
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you cut like you see all the juices</v>

143
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:27.360
<v Speaker 3>at the bottom of that plate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

144
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like you cut into and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirting in your face.</v>

145
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 3>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

146
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Jesus know that is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wild Ham.</v>

147
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.310
<v Speaker 3>So that's my warning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The apocalypse is what you're going to </v>

148
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.310
<v Speaker 3>live on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well my point is that those yeti coolers</v>

149
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 3>can keep things cold for a really long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

150
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 3>So like you could have like if you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>frozen meat,</v>

151
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 3>it'll stay frozen in those things for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

152
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or at least cold enough where you don't </v>

153
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.320
<v Speaker 3>have to worry about it going bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can keep all your stuff in there.</v>

154
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.500
<v Speaker 3>So I have meat that'll last for a week </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like a week of meat and then okay,</v>

155
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 3>generator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a generator,</v>

156
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm going solar though I'm turning my </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole house or I think I am as well.</v>

157
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.020
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy to not in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's you have to drop pretty good</v>

158
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 3>cash at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

159
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 3>It'll take about five years to get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

160
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 3>You might not ever get it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might not ever.</v>

161
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.730
<v Speaker 3>You can have it set up where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>always going to have power and you're </v>

162
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 3>completely off the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

163
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 3>That's the big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which Brian Cowen has been trying to get</v>

164
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 3>them to turn over to his soul and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>says they're really resistant.</v>

165
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He paid for panels.</v>

166
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 3>He had the whole thing set up and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

167
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

168
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:37.620
<v Speaker 3>they make it super difficult for you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do this because they,</v>

169
00:07:37.621 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 3>they're fighting the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the solar companies,</v>

170
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 3>they don't want them to be autonomous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want people to be autonomous.</v>

171
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.670
<v Speaker 3>They also want you to be connected to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the grid if you choose to remove </v>

172
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 3>yourself from the grid and be just a 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent solar.</v>

173
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

174
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Very hard to get done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Ken,</v>

175
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 3>has he cut off completely but he's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

176
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.480
<v Speaker 3>So you'll pay like a couple cents a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month just to stay on.</v>

177
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

178
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to talk to Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for for the longest time,</v>

179
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's gotten it turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

180
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 3>but for the longest time they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>turning it over.</v>

181
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm talking about six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he makes a sizable investment.</v>

182
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Spent tens of thousands of dollars and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all this equipment installed in </v>

183
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 3>his yard and they wouldn't turn it on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

184
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:21.821
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get them to turn it on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a tesla and I want to go solar.</v>

185
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 3>So it's the car so completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the battery,</v>

186
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 3>the charger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get a rebate off of this thing.</v>

187
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:35.350
<v Speaker 3>The amount of paperwork you have to show</v>
<v Speaker 3>the city of La for them to give you $700</v>

188
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 3>back is you have to take pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your house,</v>

189
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:43.280
<v Speaker 3>pictures of the charger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>receipts from the company.</v>

190
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certificates of work,</v>

191
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 3>things from the panel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

192
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a list of like 12 things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

193
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:50.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

194
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.670
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have to go to the,</v>

195
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.190
<v Speaker 3>to the mailbox once with the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>stamp,</v>

196
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 3>like it's going to take weeks for me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pull that off.</v>

197
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Your comment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

198
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing it.</v>

199
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

200
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 3>I guess going to play ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

201
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 3>They make you do $700 worth of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

202
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Your $700,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where exactly you would think they would</v>

203
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 3>be the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd think they'd be.</v>

204
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that they would encourage it </v>

205
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.141
<v Speaker 3>because it would ease the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rented a Tesl for a day because we </v>

206
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 3>have a sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called Skirt as k,</v>

207
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:22.950
<v Speaker 3>U R T,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're real new,</v>

208
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 3>but what they're doing is they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially like uber for rental cars.</v>

209
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 3>So like say if you were outside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store and you're like,</v>

210
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a rental car,</v>

211
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:35.230
<v Speaker 3>I want to drive to San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll fucking show up in 20 minutes </v>

212
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 3>with a rental car and you'd take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch and drive it up to coast.</v>

213
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

214
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:38.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

215
00:09:38.951 --> 00:09:43.951
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have an application or on your </v>

216
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:43.951
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

217
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:46.761
<v Speaker 3>You use the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you order up a car and you can get a </v>

218
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:46.761
<v Speaker 3>tesla.</v>

219
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:46.761
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

220
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I want to try this service out before we</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

221
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's get me a tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got a tesla.</v>

222
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking services excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show up.</v>

223
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 3>They give you the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give you the key that you do.</v>

224
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 3>You know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

225
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched a couple videos.</v>

226
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

227
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.560
<v Speaker 3>It's real strange because the tesla </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't start now and that's a,</v>

228
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.700
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird one for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get in it,</v>

229
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

230
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't it starting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no revenue gas.</v>

231
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 3>There's no gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no brum,</v>

232
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:10.940
<v Speaker 3>brum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brum,</v>

233
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 3>brum at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

234
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 3>And it just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it in drive and okay we're going</v>

235
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.600
<v Speaker 3>o k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what got me was how quick the </v>

236
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 3>battery drained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

237
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

238
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How quick did it train?</v>

239
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.130
<v Speaker 3>Well I live out here.</v>

240
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 3>You were just about half hour to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Improv.</v>

241
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I drove all the way the Improv back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drove here home,</v>

242
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.900
<v Speaker 3>back to the Improv and back home and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then back here and it was more than a </v>

243
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 3>half a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More than half.</v>

244
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 3>More than half gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

245
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:44.090
<v Speaker 3>that's not 240 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's.</v>

246
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 3>But that's half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 1:20</v>

247
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 3>in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not even,</v>

248
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.250
<v Speaker 3>it's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's maybe 60 miles where the driving </v>

249
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.250
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you punching it?</v>

250
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.860
<v Speaker 3>You must have been because it's a fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I drive any other way to </v>

251
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.051
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a big difference when you're </v>

252
00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:03.861
<v Speaker 3>slamming it was like a thing and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shows you like the sweet spot and </v>

253
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 3>that's around probably around 65.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ground grantee level.</v>

254
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you clash that thing,</v>

255
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

256
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.310
<v Speaker 3>But it eats up the juice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's weird how it accelerates </v>

257
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.571
<v Speaker 3>without gears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very hard for people who have </v>

258
00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 3>driven a regular car to comprehend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just,</v>

259
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.660
<v Speaker 3>it's instant on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like a golf cart,</v>

260
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 3>like a Mongo golf cart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the golf cart.</v>

261
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.930
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even going from zero to 30 5:40.</v>

262
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to get that punch.</v>

263
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.090
<v Speaker 3>It's a wonderful car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

264
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 3>What they've done is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came here from down around Wilsher,</v>

265
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 3>like Beverly Hills area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get on the four or five,</v>

266
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.820
<v Speaker 3>hit autopilot and I didn't steer until I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got off of shut the fuck one-on-one.</v>

267
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't touch the brake.</v>

268
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

269
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 2>didn't touch the accelerator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't steer.</v>

270
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 2>We taxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at a text.</v>

271
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I looked at a text that freaks me out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

272
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.420
<v Speaker 2>It drives better than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it doing?</v>

273
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a camera and it's scanning the </v>

274
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.430
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cameras and sensors.</v>

275
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the dashboard,</v>

276
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 2>it'll show the two lines that are picked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up visually.</v>

277
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.720
<v Speaker 2>It'll pick up the speed based on a sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it has cars,</v>

278
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 2>shadow cars around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's reading all the cars around you,</v>

279
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just,</v>

280
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.290
<v Speaker 2>it just goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said it at the,</v>

281
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.390
<v Speaker 2>at the speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like control and it just breaks and if </v>

282
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.591
<v Speaker 2>you want to change lanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hit the directional and if it </v>

283
00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:43.591
<v Speaker 2>thinks it's safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll change lanes for you.</v>

284
00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

285
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:44.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

286
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those Lexus Suv.</v>

287
00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it'll accelerate and decelerate </v>

288
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:51.460
<v Speaker 2>depending upon the traffic.</v>

289
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 2>So it has a laser sensor and it gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>you options.</v>

290
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Like you could ride someone's ass and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll do it that way or you could spread</v>

291
00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:00.890
<v Speaker 2>it out whereas like four cars in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you,</v>

292
00:13:00.891 --> 00:13:05.891
<v Speaker 2>it starts to break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the way I have it set up </v>

293
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:05.891
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think it doesn't break </v>
<v Speaker 2>that good.</v>

294
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant ass truck right in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty great.</v>

295
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Like when I take my kids to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll hop on the one on one and I'll,</v>

296
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:15.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not have to deal with the braking,</v>

297
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 2>stopping going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That part is just sweet.</v>

298
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome.</v>

299
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:24.211
<v Speaker 2>It's really great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they say a car insurance </v>

300
00:13:24.211 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 2>companies are getting ready for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse of their business.</v>

301
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say once everything is automated,</v>

302
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 2>they think this is the insurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies talking,</v>

303
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:34.930
<v Speaker 2>that it's gonna be an 85 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>decrease in accidents.</v>

304
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>That's how much better the car and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know the car is a better driver than I </v>

305
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more conscious,</v>

306
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:46.951
<v Speaker 2>sees more was long as you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>option to be autonomous on a country </v>

307
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

308
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.340
<v Speaker 2>as long as you get on a country road and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just fucking zoom around and </v>

309
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.900
<v Speaker 2>drive and see things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean do it on your own?</v>

310
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you get on those roads,</v>

311
00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:03.121
<v Speaker 2>like I put it on autopilot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into the comedy store and I go from </v>

312
00:14:03.121 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Sherman oaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sherman Hooks over Laurel,</v>

313
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Laurel Canyon's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wavy gravy and weird turns and people.</v>

314
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.500
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little nerve wracking.</v>

315
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 2>So when you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're doing all those turns.</v>

316
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.800
<v Speaker 2>It's doing it completely by itself on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Laurel to appoint.</v>

317
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that to a point.</v>

318
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.400
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the scary.</v>

319
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the scary part.</v>

320
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 2>So was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really cause you know Laurel,</v>

321
00:14:27.671 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 2>it's old road that you can't read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>

322
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of weirdness going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

323
00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:37.441
<v Speaker 2>I've tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you come back down </v>

324
00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:39.691
<v Speaker 2>towards Ventura and there's like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really whipping turns that you don't </v>

325
00:14:39.691 --> 00:14:43.891
<v Speaker 2>want to just let the car do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's going to be one of those </v>

326
00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:46.351
<v Speaker 2>things where they're going to be forced </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have to Redo the roads to deal with </v>

327
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:46.351
<v Speaker 2>these electric cars that have to read </v>
<v Speaker 2>the centers.</v>

328
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the other thing is I think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology is going to be gps driven </v>

329
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.120
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

330
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.130
<v Speaker 1>that'll help if it syncs up that way the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government can just fucking shut you </v>

331
00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.671
<v Speaker 1>down and pull you over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get exterminate you if you do </v>

332
00:15:00.671 --> 00:15:00.671
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

333
00:15:00.671 --> 00:15:00.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>

334
00:15:00.671 --> 00:15:03.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the grand conspiracy theory about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Hastings.</v>

335
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Michael Hastings is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Hastings is a journalist.</v>

336
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:11.861
<v Speaker 1>He wrote an article for rolling stone </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a general who was involved in the </v>

337
00:15:11.861 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 1>war and he was embedded and while he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded over there,</v>

338
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 1>just coincidentally it was when they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>that big Icelandic volcano.</v>

339
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Icelandic volcano?</v>

340
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

341
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 1>it globally crippled flights for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

342
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I remember that all through Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

343
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.700
<v Speaker 1>so he was stuck over there for I wanna </v>
<v Speaker 1>say like an extra month and when he was </v>

344
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:35.921
<v Speaker 1>stuck over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a little too coffee with this </v>

345
00:15:35.921 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 1>guy and they started cracking a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes about vice president Biden,</v>

346
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.510
<v Speaker 1>who's that?</v>

347
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 1>The soldiers and the general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't remember,</v>

348
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.180
<v Speaker 1>mcallister was at Mcalester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which whichever general believe it's </v>

349
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.230
<v Speaker 1>mcallister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to step down after the article </v>

350
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.100
<v Speaker 1>came out because the article was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely brutal and it was devastating</v>

351
00:15:55.101 --> 00:16:00.101
<v Speaker 1>and so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Michael Hastings character started </v>

352
00:16:00.101 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 1>receiving some serious tangible death </v>
<v Speaker 1>threats that like,</v>

353
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:07.751
<v Speaker 1>you're a dead motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're going to find you like you </v>

354
00:16:07.751 --> 00:16:08.480
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just cost American lives because you</v>

355
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:13.481
<v Speaker 1>just got rid of one of the best generals</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever because you don't think it's </v>

356
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:17.000
<v Speaker 1>politically correct that this guy jokes </v>
<v Speaker 1>around about a guy like Joe Biden who is</v>

357
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:18.920
<v Speaker 1>obviously a fucking goof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

358
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:23.921
<v Speaker 1>Joe Biden's a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a goof and if you don't think he's </v>

359
00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:23.921
<v Speaker 1>a goof wise in the running for </v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

360
00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why isn't he running?</v>

361
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were a bunch of reasons.</v>

362
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:28.430
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Biden was a plagiarist,</v>

363
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.460
<v Speaker 1>like Joe Biden when I was in Boston at </v>
<v Speaker 1>stitches comedy club in 1988 weeks back </v>

364
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 1>when he was running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had abandoned his,</v>

365
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>his campaign because they found his </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches were just gigantic chunks of </v>

366
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:44.380
<v Speaker 1>President Kennedy speech and snap.</v>

367
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still from Kennedy,</v>

368
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew back before the Internet.</v>

369
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew that you couldn't get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>with shit like that crazy.</v>

370
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.910
<v Speaker 1>But he got away with it because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual political scholars who are like,</v>

371
00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck head.</v>

372
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I know that fucking speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we at stitches had Joe Biden tonight.</v>

373
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.830
<v Speaker 1>We would do Joe Biden tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

374
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would steal each other's shit.</v>

375
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you went up,</v>

376
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:09.640
<v Speaker 1>you would do my act and I would try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember your at.</v>

377
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.550
<v Speaker 1>We would try to remember each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

378
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.510
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

379
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.380
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

380
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Fitzgerald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell did I forget who?</v>

381
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Forget the comic who started it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way it's a great idea.</v>

382
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.830
<v Speaker 1>That's how much of a plagiarist he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never heard that.</v>

383
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so well they keep the Democratic </v>

384
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps it under wraps now,</v>

385
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>but it was a big story in 88.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened with this?</v>

386
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.230
<v Speaker 1>So he started getting death threats </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was talking shit about him,</v>

387
00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:41.231
<v Speaker 1>started getting some serious death </v>
<v Speaker 1>threats because this guy was a love </v>

388
00:17:41.231 --> 00:17:44.921
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very respected by these people who </v>

389
00:17:44.921 --> 00:17:44.921
<v Speaker 1>worked for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including soldiers,</v>

390
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:49.990
<v Speaker 1>including Spec ops guys and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who looked at this Michael </v>

391
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Hastings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like you piece of fucking</v>

392
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:55.010
<v Speaker 3>shit anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's just a guy just to replace the </v>

393
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 3>report just to report,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a snarky little fuck,</v>

394
00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do an adderall and a bunch of </v>

395
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:00.740
<v Speaker 3>other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a little cocky.</v>

396
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy drove a 120 miles an hour </v>

397
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:08.991
<v Speaker 3>without hitting the brakes into a tree </v>
<v Speaker 3>on sunset and died under very suspicious</v>

398
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 3>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

399
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:16.070
<v Speaker 3>he was telling people that if he dies </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you should understand that they </v>

400
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:20.541
<v Speaker 3>killed me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really not going to kill myself if I </v>

401
00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:20.541
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just know this.</v>

402
00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:24.980
<v Speaker 3>They killed me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when military experts who understand</v>

403
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:29.130
<v Speaker 3>what's possible today comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>automating vehicles.</v>

404
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say it's absolutely possible.</v>

405
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.010
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are hacking into commander cars.</v>

406
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.740
<v Speaker 3>These cars like your crying that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive itself.</v>

407
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a Mercedes and the Mercedes</v>

408
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:42.320
<v Speaker 3>have that same ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

409
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Especially the new ones do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if his did,</v>

410
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
<v Speaker 3>but what they're essentially saying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>would they could just pin that fucking </v>

411
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.230
<v Speaker 3>accelerator down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just lift off that gas,</v>

412
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.240
<v Speaker 3>lift off that break so the break doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>work at all,</v>

413
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.660
<v Speaker 3>and then disable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disable the bags and steer that </v>

414
00:18:59.660 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker right into a tree.</v>

415
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how they kill them.</v>

416
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 3>That's how people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

417
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his family and a lot of other people who</v>

418
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Speaker 3>are close to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to say anything.</v>

419
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 3>They're probably terrified and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

420
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 3>we believe it was suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

421
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:12.590
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

422
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.360
<v Speaker 3>but the people who knew knew him outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>of his family,</v>

423
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is nonsense,</v>

424
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

425
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a credible conspiracy because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a guy who,</v>

426
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:28.070
<v Speaker 3>through his article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the rolling stone article was </v>

427
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.090
<v Speaker 3>devastating to the military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really devastating to.</v>

428
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't mcallister to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>general has to step down.</v>

429
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Stanley McChrystal hastings and crystal </v>
<v Speaker 3>crystal profiled the CIA director.</v>

430
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:40.830
<v Speaker 3>John Brennan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

431
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.790
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

432
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

433
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:48.681
<v Speaker 3>he was working on a pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another fucking expos day of the CIA </v>

434
00:19:48.681 --> 00:19:52.071
<v Speaker 3>director Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was really interesting.</v>

435
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.650
<v Speaker 3>What was really interesting and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

436
00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I just have to be worried about someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in the audience of the comedy </v>

437
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 3>store and like he's a hack and they take</v>
<v Speaker 3>out their cell phone and make me go into</v>

438
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:07.230
<v Speaker 3>a tree on Laurel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the CIA is not going to care.</v>

439
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.480
<v Speaker 3>But in angry audience member.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's.</v>

440
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 3>He fucked with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the general's name?</v>

441
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Stanley McChrystal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcchrystal McChrystal and the CIA.</v>

442
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.620
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

443
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:24.621
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was a double whammy of fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>ups and it's almost like they wanted to </v>

444
00:20:24.621 --> 00:20:24.621
<v Speaker 3>see what they get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

445
00:20:24.621 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't used this shit.</v>

446
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Let's try to use this shit stateside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

447
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker nutri because got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to be.</v>

448
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.110
<v Speaker 3>Because when someone riding a snarky </v>
<v Speaker 3>article like that,</v>

449
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:37.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know what actually was </v>
<v Speaker 3>said or I didn't read the article,</v>

450
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.680
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it was very disturbing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that were involved there and </v>

451
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.181
<v Speaker 3>what he had decided to do with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>article from their point of view was </v>

452
00:20:47.181 --> 00:20:50.290
<v Speaker 3>take a very inflammatory position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The he tried to,</v>

453
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate it and make it very negative </v>

454
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:55.320
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

455
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 3>they can do things like that if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing an article about it,</v>

456
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 3>if they read your article about you.</v>

457
00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

458
00:20:59.411 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you think about just </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology and I'm so excited about this</v>

459
00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so excited.</v>

460
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:06.680
<v Speaker 2>What it can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing what we're.</v>

461
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff is going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just talking about that service.</v>

462
00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:13.801
<v Speaker 2>We'll just bring it a rental car to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all and it's moving so </v>

463
00:21:13.801 --> 00:21:17.311
<v Speaker 2>quickly and so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I tend to only think of all these </v>

464
00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

465
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:20.350
<v Speaker 2>fun things that you can do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

466
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.830
<v Speaker 2>the evil guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evildoers it can use that same </v>

467
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some.</v>

468
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their mind,</v>

469
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.950
<v Speaker 3>they might not even be the evildoers he </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be a real problem.</v>

470
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

471
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might be in their eyes and enemy of </v>

472
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who's right,</v>

473
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.560
<v Speaker 3>but if he really did interrupt some </v>
<v Speaker 3>military operations at cost soldiers </v>

474
00:21:42.351 --> 00:21:47.351
<v Speaker 3>their lives because the general wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>there anymore because he had to step </v>

475
00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:48.770
<v Speaker 3>down and it fucked up the entire chain </v>
<v Speaker 3>of leadership.</v>

476
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Tevye and he was talking about in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>same article that Jamie put up that he </v>

477
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.340
<v Speaker 3>was around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

478
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.360
<v Speaker 3>whenever he was around people who kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>people for a living,</v>

479
00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.820
<v Speaker 3>they would invariably tell him we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to kill you.</v>

480
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

481
00:22:04.101 --> 00:22:06.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple people that were saying this to</v>

482
00:22:06.111 --> 00:22:11.111
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was several people there </v>

483
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:11.111
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey motherfucker,</v>

484
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:11.111
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so you know,</v>

485
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:11.900
<v Speaker 3>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all going to kill you.</v>

486
00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.390
<v Speaker 3>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did he do?</v>

487
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.100
<v Speaker 3>He doubled down when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the CIA,</v>

488
00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:16.640
<v Speaker 3>afterwards,</v>

489
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.860
<v Speaker 2>God balls the balls on the.</v>

490
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.920
<v Speaker 3>This young man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tested positive when he died for </v>

491
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:24.920
<v Speaker 3>crystal meth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did,</v>

492
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:24.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had,</v>

493
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

494
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.400
<v Speaker 3>verify that just to be sure that he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a,</v>

495
00:22:29.401 --> 00:22:33.570
<v Speaker 3>an issue with drugs in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently from all this stuff that I've</v>

496
00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:36.180
<v Speaker 3>read and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought he'd kicked it,</v>

497
00:22:36.181 --> 00:22:38.760
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>death threats will fucking get you right</v>

498
00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:43.761
<v Speaker 3>back on the wagon or off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work on the line and I'll </v>

499
00:22:43.761 --> 00:22:45.420
<v Speaker 3>have them off the wagon or do they plant</v>
<v Speaker 3>that on him?</v>

500
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy for him.</v>

501
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:50.400
<v Speaker 3>It's his body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may or may not have been real.</v>

502
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it also that stuff a crystal meth </v>

503
00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.960
<v Speaker 3>and adderall are so closely related.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

504
00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.960
<v Speaker 3>they're almost the same thing really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

505
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adderall is very,</v>

506
00:23:02.521 --> 00:23:04.800
<v Speaker 3>very similar to Crystal Bailey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

507
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.430
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

508
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.270
<v Speaker 3>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice healthy dose,</v>

509
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to worry about dying.</v>

510
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or running down sunset with no pants on </v>

511
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.530
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>

512
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.690
<v Speaker 3>you'll get productive instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>destructive.</v>

513
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.250
<v Speaker 3>Productive and destructive are next door</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbors when you're on adderall.</v>

514
00:23:23.251 --> 00:23:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>

515
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:29.010
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the scary thing when they were </v>

516
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:29.010
<v Speaker 2>talking during the Republican debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>

517
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:33.120
<v Speaker 2>how much heroin is in New Hampshire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it just nobody,</v>

518
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.800
<v Speaker 2>not one person brought up prescription </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs cause the lead into that.</v>

519
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can not.</v>

520
00:23:38.641 --> 00:23:39.870
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't.</v>

521
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.690
<v Speaker 2>There's just too much money.</v>

522
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the pharmaceutical companies have </v>

523
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:47.780
<v Speaker 3>been bought and sold.</v>

524
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 4>It's a criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a criminal business.</v>

525
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.910
<v Speaker 4>The whole business is entirely criminal </v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as politics,</v>

526
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 4>the business of politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they get money and what they can</v>

527
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 4>and can't say otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would be talking about cigarettes.</v>

528
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:03.790
<v Speaker 4>Cigarettes kill a half a million people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in America alone every year still.</v>

529
00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still.</v>

530
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does.</v>

531
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 4>It's not changing like dropped off a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit,</v>

532
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with education.</v>

533
00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:12.860
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are fucking dumb man.</v>

534
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.570
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want those things in their mouth.</v>

535
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:19.690
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it true you ever tried smoking </v>

536
00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:24.430
<v Speaker 4>once as a kid we were walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>street and we saw a lit cigarette.</v>

537
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.110
<v Speaker 4>Someone who must just put it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

538
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:32.650
<v Speaker 4>I was just walking with my two buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I picked up a cigarette and imagine if </v>

539
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.390
<v Speaker 4>that's how you got herpes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be such a memorandum cigarette.</v>

540
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 4>I coughed so much.</v>

541
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:42.070
<v Speaker 4>It was like that is all and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably 11 and that was it.</v>

542
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

543
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:45.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was good for you.</v>

544
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.120
<v Speaker 4>It was just a lucky break,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

545
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.840
<v Speaker 4>I smoked with my sister when I was 15 </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she was 14.</v>

546
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:55.990
<v Speaker 4>I tried it and she tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She kept smoking until she was in her </v>

547
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:55.990
<v Speaker 4>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it really,</v>

548
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.490
<v Speaker 4>I think thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>late thirties maybe.</v>

549
00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 4>I never smoked again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just know this is ridiculous.</v>

550
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 4>It just seemed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the idea of it.</v>

551
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:08.570
<v Speaker 4>I like holding something I like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times when I'm out with friends,</v>

552
00:25:08.571 --> 00:25:10.940
<v Speaker 4>let's have like a roll up of Napkin or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something and just.</v>

553
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.500
<v Speaker 4>I just like the authority of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks cool as fuck.</v>

554
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.130
<v Speaker 4>It looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the coolest.</v>

555
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just come out of a show and just light </v>

556
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 4>up by yourself in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the hallway.</v>

557
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.020
<v Speaker 4>You know what's funny?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When cigarette smokers looked down on </v>

558
00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:26.020
<v Speaker 4>cigar smokers like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck off.</v>

559
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.280
<v Speaker 4>I love cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cigars are great,</v>

560
00:25:28.281 --> 00:25:33.281
<v Speaker 4>but it's funny when someone lights up a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigar around someone to smoke </v>

561
00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:34.120
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll be like disgusting.</v>

562
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.350
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

563
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.680
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those fucking cigarettes.</v>

564
00:25:36.681 --> 00:25:37.490

<v Speaker 4>Smell A.</v>

565
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The worst.</v>

566
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.310
<v Speaker 4>The best is pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pipe,</v>

567
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:40.940

<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

569
00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:46.790

<v Speaker 4>offend my family,</v>

570
00:25:46.791 --> 00:25:48.980
<v Speaker 4>which is all girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

571
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

572
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.990
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not so bad.</v>

573
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget it.</v>

574
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:56.360
<v Speaker 4>I can be in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shut all the windows blown.</v>

575
00:25:56.361 --> 00:26:00.050
<v Speaker 4>I might sound with a cigar and someone's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to pop their head out of a window.</v>

576
00:26:00.051 --> 00:26:04.470
<v Speaker 4>You're disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.360
<v Speaker 1>These are from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably dried out.</v>

579

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

622
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.320
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of fucking counterfeit </v>
<v Speaker 4>cube.</v>

623
00:28:02.321 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of fake.</v>

624
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.060
<v Speaker 4>but they don't have enough quantity like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

625
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 4>I forget the name of the area where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow.</v>

626
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 4>There's this area specific era via whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>trabaho or something like that.</v>

627
00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:22.251
<v Speaker 4>I forget what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a very small area where they </v>

628
00:28:22.251 --> 00:28:25.761
<v Speaker 4>grow the best cigars and the soil is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like incredibly rich and they've been </v>

629
00:28:25.761 --> 00:28:30.740
<v Speaker 4>tilling the soil and taking care of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a very specific way for decades and </v>

630
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.630
<v Speaker 4>decades and they just know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing and now America's coming in and </v>

631
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 4>wants to devour it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

632
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:37.840
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

633
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.690
<v Speaker 4>because they do sell them around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of the world.</v>

634
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 4>I used to get them from England.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

635
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.710
<v Speaker 4>I used to get them sent to me from </v>
<v Speaker 4>England.</v>

636
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.870
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly.</v>

637
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.050
<v Speaker 4>It's not legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

638
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.700
<v Speaker 4>They would send them to me and then like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple weeks later they would send me </v>

639
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.151
<v Speaker 4>the bands so they would send them with </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Dominican bands and then you'd take</v>

640
00:28:56.461 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Speaker 4>them off and then they'd send you the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual real,</v>

641
00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.500
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

642
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:04.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend a Gad Al-Mulla that French </v>

643
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:04.550
<v Speaker 4>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

644
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.090
<v Speaker 4>it's like the biggest comedian in </v>
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>

645
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:11.540
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told him that I had gotten a little </v>

646
00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 4>while ago that I had a Cuban cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

647
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.440
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

648
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.760
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

649
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 4>I got them in touch with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you get them?</v>

650
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.670
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my buddy got.</v>

651
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:20.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm from Vegas and he knows a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows a guy like Tom.</v>

652
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans do not get the Cuban cigars.</v>

653
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:29.690
<v Speaker 4>I will bring you some that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 4>France and then he brought some stuff </v>

654
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 4>from France and I couldn't really tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was different,</v>

655
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:34.500
<v Speaker 4>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His point was Cuban will deal with us.</v>

656
00:29:34.501 --> 00:29:36.630
<v Speaker 4>What you're getting is just rehashed </v>
<v Speaker 4>horseshit.</v>

657
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 4>You definitely can get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

658
00:29:39.421 --> 00:29:40.050
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>

659
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 4>I think the ones I have now or are we </v>
<v Speaker 4>are legit maybe.</v>

660
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

661
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.900
<v Speaker 4>The only way to really know is to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>them from Cuba.</v>

662
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even then you don't know,</v>

663
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can be shipping them from Dominican</v>

664
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.760
<v Speaker 4>Republic to Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boxing of being Cuba with their own </v>

665
00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:56.760
<v Speaker 4>wrappers and sending them right to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>to save money.</v>

666
00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

667
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean once people realize that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>so much money in America now.</v>

668
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still don't think you can just go hog </v>

669
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 4>wild on by like 50 boxes of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a limitation on how much</v>

670
00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:11.770
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to import.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to Canada,</v>

671
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:12.740
<v Speaker 4>I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

672
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.360
<v Speaker 4>to a warehouse guy that dealt with Cuba </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he would sell them to the </v>

673
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 4>stores in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was all through the government and</v>

674
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 4>pr and legit and stuff and that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty trippy just walking through a </v>

675
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 4>warehouse of all heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Humidity control.</v>

676
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

677
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:30.970
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting how they have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

678
00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:35.971
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to like keep the cigars at a </v>

679
00:30:35.971 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 4>certain level of humidity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once they do that,</v>

680
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.760
<v Speaker 4>they last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

681
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.750
<v Speaker 4>And you can bring them back to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get,</v>

682
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:44.810
<v Speaker 4>if this is dry and you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just literally come back apparently </v>

683
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:44.910
<v Speaker 4>a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that it?</v>

684
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After a while they just turned to shit.</v>

685
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.870
<v Speaker 4>You got to be careful of mold to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can get mold.</v>

686
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 4>Where do you smoke your cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the fuck I want in your house?</v>

687
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm a man top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do whatever the fuck I want.</v>

688
00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.600
<v Speaker 4>Your no outside go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could do it in my office but open up </v>

689

<v Speaker 4>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

690
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 4>And to have some fucking sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 4>methods of ventilation.</v>

691
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:11.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let God do they hate it or if you just </v>

692
00:31:13.421 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 4>come home and it's still on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

775
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.150

776
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:09.490
<v Speaker 3>That hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hair's more offensive than the time </v>

777
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:12.880
<v Speaker 3>while he was going bald.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what he did it just grow it long on </v>

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:12.880
<v Speaker 3>the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did the Ben Franklin.</v>

779
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.220
<v Speaker 3>I'll admit I've thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing about those classes,</v>

780
00:35:16.221 --> 00:35:21.221
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about yoga classes </v>

781
00:35:21.221 --> 00:35:21.920
<v Speaker 3>that are almost inherently sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

782
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Central.</v>

<v Speaker 3>everyone's in their underwear.</v>

784

785
00:35:27.621 --> 00:35:30.590
<v Speaker 3>that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could all those girls look at him and</v>

786
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.590
<v Speaker 3>it's a little and then he brings him in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

787
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.910
<v Speaker 3>you can be a teacher and he wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cult.</v>

788
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the danger of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

789
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 3>He really gets devout</v>

790
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.940
<v Speaker 4>followers and then has sex with amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of tiger.</v>

791
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:46.070
<v Speaker 4>Seems like no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's one person that's some sort </v>

792
00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.971
<v Speaker 4>of charismatic leader like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you're doing something </v>

793
00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:52.680
<v Speaker 4>spiritual like yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's gonna run a cult.</v>

<v Speaker 4>with a couple teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're no joke and of course you have.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that are like right after you drop your </v>

818
00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 4>kids off at school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a 9:00</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's not like you're saying,</v>

823
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:17.571
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do a photo shoot in here </v>

824
00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:17.571

<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

825
00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:17.571
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>regular looking people.</v>

827
00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:24.940
<v Speaker 4>You go to that class for a couple months</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you start seeing the same people </v>

828
00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:24.940
<v Speaker 4>over and over again.</v>

829
00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.910
<v Speaker 4>Everybody starts looking really </v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive.</v>

830
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.910
<v Speaker 4>So it is essential practice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a,</v>

831
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.010
<v Speaker 4>there's a thing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hot.</v>

832
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.290
<v Speaker 4>It's hot and wet and everyone's naked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.850
<v Speaker 4>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm scared.</v>

835
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:44.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm not scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like as a guy it's 90 percent </v>

836
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:48.921
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should kind of just try and be </v>

837
00:37:48.921 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 4>invisible in a yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get the outside row,</v>

838
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:52.050
<v Speaker 4>keep your clothes on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is really their thing.</v>

839
00:37:52.051 --> 00:37:54.180
<v Speaker 4>And you're kind of visiting is their </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

840
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the guy invented it.</v>

841
00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.880
<v Speaker 4>I invented now he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just took yoga and made it sweaty.</v>

842
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:02.940
<v Speaker 4>Well he just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

843
00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:07.941
<v Speaker 4>he just added.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just put a bunch of poses in a </v>

844
00:38:07.941 --> 00:38:10.191
<v Speaker 4>sequence and he tried to copyright that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sequence but he was turned down so </v>

845
00:38:10.191 --> 00:38:11.610
<v Speaker 4>there's people that he was suing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a very sue,</v>

846
00:38:11.611 --> 00:38:16.611
<v Speaker 4>happy person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if someone's say allegedly I </v>

847
00:38:16.611 --> 00:38:16.920
<v Speaker 4>should say allegedly is a sue happy </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

848
00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.780
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if somebody.</v>

849
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were one of his disciples and </v>

850
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:28.560
<v Speaker 4>started your own school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had his own program and then you </v>

851
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:28.560
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

852
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.760
<v Speaker 4>this guy is kind of a Douche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to pay him money anymore.</v>

853
00:38:29.761 --> 00:38:33.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to go off and just call </v>
<v Speaker 4>it Tom Papa's yoga.</v>

854
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 4>You will get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

855
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

856
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.140
<v Speaker 1>but even though he didn't invent any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those poses,</v>

857
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 1>so he gets a piece of every bikram </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>

858
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.330
<v Speaker 1>That's where he's making all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's got all that Luke and he</v>

859
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:48.331
<v Speaker 1>was trying to say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sequences in order,</v>

860
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.220
<v Speaker 1>the way that he's putting them together </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some sort of a right,</v>

861
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.360
<v Speaker 1>an extra powerful property to them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that was his patent,</v>

862
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.990
<v Speaker 1>but I believe we check on that because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that was turned down.</v>

863
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was.</v>

864
00:39:00.751 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 1>He still made all that dough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

865
00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 1>He made a lot of fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably still makes a lot of </v>

866
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.671
<v Speaker 1>fucking money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the six point five is not going </v>

867
00:39:11.671 --> 00:39:14.841
<v Speaker 1>to make them flinch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's got that and cars just </v>

868
00:39:14.841 --> 00:39:14.841
<v Speaker 1>laying around.</v>

869
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go once in awhile.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How do you make them that much bank?</v>

872
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have thousands of schools all </v>

873
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.010
<v Speaker 1>over the country and each over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

878
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.960
<v Speaker 1>that's where it comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here goes.</v>

879
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.200
<v Speaker 1>The court affirmed that although beak </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rome had copyright protection in his </v>

880
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:46.260
<v Speaker 1>published book on the sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could not thereby invoke copyright to</v>

881
00:39:46.261 --> 00:39:49.560
<v Speaker 1>stop others from using the sequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>described in his book.</v>

882
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's like someone teaching Jujitsu and</v>

884
00:39:55.411 --> 00:39:57.860
<v Speaker 1>saying you can't teach those moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

885
00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Julius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's been around for so long,</v>

<v Speaker 4>There was a guy in my class that used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go there for awhile.</v>

893
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.170
<v Speaker 4>He used to wear the grape smuggler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was very sot nom.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Very nice people.</v>

904
00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

905
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:52.050
<v Speaker 4>it's not like the hot young hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm probably the best looking girl </v>

906
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:52.050
<v Speaker 4>in the class.</v>

907
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.650
<v Speaker 4>A road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a joke.</v>

908
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.360
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not true either.</v>

909
00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:01.140
<v Speaker 4>There's some cute ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the point being is that's not what </v>

910
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:01.140
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

911
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:01.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is a sexual vibe there.</v>

912
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're just there to do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is that kind of thing,</v>

913
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.230
<v Speaker 4>which is why I'm not too big a fan of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the classes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

926
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 1>let's just be as politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this possible.</v>

927
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000
<v Speaker 1>If you were single and the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually was into you and this all went </v>

928
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.530
<v Speaker 1>down according to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

929
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.520
<v Speaker 1>that would be the greatest like fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

930
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in that hot yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hot and Sweaty,</v>

931
00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.810
<v Speaker 1>and afterwards the teacher wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

932
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

933
00:42:03.201 --> 00:42:08.201
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just really feel like your practice </v>

934
00:42:08.201 --> 00:42:08.201
<v Speaker 1>could aid with just a little private one</v>
<v Speaker 1>on one instruction.</v>

935
00:42:08.201 --> 00:42:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

936
00:42:08.841 --> 00:42:09.950
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

937
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.690
<v Speaker 1>First we're gonna start with a foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>massage.</v>

938
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're back.</v>

939
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Your right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

940
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.760
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's rubbing your feet and lifting </v>

941
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.961
<v Speaker 1>your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to stretch your legs out </v>

942
00:42:22.961 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 1>and she's rubbing the inside of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thighs and you start moaning.</v>

943
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.370
<v Speaker 1>She moans back and the next thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it's on top.</v>

944
00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now my stay.</v>

945
00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I had a massage at the Bacara resort and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Barbara.</v>

946
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And The lady got up on the table,</v>

947
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.430
<v Speaker 2>like straddled me on the table like at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one point and it just,</v>

948
00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always thinking,</v>

949
00:42:46.841 --> 00:42:48.790
<v Speaker 2>is it going to go someplace else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't.</v>

950
00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.990
<v Speaker 2>But when I came back to the room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>told my wife what had happened,</v>

951
00:42:52.991 --> 00:42:55.120
<v Speaker 2>she was horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She angry.</v>

952
00:42:55.121 --> 00:42:59.140
<v Speaker 2>She was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That does not happen ever.</v>

953
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:01.960
<v Speaker 2>She was obviously doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

954
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:03.760
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're talking about Jim Norton.</v>

979
00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:05.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to say a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>

980
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:10.260
<v Speaker 1>You could just say Jim Norton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Norton and the outer electrons that </v>

981
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:10.650
<v Speaker 1>spawn from Jimmy and the other guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

982
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 1>you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other one to get the number from</v>

983
00:44:15.721 --> 00:44:18.750
<v Speaker 1>the chat doesn't seem smart to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Jim about in these ones.</v>

984
00:44:18.751 --> 00:44:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had more of my house.</v>

985
00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:20.550
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have a security building.</v>

988
00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:23.870
<v Speaker 1>They can't get inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

989
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.880
<v Speaker 1>but they know where you live now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what if they develop some bizarre </v>

990
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.181
<v Speaker 1>fixation on you from the radio show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then meet you after John Lennon style</v>

991
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:37.190
<v Speaker 4>outside your door?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's any part of that </v>

992
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:38.340
<v Speaker 4>scenario that he doesn't like show me </v>
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

993
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.950
<v Speaker 4>I think also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

994
00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:47.340
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dipping into the world of people </v>

995
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.170
<v Speaker 4>who get paid for sex and there's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily a bad world.</v>

996
00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.360
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

997
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:54.360
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's unnecessary world.</v>

998
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.231
<v Speaker 4>For some people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with Jerkins </v>

999
00:44:57.231 --> 00:44:57.231
<v Speaker 4>someone off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1000
00:44:57.231 --> 00:44:58.200
<v Speaker 4>why is it okay to rub someone's back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not okay to rub their dick.</v>

1001
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 4>You tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1002
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.230
<v Speaker 4>It's foolishness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1003
00:45:02.231 --> 00:45:05.190
<v Speaker 4>You know the only thing I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess the possible threat of diseases,</v>

1004
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:07.950
<v Speaker 4>but if as long as you know proper gun </v>
<v Speaker 4>control,</v>

1096
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.360
<v Speaker 1>He built his own fucking jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He turned himself into his own jail.</v>

1097
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.460
<v Speaker 1>He built his own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made a deal with the government,</v>

1098
00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:28.310
<v Speaker 1>with the Colombian government where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would admit to.</v>

1099
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:33.340
<v Speaker 1>This is all historical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who says this is the historical fact box</v>

1100
00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:36.320
<v Speaker 1>taken from wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually knew about this in advance,</v>

1101
00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:38.390
<v Speaker 1>but I just didn't know how they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to play it out on the show,</v>

1102
00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:42.770
<v Speaker 1>but he did a fantastic job in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he turned himself.</v>

1103
00:49:42.771 --> 00:49:47.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a fucking major league drug </v>

1104
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:47.771
<v Speaker 1>dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The greatest drug dealer of all time.</v>

1105
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:52.151
<v Speaker 1>Next to El Chapo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>El Chapo was apparently even a bigger </v>

1106
00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:55.340
<v Speaker 1>deal than him really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he made it so that he would only get</v>

1107
00:49:55.341 --> 00:49:58.430
<v Speaker 1>charged with one count of smuggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

1108
00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:02.540
<v Speaker 1>And even then he wanted a bargain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to a lesser charge.</v>

1109
00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:06.320
<v Speaker 1>He built his own super powerful luxury </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison,</v>

1110
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:10.580
<v Speaker 1>had his own guards to guard him and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>super powerful</v>

1111
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 4>luxury prison cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where it was in Columbia,</v>

1112
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.540
<v Speaker 4>in Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the government,</v>

1113
00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:19.910
<v Speaker 4>they had um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well he killed everybody and,</v>

1114
00:50:19.911 --> 00:50:21.680
<v Speaker 4>but they had him now and he's like,</v>

1115
00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I even have them nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He turned himself in.</v>

1116
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:26.900

<v Speaker 3>She's just killed thousands of people.</v>

1119
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:37.880

1124
00:50:47.801 --> 00:50:50.351

1133
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching Oj.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a shootout,</v>

1134
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.050
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly from rival gang </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the government.</v>

1135
00:51:21.051 --> 00:51:22.110
<v Speaker 3>I think the government shot him.</v>

1136
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>

1137
00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Who shot him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Pablo was uh,</v>

1138
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.490
<v Speaker 3>was caring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>caring so much.</v>

1139
00:51:28.491 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I was earning so much each year they </v>
<v Speaker 3>read off 10 percent of the money because</v>

1140
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:35.180
<v Speaker 3>the rats would eat it in storage or be </v>
<v Speaker 3>damaged by water.</v>

1141
00:51:35.181 --> 00:51:39.080
<v Speaker 3>And Lost Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be about two point 1 billion.</v>

1142
00:51:39.081 --> 00:51:42.500
<v Speaker 3>So two point 1 billion per month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>per month was what?</v>

1143
00:51:42.501 --> 00:51:44.720
<v Speaker 3>The rats?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1144
00:51:44.721 --> 00:51:49.721
<v Speaker 3>it says here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says each year picture right above </v>

1145
00:51:49.721 --> 00:51:50.850
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Said it was factored in.</v>

1146
00:51:50.851 --> 00:51:53.960
<v Speaker 3>A two point 1 billion loss in profits </v>
<v Speaker 3>each month.</v>

1147
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scroll that down.</v>

1148
00:51:54.981 --> 00:51:57.040

<v Speaker 3>The loss was to what it says it was.</v>

1149
00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.960
<v Speaker 3>It was earning so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each year he'd write off 10 percent.</v>

1150
00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.800
<v Speaker 3>That would be to write 10 percent per </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1151
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 3>She's $420 million a week.</v>

1152
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.900

<v Speaker 1>That is the documentary that was created</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the help of the private </v>

1191
00:54:14.271 --> 00:54:16.190
<v Speaker 1>investigator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Courtney love hired,</v>

1192
00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.130
<v Speaker 1>who actually believes that she had Kurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>cobain killed.</v>

1193
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:24.910
<v Speaker 1>She hired the private investigator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hired the private investigator to find </v>

1194
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:25.760
<v Speaker 1>him during the time that he was missing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blah,</v>

1195
00:54:25.761 --> 00:54:26.030
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

00:54:26.031 --> 00:54:26.420
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

1197
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:31.870
<v Speaker 1>During his interactions with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believed her to be so deceptive and </v>

1198
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:35.030
<v Speaker 1>such a liar and a manipulator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the evidence that he presents,</v>

1199
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.580
<v Speaker 1>he believes is enough to reopen the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

1200
00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:40.490
<v Speaker 1>He said they did a terrible job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>examining the body.</v>

1201
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1202
00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:46.170
<v Speaker 1>they cremated them within six days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The police called it a suicide,</v>

1203
00:54:46.581 --> 00:54:49.700
<v Speaker 1>not an autopsy specialists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just not the way you do it.</v>

1204
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And he said there's enough evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>point to that.</v>

1205
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:58.390
<v Speaker 1>He and his words thinks that courtney </v>
<v Speaker 1>love had Kurt cobain killed for the </v>

1206
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.390
<v Speaker 1>money because he was leaving her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1207
00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:00.140
<v Speaker 4>had him killed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>heroin or that was in his body was three</v>

1210
00:55:08.331 --> 00:55:12.710
<v Speaker 4>times the lethal dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But of course that means for me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got an apartment in new Rochelle </v>

1271
00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:57.360
<v Speaker 1>because it was close to executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>billiards in white plains.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was there,</v>

1274
00:57:59.901 --> 00:58:02.710
<v Speaker 1>but so often my manager thought that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a problem.</v>

1275
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.280
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you taken pool more seriously than </v>

<v Speaker 1>your career?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I might be just so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are hung out with were </v>

1278
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.630
<v Speaker 1>so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1279
00:58:13.631 --> 00:58:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Mount Vernon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy international style.</v>

1280
00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll hang out with a guy who was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>international credit card smuggler.</v>

1281
00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:25.290
<v Speaker 1>He was the first really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is international style and </v>

1282
00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:27.100
<v Speaker 1>international south was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a Gambler,</v>

1283
00:58:27.101 --> 00:58:30.700
<v Speaker 1>but I use that word loosely because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an incredible loser,</v>

1284
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.120
<v Speaker 1>but he made so much money from all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit card swindled that he would go </v>

1285
00:58:37.661 --> 00:58:40.030
<v Speaker 1>into the pool hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is before my time before I met him.</v>

1286
00:58:40.031 --> 00:58:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I met him once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got out of jail,</v>

1287
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:43.330
<v Speaker 1>but he was still a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just couldn't win.</v>

1288
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically he had like these </v>

1289
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:50.551
<v Speaker 1>blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he would have a ball like sitting </v>

1290
00:58:50.551 --> 00:58:53.191
<v Speaker 1>in front of the whole for a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars and he just bumped because </v>

1291
00:58:53.191 --> 00:58:53.191
<v Speaker 1>bobble it.</v>

1292
00:58:53.191 --> 00:58:53.840
<v Speaker 1>He could never win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd never won.</v>

1293
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:56.440
<v Speaker 1>He never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just psychology.</v>

1294
00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:58.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

1295
00:58:58.331 --> 00:59:00.730
<v Speaker 1>So during the time where he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>swindler,</v>

1296
00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.880
<v Speaker 1>what he would do is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was the early days of credit cards.</v>

1297
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:06.790
<v Speaker 1>This is the 19 eighties American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Express.</v>

1298
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.180
<v Speaker 1>They would take these receipts that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would get them from stores,</v>

1299
00:59:10.181 --> 00:59:12.070
<v Speaker 1>like say if they run your credit card on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1300
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get that.</v>

1301
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:18.370
<v Speaker 1>The carbons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would get those carbons and then </v>

1302
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:18.430
<v Speaker 1>they would make copies of the credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>card,</v>

1303
00:59:18.431 --> 00:59:22.610
<v Speaker 1>they make another copy of the credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>card and just fucking run up these crazy</v>

1304
00:59:22.611 --> 00:59:25.130
<v Speaker 1>bills by all this shit and then sell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1305
00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And so he would get money and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to the pool hall was just Brown </v>

1306
00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:34.241
<v Speaker 1>paper bags filled with hundred dollar </v>
<v Speaker 1>bills and people from all over the world</v>

1307
00:59:34.341 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Speaker 1>would come to find him to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1308
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Because he was a loser because he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>loser with tons and tons of cash.</v>

1310
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 1>So he would just lose all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say he's a loser.</v>

1311
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:46.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean like as a person who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very nice guy,</v>

1312
00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.180
<v Speaker 1>but I mean like as a pool player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a loser.</v>

1313
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:54.140
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't a bad player either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like good enough to play.</v>

1314
00:59:54.141 --> 00:59:58.490
<v Speaker 1>But the big games player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he psychologically was a beat,</v>

1315
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.530
<v Speaker 1>a beat man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just could not do it.</v>

1316
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Did he drink?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1317
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.260
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1318
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1319
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.950
<v Speaker 1>he died of cancer and it was an ugly one</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1320
01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>My friend's mom was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1321
01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the nurses that was taking care </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and it was just,</v>

1322
01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>it ended bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all dead.</v>

1323
01:00:16.101 --> 01:00:17.930
<v Speaker 1>All those people that I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then yeah,</v>

1324
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:22.931
<v Speaker 1>the guy who owned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy as red and he was just fucking </v>

1325
01:00:22.931 --> 01:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>hilarious piano players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>musician.</v>

1326
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to invest his money and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought a pool hall and it just became </v>

1327
01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>this incredible hangout because she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy guy as a reedy who owned it was</v>

1328
01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the nicest guy on the planet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody loved them.</v>

1329
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>So they would come and hang out at his </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool hall,</v>

1330
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.190
<v Speaker 1>like partially just to say hi and hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with him.</v>

1331
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And then he created this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

1332
01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>It was like all fun and laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did you know other comics sit there?</v>

<v Speaker 1>of the people that worked there and ran </v>

<v Speaker 1>till the morning and then we'd get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd go to the diner and this was.</v>

1346
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I was 24 or 20 somewhere around there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had no job.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so do jokes.</v>

1348
01:01:33.861 --> 01:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>At night I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would literally,</v>

1349
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I would get up and go to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd had over the pool hall.</v>

1350
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd hang out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what's going on.</v>

1351
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Then I would go do my gig and then I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back to the pool hall and I'd stay </v>

1352
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>there until the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where would you go gig?</v>

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Wherever it was either in the city or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the gigs that I did.</v>

1354
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.530
<v Speaker 1>When I first moved to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that,</v>

1355
01:01:54.531 --> 01:01:56.840

<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1359
01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.600

<v Speaker 3>I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed your car.</v>

1383
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:06.500
<v Speaker 3>I needed a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a car and I wasn't gonna get rid </v>

1384
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:06.500
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>

1385
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.020
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't afford an apartment.</v>

1386
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:11.580
<v Speaker 3>Like apartments for people were out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country or out of the city.</v>

1387
01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:17.300
<v Speaker 3>New York City apartment rates are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane that it doesn't make sense that </v>

1388
01:03:17.341 --> 01:03:19.620
<v Speaker 3>anybody could afford to live there other</v>
<v Speaker 3>than rich people.</v>

1389
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.840
<v Speaker 3>And it's gotten so much worse from back </v>
<v Speaker 3>then way worse way than it was.</v>

1390
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.040
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't achieve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now forget it.</v>

1391
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was poor as fuck you mean back then </v>

1392
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:33.321
<v Speaker 3>when I first moved there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived with my grandfather and north </v>

1393
01:03:33.321 --> 01:03:33.321
<v Speaker 3>ninth street in Newark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey,</v>

1394
01:03:33.321 --> 01:03:38.000
<v Speaker 3>which was the ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather art got it in the 19 </v>

1395
01:03:38.101 --> 01:03:43.101
<v Speaker 3>forties and when it was an all Italian </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood and then it became an all </v>

1396
01:03:43.101 --> 01:03:44.790
<v Speaker 3>black neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it became Puerto Rican,</v>

1397
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:49.791
<v Speaker 3>then it became Dominican and production </v>
<v Speaker 3>left and just dried up.</v>

1398
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did blockbusting where the real </v>

1399
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.270
<v Speaker 3>estate people would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1400
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:57.030
<v Speaker 3>come door to door and they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1401
01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.720
<v Speaker 3>black people are moving in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1402
01:03:58.721 --> 01:04:00.430
<v Speaker 3>you've got to sell now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you're,</v>

1403
01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Speaker 3>your property value's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the floor.</v>

1404
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.880
<v Speaker 3>And they would literally clean out whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>blocks like that.</v>

1405
01:04:05.881 --> 01:04:08.160
<v Speaker 3>And Salomon people would sell their </v>
<v Speaker 3>houses in a panic.</v>

1406
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:09.510
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1407
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:10.740
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1408
01:04:10.741 --> 01:04:12.000
<v Speaker 3>they did to my grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1409
01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.070
<v Speaker 3>I liked black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

1410
01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:17.170
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stayed there to the end.</v>

1411
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1412
01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.440
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.080
<v Speaker 3>There was a common tactic that they used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use.</v>

1414
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Find a picture of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dirty kind of started getting </v>

1415
01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 3>distracted about Mike Segal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1416
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:30.900
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1417
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:32.640
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Segal is a famous world champion.</v>

1418
01:04:32.641 --> 01:04:36.600
<v Speaker 3>This guy's name was buffalo bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is what they used to call them,</v>

1419
01:04:36.601 --> 01:04:40.140
<v Speaker 3>pool player Gambler or water dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Did you know of the pool hall?</v>

1421

<v Speaker 3>let me try and find a place near here or</v>

1422
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:46.170
<v Speaker 3>to the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1423
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I was living in New Jersey when my </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandfather was trying to save up enough</v>

1424
01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:54.291
<v Speaker 3>money to get an apartment and when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>saved up enough money to get an </v>

1425
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:54.291
<v Speaker 3>apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1426
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:58.460
<v Speaker 3>I was taking the trek down to white </v>
<v Speaker 3>plains all the time as my friend John </v>

1427
01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.780
<v Speaker 3>and my friend Johnny B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was Johnny B was actually a </v>

1428
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.100
<v Speaker 3>professional pool hustler who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my best friends became one of my </v>

1429
01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.440
<v Speaker 3>best friends at around that same town </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1430
01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.790
<v Speaker 3>But it was a special place man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've thought about almost writing a book</v>

1431
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:15.930
<v Speaker 3>about the adventures of being a part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that place because it was so fun.</v>

1432
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I was just going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I've been in la too long because</v>

1433
01:05:18.101 --> 01:05:19.150
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole time you're like,</v>

1434
01:05:19.151 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 3>this is a great movie or show was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a movie.</v>

1435
01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:29.060
<v Speaker 3>It was like every night there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something going on there and we would </v>

1436
01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:29.060
<v Speaker 3>run to get to that place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1437
01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't wait to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get in the door and no one had a </v>

1438
01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:34.060
<v Speaker 3>phone back then because there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a cell phone or a payphone,</v>

1439
01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:39.160
<v Speaker 3>payphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would be on the phone all the </v>

1440
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:39.160
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like getting calls.</v>

1441
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.240
<v Speaker 3>It would ring and people would call and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so no one had,</v>

1442
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:45.270
<v Speaker 3>no one had cell phones but people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>come in from all over the country </v>

1443
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.700
<v Speaker 3>because that was a place that will have </v>
<v Speaker 3>gambling action.</v>

1444
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.200
<v Speaker 3>So guys would come in from Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys would come in,</v>

1445
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.610
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy came in from there,</v>

1446
01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:53.580
<v Speaker 3>they can come in from all over the place</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing but not at that level.</v>

1447
01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:54.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't good.</v>

1448
01:05:54.581 --> 01:05:55.830
<v Speaker 3>You're just playing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1449
01:05:56.050 --> 01:06:01.050
<v Speaker 3>I was more of a spectator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was playing and I was playing in </v>

1450
01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:01.050
<v Speaker 3>tournaments and stuff like that and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>

1451
01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:02.920
<v Speaker 3>I got better over the couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I lived there,</v>

1452
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:05.770
<v Speaker 3>but I was never at a level that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys were at.</v>

1453
01:06:05.771 --> 01:06:08.590
<v Speaker 3>These are like real professional level </v>
<v Speaker 3>players would go there.</v>

1454
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:13.650
<v Speaker 3>And is it like any sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those guys just had something </v>

1455
01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:14.350
<v Speaker 3>special or they just put more time in </v>
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>

1456
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1457
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:20.850
<v Speaker 3>I think there are special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain special things like </v>

1458
01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:23.401
<v Speaker 3>athleticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Karl Malone or like a Michael </v>

1459
01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Jordan or know fill in the blanks with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the elite athletes.</v>

1460
01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Lebron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lebron James,</v>

1461
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.910
<v Speaker 3>and you use your regular guy at yoga.</v>

1462
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a regular guy.</v>

1463
01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:41.130
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a giant advantage is a giant </v>

1464
01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:44.611
<v Speaker 3>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has that thing and then on top of </v>

1465
01:06:44.611 --> 01:06:47.131
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when you get a guy like Lebron </v>

1466
01:06:47.131 --> 01:06:49.500
<v Speaker 3>James,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you get as a guy who has this </v>

1467
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.630
<v Speaker 3>massive physical advantage and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>dedication and then intelligence and </v>

1468
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:53.500
<v Speaker 3>then discipline and then you get a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

1469
01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.540
<v Speaker 3>It's once in a lifetime athlete that </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes along that has the whole package,</v>

1470
01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.760
<v Speaker 3>but we'll pull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like that because there's no </v>

1471
01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:02.950
<v Speaker 3>physical strength aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Long arms.</v>

1472
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't help at all.</v>

1473
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.610
<v Speaker 3>Some of the best players in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really tiny guys.</v>

1474
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Are they really using the bridge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1475
01:07:09.231 --> 01:07:14.231
<v Speaker 3>there are other switch hands switch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They play lefthanded like Jose Perico </v>

1476
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:14.560
<v Speaker 3>was like one of the greatest players of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all time.</v>

1477
01:07:14.561 --> 01:07:16.320
<v Speaker 3>He's like five one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1478
01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Tiny little Filipino guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1479
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 3>so it's just more just dedication and </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and dedication,</v>

1480
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:23.980
<v Speaker 3>the implant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of geometry,</v>

1481
01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:29.550
<v Speaker 3>angles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding like how the ball's gonna </v>

1482
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:30.010
<v Speaker 3>reflect off other balls and it's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to bounce off the rail.</v>

1483
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.470
<v Speaker 3>Things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got good though.</v>

1484
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I got pretty good.</v>

1486
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:38.200

<v Speaker 3>Regular people see me play the like,</v>

1487
01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:43.201

<v Speaker 3>impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm okay that game with like,</v>

1489
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.620

<v Speaker 3>Three cushioned billiards.</v>

1490
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Three different balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were,</v>

1491
01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:55.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit one ball and it has to go three </v>

1492
01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.230
<v Speaker 3>cushions and then hit the other bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird game.</v>

1493
01:07:56.490 --> 01:08:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a game that's really popular in </v>

1494
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.490
<v Speaker 3>South America.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was on a movie once and the guy was </v>
<v Speaker 4>renting his house out for you.</v>

1541
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:56.260
<v Speaker 4>Ever seen how they do that?</v>

1542
01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.790
<v Speaker 4>Like people rent their house out for </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies.</v>

1543
01:09:57.791 --> 01:09:58.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to know a guy,</v>

1544
01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:03.810
<v Speaker 4>that's how I paid his whole mortgage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a cool house in the Hollywood </v>

1545
01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:05.110
<v Speaker 4>hills and he just rented out to movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>studios and TV studios and that's how he</v>

1546
01:10:05.111 --> 01:10:10.111
<v Speaker 4>paid his bills and they would only use </v>
<v Speaker 4>it like a couple of days a month and </v>

1547
01:10:10.111 --> 01:10:10.300
<v Speaker 4>that paid for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

1548
01:10:10.301 --> 01:10:15.160
<v Speaker 4>this guy was a chess player and all he </v>
<v Speaker 4>did was play chess really?</v>

1549
01:10:15.161 --> 01:10:18.570
<v Speaker 4>So we're hanging around with this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his house and I'm like,</v>

1550
01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.000

<v Speaker 4>I rent the house out for movies and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of fun.</v>

1555
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:28.390
<v Speaker 4>I like watching movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get filmed in my house.</v>

1556
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:29.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 4>a cool house.</v>

1558
01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:34.090
<v Speaker 4>And so I went with them and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>show me what you do.</v>

<v Speaker 4>so I'll go to this forum and I'll say </v>

1561
01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:44.520
<v Speaker 4>who would like to have a game?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they meet up in this room and </v>

1562
01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.280
<v Speaker 4>then they play chess online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Online.</v>

1563
01:10:45.281 --> 01:10:46.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was watching him play chess online</v>

1564
01:10:46.991 --> 01:10:49.810
<v Speaker 4>and that's apparently where the majority</v>
<v Speaker 4>of games get played.</v>

1565
01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:56.370
<v Speaker 4>Norton and I were starting to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could play against each other </v>

1566
01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:56.370
<v Speaker 4>online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

1567
01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:57.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1568
01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.380
<v Speaker 4>it's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>

1569
01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:05.120
<v Speaker 4>I just the physical part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like anything with online </v>

1570
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:05.120
<v Speaker 4>newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1571
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.790
<v Speaker 4>I missed the physical moving the pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:08.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1573
01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:13.230
<v Speaker 4>he was into it for for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Howard stern was into it to the point </v>

1574
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.940
<v Speaker 4>where he was taking lessons talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it on the air all the time.</v>

1575
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1576
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:17.710
<v Speaker 4>I think he probably decided it was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>a mad.</v>

1577
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:19.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a time suck.</v>

1578
01:11:19.251 --> 01:11:20.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a time suck.</v>

1579
01:11:20.281 --> 01:11:25.281
<v Speaker 4>And once I started being able to read in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the paper the moves and understand it,</v>

1580
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.090
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm spending too much time.</v>

1581
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:30.900
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's what I'm fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>balling me.</v>

1582
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:32.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1583
01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:37.071
<v Speaker 4>King took six course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The obvious Belgium variation.</v>

1584
01:11:38.731 --> 01:11:41.580
<v Speaker 4>Why is it in the paper?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's fucking smart people.</v>

1585
01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.920
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like reading the box score to a </v>

1586
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:46.920
<v Speaker 4>baseball game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1587
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.391
<v Speaker 4>it's always been in the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That particular game that someone's </v>

1588
01:11:50.391 --> 01:11:50.890
<v Speaker 4>playing that you're following along,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're showing,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well maybe.</v>

1591
01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Has there ever been a newspaper that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll show a move then ask you for the </v>

1592
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:04.170
<v Speaker 1>counter to that move and then you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play the game out day after day?</v>

1593
01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.830
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1594

<v Speaker 4>They want it to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then,</v>

1595
01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:10.370

1600
01:12:21.691 --> 01:12:23.880
<v Speaker 1>That we both thought was bullshit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And the idea behind it as no grains,</v>

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:54.740
<v Speaker 1>but you wanted to bring your body into </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketosis where your body burns off fat </v>

1611
01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:58.410
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's telling me not to do it.</v>

1612
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will work for this.</v>

1613
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you done it?</v>

1614
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:02.670

<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did you hear about it?</v>

1616
01:13:06.190 --> 01:13:07.970
<v Speaker 1>We'll have this guy on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name's Mark Sisson.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a pretty famous guy in the Paleo </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1618
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1621
01:13:15.571 --> 01:13:17.200
<v Speaker 1>that's actually kind of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They they brands.</v>

1624

<v Speaker 1>the name is wrong,</v>

1625
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but the diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the principles of the Diet are really </v>

1626
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 1>good for fighting inflammation for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

1627
01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Like he had irritable bowel syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>

1628
01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.960
<v Speaker 1>they find that it helps them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritis and a lot of it cures a lot of</v>

1629
01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:41.760
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I have them,</v>

1630
01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1631
01:13:43.141 --> 01:13:48.141
<v Speaker 1>well let's see what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I had this Guy Kyle Kingsbury </v>

<v Speaker 1>on who's a former UFC fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great athlete,</v>

1634
01:13:49.171 --> 01:13:54.171

<v Speaker 1>And he was talking to me about it and </v>

1635
01:13:54.171 --> 01:13:54.930
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that he said was he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was citing the mental clarity aspects of</v>

1636
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:54.990
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1637
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:57.330
<v Speaker 1>He said it makes his mind functions </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1638
01:13:57.331 --> 01:14:00.240
<v Speaker 1>He has more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He feels more even throughout the day.</v>

1639
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:03.060
<v Speaker 1>And then I talked to my car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother Danny protocols,</v>

<v Speaker 1>said he's been on it since November.</v>

1643
01:14:11.561 --> 01:14:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And he also cited the mental clarity </v>

<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1647
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So just no grains is the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grains.</v>

1648
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Mostly fats like fats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I eat a lot of Avocados.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking Avocados a day.</v>

1650
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:39.550

<v Speaker 1>Just extra heaps of Guacamole.</v>

1653
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.440
<v Speaker 1>And then I two giant things of Guacamole</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of that.</v>

1654
01:14:50.441 --> 01:14:55.080
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just eating guacamole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So steak bowl would have made.</v>

1655
01:14:55.770 --> 01:15:00.770
<v Speaker 1>He didn't mention did I said steak bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you listed a stake taking it.</v>

1656
01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:04.700
<v Speaker 1>But you also took the right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just eating boring shit when I go to</v>

1659
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:13.240
<v Speaker 1>the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Great,</v>

1660
01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but when I go to a restaurant could </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Lord.</v>

1661
01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:20.911
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find things to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Restaurants kill every diet no matter </v>

1662
01:15:20.911 --> 01:15:22.030
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you're trying to do,</v>

1663
01:15:22.090 --> 01:15:25.660
<v Speaker 1>restaurants are just bad place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to this one place and I wanted to</v>

1664
01:15:25.661 --> 01:15:27.790
<v Speaker 1>get a nice salad and then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1665
01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:30.910
<v Speaker 1>What's in the salad dressing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you toss it in the side?</v>

1666
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes already tossed in it.</v>

1667
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.320
<v Speaker 1>You might as well be eating candy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1668
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.950
<v Speaker 1>The side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1669
01:15:35.951 --> 01:15:37.420
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even eat this.</v>

1670
01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all sugar.</v>

1671
01:15:38.441 --> 01:15:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there is some sugar and I go,</v>

1673
01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:44.170

<v Speaker 1>Goddamn desert.</v>

1674
01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>It was glistening with syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

1675
01:15:49.871 --> 01:15:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1676
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:53.290
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's high calorie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have wood ranch.</v>

1677
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Every wood ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbecue places,</v>

1678
01:15:54.970 --> 01:15:56.610
<v Speaker 1>they have this thing called a natalie </v>
<v Speaker 1>salads.</v>

1679
01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Fucking delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it,</v>

1680
01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:01.240
<v Speaker 1>but he might as well be eating an ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>cream Sundae.</v>

1681
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:07.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a salad that's discovered in syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's their salad dressing is syrup.</v>

1682
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:08.710
<v Speaker 1>So how long have you been doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet?</v>

1683
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Today is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

1684
01:16:09.821 --> 01:16:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Day nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

1685
01:16:12.941 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have days.</v>

1686
01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've lost a little weight,</v>

1687
01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 1>which uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1688
01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.750
<v Speaker 1>my body's always pretty much the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight really gain or lose,</v>

1689
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:26.050
<v Speaker 1>but I did some things in the past that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made me lose weight.</v>

1690
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:28.450
<v Speaker 1>One of them was I cut all the sugar out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my diet.</v>

1691
01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I lost five pounds in a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing nothing else but doing that </v>

1692
01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:36.840
<v Speaker 1>really it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went gluten free for a while </v>

1693
01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.110
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helped me a lot.</v>

1694
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.960
<v Speaker 1>That made me feel like there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something going on to that,</v>

1695
01:16:40.961 --> 01:16:44.350
<v Speaker 1>like a energy levels felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My skin look good,</v>

1696
01:16:44.351 --> 01:16:47.980
<v Speaker 1>like really healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what that is though is the sugar</v>

1697
01:16:47.981 --> 01:16:50.080
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think with gluten,</v>

1698
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.100
<v Speaker 1>gluten is bread and pasta in Wheaton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff,</v>

1699
01:16:54.101 --> 01:16:56.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I had an issue with gluten</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

1700
01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:58.590
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't have an issue processing </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten.</v>

1701
01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all converts to sugar,</v>

1702
01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:03.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just a lot of sugar for your</v>

1703
01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:08.041
<v Speaker 1>body and your body just doesn't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much sugar to process this </v>

1704
01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 1>essentially toxic and the more people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are learning about sugar,</v>

1705
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.160
<v Speaker 2>the more people are coming to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement like almost all these </v>

1706
01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:19.450
<v Speaker 2>scientists and nutritional experts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to an agreement like processed </v>

1707
01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 2>sugar is just fucking awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>

1708
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.870
<v Speaker 2>It's really bad and it's in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

1709
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been baking bread lately.</v>

1710
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sourdough bread.</v>

1711
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Sourdough bread is very good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1712
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Has Gluten though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Natural process.</v>

1713
01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sour dough bread apparently has way </v>

1714
01:17:39.190 --> 01:17:42.251
<v Speaker 2>less gluten than regular bread right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here because my wife can eat that </v>

1715
01:17:42.251 --> 01:17:43.520
<v Speaker 2>mechanic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other brand really?</v>

1716
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just takes the.</v>

1717
01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:48.680
<v Speaker 2>You just take flour and water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a starter,</v>

1718
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:51.420
<v Speaker 2>which is culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:56.540
<v Speaker 2>You just start with flour and water and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the natural yeast that comes from around</v>

1720
01:17:56.570 --> 01:18:00.110
<v Speaker 2>us in the environment goes in and starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating that.</v>

1721
01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.260
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it becomes a living thing and people</v>

1722
01:18:03.261 --> 01:18:06.620
<v Speaker 2>have starters that are like 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old wax you take,</v>

1723
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:11.830
<v Speaker 2>you take a couple ounces off and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>always maintain a little and feed it </v>

1724
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.830
<v Speaker 2>like a living thing.</v>

1725
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:13.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like a bowl of flour and water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1726
01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:17.790
<v Speaker 2>you'll see it start to bubble when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feed it more flour and water receding.</v>

1727
01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the coolest.</v>

1728
01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.950
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's in your refrigerator.</v>

1729
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.870
<v Speaker 2>In my fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1730
01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.890
<v Speaker 2>a little little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Mason Jar.</v>

1731
01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.920
<v Speaker 2>And then you scoop it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take a little chunk of it in the </v>

1732
01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.001
<v Speaker 2>feed it and it expands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you take some of that and make </v>

1733
01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:34.820
<v Speaker 2>bread out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is fucking nuts.</v>

1734
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:36.110
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:39.950
<v Speaker 2>So never would have been into this if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't hear that concept.</v>

1736
01:18:39.951 --> 01:18:43.990
<v Speaker 2>And now I can stop baking bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Little Red Riding Hood.</v>

1737
01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Who gave you the idea to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This writer friend of mine,</v>

1738
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:51.260
<v Speaker 2>he's been doing it for a long time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it's just,</v>

1739
01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.330
<v Speaker 2>you just have sourdough bread and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids love it.</v>

1740
01:18:53.331 --> 01:18:56.330
<v Speaker 2>And Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just started doing it and uh,</v>

1741
01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I just got hooked on it.</v>

1742
01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Where do you buy your starter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't buy it.</v>

1743
01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:03.440
<v Speaker 2>You can just start it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make a starter,</v>

1744
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.970
<v Speaker 2>make a starter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1745
01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:09.971
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just take some flour and water and </v>

1746
01:19:09.971 --> 01:19:10.640
<v Speaker 2>put it out on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

1747
01:19:10.641 --> 01:19:11.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>counter.</v>

1748
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.620
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1749
01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's measurements and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's it.</v>

1750
01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:20.710
<v Speaker 2>And then the natural yeast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's yeast around us just floating </v>

1751
01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:22.820
<v Speaker 2>around that explains a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The APP and it goes into,</v>

1752
01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.710
<v Speaker 2>it goes into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1753
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:29.150
<v Speaker 2>into the concoction and you'll see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to bubble and get lighter and you</v>

1754
01:19:29.151 --> 01:19:32.150
<v Speaker 2>feed it some more and it gets bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say feed it like for you,</v>

1755
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:34.430
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a yeast,</v>

1756
01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:39.580
<v Speaker 2>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little community feeding you </v>

1757
01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.250
<v Speaker 2>equal parts of flour and water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1758
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:45.500
<v Speaker 2>And it eats it and now it's like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>living thing in the house who has a star</v>

1759
01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:46.460
<v Speaker 2>that's 100 years old.</v>

1760
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I went to buy a Dutch oven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a pot that you can bake </v>

1761
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.790
<v Speaker 2>that we put the bread in and this old </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy was like,</v>

1762
01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:59.420
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the guy will sit down with like six</v>

1763
01:19:59.421 --> 01:20:02.060
<v Speaker 2>foot lanky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you need it for?</v>

1764
01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make some bread.</v>

1765
01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been making bread for a long time.</v>

1766
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be making sourdough bread.</v>

1767
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my start and where are you getting</v>

1768
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:15.060
<v Speaker 2>your starter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1769
01:20:15.061 --> 01:20:20.061
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine has the brightest </v>

1770
01:20:20.061 --> 01:20:20.280
<v Speaker 2>starter and my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What labrea?</v>

1771
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:25.400
<v Speaker 2>What's the labrea starter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one is that all the brave labrea </v>

1772
01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.600
<v Speaker 2>bakery bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the yeast off of the skin of </v>

1773
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 2>grapes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he is a process where you take grapes</v>

1774
01:20:31.681 --> 01:20:34.190
<v Speaker 2>and you put it in like cheesecloth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just let the.</v>

1775
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:38.760
<v Speaker 2>The yeast come off of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all grapes have yeast in the skin,</v>

1776
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:44.270
<v Speaker 2>eating on the skin of the grapes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that drips off and then you put it into </v>

1777
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.270
<v Speaker 2>the basic.</v>

1778
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Started with flour and water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it have you say liberal,</v>

1779
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:49.160
<v Speaker 2>sweeter say chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you mean?</v>

1780
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Like liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1781
01:20:49.951 --> 01:20:54.951
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see them there are actual bakery </v>

1782
01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 2>and now they're like in Ralph's and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's all over and they say,</v>

1783
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:59.700
<v Speaker 2>and like the places San Francisco that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have big sourdough,</v>

1784
01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:02.400
<v Speaker 2>that it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's maintains the same.</v>

1785
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Started that they've always had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy said,</v>

1786
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:10.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I told them where I was getting my </v>

1787
01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:12.680
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter made one as a gift and then </v>

1788
01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.961
<v Speaker 2>this other guy gave me a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said his starter came from Jackson </v>

1789
01:21:14.961 --> 01:21:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming and he got it from a friend of </v>

1790
01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:23.361
<v Speaker 2>his and it's over 100 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have been passing it on to cowboy</v>

1791
01:21:24.611 --> 01:21:26.010
<v Speaker 2>starter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cowboy started.</v>

1792
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:31.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of miners in San Francisco </v>

1793
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:34.911
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>During the gold rush they were creating </v>

1794
01:21:34.911 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 2>bred that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it started.</v>

1795
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how old the yeast organisms get</v>

1796
01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:46.020
<v Speaker 2>before they die and do they die?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably reproduce in.</v>

1797
01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

1798
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because basically like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have it on my counter nab and feeding it</v>

1799
01:21:52.471 --> 01:21:53.850
<v Speaker 2>for the last day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now,</v>

1800
01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.340
<v Speaker 2>so now it's kind of bubbly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1801
01:21:56.370 --> 01:22:00.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like glue and it's kind of bubbly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll scoop out four ounces of that,</v>

1802
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.520
<v Speaker 2>make bread out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then take one ounce of that,</v>

1803
01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:10.521
<v Speaker 2>put it back in the jar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed it a little and put it in the </v>

1804
01:22:10.521 --> 01:22:10.521
<v Speaker 2>fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the process?</v>

1805
01:22:10.521 --> 01:22:12.360
<v Speaker 2>So if you took four ounces out and made </v>
<v Speaker 2>bread with it,</v>

1806
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:14.310
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The starter,</v>

1807
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:18.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you basically take a lot of flour.</v>

1808
01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:22.440
<v Speaker 2>You take like 28,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is to make two of them two loaves.</v>

1809
01:22:22.441 --> 01:22:27.441
<v Speaker 2>You take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 28 ounces of all purpose flour or </v>

1810
01:22:27.441 --> 01:22:28.770
<v Speaker 2>wheat flour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to use.</v>

1811
01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.860
<v Speaker 2>You put that in with a little salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you take your starter,</v>

1812
01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:35.160
<v Speaker 2>you take the four ounces and an 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>ounces of water,</v>

1813
01:22:35.161 --> 01:22:37.410
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you make it into a cloudy mixture.</v>

1814
01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:43.220
<v Speaker 2>And then you dump that into the flour </v>
<v Speaker 2>and salt that's in your mixer and it </v>

1815
01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:46.080
<v Speaker 2>just makes it into dough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it just rises naturally.</v>

1816
01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Bold it a couple times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it into a ball,</v>

1817
01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:51.960
<v Speaker 2>into the Dutch oven after a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

1818
01:22:51.961 --> 01:22:54.300
<v Speaker 2>and then you've got bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that simple.</v>

1819
01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:59.330
<v Speaker 2>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long before you start growing your </v>

1820
01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:00.240
<v Speaker 2>own wheat and smashing up with a rock?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably I'm.</v>

1821
01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm headed that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is where the guy who worry about </v>

1822
01:23:05.471 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 2>the Dutch oven</v>

1823
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.040
<v Speaker 4>from is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really like seed breads and then I </v>

1824
01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.210
<v Speaker 4>looked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like crazy.</v>

1825
01:23:13.211 --> 01:23:18.211
<v Speaker 4>Like 12 different seeds from different </v>
<v Speaker 4>places and you mash them up and then </v>

1826
01:23:18.251 --> 01:23:23.251
<v Speaker 4>you're getting a job at Williams sonoma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to the Museum of natural history.</v>

1827
01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:26.980
<v Speaker 4>They have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an Egyptian mummy display.</v>

1828
01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.610
<v Speaker 4>Really fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1829
01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:33.190
<v Speaker 4>but one of the interesting things was by</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time Egyptian people were older,</v>

1830
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:34.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't leave that live that long,</v>

1831
01:23:34.631 --> 01:23:39.631
<v Speaker 4>but if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have any teeth left because </v>

1832
01:23:39.631 --> 01:23:40.690
<v Speaker 4>the way they made bread,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they grounded up.</v>

1833
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:44.110
<v Speaker 4>They ground up their own flour and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>left sand in the bread.</v>

1834
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.870
<v Speaker 4>So the bread was all you were eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sand were away your teeth.</v>

1835
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:54.970
<v Speaker 4>That's gross.</v>

<v Speaker 4>were trying to concoct to save teeth,</v>

1839
01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:11.700
<v Speaker 4>like wooden caps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they would put a shoe on that </v>

1840
01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:15.100
<v Speaker 4>instead of chewing with whatever nerve </v>
<v Speaker 4>endings were left in your face,</v>

1841
01:24:15.190 --> 01:24:18.590

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1866
01:25:31.811 --> 01:25:36.811

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1875
01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.290

<v Speaker 4>but it was quite awhile ago.</v>

1876
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:01.360
<v Speaker 4>Probably never find it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>

1877

<v Speaker 4>good for her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is.</v>

1878
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:05.270
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really a weird thing.</v>

1879
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:06.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who haven't never.</v>

1880
01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 4>I've never be bacon bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm like hooked on it.</v>

1881
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a woman who made sourdough </v>

1882
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.530
<v Speaker 4>bread using yeast from her vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just ate the bread.</v>

1883
01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:23.220
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't she know I would eat a </v>
<v Speaker 4>donut.</v>

1884
01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.410
<v Speaker 4>Gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it so gross when I eat it?</v>

1885
01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.170
<v Speaker 4>But when my wife swallows it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all gravy.</v>

1886
01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.520
<v Speaker 4>That's a good relationship to committed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So life is built?</v>

1887
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:41.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a compromise.</v>

1888
01:26:43.150 --> 01:26:45.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm baking bread and getting fat.</v>

1889
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:46.310
<v Speaker 4>What else you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Growing?</v>

1890
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:48.260
<v Speaker 4>Anything in your garden?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You one of those guys?</v>

1891
01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:48.950
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1892
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:50.870
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're surrounded by bamboo.</v>

1893
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:54.770
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't had a bone arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bamboo just cost me five grand.</v>

1894
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:56.630
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1895
01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once we had the reins,</v>

1896
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.860
<v Speaker 4>nothing was draining off the property </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>

1897
01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:02.470
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1898
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.980
<v Speaker 4>they started looking at the drainage </v>
<v Speaker 4>pipes and stuff.</v>

1899
01:27:06.981 --> 01:27:10.110
<v Speaker 4>And the guys who built it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>fastened them together at one point.</v>

1900
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:13.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gram bu has grown into.</v>

1901
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:15.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like a log.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1902
01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:18.260
<v Speaker 4>I never saw it this thick like sign that</v>
<v Speaker 4>just happened.</v>

1903
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:21.710
<v Speaker 4>It's massive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a root growing in my pipe.</v>

1904
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:23.930
<v Speaker 4>CV can find that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was online,</v>

1905
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:27.210
<v Speaker 4>like a toilet route.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like a group,</v>

1906
01:27:27.730 --> 01:27:30.140
<v Speaker 4>like the guy was pulling a Gofer out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>my toilet.</v>

1907
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:35.890
<v Speaker 4>There was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what happened when we moved to </v>

1908
01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:35.900
<v Speaker 4>Colorado for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1909
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.080
<v Speaker 4>I didn't use that bathroom obviously </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we were there for like four </v>

1910
01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:41.080
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1911
01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:45.550
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing had apparently been in the </v>

1912
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.550
<v Speaker 4>toilet.</v>

1913
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:46.160
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's from my own bathroom.</v>

1914
01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:49.520
<v Speaker 4>That's the bathroom in my office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1915
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:52.580
<v Speaker 4>That thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy is holding it up right now.</v>

1916
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm sending you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that solid or was that.</v>

1917
01:27:54.741 --> 01:27:59.741
<v Speaker 4>Was that fibrous?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that flicker can send me that </v>

1918
01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:03.431
<v Speaker 4>photo so I can put it up on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because I always forget about this,</v>

1919
01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:06.170
<v Speaker 4>I need to put it up somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Show people.</v>

1920
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:09.380
<v Speaker 4>But that fucking thing it looked like if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see how thick it is,</v>

1921
01:28:09.381 --> 01:28:11.180
<v Speaker 4>it looks like he's pulling a Muskrat </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

1922
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:13.700
<v Speaker 4>It looks like some kind of a weasel or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1923
01:28:13.701 --> 01:28:15.410
<v Speaker 4>How long was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking huge.</v>

1924
01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:18.770
<v Speaker 4>It's like four feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least you start to get scared of it.</v>

1925
01:28:18.771 --> 01:28:20.600
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff is really invasive.</v>

1926
01:28:20.601 --> 01:28:23.060
<v Speaker 4>Like it could really do some damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1927
01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.330
<v Speaker 4>It's not good with this beautiful bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1928
01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:27.110
<v Speaker 4>That's your bread.</v>

1929
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:29.030
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

1930
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:31.160
<v Speaker 4>That looks excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

1931
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:36.250
<v Speaker 4>It makes me want to break my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like one of my first ones and </v>

1932
01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:36.250
<v Speaker 4>this is the starter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you gotten better at it?</v>

1933
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fortunately we got to get back on the </v>

1934
01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:41.720
<v Speaker 4>road home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Baking bread.</v>

1935
01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.820
<v Speaker 4>This is a lot of starter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1936
01:28:43.821 --> 01:28:48.821
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just since before I knew what I was </v>

1937
01:28:48.821 --> 01:28:48.821
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was growing a lot of it.</v>

1938
01:28:48.821 --> 01:28:50.020
<v Speaker 4>Now you just need like a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was this just like,</v>

1939
01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.190
<v Speaker 4>do you have a burning desire to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1940
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.200
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend told me about it,</v>

1941
01:28:54.201 --> 01:28:57.830
<v Speaker 4>that he was doing it and I came home at </v>
<v Speaker 4>dinner,</v>

1942
01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:02.840
<v Speaker 4>told my wife and kids about it and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>for Christmas my daughter started a </v>

1943
01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:08.420
<v Speaker 4>starter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She went off in youtube and figured out </v>

1944
01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:10.500
<v Speaker 4>how to do it and then for her presence </v>
<v Speaker 4>she gave me some starter.</v>

1945
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so cute.</v>

1946
01:29:12.001 --> 01:29:17.001
<v Speaker 4>So sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we started making bread off of that </v>

1947
01:29:17.001 --> 01:29:17.001
<v Speaker 4>and then my other friend who turned me </v>
<v Speaker 4>onto it originally,</v>

1948
01:29:17.001 --> 01:29:21.090
<v Speaker 4>he brought me a little of the bravest </v>
<v Speaker 4>starter creatures.</v>

1949
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:26.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you thought about experimenting </v>

1950
01:29:26.150 --> 01:29:26.150
<v Speaker 4>with different starters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the grape starter?</v>

1951
01:29:26.150 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 4>The starter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pussy ones.</v>

1952
01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 4>Intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know about it until just now.</v>

1953
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.980
<v Speaker 4>That's the show's good for now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1954
01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:41.010
<v Speaker 4>it now maybe grow my own weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be good.</v>

1955
01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Now it's pretty safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty safe to grow.</v>

1956
01:29:43.331 --> 01:29:44.550
<v Speaker 4>You don't really get in trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1957
01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:45.280
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fornia,</v>

1958
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:47.280
<v Speaker 4>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go to jail forever.</v>

1959
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:52.310
<v Speaker 4>You can so stupid forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can fucking lock if they found you </v>

1960
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:57.171
<v Speaker 4>with a giant plant that not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say if you have a plant in the </v>

1961
01:29:57.171 --> 01:29:58.920
<v Speaker 4>plants and dirt and the dirt and a pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were the whole thing together.</v>

1962
01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:02.850
<v Speaker 4>So if you have a big heavy clay pot at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end,</v>

1963
01:30:02.851 --> 01:30:05.760
<v Speaker 4>the dirt that it goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might have 50 pounds of weed.</v>

1964
01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:11.130
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you really don't even have a pound </v>

1965
01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:11.130
<v Speaker 4>of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1966
01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:12.930
<v Speaker 4>that's probably a male class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew it in college.</v>

1967
01:30:12.931 --> 01:30:15.390
<v Speaker 4>We had a house and we had like a walk in</v>
<v Speaker 4>closet.</v>

1968
01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:18.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the happy days.</v>

1969
01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just seeing it come alive and knowing,</v>

1970
01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:27.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in school you had no money to even buy </v>

1971
01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:27.220
<v Speaker 4>it and then we'll all of a sudden we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were growing.</v>

1972
01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:30.150
<v Speaker 4>It is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is not to sell just for ourselves.</v>

1973
01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.130
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1974
01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:32.490
<v Speaker 4>it was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was beautiful.</v>

1975
01:30:32.491 --> 01:30:34.410
<v Speaker 4>That would be a nice thing to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good idea.</v>

1976
01:30:34.411 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 4>Until your kids find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:40.290
<v Speaker 4>Then you got to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know know daddy's funny and silly.</v>

1978
01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Daddy's enhanced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was natural for awhile,</v>

1979
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:49.770
<v Speaker 4>but now he's got to keep it going with I</v>
<v Speaker 4>knew a guy who had a um,</v>

1980
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:54.950
<v Speaker 4>a dispensary and in the back room of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dispensary it was a very large room </v>

1981
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:58.020
<v Speaker 4>where they were growing weed and I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the room and it was like we'd those</v>

1982
01:30:58.021 --> 01:31:03.021
<v Speaker 4>like five feet high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five foot high plants and all these </v>

1983
01:31:03.021 --> 01:31:03.021
<v Speaker 4>lights and everything.</v>

1984
01:31:03.021 --> 01:31:05.820
<v Speaker 4>And I swear to God it felt like you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>going into a room filled with people.</v>

1985
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:09.060
<v Speaker 4>Like there was like an intelligence in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that room.</v>

1986
01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:11.090
<v Speaker 4>Really very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

1987
01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Granted I was hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It must have been really when I walked </v>

1988
01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:19.881
<v Speaker 4>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do really think there's something </v>

1989
01:31:19.881 --> 01:31:19.881
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was something to that room.</v>

1990
01:31:19.881 --> 01:31:20.160
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1991
01:31:20.161 --> 01:31:22.530
<v Speaker 4>this room feels like there's things in </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1992
01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.820
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't seem like a room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Full plant.</v>

1993
01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:29.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can go into a room full of </v>

1994
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:29.840
<v Speaker 4>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1995
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:29.840
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is beautiful vegetation.</v>

1996
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is like,</v>

1997
01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:31.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>full of hello.</v>

1998
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:38.290
<v Speaker 4>It was very weird that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally get that you really start to </v>

1999
01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:42.201
<v Speaker 4>care for them too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really seems insane that you don't </v>

2000
01:31:42.201 --> 01:31:46.281
<v Speaker 4>own a dispensary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like me and anybody with anybody </v>

2001
01:31:46.281 --> 01:31:48.110
<v Speaker 4>with a brain living in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you see in,</v>

2002
01:31:48.111 --> 01:31:53.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Denver print money to change that city </v>

2003
01:31:53.111 --> 01:31:55.770
<v Speaker 4>and people are making so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about going into.</v>

2004
01:31:56.710 --> 01:31:57.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2005
01:31:57.530 --> 01:32:00.000
<v Speaker 4>We've considered starting in Denver,</v>

2006
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:05.010
<v Speaker 3>perhaps some sort of an edible factory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really hire mercenaries.</v>

2007
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:13.470
<v Speaker 3>What do I got?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta hire mercenaries and I'm not </v>

2008
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.940
<v Speaker 3>joking if you want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all cash.</v>

2009
01:32:13.941 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 3>It's all cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2010
01:32:15.570 --> 01:32:19.000
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a lot of people that</v>

2011
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 3>know that this is like essentially like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bank they can rob,</v>

2012
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:26.911
<v Speaker 3>but it has much less security and for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the longest time people were being </v>

2013
01:32:26.911 --> 01:32:31.291
<v Speaker 3>forced to take these cash drops and take</v>
<v Speaker 3>him to banks and banks weren't even </v>

2014
01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:36.751
<v Speaker 3>taking them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then they would have to take them to </v>

2015
01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:38.581
<v Speaker 3>banks and convert them to like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>traveler's check or something along </v>

2016
01:32:38.581 --> 01:32:38.581
<v Speaker 3>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a bunch of different work</v>

2017
01:32:38.581 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 3>around so they had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some banks do.</v>

2018
01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Banks are taking it now though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck they're doing</v>

2019
01:32:43.901 --> 01:32:48.901
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's the real issue is </v>

2020
01:32:48.901 --> 01:32:51.190
<v Speaker 3>if some fucking Wackadoo like Ted Cruz </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually becomes the president,</v>

2021
01:32:52.090 --> 01:32:54.790
<v Speaker 3>which is not outside of the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>

2022
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Phillips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the scariest elections in</v>

2023
01:32:57.041 --> 01:33:02.041
<v Speaker 3>recent memory for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is the most scary because I </v>

2024
01:33:02.041 --> 01:33:03.970
<v Speaker 3>don't think that people are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>vote for Hillary Clinton.</v>

2025
01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:06.730
<v Speaker 3>I not only do I not think that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are willing to vote for her.</v>

2026
01:33:06.731 --> 01:33:08.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2027
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:13.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the people that are willing to </v>

2028
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:15.541
<v Speaker 3>vote for her are only willing to vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>for her because she's a woman and they </v>

2029
01:33:15.541 --> 01:33:15.541
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

2030
01:33:15.541 --> 01:33:15.541
<v Speaker 3>let's see if chicks can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2031
01:33:15.541 --> 01:33:17.470
<v Speaker 3>or I want a woman in office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

2032
01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:20.290
<v Speaker 3>I get that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's not compelling as a leader.</v>

2033
01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:24.070
<v Speaker 3>She's just not now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Bernie Sanders is interesting.</v>

2034
01:33:24.490 --> 01:33:26.380
<v Speaker 3>He's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very interesting.</v>

2035
01:33:26.381 --> 01:33:28.650
<v Speaker 3>Socially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very interesting in that he's.</v>

2036
01:33:28.651 --> 01:33:33.651
<v Speaker 3>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's way more a man of a people of the </v>

2037
01:33:33.651 --> 01:33:37.021
<v Speaker 3>people than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people like he's a career </v>

2038
01:33:37.021 --> 01:33:37.021
<v Speaker 3>politician.</v>

2039
01:33:37.021 --> 01:33:37.021
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2040
01:33:37.021 --> 01:33:41.131
<v Speaker 3>but this fucking guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so different than any other career </v>

2041
01:33:41.131 --> 01:33:41.730
<v Speaker 3>politician that's running for office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he is.</v>

2042
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:46.770
<v Speaker 3>He's the most intriguing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting and intriguing to me along </v>

2043
01:33:46.770 --> 01:33:49.681
<v Speaker 3>with trump and trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although he says a lot of really stupid </v>

2044
01:33:49.681 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 3>things and he's ridiculous and he's his </v>
<v Speaker 3>ego's out of control.</v>

2045
01:33:51.911 --> 01:33:54.910
<v Speaker 3>And the shit that he says about Mexicans</v>
<v Speaker 3>is deplorable.</v>

2046
01:33:55.570 --> 01:34:00.570
<v Speaker 3>He's so wealthy that he can do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck he wants and he's using all of </v>

2047
01:34:00.570 --> 01:34:05.041
<v Speaker 3>his own money to fund this campaign and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he won't be a puppet the same way that </v>

2048
01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or any of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>other guys on the right.</v>

2049
01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Will those guys scare the fuck out of me</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Ted Cruz guy scares the fuck out of</v>

2050
01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:14.320
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really framing.</v>

2051
01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.390
<v Speaker 3>He's so dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not dumb.</v>

2052
01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:17.310
<v Speaker 3>That's what scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2053
01:34:17.311 --> 01:34:17.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2054
01:34:17.650 --> 01:34:22.650
<v Speaker 3>he's very smart as far as education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the shit that he says and Oh my God,</v>

2055
01:34:23.411 --> 01:34:28.411
<v Speaker 3>I think the Hillary thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also a majority of people who </v>

2056
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:34.170
<v Speaker 3>from that party who will vote to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>things going on the Obama track.</v>

2057
01:34:34.171 --> 01:34:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's enough of that that</v>

2058
01:34:36.851 --> 01:34:40.540
<v Speaker 3>just kind of Grin and bear voting for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary,</v>

2059
01:34:40.630 --> 01:34:42.670
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton versus Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2060
01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:47.740
<v Speaker 3>who knows what the fuck happens if Putin</v>
<v Speaker 3>decides to ramp it up because hillary </v>

2061
01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.180
<v Speaker 3>becomes president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty tough though.</v>

2062
01:34:49.181 --> 01:34:50.920
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had that job.</v>

2065
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.550

<v Speaker 4>She wasn't,</v>

2066

<v Speaker 4>she wasn't nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real queen,</v>

2067

<v Speaker 4>She just so non compelling to me.</v>

2069
01:35:10.851 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing she says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>

2070
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:17.790
<v Speaker 4>A great photo that I put up on instagram</v>
<v Speaker 4>that somebody made of the difference </v>

2071
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 4>between Bernie Sanders and Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton in regard to their response.</v>

2072
01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:22.310
<v Speaker 4>Like what is the olive garden like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do,</v>

2073
01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.950

<v Speaker 4>It's funny,</v>

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:29.390
<v Speaker 4>I'll show Jamie pull it up because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>so hilarious.</v>

2075
01:35:29.391 --> 01:35:32.870
<v Speaker 4>But it is how I feel about Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton.</v>

2076
01:35:32.871 --> 01:35:36.740
<v Speaker 4>Like I feel like she's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2077
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:38.540
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>

2078
01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:41.120
<v Speaker 4>It's politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's also boring.</v>

2079
01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that is something you kind </v>

2080
01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:46.400
<v Speaker 4>of appreciate when they're in office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2081
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:50.060
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama's kind of boring and wonkish any,</v>

2082
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:53.840
<v Speaker 4>but it just kinda no drama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No big.</v>

2083
01:35:53.841 --> 01:35:58.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking against her at the same </v>

2084
01:35:58.841 --> 01:35:58.841
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with Obama there was no scandal.</v>

2085
01:35:58.910 --> 01:36:03.910
<v Speaker 4>There was no do surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no things taking us off track </v>

2086
01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:06.210
<v Speaker 4>day just kind of went to work </v>
<v Speaker 4>methodically.</v>

2087
01:36:06.211 --> 01:36:07.910
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't flashy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't exciting,</v>

2088
01:36:07.911 --> 01:36:12.911
<v Speaker 4>but it's improved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it is all garden and authentic </v>

2089
01:36:13.671 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 4>Italian restaurant for the whole family </v>
<v Speaker 4>says Hillary Bernie.</v>

2090
01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:21.080
<v Speaker 4>Only when I'm high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't make sense.</v>

2091
01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:23.210
<v Speaker 4>It totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2092
01:36:23.211 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that um,</v>

2093
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:29.960
<v Speaker 4>this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no one that really grabs me.</v>

2094
01:36:29.961 --> 01:36:34.070
<v Speaker 4>Like Al Know Al Gore when he was running</v>
<v Speaker 4>opposite of Bush was compelling.</v>

2095
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:39.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a guy who cares a lot about the </v>

2096
01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:39.460
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2097
01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:39.460
<v Speaker 4>people is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2098
01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:42.661
<v Speaker 4>he's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That movie an inconvenient truth is </v>

2099
01:36:42.661 --> 01:36:43.580
<v Speaker 4>filled with books and bullshit and lies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and propaganda.</v>

2100
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:47.870
<v Speaker 4>Not One question about climate change in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Republican debates.</v>

2101
01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:50.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to keep the that on the DL.</v>

2102
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.280
<v Speaker 4>Not One pill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Addictions,</v>

2103
01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:54.470
<v Speaker 4>like we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical addictions,</v>

2104
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:58.520
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if there was a drug that just got</v>

2105
01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 4>released that's killing as many people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes,</v>

2106
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:02.390
<v Speaker 4>that would be the number one hot topic </v>
<v Speaker 4>for debate.</v>

2107
01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:05.750
<v Speaker 4>If there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a disease like the Zika virus,</v>

2108
01:37:05.751 --> 01:37:08.360
<v Speaker 4>it was killing a half million people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be the number one hot,</v>

2109
01:37:08.361 --> 01:37:13.361
<v Speaker 4>huge topic of debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Half a million people a year in this </v>

2110
01:37:13.361 --> 01:37:16.331
<v Speaker 4>country alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But cigarettes skirt right under the </v>

2111
01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:16.331
<v Speaker 4>radar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2112
01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:16.880
<v Speaker 4>It's because the amount of money they </v>
<v Speaker 4>contribute.</v>

2113
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:18.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

2114
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:21.970
<v Speaker 4>The heroin problem in New Hampshire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2115
01:37:22.450 --> 01:37:27.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you think that drumming up such </v>

2116
01:37:27.450 --> 01:37:27.950
<v Speaker 4>fear about all the terrorism is so good </v>
<v Speaker 4>because these guys want to come.</v>

2117
01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.990
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing with the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 4>complex.</v>

2118
01:37:29.991 --> 01:37:33.950
<v Speaker 4>They want to just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys spend a lot of money on those</v>

2119
01:37:33.951 --> 01:37:38.951
<v Speaker 4>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also know the whole reality of </v>

2120
01:37:38.951 --> 01:37:42.011
<v Speaker 4>the New Hampshire heroin problem was </v>
<v Speaker 4>entirely spawned entirely spawned by </v>

2121
01:37:42.681 --> 01:37:43.730
<v Speaker 4>oxicon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2122
01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.960
<v Speaker 4>It was people that got oxycontin's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got them easy and cheaply,</v>

2123
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:53.080
<v Speaker 4>and then they cramp down on it when they</v>
<v Speaker 4>found that all these people are </v>

2124
01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:53.120
<v Speaker 4>addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what did they do?</v>

2125
01:37:53.121 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 4>Did they fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they cure their addiction.</v>

2126
01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:01.160
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made these poor fucking people try </v>

2127
01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.921
<v Speaker 3>to figure out some other way to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>their fix and the way to do that was </v>

2128
01:38:03.921 --> 01:38:05.400
<v Speaker 3>heroin a cheaper way to get it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To get it?</v>

2129
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.530
<v Speaker 3>The only way to get it because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't get the pills anymore,</v>

2130
01:38:07.890 --> 01:38:10.080
<v Speaker 3>so they started shooting up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it came from.</v>

2131
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:15.081
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all spawned out of the </v>

2132
01:38:15.081 --> 01:38:15.081
<v Speaker 3>prescription drug problem that we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country.</v>

2133
01:38:15.081 --> 01:38:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Apparently that movie that those guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>came in here,</v>

2134
01:38:16.921 --> 01:38:21.921
<v Speaker 3>this prescription thugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's very good and there's </v>

2135
01:38:21.921 --> 01:38:25.491
<v Speaker 3>some insane fucking stats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>statistics about it and I'll try to get </v>

2136
01:38:25.491 --> 01:38:29.560
<v Speaker 3>those guys to come back in and talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it after I'm there.</v>

2137
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:32.430
<v Speaker 3>They're doing their their press cycle </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now and after I watch it,</v>

2138
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:35.220
<v Speaker 3>but a the same guys who did bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

2139
01:38:35.221 --> 01:38:37.650

<v Speaker 3>which was supposedly on steroids.</v>

2142
01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:46.380
<v Speaker 3>but it's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrifying,</v>

2143
01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:47.560
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

2144
01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:53.060
<v Speaker 3>What's so scary as a parent is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could basically raise this beautiful </v>

2145
01:38:54.451 --> 01:38:58.740
<v Speaker 3>person their whole life and get to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever age.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Someone could fucking give them </v>

2151
01:39:15.111 --> 01:39:15.111
<v Speaker 3>something and they can die from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone can lie to them.</v>

2152
01:39:15.111 --> 01:39:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Someone could bill cosby them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give them some shit that they think is </v>

<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but it at least it's opening up this </v>

2169
01:39:56.901 --> 01:40:00.711
<v Speaker 3>discussion that I think we need to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country about men who are </v>

2170
01:40:00.711 --> 01:40:02.040

<v Speaker 3>allegedly wasn't cee lo green busted for</v>
<v Speaker 3>given girls ecstasy just without them </v>

2177
01:40:23.311 --> 01:40:24.020
<v Speaker 3>knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2178
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allegedly,</v>

2179
01:40:26.041 --> 01:40:29.100
<v Speaker 3>allegedly who the guy who looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>peanut m and m was trying to get.</v>

2180
01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Get some boats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had some pressure.</v>

2181
01:40:30.741 --> 01:40:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him once they get on a plane,</v>

2182
01:40:35.281 --> 01:40:36.990
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus Christ.</v>

2183
01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:39.210
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop eating dude.</v>

2184
01:40:40.450 --> 01:40:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Settle down gluten grain and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take bowls stomach.</v>

2185
01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:48.690
<v Speaker 3>He had that one song that fuck you song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Song.</v>

2186
01:40:48.710 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 3>It was a good song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that launched the whole thing is </v>

2187
01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since those allegations,</v>

2188
01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:54.610
<v Speaker 3>I think he's kind of disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2189
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the deal is.</v>

2190
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:58.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean he might be in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trial or something.</v>

2191
01:40:58.990 --> 01:41:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to knock them out.</v>

2192
01:41:02.190 --> 01:41:03.730
<v Speaker 3>We'll access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't knock them out,</v>

2193
01:41:03.731 --> 01:41:05.830
<v Speaker 3>but I think it makes them much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to have sex.</v>

2194
01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:08.020
<v Speaker 3>But back to the cosby thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what you're saying,</v>

2195
01:41:08.021 --> 01:41:12.000
<v Speaker 3>like that issue of guys that are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to knock women out.</v>

2196
01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you feel good about yourself the </v>

2197
01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:18.020
<v Speaker 3>next.</v>

2198
01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:18.020
<v Speaker 3>As soon as it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about that.</v>

2199
01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:19.420
<v Speaker 3>It's about getting back at women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2200
01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:20.350
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2201
01:41:20.351 --> 01:41:25.351
<v Speaker 3>I think there's women out there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate men and there's men out there that </v>

2202
01:41:26.381 --> 01:41:28.450
<v Speaker 3>hate women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at this point it's ridiculous to</v>

2203
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:33.690
<v Speaker 3>pretend anything different and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a direct correlation between </v>

2204
01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:38.010
<v Speaker 3>people that have been rejected and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have associated women with </v>

2205
01:41:38.010 --> 01:41:39.850
<v Speaker 3>someone who's going to turn them down or</v>
<v Speaker 3>treat them like shit because they're not</v>

2206
01:41:39.851 --> 01:41:41.100
<v Speaker 3>physically attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2207
01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.060
<v Speaker 3>This fucking guy is built like a peanut </v>
<v Speaker 3>m and m's.</v>

2208
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2209
01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:49.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky enough where I never had </v>

2210
01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.520
<v Speaker 2>those interactions with girls coming up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with funny.</v>

2211
01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:54.020
<v Speaker 2>It was funny and pretty good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2212
01:41:54.021 --> 01:41:59.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a meeting friends as an adult who </v>

2213
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:03.910
<v Speaker 2>women just screwed them over in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

2214
01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:05.930
<v Speaker 2>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their fable.</v>

2215
01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:10.250
<v Speaker 2>They come out with a whole different </v>
<v Speaker 2>view of womanhood.</v>

2216
01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2217
01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:16.060
<v Speaker 2>mine was really pleasant and I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>see women as the victim or I always see </v>

2218
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:19.931
<v Speaker 2>women and the guys who had a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty time and they got jumped on and </v>

2219
01:42:19.931 --> 01:42:24.461
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a rage that these guys carry </v>

2220
01:42:24.461 --> 01:42:27.731
<v Speaker 2>around that it's really just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a stroke of luck that when I was </v>

2221
01:42:27.731 --> 01:42:28.070
<v Speaker 2>young I met them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice ones.</v>

2222
01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:29.290
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2223
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:31.460
<v Speaker 2>These guys are really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2224
01:42:31.461 --> 01:42:35.120
<v Speaker 2>you see guys like and they kind of say </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes about like knocking a girl out and</v>

2225
01:42:35.121 --> 01:42:36.800
<v Speaker 2>doing all those kinds of events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really.</v>

2226
01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.760
<v Speaker 2>They're not really kidding in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2227
01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:44.800
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a darkness anytime you talk about </v>

2228
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:44.800
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2229
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:44.800
<v Speaker 3>These guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2230
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.300
<v Speaker 3>there's always going to be people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>got fucked over by somebody and if </v>

2231
01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:53.491
<v Speaker 3>you're involved in a horrific divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have a friend who was involved in </v>

2232
01:42:53.491 --> 01:42:57.671
<v Speaker 3>a horrific divorce that took years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about on this podcast ad </v>

2233
01:42:57.671 --> 01:42:59.200
<v Speaker 3>nauseum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately he's,</v>

2234
01:42:59.201 --> 01:43:04.201
<v Speaker 3>he's got to pay her for the rest of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>life because you were married for 12 </v>

2235
01:43:04.201 --> 01:43:04.201
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he,</v>

2236
01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:09.560
<v Speaker 3>she's a grown woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a fucking kid when the kids </v>

2237
01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:09.560
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on their own.</v>

2238
01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not.</v>

2239
01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Not a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have a woman and you're </v>

2240
01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:14.340
<v Speaker 3>married to her for 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2241
01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:14.590
<v Speaker 3>they were divorced more than 12 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

2242
01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:17.590
<v Speaker 3>so he has to pay her forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>

2243
01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:18.940
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until she died.</v>

2244
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:23.970
<v Speaker 3>So she fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if she gets into some life extension </v>

2245
01:43:23.970 --> 01:43:23.970
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some new science comes out.</v>

2246
01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.950
<v Speaker 3>He and he lives for 500 years and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives for 500 years.</v>

2247
01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:32.130
<v Speaker 3>He's going to have to pay her for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that he doesn't even remember </v>

2248
01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:32.130
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2249
01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:32.950
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not talking about a small amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of money either.</v>

2250
01:43:32.951 --> 01:43:35.500
<v Speaker 3>He's wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's paying her hundreds of thousands</v>

2251
01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:36.940
<v Speaker 3>of dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More than a half a million.</v>

2252
01:43:36.941 --> 01:43:38.530
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's his rage like,</v>

2253
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:39.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2254
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:41.530
<v Speaker 3>If you get them started up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just needed.</v>

2255
01:43:41.531 --> 01:43:46.531
<v Speaker 3>He literally needs a drink really start </v>
<v Speaker 3>bubbling in his mind because the whole </v>

2256
01:43:46.841 --> 01:43:48.430
<v Speaker 3>thing was a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

2257
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:49.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:43:49.691 --> 01:43:54.691
<v Speaker 3>There's bad divorce laws and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad horrible ones and if you get </v>

2259
01:43:54.691 --> 01:43:55.670
<v Speaker 3>the wrong lawyer and she gets the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

2260
01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just insane that you don't have to </v>

2261
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.000
<v Speaker 3>move on with your life like as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a woman is married to a guy and </v>

2262
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.081
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about someone with </v>
<v Speaker 3>children and she doesn't even have any </v>

2263
01:44:11.081 --> 01:44:11.081
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2264
01:44:11.081 --> 01:44:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is indefensible because people said</v>

2265
01:44:12.441 --> 01:44:14.030
<v Speaker 3>no children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard people say,</v>

2266
01:44:14.031 --> 01:44:14.950
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2267
01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:20.020
<v Speaker 3>she's got to raise the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kids know kids and when you tell </v>

2268
01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:20.020
<v Speaker 3>them that they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2269
01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:23.561
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually she doesn't even have any kids </v>

2270
01:44:23.561 --> 01:44:26.621
<v Speaker 3>and he has to pay her for ever forever </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions and millions and millions of </v>

2271
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:30.380
<v Speaker 3>dollars by the time she's dead for </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

2272
01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.480
<v Speaker 3>for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forgot.</v>

2273
01:44:31.530 --> 01:44:34.370
<v Speaker 3>They had a relationship relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>with time together and he didn't want to</v>

2274
01:44:34.371 --> 01:44:37.130
<v Speaker 3>be with her anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he has to pay her forever.</v>

2275
01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the most horrific form of </v>

2276
01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:42.840
<v Speaker 3>prostitution known to man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2277
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:45.770
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2278
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:49.230
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about child support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

2279
01:44:49.231 --> 01:44:54.231
<v Speaker 3>Now we're not talking even about a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>who like put the guy through school </v>

2280
01:44:54.231 --> 01:44:55.880
<v Speaker 3>while he was working on his engineering </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree or something like that.</v>

2281
01:44:55.881 --> 01:44:59.240
<v Speaker 3>And then he went on to become successful</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tried to abandon her and she's like,</v>

2282
01:44:59.241 --> 01:45:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put you through school.</v>

2283
01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm responsible for part of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

2284
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.560
<v Speaker 3>That makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2285
01:45:03.561 --> 01:45:04.640
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never worked.</v>

2286
01:45:04.850 --> 01:45:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

2287
01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Never worked while she was with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never worked.</v>

2288
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry,</v>

2289
01:45:12.441 --> 01:45:13.310
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take care of you.</v>

2290
01:45:13.311 --> 01:45:15.440
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does the law support that?</v>

2291
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:19.340
<v Speaker 3>Because they're cunts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cunt festival up there.</v>

2292
01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever creates it.</v>

2293
01:45:21.201 --> 01:45:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Whoever forces it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoever looks at that on paper and says,</v>

2294
01:45:23.421 --> 01:45:24.650
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it's written.</v>

2295
01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:29.980
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A media should come from God's hand and </v>

2296
01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:30.710
<v Speaker 3>fucking blow your brains out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

2297
01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:33.410
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so gross.</v>

2298
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:35.540
<v Speaker 3>That is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's scary.</v>

2299
01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:38.660
<v Speaker 3>It's really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if he just got a job as a busboy?</v>

2300
01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's response and went to like a studio </v>

2301
01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:43.780
<v Speaker 3>apartment and didn't make that much </v>
<v Speaker 3>money anymore.</v>

2302
01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got another one,</v>

2303
01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:45.170
<v Speaker 3>Dave.</v>

2304
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

2305
01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:51.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn it from a news.</v>

2306
01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Newsradio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2307
01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to draw a blank on date because,</v>

2308
01:45:55.810 --> 01:45:58.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one hurts my brain so much.</v>

2309
01:45:58.210 --> 01:45:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I draw blanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2310
01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Dave Foley got divorced and his wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted money.</v>

2311
01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:10.780
<v Speaker 3>That is like the way they establish how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much money he was going to pair was </v>

2312
01:46:10.881 --> 01:46:13.250
<v Speaker 3>depending upon how much money he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>making at the time.</v>

2313
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:15.350
<v Speaker 3>So he was on news radio when they got </v>
<v Speaker 3>divorced,</v>

2314
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:20.590
<v Speaker 3>so that was the highlight of his entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>life as far as how much money he's ever </v>

2315
01:46:20.590 --> 01:46:20.590
<v Speaker 3>going to make in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2316
01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:22.880
<v Speaker 3>So they based it on a percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2317
01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 3>like 50 percent of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he will never.</v>

2318
01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:28.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean right now he's never made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2319
01:46:28.221 --> 01:46:29.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he will.</v>

2320
01:46:29.691 --> 01:46:32.870
<v Speaker 3>He's a very talented guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might have a hit next week,</v>

2321
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:38.350
<v Speaker 3>but as far as right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never made that kind of money ever </v>

2322
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:41.141
<v Speaker 3>again in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He owes hundreds of thousands of </v>

2323
01:46:41.141 --> 01:46:41.141
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't go to Canada.</v>

2324
01:46:41.141 --> 01:46:42.940
<v Speaker 3>If he goes to Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll arrest him and the DA.</v>

2325
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
<v Speaker 3>The judge literally said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ability to pay has no relation to </v>

2326
01:46:48.051 --> 01:46:49.410
<v Speaker 3>your obligation to pay.</v>

2327
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:56.220
<v Speaker 3>So you have an obligation to obey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not care if you're able to able to,</v>

2328
01:46:56.221 --> 01:46:58.410
<v Speaker 3>you have an obligation to make more </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2329
01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the end,</v>

2330
01:47:01.501 --> 01:47:06.290
<v Speaker 3>and that's the judge's words to his face</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not like,</v>

2331
01:47:07.050 --> 01:47:08.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even $100,000</v>

2332
01:47:08.851 --> 01:47:11.700
<v Speaker 3>working at straight gig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like winning the lottery.</v>

2333
01:47:11.701 --> 01:47:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They based it on his winning ticket.</v>

2334
01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:17.000
<v Speaker 3>He won the lottery based network show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2335
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:19.950
<v Speaker 3>he won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got the cushiest spot ever,</v>

2336
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.740
<v Speaker 3>which is a network Sitcom in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>

2337
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 3>right back when they were real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>

2338
01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:27.620
<v Speaker 3>you cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even exist anymore.</v>

2339
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:29.550
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many sitcoms are there now?</v>

2340
01:47:29.551 --> 01:47:34.551
<v Speaker 3>They're 10 million actors in Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get on 10 sit.</v>

2341
01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

2342
01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's 50 something so it's not going </v>

2343
01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:42.420
<v Speaker 3>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2344
01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:46.730
<v Speaker 3>they don't want the 57 guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want the guy that he was in the </v>

2345
01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:46.730
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want the 30 year old guy.</v>

2346
01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:48.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a nightmare.</v>

2347
01:47:48.391 --> 01:47:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He's another one.</v>

2348
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:53.190
<v Speaker 3>You're around him when he talks about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you just need a drink.</v>

2349
01:47:53.530 --> 01:47:54.760
<v Speaker 3>I can drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start small.</v>

2350
01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.330
<v Speaker 3>It's so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ice Cubes,</v>

2351
01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:59.400
<v Speaker 3>dance classes and whiskey starts pouring</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And he is the nicest guy.</v>

2353
01:48:02.821 --> 01:48:07.821
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is one of the handful of nicest </v>

2354
01:48:07.821 --> 01:48:09.290
<v Speaker 3>people I've ever met in my life and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>talks about his ex wife goes,</v>

2355
01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:13.200
<v Speaker 3>she's a contact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is and she will not negotiate.</v>

2356
01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:15.750
<v Speaker 3>She will not lessen his money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She will not.</v>

2357
01:48:15.751 --> 01:48:17.550
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants to torture him.</v>

2358
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:20.670
<v Speaker 3>She's as crazy as that crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2359
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:23.370
<v Speaker 3>it's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's these crazy laws.</v>

2360
01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.270
<v Speaker 3>And when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2361
01:48:24.271 --> 01:48:26.850
<v Speaker 3>why do you think why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even my own wife,</v>

2362
01:48:26.851 --> 01:48:29.400
<v Speaker 3>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Saint Mary's is retarded.</v>

2363
01:48:29.401 --> 01:48:31.290
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am happy.</v>

2364
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:32.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm happily married.</v>

2365
01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I love her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's great.</v>

2366
01:48:33.451 --> 01:48:36.300
<v Speaker 3>I love having a family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is fucking dumb.</v>

2367
01:48:36.530 --> 01:48:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't say that.</v>

2368
01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.400
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say it.</v>

2369
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.510
<v Speaker 3>If you were making all the money you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>say to,</v>

2370
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:45.510
<v Speaker 3>it's great to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took.</v>

2371
01:48:45.690 --> 01:48:49.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a legal contract with the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>that involves two people getting along.</v>

2372
01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most transient things </v>

2373
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:57.240
<v Speaker 3>that we can do is try to establish </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual relationships with each other.</v>

2374
01:48:57.700 --> 01:48:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Often those fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last,</v>

2375
01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:02.100
<v Speaker 3>none of them lasts forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2376
01:49:02.101 --> 01:49:04.020
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really a business.</v>

2377
01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:08.340
<v Speaker 3>You're really creating a business and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes a big business as you go further</v>

2378
01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:11.250
<v Speaker 3>on and bring on other employees and </v>
<v Speaker 3>children in that kind of thing,</v>

2379
01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:17.300
<v Speaker 3>and this is why you're not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have sex with your coworkers because </v>

2380
01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:19.220
<v Speaker 3>that makes things very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2381
01:49:19.221 --> 01:49:19.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

2382
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:24.830
<v Speaker 3>If you have a job and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary and you start banging your </v>

2383
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:27.831
<v Speaker 3>secretary and she's a part of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>business that you've created with your </v>

2384
01:49:27.831 --> 01:49:27.831
<v Speaker 3>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got real issues,</v>

2385
01:49:27.831 --> 01:49:29.850
<v Speaker 3>you're experiencing pleasure from </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else and that's like,</v>

2386
01:49:29.851 --> 01:49:31.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you are working on a set,</v>

2387
01:49:31.650 --> 01:49:34.470
<v Speaker 3>you can't plug something in because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a union electrician,</v>

2388
01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:34.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2389
01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.040
<v Speaker 3>It's his job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2390
01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:41.240
<v Speaker 3>You need that union electrician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise that guy wouldn't really be </v>

2391
01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:41.240
<v Speaker 3>able to justify his position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>one too many employees.</v>

2396
01:49:52.631 --> 01:49:53.900
<v Speaker 3>It's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this try and keep that on the rails.</v>

<v Speaker 3>things in and um,</v>

2399
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.630
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like I don't need someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:19.690
<v Speaker 3>I think where you got married as big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the bigger part is a big one.</v>

2404
01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:22.900
<v Speaker 3>If you get married in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like one of the worst places.</v>

2405
01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:23.830
<v Speaker 3>One of my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2406
01:50:23.831 --> 01:50:28.831
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the worst places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite stories was this New </v>

2407
01:50:28.831 --> 01:50:29.830
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really wealthy.</v>

2408
01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Fucking millionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multimillionaire business guy marries </v>

2409
01:50:35.190 --> 01:50:36.220
<v Speaker 3>this young lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in his sixties.</v>

2410
01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:38.020
<v Speaker 3>She's in her 30 [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's hot as fuck.</v>

2411
01:50:38.021 --> 01:50:40.690
<v Speaker 3>He marries her and then when he marries </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

2412
01:50:41.410 --> 01:50:45.280
<v Speaker 3>he immediately files for divorce in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dominican Republic,</v>

2413
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:51.370
<v Speaker 3>believe is Dominican Republic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Write this story up because it was real </v>

2414
01:50:51.370 --> 01:50:53.791
<v Speaker 3>recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had no idea they were married the </v>

2415
01:50:53.791 --> 01:50:53.791
<v Speaker 3>entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She thought they were married,</v>

2416
01:50:53.791 --> 01:50:57.750
<v Speaker 3>but he had filed for divorce and had </v>
<v Speaker 3>attorneys represent her and him in </v>

2417
01:50:58.961 --> 01:51:03.590
<v Speaker 3>absentia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He paid for both lawyers on the case and</v>

2418
01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:06.430
<v Speaker 3>got divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he didn't have any country in another</v>

2419
01:51:06.431 --> 01:51:08.590
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's saying we're not married.</v>

2420
01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Bitch got divorced weeks afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my paperwork.</v>

2421
01:51:12.690 --> 01:51:16.060
<v Speaker 3>It's binding in the Dominican Republic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a legal document.</v>

2422
01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where'd they get married?</v>

2423
01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:19.390
<v Speaker 3>In the station?</v>

2424
01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:20.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

2425
01:51:20.141 --> 01:51:21.820
<v Speaker 3>In the states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's.</v>

2426
01:51:21.850 --> 01:51:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mick Jagger.</v>

2427
01:51:22.691 --> 01:51:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Try to do the same thing with Jerry </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hall.</v>

2428
01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2429
01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.070
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't even get married.</v>

2430
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:28.810
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got married on like a fucking coconut</v>

2431
01:51:28.811 --> 01:51:33.811
<v Speaker 3>island somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was saying that that didn't count </v>

2432
01:51:33.811 --> 01:51:35.100
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my guy.</v>

2433
01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the guy.</v>

2434
01:51:36.190 --> 01:51:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Husbands secretly divorced wife after </v>
<v Speaker 3>wedding to protect his assets and look </v>

2435
01:51:41.190 --> 01:51:43.270
<v Speaker 3>at him and look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's hot and young.</v>

2436
01:51:43.271 --> 01:51:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Of course they were married for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2437
01:51:45.791 --> 01:51:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Raising a son and living the good life </v>
<v Speaker 3>in between homes in New York and France.</v>

2438
01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all perfect except one thing.</v>

2439
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:57.870
<v Speaker 3>He had secretly divorced her just months</v>
<v Speaker 3>after their wedding in an apparent </v>

2440
01:51:57.870 --> 01:52:01.540
<v Speaker 3>attempt to shield his assets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's 90.</v>

2441
01:52:01.570 --> 01:52:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now she's 59.</v>

2442
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:09.000
<v Speaker 3>She's suing her in a 90 year old husband</v>
<v Speaker 3>to nullify the divorce that she never </v>

2443
01:52:10.001 --> 01:52:15.001
<v Speaker 3>knew about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And keep him from selling an apartment </v>

2444
01:52:15.001 --> 01:52:17.641
<v Speaker 3>that they shared that they met in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they met when he was 70.</v>

2445
01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:23.230
<v Speaker 3>He knew what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2446
01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:26.110
<v Speaker 3>he was 70 and probably shouldn't no to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the prenup.</v>

2447
01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:29.310
<v Speaker 3>And she was more than 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2448
01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:31.820
<v Speaker 3>his senior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2449
01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:37.000
<v Speaker 3>She was like somewhere around 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>something years old as fuck.</v>

2450
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Marrying a 70 year old guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She says it's a fraud.</v>

2451
01:52:40.331 --> 01:52:41.390
<v Speaker 3>She tells the post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2452
01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:46.000
<v Speaker 3>well it's the fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what?</v>

2453
01:52:46.170 --> 01:52:48.420
<v Speaker 1>What did you do to get that apart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's,</v>

2454
01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 1>where's your money coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady?</v>

2455
01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:52.580
<v Speaker 1>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not good enough.</v>

2456
01:52:52.581 --> 01:52:57.581
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've established that when someone </v>

2457
01:52:57.581 --> 01:52:57.581
<v Speaker 1>marries someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won the lottery.</v>

2458
01:52:57.581 --> 01:52:59.600
<v Speaker 1>When you marry some old rich dude like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

2459
01:52:59.810 --> 01:53:04.810
<v Speaker 1>you've won the lottery and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve to get paid from winning that </v>

2460
01:53:04.810 --> 01:53:05.510
<v Speaker 1>lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is what?</v>

2461
01:53:05.511 --> 01:53:10.511
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly was going on in that </v>

2462
01:53:10.511 --> 01:53:12.431
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were together and he made all the </v>

2463
01:53:12.431 --> 01:53:14.480
<v Speaker 1>money and she wants some of that money </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he made while she was living in the</v>

2464
01:53:14.481 --> 01:53:16.430
<v Speaker 1>same place as him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what it is.</v>

2465
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:20.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a professional athlete,</v>

2466
01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:21.980
<v Speaker 1>how do you possibly meet someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2467
01:53:21.981 --> 01:53:24.260
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go against you.</v>

2468
01:53:24.650 --> 01:53:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it works.</v>

2469
01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can meet the right people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2470
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:29.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really who are you?</v>

2471
01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Who are they?</v>

2472
01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to generalize and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships work great and some </v>

2473
01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:39.281
<v Speaker 1>marriages worth grade some marriages </v>
<v Speaker 1>where both people make a similar amount </v>

2474
01:53:39.281 --> 01:53:41.810
<v Speaker 1>of money and then no one is really in it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the money and they had just their.</v>

2475
01:53:41.850 --> 01:53:46.850
<v Speaker 1>They have a modest living and they enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they just love being </v>

2476
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:48.350
<v Speaker 1>together and they liked the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were a ring and hey,</v>

2477
01:53:48.351 --> 01:53:50.060
<v Speaker 1>that's my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my husband.</v>

2478
01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:51.530
<v Speaker 1>We're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love it.</v>

2479
01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:54.110
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing wrong with that.</v>

2480
01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:59.260
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is when you break up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like my buddy who went through this </v>

2481
01:53:59.260 --> 01:53:59.540
<v Speaker 1>horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific divorce,</v>

2482
01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:05.560
<v Speaker 1>he married a new woman after that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't want to sign a prenup and he </v>

2483
01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:06.700
<v Speaker 1>was going fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2484
01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:08.870
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone was screaming at him,</v>

2485
01:54:08.871 --> 01:54:12.210
<v Speaker 1>all of his friends do not do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to find it.</v>

2486
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:17.950
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that it's not going to </v>

2487
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.950
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2488
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.950
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2489
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:21.280
<v Speaker 1>because if it doesn't work then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prenup doesn't mean anything and he has </v>

2490
01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:21.920
<v Speaker 1>a history of always saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't work,</v>

2491
01:54:21.921 --> 01:54:24.140
<v Speaker 1>the Prenup is valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes in handy,</v>

2492
01:54:24.141 --> 01:54:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what I'm saying is if this marriage</v>

2493
01:54:27.471 --> 01:54:28.580
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do your part,</v>

2494
01:54:28.581 --> 01:54:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I do my part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll work it out.</v>

2495
01:54:29.721 --> 01:54:31.640
<v Speaker 1>We make it beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We stayed together forever.</v>

2496
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:34.820
<v Speaker 1>The prenup doesn't mean shit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you together forever,</v>

2497
01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:36.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the marriage is going to work,</v>

2498
01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:37.790
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it only,</v>

2499
01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.760
<v Speaker 1>it only means something if it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work out.</v>

2500
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:42.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking at it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment.</v>

2501
01:54:42.770 --> 01:54:46.880
<v Speaker 1>So what she is hoping for or what she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying essentially is if it doesn't work</v>

2502
01:54:46.881 --> 01:54:49.820
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to get fucked over and you're</v>

2503
01:54:49.821 --> 01:54:54.821
<v Speaker 1>protecting yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're protecting yourself from the </v>

2504
01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:54.821
<v Speaker 1>legal system that's set up the fuck you.</v>

2505
01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:58.070
<v Speaker 1>If you and I don't want to be together </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

2506
01:54:58.430 --> 01:55:03.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to get punished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must be punished financially and he </v>

2507
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:04.010
<v Speaker 1>has a whole story that he could hold up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of her.</v>

2508
01:55:04.090 --> 01:55:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2509
01:55:04.791 --> 01:55:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I am suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any works like,</v>

2510
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:08.390
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hours?</v>

2511
01:55:08.630 --> 01:55:10.910
<v Speaker 1>He's got a prenup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does know he got through it.</v>

2512
01:55:10.911 --> 01:55:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was good.</v>

2513
01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:14.780
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could you the beating that he took,</v>

2514
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:17.270
<v Speaker 1>but he lost a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost.</v>

2515
01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole story is comical.</v>

2516
01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:23.450
<v Speaker 1>The ex wife lives in with a guy now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's not allowed to.</v>

2517
01:55:23.451 --> 01:55:27.320
<v Speaker 1>So when they go to inspect the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy literally puts all this stuff in</v>

2518
01:55:27.321 --> 01:55:32.321
<v Speaker 1>a u haul drives around the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which did inspect her leave and drives </v>

2519
01:55:32.321 --> 01:55:32.321
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a game.</v>

2520
01:55:32.321 --> 01:55:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Can you get a private investigators?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>

2521
01:55:35.241 --> 01:55:36.050
<v Speaker 1>You have to prove it.</v>

2522
01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:37.740
<v Speaker 1>The private investigator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2523
01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:40.520
<v Speaker 1>What evidence did he discovers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't.</v>

2524
01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:43.680
<v Speaker 1>There's only so much privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can violate someone's home.</v>

2525
01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not his home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His own home where he could put in his </v>

2526
01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:51.540
<v Speaker 1>own home and catch his wife bag and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking personal trainer.</v>

2527
01:55:51.690 --> 01:55:54.270
<v Speaker 1>This is not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is her house now,</v>

2528
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:59.870
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multimillion dollar house in the </v>

2529
01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:00.810
<v Speaker 1>palisades really overlooking the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All hers.</v>

2530
01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ow.</v>

2531
01:56:03.151 --> 01:56:08.151
<v Speaker 1>It hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you find out what happened to you </v>

2532
01:56:08.151 --> 01:56:08.370
<v Speaker 1>in a divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific,</v>

2533
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:13.430
<v Speaker 1>but what happens if he seriously gets a </v>
<v Speaker 1>job working at a diner and it's like no </v>

2534
01:56:13.801 --> 01:56:15.120
<v Speaker 1>one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one will hire me.</v>

2535
01:56:15.210 --> 01:56:20.210
<v Speaker 1>He would have to go back to court and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd would have to figure out a way to </v>

2536
01:56:20.210 --> 01:56:23.601
<v Speaker 1>get a judge to agree to lower the terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is he's responsible for </v>

2537
01:56:23.601 --> 01:56:24.570
<v Speaker 1>maintaining her lifestyle.</v>

2538
01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:28.440
<v Speaker 1>So if he takes that job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could actually be put in prison.</v>

2539
01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's not making enough.</v>

2540
01:56:29.970 --> 01:56:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2541
01:56:31.411 --> 01:56:34.110
<v Speaker 1>he would have to get a judge that agrees</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain,</v>

2542
01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:38.790
<v Speaker 1>to lower the lifestyle that he has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's obligated to maintain.</v>

2543
01:56:38.970 --> 01:56:41.370
<v Speaker 1>He's obligated to maintain a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle for her.</v>

2544
01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2545
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:48.870
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about subsistence.</v>

2546
01:56:49.050 --> 01:56:52.410
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about like you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>extrapolate to give her $50,000</v>

2547
01:56:52.411 --> 01:56:54.300
<v Speaker 1>a year and that's enough for her to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive on.</v>

2548
01:56:54.301 --> 01:56:59.301
<v Speaker 1>And she wasn't that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have to get a job or maybe </v>

2549
01:56:59.301 --> 01:57:02.331
<v Speaker 1>you have to give her a $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for two years until she can figure out </v>

2550
01:57:02.331 --> 01:57:03.900
<v Speaker 1>how to get a job like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a human being.</v>

2551
01:57:03.901 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 1>She's a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's intelligent,</v>

2552
01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:07.500
<v Speaker 1>she's articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has an education.</v>

2553
01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:12.180
<v Speaker 1>She's not a handicap person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not diseased like she's not broken</v>

2554
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:13.290
<v Speaker 1>like where she can't work.</v>

2555
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:16.620
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like a regular person,</v>

2556
01:57:17.110 --> 01:57:20.040
<v Speaker 1>a regular person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking madness.</v>

2557
01:57:20.041 --> 01:57:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made it is mostly madness.</v>

2558
01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:25.710
<v Speaker 1>It's really the worst case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is in,</v>

2559
01:57:25.711 --> 01:57:30.711
<v Speaker 1>unless you're with these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know these stories unless you </v>

2560
01:57:30.711 --> 01:57:32.160
<v Speaker 1>know someone that's gone through this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know these stories,</v>

2561
01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:37.580
<v Speaker 1>and then when you hear these men's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights groups and then you hear </v>

2562
01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:37.960
<v Speaker 1>feminists mock men's rights groups like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

2563
01:57:38.250 --> 01:57:43.250
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason why a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't take feminism seriously and this </v>

2564
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:46.640
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of them mock these men's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights groups and this is also the </v>

2565
01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:49.761
<v Speaker 1>reason why a lot of these men's rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups have a valid point because </v>

2566
01:57:49.761 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of men's rights points </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are stupid as far.</v>

2567
01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:53.850
<v Speaker 1>What do you care if these feminists </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like you?</v>

2568
01:57:53.851 --> 01:57:58.851
<v Speaker 1>What do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bitch about the way you act or </v>

2569
01:57:58.851 --> 01:57:58.851
<v Speaker 1>dress unless you work with them.</v>

2570
01:57:58.851 --> 01:57:58.851
<v Speaker 1>What do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2571
01:57:58.851 --> 01:57:58.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're.</v>

2572
01:57:58.981 --> 01:58:03.981
<v Speaker 1>If you're trapped in some office with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some man hating woman and she has a </v>

2573
01:58:03.981 --> 01:58:06.030
<v Speaker 1>position above you and she's making your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life hell well,</v>

2574
01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:09.330
<v Speaker 1>that's no different than being trapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an office with some sexist pig.</v>

2575
01:58:09.331 --> 01:58:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a woman,</v>

2576
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:12.000
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

2577
01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:14.790
<v Speaker 1>If someone is gender specifically biased</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any way,</v>

2578
01:58:14.791 --> 01:58:16.950
<v Speaker 1>shape or sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in,</v>

2579
01:58:17.070 --> 01:58:19.380
<v Speaker 1>unless you see the devastation that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

2580
01:58:20.090 --> 01:58:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it someone's life like day Foley's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the time that I met him,</v>

2581
01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 1>to the time that he got divorced when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on Newsradio,</v>

2582
01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:33.150
<v Speaker 1>his life has been overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by this woman that he used to</v>

2583
01:58:33.151 --> 01:58:35.610
<v Speaker 1>be married to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't even know anymore.</v>

2584
01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2585
01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:38.550
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't see her anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't.</v>

2586
01:58:38.610 --> 01:58:43.610
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't had sex with her in decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still inexorably connected </v>

2587
01:58:44.231 --> 01:58:46.270
<v Speaker 1>financially and it has ruined his life.</v>

2588
01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:51.780
<v Speaker 1>These are two pages to people I know who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pay the women that they used to </v>

2589
01:58:52.721 --> 01:58:55.900
<v Speaker 1>sleep with more than 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to.</v>

2590
01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:58.300
<v Speaker 1>They have to pay them forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2591
01:58:59.050 --> 01:59:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's just one story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

2592
01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:04.330
<v Speaker 1>the problem is the court system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things that I was</v>

2593
01:59:04.331 --> 01:59:07.040
<v Speaker 1>going over with Phil Hartman before his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife murdered him.</v>

2594
01:59:07.630 --> 01:59:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I was telling him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2595
01:59:08.951 --> 01:59:09.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2596
01:59:10.210 --> 01:59:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a really fucked up house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was little,</v>

2597
01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:20.260
<v Speaker 1>my parents split up when I was young </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was violence and there was just </v>

2598
01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:20.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my mom,</v>

2599
01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:24.960
<v Speaker 1>when my dad hit my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom got her shit and got the fuck </v>

2600
01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:25.570
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

2601
01:59:25.630 --> 01:59:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I saw him hit her eye and then we moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>to my grandpa's,</v>

2602
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:33.790
<v Speaker 1>my grandfather's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like immediately afterwards we were out </v>

2603
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:35.040
<v Speaker 1>and apparently he had done it before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2604
01:59:35.041 --> 01:59:36.940
<v Speaker 1>he terrorized her and she was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

2605
01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:39.670
<v Speaker 1>We're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>

2606
01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:43.090
<v Speaker 1>in my mind when Shit goes bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to fucking pull strings,</v>

2607
01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:45.520
<v Speaker 1>get you just get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get out.</v>

2608
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:46.690

<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was like.</v>

2611
01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:51.730
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple.</v>

2612
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:53.710
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't give half.</v>

2613
01:59:53.970 --> 01:59:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid her half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2614
01:59:55.451 --> 01:59:56.680
<v Speaker 1>it's not half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2615
01:59:56.681 --> 01:59:59.020
<v Speaker 1>it's two thirds because the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers get a third.</v>

2616
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:00.730
<v Speaker 1>He likes it's a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2617
02:00:00.731 --> 02:00:03.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>business involved in law.</v>

2618
02:00:03.490 --> 02:00:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Who's a business involved in divorce?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2619
02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:07.180
<v Speaker 1>he had to pay for her lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2620
02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I have to pay for her lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to pay for my lawyer.</v>

2621
02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>And there's two lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're to battle it out and they're </v>

2622
02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:16.681
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drag it out as long as possible to make </v>

2623
02:00:16.681 --> 02:00:16.681
<v Speaker 1>the most money.</v>

2624
02:00:16.681 --> 02:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Just ruin your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well they get a percentage and they </v>

2625
02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:22.120
<v Speaker 1>get legal to get paid by the hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole thing is just brutality.</v>

2626
02:00:22.121 --> 02:00:27.121
<v Speaker 1>Keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have somebody who's a little </v>

2627
02:00:27.121 --> 02:00:27.121
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just keep fueling the fire.</v>

2628

2639
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:59.910

<v Speaker 1>of dollars for Sam's baby.</v>

2640
02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:01.000
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he first,</v>

2641
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Sam's baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucked.</v>

2642
02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:03.940

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2643
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.580

<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a car.</v>

2644
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2645
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:11.920
<v Speaker 1>he's devastated by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a working comic to comic.</v>

2646
02:01:12.010 --> 02:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not,</v>

2647
02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a road comic road guy who does it</v>

2648
02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>does well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does headlines,</v>

2649
02:01:18.190 --> 02:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but he can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like A.</v>

2650
02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

2651
02:01:20.930 --> 02:01:24.730
<v Speaker 1>So he tried to fight it and lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now because he lost,</v>

2652
02:01:24.731 --> 02:01:29.731
<v Speaker 1>he has to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's responsible for another man's </v>

2653
02:01:29.731 --> 02:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>child because his wife had an affair and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

2654
02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Why does that not matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we are living in a system that </v>

2655
02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>looked limit or fucked over in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

2656
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just make this as a caveat.</v>

2657
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Women get fucked over in this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

2658
02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2659
02:01:45.230 --> 02:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Besides what we're talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 1>men that are willing to drop pills and </v>

2660
02:01:50.230 --> 02:01:54.071
<v Speaker 1>girls drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's women that work in offices with </v>

2661
02:01:54.071 --> 02:01:56.861
<v Speaker 1>pieces of shit for bosses and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually harassed them and fuck with </v>

2662
02:01:56.861 --> 02:02:00.911
<v Speaker 1>them and make their life was horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and create this boy's club environment </v>

2663
02:02:00.911 --> 02:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>that makes it terrible for them to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2664
02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely key,</v>

2665
02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:08.380
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to divorce and when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to a man who makes money and the,</v>

2666
02:02:08.770 --> 02:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>the preying upon that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man that happens.</v>

2667
02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:14.330
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking Hoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific.</v>

2668
02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:17.000
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be a documentary.</v>

2669
02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:22.460
<v Speaker 1>It's so much a follow those stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>around like being really because people </v>

2670
02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>don't know those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2671
02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>An inconvenient truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2672
02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Another one rather inconvenient truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

2673
02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:28.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad man.</v>

2674
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

2675
02:02:33.110 --> 02:02:37.070
<v Speaker 1>California has that law and in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of understand because like,</v>

2676
02:02:37.071 --> 02:02:38.210
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2677
02:02:38.211 --> 02:02:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I have a stepdaughter and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I feel she's my daughter.</v>

2678
02:02:41.661 --> 02:02:46.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I treat her like she's my daughter and </v>

2679
02:02:46.661 --> 02:02:49.030
<v Speaker 1>if I found out that one of my actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters was actually not my biological</v>

2680
02:02:49.461 --> 02:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't love them any less.</v>

2681
02:02:51.210 --> 02:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want my wife to get giant </v>

2682
02:02:56.210 --> 02:02:58.820
<v Speaker 1>chunks of money because of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it was about supporting the kid,</v>

2683
02:02:59.210 --> 02:03:00.470
<v Speaker 1>I would never change that.</v>

2684
02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:03.830
<v Speaker 1>I've never changed that because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his case is more than that.</v>

2685
02:03:03.831 --> 02:03:05.450
<v Speaker 1>It's to support her also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2686
02:03:05.451 --> 02:03:07.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucked up situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2687
02:03:07.221 --> 02:03:10.460
<v Speaker 1>It's God Damn Sam Kennison like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't the Sam kinison estate,</v>

2688
02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much money are they making?</v>

2689
02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come they're not?</v>

2690
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they pay it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2691
02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>That's his kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a wealthy man who </v>

2692
02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:22.721
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the greatest comics who </v>

2693
02:03:22.721 --> 02:03:22.721
<v Speaker 1>ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could only assume,</v>

2694
02:03:22.721 --> 02:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>like I read something the other day that</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that Liverpool just Liverpool gets </v>

2695
02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:28.280
<v Speaker 1>100 million dollars a year from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beatles.</v>

2696
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just the tax is involved.</v>

2697
02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:38.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money that they generate </v>

2698
02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:38.960
<v Speaker 1>from their portfolio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the taxes from all the sales.</v>

2699
02:03:38.961 --> 02:03:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2700
02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:42.620
<v Speaker 1>You're not making my innocent anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2701
02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny.</v>

2702
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:45.560
<v Speaker 1>But kennison had generated a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

2703
02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's gone.</v>

2704
02:03:48.110 --> 02:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a whole generation that </v>

2705
02:03:53.110 --> 02:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even know Sam anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

2706
02:03:53.110 --> 02:03:56.420
<v Speaker 1>God isn't crazy as a kid that does a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great impression of Kennison and it went</v>

2707
02:03:56.421 --> 02:03:57.620
<v Speaker 1>up and crack gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2708
02:03:57.621 --> 02:04:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing the factory.</v>

2709
02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:02.660
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's talking about.</v>

2710
02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

2711
02:04:03.381 --> 02:04:06.830

<v Speaker 1>like you and I,</v>

2712
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>we were around when the Oj trial was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

2713
02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of kids today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even fucking have any idea </v>

2714
02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>what this about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm probably not gonna be able to do </v>

2749
02:05:28.070 --> 02:05:29.940
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a fact.</v>

2750
02:05:29.941 --> 02:05:33.870
<v Speaker 1>So I'm halfway to not being mobile.</v>

<v Speaker 1>At what age do you get where your body </v>

2753
02:05:39.710 --> 02:05:39.710
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't work right anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2754
02:05:39.710 --> 02:05:41.370
<v Speaker 1>well that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're active,</v>

2755
02:05:41.371 --> 02:05:43.230
<v Speaker 1>you gotta stay active,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to stay.</v>

2756
02:05:43.231 --> 02:05:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean no joke and when going to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga class where it's,</v>

2757
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:51.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the after drop off and there's some </v>

2758
02:05:51.770 --> 02:05:53.961
<v Speaker 1>older people to see like a 70 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman and they're like standing on her </v>

2759
02:05:53.961 --> 02:05:57.981
<v Speaker 1>head and doing a backward backbend </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she kept doing that.</v>

2760
02:05:58.351 --> 02:06:03.351
<v Speaker 1>That's why she's able to do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things is the place </v>

2761
02:06:03.351 --> 02:06:07.041
<v Speaker 1>that I go to a some really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>instructors and one of the things that </v>

2762
02:06:07.041 --> 02:06:07.170
<v Speaker 1>this lady was talking about was she's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

2763
02:06:07.710 --> 02:06:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I want to say she's in her sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was saying that if you just maintain</v>

2764
02:06:12.361 --> 02:06:17.361
<v Speaker 1>your practice and keep doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be healthy and mobile deepen </v>

2765
02:06:17.361 --> 02:06:17.361
<v Speaker 1>your nineties.</v>

2766
02:06:17.361 --> 02:06:19.590
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is just people neglecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>their body.</v>

2767
02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Atrophy were just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2768
02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you see people that can't even touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>their toes anymore.</v>

2769
02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:29.440
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to the gym and as you get </v>

2770
02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:33.141
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one really important thing is lifting </v>

2771
02:06:33.141 --> 02:06:35.331
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important for older people </v>

2772
02:06:35.331 --> 02:06:37.760
<v Speaker 1>because you need to maintain muscle mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to avoid being injured and bone </v>

2773
02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:41.151
<v Speaker 1>density don't they say like you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really Max out as much as you can up </v>

2774
02:06:41.151 --> 02:06:43.200
<v Speaker 1>until up to 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's because that's when you really</v>

2775
02:06:43.201 --> 02:06:45.120
<v Speaker 1>start to fall off muscle wise.</v>

2776
02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2777
02:06:48.170 --> 02:06:49.180
<v Speaker 3>I haven't heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2778
02:06:49.550 --> 02:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2779
02:06:50.001 --> 02:06:55.001
<v Speaker 1>you're slowly falling off from the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like 30 is the whole key is just </v>

2780
02:06:55.820 --> 02:07:00.590
<v Speaker 1>maintaining a level of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to maintain a level of activity</v>

2781
02:07:00.591 --> 02:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>but also maintain a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance.</v>

2782
02:07:04.610 --> 02:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I really love yoga </v>
<v Speaker 1>because yoga is taken care of.</v>

2783
02:07:08.241 --> 02:07:13.241
<v Speaker 1>A lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like weird back pains that I used to </v>

2784
02:07:13.241 --> 02:07:15.191
<v Speaker 1>have and things and weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird isn't all of a sudden all </v>

2785
02:07:15.191 --> 02:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>this goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that tensions.</v>

2786
02:07:15.850 --> 02:07:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2787
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2788
02:07:18.411 --> 02:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why those skinny </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers in India been doing it for</v>

2789
02:07:20.991 --> 02:07:22.250
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years.</v>

2798
02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:36.070

2799
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:37.870
<v Speaker 4>Once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once a year.</v>

2815

<v Speaker 4>stretching and the tissue in your neck </v>

2817
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the secrets of the </v>

2818
02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:25.510
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and the Yogis of India is </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would.</v>

2819
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:28.090
<v Speaker 4>They would smoke all these chillums,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would smoke,</v>

2820
02:08:28.091 --> 02:08:31.940
<v Speaker 4>hash the hash heads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they would go and do their practice.</v>

2821
02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:33.850
<v Speaker 4>That's really a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2822
02:08:33.970 --> 02:08:35.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted it so bad.</v>

2823
02:08:35.621 --> 02:08:37.470
<v Speaker 4>I can completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2824
02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:39.400
<v Speaker 4>could fill it for the first time in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

2825
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:44.430
<v Speaker 4>I've always been active always for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first time in my life I have this issue </v>

2826
02:08:44.430 --> 02:08:46.570
<v Speaker 4>where I've got a muscle under here under</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first rib.</v>

2827
02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:51.660
<v Speaker 4>It's tight and it's affecting back here </v>
<v Speaker 4>down to my arm and it's affecting how </v>

2828
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:56.860
<v Speaker 4>it's cutting off whatever nerves are </v>
<v Speaker 4>running down here.</v>

2829
02:08:56.890 --> 02:08:59.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's cutting.</v>

2830
02:08:59.730 --> 02:09:01.330
<v Speaker 4>It's raising the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This rib,</v>

2831
02:09:01.630 --> 02:09:02.960
<v Speaker 4>it's actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a stall.</v>

2832
02:09:02.961 --> 02:09:07.961
<v Speaker 4>Tight muscles tightened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rib is pulled up and it's pinching </v>

2833
02:09:07.961 --> 02:09:09.220
<v Speaker 4>on the stuff that's coming down.</v>

2834
02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel any numbness?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes.</v>

2835
02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so going to this great guy,</v>

2836
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:16.990
<v Speaker 4>he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He works with the clippers and stuff and</v>

2837
02:09:16.991 --> 02:09:19.840
<v Speaker 4>he's knows exactly where it is and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's helping,</v>

2838
02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:22.030
<v Speaker 4>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do not sleep on?</v>

2839
02:09:22.031 --> 02:09:27.031
<v Speaker 4>Your stomach just goes in and loosens it</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and it's basically just kind of </v>

2840
02:09:27.031 --> 02:09:30.310
<v Speaker 4>releasing the tension of tissue and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>working and feel it,</v>

2841
02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:31.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only a couple of times.</v>

2842
02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:34.480
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two parts of this.</v>

2843
02:09:34.481 --> 02:09:39.481
<v Speaker 4>One is I can't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sleep on my stomach with my head to </v>

2844
02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:40.010
<v Speaker 4>the side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to do that.</v>

2845
02:09:40.011 --> 02:09:42.750
<v Speaker 4>I fucked my neck up doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what happened.</v>

2846
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:44.380
<v Speaker 4>And it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the cause,</v>

2847
02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:47.410
<v Speaker 4>the cause of it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my sleep,</v>

2848
02:09:47.650 --> 02:09:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm used to doing that my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm laying on my back.</v>

2849
02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:53.800
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to sleep.</v>

2850
02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:55.960
<v Speaker 4>I lay on my side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do?</v>

2851
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lay on my side.</v>

2852
02:09:56.831 --> 02:09:59.410
<v Speaker 4>I put a pillow in between my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lay on my side.</v>

2853
02:10:00.070 --> 02:10:01.030
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally,</v>

2854
02:10:01.031 --> 02:10:06.031
<v Speaker 4>when I was driving here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like Joe will know I had the same </v>

2855
02:10:06.031 --> 02:10:06.190
<v Speaker 4>exact issue by the denial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2856
02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Before I hurt my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurt my neck from Jujitsu.</v>

2857
02:10:08.710 --> 02:10:11.800
<v Speaker 4>But before I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started developing problems in my neck</v>

2858
02:10:11.801 --> 02:10:13.420
<v Speaker 4>from laying down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2859
02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:16.490
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just from laying down on your.</v>

2860
02:10:16.491 --> 02:10:19.900
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you laid down flat within,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn your head in the same way,</v>

2861
02:10:20.170 --> 02:10:21.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Always turn your head to the right.</v>

2862
02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:22.690
<v Speaker 4>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucked.</v>

2863
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:25.600
<v Speaker 4>If you ever heard of those cab drivers </v>
<v Speaker 4>develop.</v>

2864
02:10:25.601 --> 02:10:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Swollen discs are bulging discs because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they sit with a wallet in their pocket.</v>

2865
02:10:30.250 --> 02:10:35.250
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because just that lifting of your butt </v>

2866
02:10:35.250 --> 02:10:35.250
<v Speaker 4>cheek,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that an inch on</v>

2867
02:10:35.250 --> 02:10:37.360
<v Speaker 1>one side fucks your backup repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2868
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:38.960
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you're doing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sleeping.</v>

2869
02:10:39.090 --> 02:10:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really bad for you.</v>

2870
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Tissue is really pliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is like everything's out of whack.</v>

2871
02:10:45.651 --> 02:10:49.100
<v Speaker 1>So you have to kind of like reset it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll reset me and then it's like,</v>

2872
02:10:49.370 --> 02:10:54.370
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't lift your arm and try and be </v>

2873
02:10:54.370 --> 02:10:54.370
<v Speaker 1>cool and just kind of let it learn that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got.</v>

2874
02:10:54.370 --> 02:10:56.030
<v Speaker 1>It's back in its place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that little ball?</v>

2875
02:10:56.031 --> 02:11:01.031
<v Speaker 1>That little blue ball right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a little balloon behind the </v>

2876
02:11:01.431 --> 02:11:02.840
<v Speaker 1>creepy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2877
02:11:02.841 --> 02:11:03.680
<v Speaker 1>this heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2878
02:11:03.681 --> 02:11:05.420
<v Speaker 1>what's this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a,</v>

2879
02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:10.190
<v Speaker 1>that's called a mobilitywod supernova.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a smaller one.</v>

2880
02:11:10.191 --> 02:11:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I actually prefer there's a larger one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have around here somewhere.</v>

2881
02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2882
02:11:14.050 --> 02:11:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I give them to people because I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to use these things.</v>

2883
02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:21.500
<v Speaker 1>People have sore backs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you do is you put it on the ground </v>

2884
02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:24.761
<v Speaker 1>or on a wall and you back up against it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like put your weight on it and you </v>

2885
02:11:24.761 --> 02:11:29.291
<v Speaker 1>rub it up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you roll the ball and it breaks up </v>

2886
02:11:29.291 --> 02:11:32.900
<v Speaker 1>all the scar tissue and loosens up all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tendons and all the Fascia.</v>

2887
02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:35.510
<v Speaker 1>It's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you get them,</v>

2888
02:11:35.511 --> 02:11:37.990
<v Speaker 1>if you can bite your teeth and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>

2889
02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:41.000
<v Speaker 1>it'll make a significant difference in </v>
<v Speaker 1>loosening up your muscles.</v>

2890
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:44.630
<v Speaker 1>It's such a strange idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never had any issue.</v>

2891
02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I've worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an athlete my whole life and never</v>

2892
02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.010
<v Speaker 1>literally I've ever been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2893
02:11:49.011 --> 02:11:54.011
<v Speaker 1>that hurt for the first time and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>no idea the concept that all the tissue </v>

2894
02:11:54.171 --> 02:11:57.950
<v Speaker 1>and tendons are just tightening and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>just ending up like,</v>

2895
02:11:58.310 --> 02:12:00.620
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hunchback will.</v>

2896
02:12:00.621 --> 02:12:05.621
<v Speaker 1>That's all one of the things that pot </v>
<v Speaker 1>will help because we feel all those </v>

2897
02:12:05.621 --> 02:12:06.920
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel tense like marijuana.</v>

2898
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:10.250
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever sensitivity you have about your</v>

2899
02:12:10.251 --> 02:12:12.880
<v Speaker 1>body awareness ramps it up to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

2900
02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Why sex feels so good when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you smoke,</v>

2901
02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:17.900
<v Speaker 1>because it just ramps up all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>

2902
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:22.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes the way you interface with </v>

2903
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.910
<v Speaker 1>the nerve endings.</v>

2904
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared now to lift for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2905
02:12:24.501 --> 02:12:28.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lifting railing for like since </v>
<v Speaker 1>like October.</v>

2906
02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good because that'll fuck it </v>

2907
02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:33.300
<v Speaker 1>up even more because you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2908
02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:37.141
<v Speaker 1>You lose strength in your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to go to a personal trainer </v>

2909
02:12:37.141 --> 02:12:40.961
<v Speaker 1>that understands how to strengthen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>area to keep this whole thing from </v>

2910
02:12:40.961 --> 02:12:40.961
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2911
02:12:40.961 --> 02:12:43.430
<v Speaker 1>he works with the clippers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's and he's running two times and it's</v>

2912
02:12:43.431 --> 02:12:44.000
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2913
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:47.390
<v Speaker 1>we're onto it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a good massage therapist guy,</v>

2914
02:12:47.391 --> 02:12:48.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he does.</v>

2915
02:12:48.141 --> 02:12:50.480
<v Speaker 1>He's massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said he's like a chiropractor.</v>

2916
02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:53.630
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I am practice mostly bullshit.</v>

2917
02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's physical therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>or chiropractor.</v>

2918
02:12:55.671 --> 02:13:00.671
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think chiropractors are mostly </v>

2919
02:13:00.671 --> 02:13:01.470
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonsense.</v>

2920
02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2921
02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I think they're mostly bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that they do do is</v>

2922
02:13:06.650 --> 02:13:11.650
<v Speaker 1>all the other stuff outside of cracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cold lasers work and massage work.</v>

2923
02:13:12.590 --> 02:13:17.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of other different </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective methods of alleviating </v>

2924
02:13:17.590 --> 02:13:18.080
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention that work,</v>

2925
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:23.470
<v Speaker 1>but all that back cracking stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you talk to like most people that,</v>

2926
02:13:24.111 --> 02:13:26.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that study it and then try to figure out</v>

2927
02:13:26.631 --> 02:13:29.030
<v Speaker 1>what exactly they're doing like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not doing anything.</v>

2928
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 1>They're popping things in place and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have something really fucked</v>

2929
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:32.610
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2930
02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:37.620
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if something's like really out of </v>

2931
02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:37.980
<v Speaker 4>whack and they can straighten it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time that's not what's going</v>

2932
02:13:37.981 --> 02:13:42.981
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time you're just getting </v>

2933
02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:44.511
<v Speaker 4>this sort of placebo effect where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're pushing on your back and making </v>

2934
02:13:44.511 --> 02:13:44.511
<v Speaker 4>a noise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pop.</v>

2935
02:13:44.511 --> 02:13:44.511
<v Speaker 4>Pop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got it.</v>

2936
02:13:44.511 --> 02:13:45.810
<v Speaker 4>We got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're good at Tom.</v>

2937
02:13:45.811 --> 02:13:46.580
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm good.</v>

2938
02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:49.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeling right now.</v>

2939
02:13:49.490 --> 02:13:50.820
<v Speaker 4>This guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2940
02:13:50.821 --> 02:13:52.620
<v Speaker 4>I was really a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2941
02:13:52.770 --> 02:13:54.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean I literally couldn't go like this</v>
<v Speaker 4>without this.</v>

2942
02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:57.030
<v Speaker 4>Just going numb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2943
02:13:57.540 --> 02:13:59.850
<v Speaker 4>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was just like,</v>

2944
02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's right in here.</v>

2945
02:14:00.631 --> 02:14:03.930
<v Speaker 4>But at the tent and then cool for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2946
02:14:03.931 --> 02:14:07.620
<v Speaker 4>a week and then I'm sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm literally going to do it every week.</v>

2947
02:14:07.650 --> 02:14:09.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to loosen it up.</v>

2948
02:14:09.151 --> 02:14:10.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds a bit of a real.</v>

2949
02:14:11.370 --> 02:14:12.350
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever gotten your ad?</v>

2950
02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:17.360
<v Speaker 4>Rolfing done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rolfing thing is like a very painful </v>

2951
02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.350
<v Speaker 4>method of deep tissue massage where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2952
02:14:18.370 --> 02:14:23.370
<v Speaker 4>they're stretching out your fascia and </v>
<v Speaker 4>facing up all these binding to negative </v>

2953
02:14:23.701 --> 02:14:25.380
<v Speaker 4>scar tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>

2954
02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:27.020
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2955
02:14:27.050 --> 02:14:30.960
<v Speaker 4>that can be super effective with all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>scar tissue just from whatever abuse you</v>

2956
02:14:30.961 --> 02:14:33.760
<v Speaker 4>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life muscle polls that funny.</v>

2957
02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:35.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Healed tents up me.</v>

2958
02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you have a bad poll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had a bunch of them or scar tissue </v>

2959
02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:42.480
<v Speaker 4>all over my back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think yoga fixed a lot of it,</v>

2960
02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:44.480
<v Speaker 4>like really a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any issues.</v>

2961
02:14:44.481 --> 02:14:49.481
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do feel like as much as I love </v>

2962
02:14:49.481 --> 02:14:51.861
<v Speaker 4>yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do feel like you'd have to keep </v>

2963
02:14:51.861 --> 02:14:51.861
<v Speaker 4>lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2964
02:14:51.861 --> 02:14:52.020
<v Speaker 4>And I haven't literally because this </v>
<v Speaker 4>started getting,</v>

2965
02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:54.000
<v Speaker 4>becoming a problem like around October,</v>
<v Speaker 4>November,</v>

2966
02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:57.660
<v Speaker 4>and I literally feel like soft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2967
02:14:57.670 --> 02:14:59.800
<v Speaker 4>The people that don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2968
02:14:59.801 --> 02:15:01.470
<v Speaker 4>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think they're right.</v>

3113
02:20:55.450 --> 02:20:57.350
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to go through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>files and I'll go.</v>

3114
02:20:57.710 --> 02:21:00.170
<v Speaker 4>That's what a dad does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She is nice house we live in.</v>

3116
02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:05.660
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana is not bad for you.</v>

3117
02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:08.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't bad.</v>

3118
02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:09.680
<v Speaker 4>It's bad for a kid though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3119
02:21:09.681 --> 02:21:11.390
<v Speaker 4>If you don't want your kids do those </v>
<v Speaker 4>wine.</v>

3120
02:21:11.391 --> 02:21:13.340
<v Speaker 4>I drink wine in front of my children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>

3121
02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:18.400
<v Speaker 4>I go to a restaurant and I have a couple</v>
<v Speaker 4>of glasses of wine in front of my </v>

3122
02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:19.700
<v Speaker 4>children and I don't have any problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

3123
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:22.240
<v Speaker 4>I've let them taste it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Latino men,</v>

3124
02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:27.300
<v Speaker 4>they put it in their mouth like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but wine is alcohol and you could drink </v>

3125
02:21:28.851 --> 02:21:31.700
<v Speaker 4>yourself to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You drink yourself to death off of wine.</v>

3126
02:21:31.701 --> 02:21:33.410
<v Speaker 4>People have done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It smells so good.</v>

3127
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:38.590
<v Speaker 4>Smells great over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

3128
02:21:39.140 --> 02:21:40.820
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing wrong with it man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bullshit.</v>

3129
02:21:40.850 --> 02:21:41.420
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3130
02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:44.060
<v Speaker 4>I was just in Hawaii and it was just so </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3131
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:45.020

3133
02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:47.800
<v Speaker 4>just made for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3134
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:50.780

3135

<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3136
02:21:53.660 --> 02:21:55.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of poverty.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3138
02:21:56.600 --> 02:21:58.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's parts of it that are just</v>

3139
02:21:58.760 --> 02:21:59.810
<v Speaker 4>a regular place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

3140
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:05.150
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that drives me crazy because I'm </v>

3141
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.150
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 4>paradise there though.</v>

<v Speaker 4>right places.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people are great to have a very </v>

3147
02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:21.170
<v Speaker 4>relaxed attitude about life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's magical.</v>

3148
02:22:21.790 --> 02:22:26.790
<v Speaker 4>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're just sitting there and in </v>

3149
02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:29.891
<v Speaker 4>the of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the middle of the ocean and this little </v>

3150
02:22:29.891 --> 02:22:32.901
<v Speaker 4>island and all these other human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some whatever their reason have joined </v>

3151
02:22:32.901 --> 02:22:35.160
<v Speaker 4>you on this island and there's this </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant whale with.</v>

3152
02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:38.570
<v Speaker 4>It's a baby whale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just dancing right next.</v>

3153
02:22:38.590 --> 02:22:42.030
<v Speaker 4>You go under the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hear them singing stars.</v>

3154
02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:43.350
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3155
02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:47.130
<v Speaker 4>we were there with wild masons and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were on this tour where you,</v>

3156
02:22:47.131 --> 02:22:48.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put on like,</v>

3157
02:22:48.910 --> 02:22:52.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>snorkel gear and then they find the pods</v>

3158
02:22:52.110 --> 02:22:53.580
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3159
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:58.630
<v Speaker 4>they pull the boat within maybe 50 yards</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the pod and then you dive in the </v>

3160
02:22:58.630 --> 02:23:00.240
<v Speaker 4>water and swim over to the pods of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dolphins.</v>

3161
02:23:00.241 --> 02:23:05.241
<v Speaker 4>Now is amazing chefs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Hawaii has got a lot of fucking </v>

3162
02:23:05.241 --> 02:23:05.700
<v Speaker 4>shark attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3163
02:23:05.730 --> 02:23:08.310
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally was like,</v>

3164
02:23:08.311 --> 02:23:10.740
<v Speaker 4>why aren't there more shark attacks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I got home I looked it up.</v>

3165
02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:13.320
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While we were there.</v>

3166
02:23:13.350 --> 02:23:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Somebody's got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get hold.</v>

3167
02:23:14.450 --> 02:23:15.930
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While we were there,</v>

3168
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:20.160
<v Speaker 4>a woman from Germany got fucking marked </v>
<v Speaker 4>by a shark just swimming,</v>

3169
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:21.060
<v Speaker 4>snorkeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3170
02:23:21.061 --> 02:23:22.290
<v Speaker 4>we've been there three times.</v>

3171
02:23:22.290 --> 02:23:26.490
<v Speaker 4>When people got jacked by sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a woman got killed and then another dude</v>

3172
02:23:26.491 --> 02:23:31.491
<v Speaker 4>got his leg essentially ripped off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a local Hawaiian Kid who was </v>

3173
02:23:31.491 --> 02:23:33.570
<v Speaker 4>surfing and that was on the big island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He Got Jack.</v>

3174
02:23:33.571 --> 02:23:35.730
<v Speaker 4>There was another time we were there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching the news and you know,</v>

3175
02:23:36.180 --> 02:23:41.180
<v Speaker 4>were out there in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking calm as can be snorkeling and </v>

3176
02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:41.690
<v Speaker 4>having a good old time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>

3177
02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:43.860
<v Speaker 4>it's nerve wracking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's scary.</v>

3178
02:23:43.861 --> 02:23:48.861
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad I didn't know that when it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there trying to look for sea </v>

3179
02:23:48.861 --> 02:23:48.861
<v Speaker 4>turtles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3180
02:23:48.861 --> 02:23:52.370
<v Speaker 4>Two Thousand Fifteen was apparently the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest year ever recorded for shark </v>

3181
02:23:52.370 --> 02:23:52.980
<v Speaker 4>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the change?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Climate Change?</v>

<v Speaker 4>add.</v>

3184
02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:02.250

<v Speaker 4>He know the people are to blame.</v>

3186
02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:07.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I saw that recently,</v>

3187

<v Speaker 4>Now I think someone's going to send me </v>
<v Speaker 4>into a record number of shark attacks in</v>

3198
02:24:35.371 --> 02:24:38.220
<v Speaker 4>2015 though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only six deaths.</v>

3199
02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:43.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine if the wolf man only killed six </v>

3200
02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:43.840
<v Speaker 4>people last year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People like,</v>

3201
02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fun to go outside with full moon.</v>

3202
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:49.710
<v Speaker 4>Just get out in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that man will then mostly eat </v>

3203
02:24:49.710 --> 02:24:50.340
<v Speaker 4>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3204
02:24:51.310 --> 02:24:54.510
<v Speaker 4>The wolf was the number of attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if there's six deaths,</v>

3205
02:24:54.511 --> 02:24:59.511
<v Speaker 4>how many attacks were there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>90 eight and 98 in one year.</v>

3206
02:25:00.110 --> 02:25:00.930
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety eight.</v>

3207
02:25:01.290 --> 02:25:02.940
<v Speaker 4>Twenty zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say Twenty eight,</v>

3208
02:25:03.210 --> 02:25:04.830
<v Speaker 4>26.</v>
<v Speaker 4>March 26 more.</v>

3209
02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:06.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

3210
02:25:06.661 --> 02:25:11.661
<v Speaker 4>In the previous year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of shark attacks worldwide </v>

3211
02:25:11.661 --> 02:25:14.061
<v Speaker 4>with 98 incidents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a whopping 26 more than the previous </v>

3212
02:25:14.061 --> 02:25:14.061
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

3213
02:25:14.061 --> 02:25:17.310
<v Speaker 4>and that's way more than a decade prior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not Hawaii though.</v>

3214
02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:19.560
<v Speaker 4>That's international is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>international.</v>

3215

<v Speaker 3>trip,</v>

3233
02:26:07.421 --> 02:26:09.670
<v Speaker 3>if you organize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left a lot of them through the hotel.</v>

3235
02:26:11.341 --> 02:26:16.341

<v Speaker 3>they have like the little brochures </v>

3236
02:26:16.341 --> 02:26:16.341
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take you out for this kind of fish.</v>

3238
02:26:16.341 --> 02:26:20.910
<v Speaker 3>And so last time we went out we call a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called the who called.</v>

3239
02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:24.970
<v Speaker 3>So delicious man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the chef prepared it three different</v>

3240
02:26:24.971 --> 02:26:26.470
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He grilled it,</v>

3241
02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:28.960
<v Speaker 3>he baked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he served it as Sashimi.</v>

3242
02:26:29.070 --> 02:26:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four different ways because he made a </v>

3243
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:37.040
<v Speaker 3>severe j to Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hours old,</v>

3244
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:41.680
<v Speaker 3>she's had severe ha like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Costa Rica.</v>

3245
02:26:41.681 --> 02:26:44.930
<v Speaker 3>We came back and the guy just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like with all the,</v>

3246
02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:50.160
<v Speaker 3>you can just kinda lime jurors the hose </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's just like chopping up avocado </v>

3247
02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:53.730
<v Speaker 3>or having so best thing you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten so much.</v>

3248
02:26:54.050 --> 02:26:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Fish is one of those things where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>tastes so much better when it's fresh.</v>

3249
02:26:57.490 --> 02:27:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Completely the opposite with meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like meat actually tastes better when it</v>

3250
02:27:02.561 --> 02:27:05.170
<v Speaker 3>sits for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we buy dry aged meat.</v>

3251
02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:08.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sit in the steak house.</v>

3252
02:27:08.141 --> 02:27:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm just on a shelf for six months and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like 35 degrees.</v>

3253
02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:17.080
<v Speaker 3>They can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it develops this sort of crust of </v>

3254
02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.381
<v Speaker 3>bacteria on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty five degrees if you've ever been </v>

3255
02:27:19.381 --> 02:27:22.771
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a butcher shop and seeing dry </v>

3256
02:27:22.771 --> 02:27:23.170
<v Speaker 3>aged meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will query you often meet for awhile.</v>

3257
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:27.700
<v Speaker 3>You believe screen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3258
02:27:27.730 --> 02:27:31.210
<v Speaker 3>queer you is not homophobic at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a perfect,</v>

3259
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:34.360
<v Speaker 3>perfectly reasonable word to use in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictionary.</v>

3260
02:27:34.361 --> 02:27:37.960
<v Speaker 3>It's perfectly reasonable way to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a loophole,</v>

3261
02:27:38.380 --> 02:27:40.810
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks rotten and black.</v>

3262
02:27:40.811 --> 02:27:42.850
<v Speaker 3>It looks like mold and they'll really </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks.</v>

3263
02:27:42.851 --> 02:27:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the mold grows on the outside of</v>

3264
02:27:45.551 --> 02:27:50.551
<v Speaker 3>the meat and that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like bacteria is destroying the </v>

3265
02:27:50.551 --> 02:27:51.730
<v Speaker 3>outside of the meat and you cut that </v>
<v Speaker 3>away and what's underneath?</v>

3266
02:27:51.731 --> 02:27:54.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just tender and relaxed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>

3267
02:27:54.510 --> 02:27:59.470
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like my neck after maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to eat mold on your neck.</v>

3268
02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:03.070
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever gone to Africa?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I would go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3312
02:29:56.210 --> 02:29:58.260
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely be worried about </v>
<v Speaker 3>malaria.</v>

3313
02:29:58.400 --> 02:30:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about a lot of things for </v>

3314
02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:03.400
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I am fat.</v>

3315
02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:04.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by the wildlife there.</v>

3316
02:30:04.411 --> 02:30:09.411
<v Speaker 3>Although the reality of these parks is </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost artificial and a lot of ways how </v>

3317
02:30:12.390 --> 02:30:15.360
<v Speaker 3>they maintain everything and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it for,</v>

3318
02:30:15.630 --> 02:30:18.110
<v Speaker 3>for tourist money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's almost,</v>

3319
02:30:19.050 --> 02:30:21.510
<v Speaker 3>there's almost an artificial quality to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because,</v>

3320
02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:27.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these places are fenced in and </v>

3321
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:27.620
<v Speaker 3>so even though it's thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of acres like this,</v>

3322
02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:30.660
<v Speaker 3>it's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite fucked up.</v>

3323
02:30:30.690 --> 02:30:32.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not quite as zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3324
02:30:32.500 --> 02:30:33.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3325
02:30:33.201 --> 02:30:34.410
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

3326
02:30:34.411 --> 02:30:36.750
<v Speaker 3>And they're still migrating and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>still all that stuff.</v>

3327
02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:38.100
<v Speaker 3>They're not feeding him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3328
02:30:38.101 --> 02:30:38.490
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3329
02:30:38.491 --> 02:30:38.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3330
02:30:38.910 --> 02:30:42.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's still live and wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like going into Yosemite.</v>

3331
02:30:42.860 --> 02:30:44.400
<v Speaker 3>He used to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3332
02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:45.990
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

3333
02:30:46.050 --> 02:30:47.630
<v Speaker 3>They get used to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're in these.</v>

3334
02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:52.640
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times you're in these open air </v>
<v Speaker 3>jeeps and we were talking about it on </v>

3335
02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:53.070
<v Speaker 3>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was saying like,</v>

3336
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:58.090
<v Speaker 3>how?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come these fucking animals don't </v>

3337
02:30:58.090 --> 02:30:59.781
<v Speaker 3>jump in there and almost as if on cue </v>
<v Speaker 3>after we said that a leopard jumped in a</v>

3338
02:30:59.851 --> 02:31:02.100
<v Speaker 3>jeep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an open air jeep like a week later,</v>

3339
02:31:02.101 --> 02:31:02.970
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3340
02:31:03.330 --> 02:31:05.160
<v Speaker 3>why isn't that fucking happening every </v>
<v Speaker 3>day?</v>

3341
02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:09.510
<v Speaker 3>But I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what if animals like lions just</v>

3342
02:31:09.511 --> 02:31:12.480
<v Speaker 3>start figuring that out the same way </v>
<v Speaker 3>keynote there's been,</v>

3343
02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:15.330
<v Speaker 3>there was an article recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about chimps that they</v>

3344
02:31:15.331 --> 02:31:20.331
<v Speaker 3>believe chimps have just started to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enter the stone age for the of </v>

3345
02:31:20.331 --> 02:31:20.820
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzee intelligence.</v>

3346
02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:25.820
<v Speaker 3>Like they literally might be evolving </v>
<v Speaker 3>before our eyes and they started to use </v>

3347
02:31:25.820 --> 02:31:28.830
<v Speaker 3>tools on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This observed champion.</v>

3348
02:31:28.980 --> 02:31:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're coming.</v>

3349
02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might take a few million years,</v>

3350
02:31:32.281 --> 02:31:37.281
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if human beings have only been in this </v>

3351
02:31:37.281 --> 02:31:39.771
<v Speaker 3>form where they think for the last like </v>
<v Speaker 3>200 plus thousand years essentially </v>

3352
02:31:39.771 --> 02:31:42.750
<v Speaker 3>unrecognizable from Uri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck?</v>

3353
02:31:43.050 --> 02:31:45.360
<v Speaker 3>What's the chimp going to be like in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years?</v>

3354
02:31:45.480 --> 02:31:47.190
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Bay.</v>

3355
02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might be like some crazy sasquatch </v>

3356
02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:54.600
<v Speaker 3>type thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some almost half human half monkey thing</v>

3357
02:31:54.601 --> 02:31:59.601
<v Speaker 3>running through the woods and we'll just</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like jelly fish with cars that drive </v>

3358
02:31:59.601 --> 02:32:02.841
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prime rib eye balls in much.</v>

3359
02:32:07.140 --> 02:32:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Our cars never crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we make them out of paper.</v>

3360
02:32:09.850 --> 02:32:12.890
<v Speaker 3>That was logic is everyone's driving a </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper car.</v>

3361
02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:17.610
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So knowing that that amount of tax.</v>

3362
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:19.830
<v Speaker 3>I posted this the other day on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Instagram,</v>

3363
02:32:19.831 --> 02:32:23.070
<v Speaker 3>but just chimps testicle in relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the size of his brain.</v>

3364
02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:28.260
<v Speaker 3>It's testicle is literally about 70 to </v>
<v Speaker 3>80 percent of the size of its brain.</v>

3365
02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a fair amount.</v>

3366
02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:35.940
<v Speaker 3>70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think 70 is accurate at something like </v>

3367
02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:35.940
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's made wrong.</v>

3368
02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is balls?</v>

3369
02:32:37.860 --> 02:32:40.260
<v Speaker 3>One ball is 70 percent the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

3370
02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Two balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Balls are almost a whole.</v>

3371
02:32:44.101 --> 02:32:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Brain is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3372
02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Poor guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so big.</v>

3373
02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:51.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ball's in front of us.</v>

3374
02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:53.340
<v Speaker 3>This is a little perspective trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3375
02:32:53.341 --> 02:32:55.410
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that guy's hands.</v>

3376
02:32:55.411 --> 02:33:00.411
<v Speaker 3>That's not one above the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one behind the other and the other </v>

3377
02:33:00.411 --> 02:33:01.140
<v Speaker 3>hand looks bigger and blacker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different guy,</v>

3378
02:33:01.170 --> 02:33:03.530
<v Speaker 3>different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These flocks.</v>

3379
02:33:04.210 --> 02:33:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if they got it right up next to </v>

3380
02:33:09.210 --> 02:33:09.210
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to go 40 percent.</v>

3381
02:33:09.210 --> 02:33:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant ball.</v>

3382
02:33:09.841 --> 02:33:11.280
<v Speaker 3>I'd be very proud of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Testicle,</v>

3383
02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:13.710
<v Speaker 3>testicle like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show everybody.</v>

3384
02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:15.570
<v Speaker 3>So knowing that there's that many shark </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks,</v>

3385
02:33:15.571 --> 02:33:17.940
<v Speaker 3>will you not go snorkel next time you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go?</v>

3386
02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what.</v>

3387
02:33:21.031 --> 02:33:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about going to Paris this</v>
<v Speaker 3>year and I'm not going to Paris.</v>

3388
02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:26.070
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

3389
02:33:26.310 --> 02:33:28.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents made that call to.</v>

3390
02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the right call for me for</v>

3391
02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:36.201
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have some giant ass fucking crazy </v>

3392
02:33:36.201 --> 02:33:37.140
<v Speaker 3>terrorist attack like that and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't heard any issues with immigrants</v>

3393
02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:39.300
<v Speaker 3>and all the craziness that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3394
02:33:39.310 --> 02:33:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3395
02:33:40.260 --> 02:33:42.270
<v Speaker 3>they might've let some bad people in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

3396
02:33:42.390 --> 02:33:45.690
<v Speaker 3>they let some great people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to escape a terrible place,</v>

3397
02:33:45.691 --> 02:33:47.550
<v Speaker 3>but they also might have let some bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>people into.</v>

3398
02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:50.730
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of fucking anti Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 3>sentiment.</v>

3399
02:33:50.731 --> 02:33:55.731
<v Speaker 3>Although I'm not Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know video of these people walking </v>

3400
02:33:55.731 --> 02:33:59.460
<v Speaker 3>through these Arab neighborhoods and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Paris and the fucking rampant,</v>

3401
02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:03.210
<v Speaker 3>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like outright antisemitism,</v>

3402
02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:04.380
<v Speaker 3>yelling it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people.</v>

3403
02:34:04.490 --> 02:34:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not America.</v>

3404
02:34:07.890 --> 02:34:08.660
<v Speaker 3>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're.</v>

3405
02:34:08.690 --> 02:34:09.840
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with.</v>

3406
02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:13.050
<v Speaker 3>It's a very tricky place right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

3407
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:15.390
<v Speaker 3>It's such a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really beautiful.</v>

3408
02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:16.620
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stunning.</v>

3409
02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:18.280
<v Speaker 3>So historically</v>

3410
02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:22.180
<v Speaker 1>with any update on the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they declared war on Isis.</v>

3411
02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has it gotten even that man?</v>

3412
02:34:24.581 --> 02:34:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3413
02:34:25.180 --> 02:34:27.520
<v Speaker 1>What happened over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even understand what happened.</v>

3414
02:34:27.521 --> 02:34:32.521
<v Speaker 1>It's when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a group of people and </v>

3415
02:34:32.521 --> 02:34:32.521
<v Speaker 1>those people that wanted to performing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that terrorist act,</v>

3416
02:34:32.521 --> 02:34:33.880
<v Speaker 1>wind up dying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

3417
02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:39.240
<v Speaker 1>try getting the truth out of all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to figure out what their motives </v>

3418
02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:40.180
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what like the San Bernardino people.</v>

3419
02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Try figuring that out after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to figure that out.</v>

3420
02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to San Bernardino either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dropping your kids off and it's not </v>

3421
02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:48.660
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Bernardino.</v>

3422
02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:52.860
<v Speaker 1>That's how a hypocrite I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't go to Paris to go to San </v>

3423
02:34:52.860 --> 02:34:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Bernardino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bet you go to Paris if someone gave you </v>

3424
02:34:56.540 --> 02:34:56.540
<v Speaker 1>a sweet gig there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3425
02:34:56.540 --> 02:34:56.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3426
02:34:56.540 --> 02:34:57.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3427
02:34:57.990 --> 02:35:01.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a brutal flight to man a Gig.</v>

3428
02:35:01.390 --> 02:35:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Eight is I would way rather go there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just vegetate and not have any </v>

3429
02:35:06.390 --> 02:35:06.480
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

3430
02:35:06.690 --> 02:35:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Then you go there for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that I've really </v>

3431
02:35:11.690 --> 02:35:13.980
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed about traveling is that I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten a chance to see some really </v>

3432
02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:15.610
<v Speaker 1>cool places like England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland,</v>

3433
02:35:15.850 --> 02:35:18.670
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that's an issue is</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I've gone I've been working.</v>

3434
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't have a chance to see that </v>

3435
02:35:23.790 --> 02:35:26.761
<v Speaker 1>much now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Italy for the first time and </v>

3436
02:35:26.761 --> 02:35:27.340
<v Speaker 1>no Gig at all and I don't travel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that either.</v>

3437
02:35:27.341 --> 02:35:28.030
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally.</v>

3438
02:35:28.580 --> 02:35:31.210
<v Speaker 1>And what a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3439
02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:32.920
<v Speaker 1>what a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

3440
02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:34.010
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3441
02:35:34.011 --> 02:35:39.011
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know how you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see if I fly to Chicago and I got a </v>

3442
02:35:39.011 --> 02:35:42.751
<v Speaker 1>Gig tomorrow night in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get something to eat and </v>

3443
02:35:42.751 --> 02:35:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go to the gym and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go over my notes.</v>

3444
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going anywhere.</v>

3445
02:35:45.130 --> 02:35:46.790
<v Speaker 1>No I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3446
02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:48.600
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

3447
02:35:48.610 --> 02:35:49.540
<v Speaker 1>don't you go sightseeing.</v>

3448
02:35:49.630 --> 02:35:54.630
<v Speaker 1>They don't realize that everything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do during that day takes away from the </v>

3449
02:35:54.630 --> 02:35:54.630
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3450
02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000
<v Speaker 1>There's just an energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental and physical energy that does not</v>

3451
02:35:58.001 --> 02:36:01.180
<v Speaker 1>end up in the show unless it's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to enhance the show.</v>

3452
02:36:01.210 --> 02:36:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Like going over your notes like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there but not running around </v>

3453
02:36:06.210 --> 02:36:06.210
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting cabs do,</v>

3454
02:36:06.250 --> 02:36:11.250
<v Speaker 1>talking to waiters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a little bit of activity and </v>

3455
02:36:11.250 --> 02:36:12.360
<v Speaker 1>sightseeing can amp you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3456
02:36:12.430 --> 02:36:16.060
<v Speaker 1>little you have to have the time to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it can't be taken away from.</v>

3457
02:36:16.061 --> 02:36:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise is mandatory.</v>

3458
02:36:18.701 --> 02:36:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I go on the road,</v>

3459
02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:25.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important things for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>is almost immediately I have to </v>

3460
02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:25.440
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3461
02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if I don't then I'm going to be </v>

3462
02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:30.060
<v Speaker 1>tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get there and I'm like,</v>

3463
02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:30.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking flying.</v>

3464
02:36:30.250 --> 02:36:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you gotta do is say,</v>

3465
02:36:32.771 --> 02:36:33.820
<v Speaker 1>shut up pussy.</v>

3466
02:36:34.030 --> 02:36:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Just put your fucking shorts on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this.</v>

02:36:36.281 --> 02:36:37.780
<v Speaker 1>What floors Jim on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3468
02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get on the fucking machine and just go.</v>

3469
02:36:40.751 --> 02:36:45.751
<v Speaker 1>Just go or a routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I'm doing whatever weight </v>

3470
02:36:45.751 --> 02:36:46.180
<v Speaker 1>lifting routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking make sure I do it.</v>

3471
02:36:46.181 --> 02:36:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I actually had a boss.</v>

3472
02:36:48.430 --> 02:36:50.020
<v Speaker 1>I should do that more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

3473
02:36:50.021 --> 02:36:50.800
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

3474
02:36:50.801 --> 02:36:55.801
<v Speaker 1>just write it down so that it's not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>option to deny like unless you're sick </v>

3475
02:36:55.801 --> 02:36:56.830
<v Speaker 1>or something like that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely shouldn't work out.</v>

3476
02:36:56.860 --> 02:36:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you can do that,</v>

3477
02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:03.360
<v Speaker 1>just it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 40 minutes that you would just be </v>

3478
02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:03.490
<v Speaker 1>jerking off and reading email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

3479
02:37:04.100 --> 02:37:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Totally split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That 40 minutes will go by and you're </v>

3480
02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:09.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

3481
02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I missed the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that before too.</v>

3482
02:37:09.461 --> 02:37:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're tired.</v>

3483
02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I,</v>

3484
02:37:13.450 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>when I say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go down there and</v>

3485
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:17.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

3491
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:30.500
<v Speaker 2>That'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

3493
02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:38.100

<v Speaker 3>really good for just resetting </v>

3494
02:37:39.011 --> 02:37:40.540
<v Speaker 3>everything that your whole nervous </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

3508
02:38:11.351 --> 02:38:16.351

<v Speaker 3>It looked great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The backstage was grieving greg.</v>

3541
02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:36.070
<v Speaker 3>It was a good spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That town,</v>

3542
02:39:36.071 --> 02:39:41.071
<v Speaker 3>like Irvine is a town where there's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many fucking people jammed into that </v>

3543
02:39:41.351 --> 02:39:42.490
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's shocking,</v>

3544
02:39:42.491 --> 02:39:46.090
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is one of the most populated areas in</v>

3545
02:39:46.091 --> 02:39:51.091
<v Speaker 3>southern California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did you guys come from like me and </v>

3546
02:39:51.091 --> 02:39:54.121
<v Speaker 3>my wife were talking about this the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day that there's such a big </v>

3547
02:39:54.121 --> 02:39:56.821
<v Speaker 3>difference between driving up like we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like thousand oaks is and driving down </v>

3548
02:39:57.401 --> 02:40:01.390
<v Speaker 3>Orange County like thousand oaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things lighten up considerably.</v>

3549
02:40:01.391 --> 02:40:02.360
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3550
02:40:02.370 --> 02:40:04.300
<v Speaker 3>it's like fucking horses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should up there,</v>

3551
02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:07.630
<v Speaker 3>but if you get down to like Laguna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3552
02:40:07.660 --> 02:40:11.110
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck getting there and time.</v>

3553
02:40:11.170 --> 02:40:16.170
<v Speaker 3>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever do gigs in San Diego that </v>

3554
02:40:16.170 --> 02:40:19.941
<v Speaker 3>drive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might as well just drive to the </v>

3555
02:40:19.941 --> 02:40:19.941
<v Speaker 3>fucking ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if your car can make it.</v>

3556
02:40:19.941 --> 02:40:23.190
<v Speaker 3>See if you could just drive on the edge </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the water.</v>

3557
02:40:23.220 --> 02:40:24.790
<v Speaker 3>I take the train a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3558
02:40:24.990 --> 02:40:26.280
<v Speaker 3>you ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3559
02:40:26.281 --> 02:40:27.780
<v Speaker 3>I've never done that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was just thinking,</v>

3560
02:40:27.810 --> 02:40:32.810
<v Speaker 3>no wonder if you could drive in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean if they arrest you.</v>

3561
02:40:32.941 --> 02:40:35.880
<v Speaker 3>What are they actually in the ocean and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're driving your car.</v>

3562
02:40:35.890 --> 02:40:37.980
<v Speaker 3>They let you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of car?</v>

3563
02:40:38.250 --> 02:40:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have one of those cars,</v>

3564
02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:40.860
<v Speaker 3>the snorkel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm thinking.</v>

3565
02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:43.200
<v Speaker 3>If you've got like one of them Toyota </v>
<v Speaker 3>land cruisers,</v>

3566
02:40:43.210 --> 02:40:48.210
<v Speaker 3>they put a snorkel on them and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive to the river and the fucking </v>

3567
02:40:48.210 --> 02:40:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Amazon like you would think they'd let </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go.</v>

3568
02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:52.590
<v Speaker 3>The sharks might get you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they let you do that?</v>

3569
02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Like how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with the coastguard k fuck face,</v>

3570
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:59.160
<v Speaker 3>you can't just drive in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not.</v>

3571
02:40:59.170 --> 02:41:00.930
<v Speaker 3>I thought about the same thing in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar vein.</v>

3572
02:41:00.931 --> 02:41:02.520
<v Speaker 3>Can you just go on horseback down?</v>

3573
02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Ventura could just get a horse and go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bank that way.</v>

3574
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:07.650
<v Speaker 3>That's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good point.</v>

3575
02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Could you just tired horse up to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bike rack and walk inside and you cash a</v>

3576
02:41:13.651 --> 02:41:14.340
<v Speaker 3>check?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3577
02:41:14.341 --> 02:41:19.341
<v Speaker 3>it's always weird if you go to burbank </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see people riding their horses </v>

3578
02:41:19.341 --> 02:41:19.341
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Burbank.</v>

3579
02:41:19.341 --> 02:41:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Burbank is an equestrian neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My daughter was taking lessons over </v>

3580
02:41:23.450 --> 02:41:23.530
<v Speaker 3>there for a little bit with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3581
02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:25.320
<v Speaker 3>here's this Guy Perth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>

3582
02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy just drove right in.</v>

3583
02:41:27.210 --> 02:41:29.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm just driving in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just stupid.</v>

3584
02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:33.190
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this guy tried watchmen drive current</v>

3585
02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:35.220
<v Speaker 3>into the ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ocean from the cops I think.</v>

3586
02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to get away from.</v>

3587
02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's different.</v>

3588
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:43.880
<v Speaker 3>And so now he's driving off and the cops</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to get them so they drove right </v>

3589
02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:44.940
<v Speaker 3>into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's an idiot.</v>

3590
02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:46.080
<v Speaker 3>See the car doesn't.</v>

3591
02:41:46.250 --> 02:41:48.820
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once the hood is underwater.</v>

3592
02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Dip Shit for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the snorkels for for it.</v>

3593
02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:53.400
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that the cops behind him </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3594
02:41:53.460 --> 02:41:55.530
<v Speaker 3>well he's going hop out of the car and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just swim.</v>

3595
02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:56.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's out now.</v>

3596
02:41:56.790 --> 02:42:01.790
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a car with a snorkel and he </v>

3597
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:05.721
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have a car with a snorkel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can drive pretty far and they can't </v>

3598
02:42:05.721 --> 02:42:06.960
<v Speaker 3>get you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could stay up but he could just</v>

3599
02:42:06.961 --> 02:42:10.320
<v Speaker 3>drive next to you on the beach and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually got to come to the land.</v>

3600
02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Look at this crazy clusterfuck of cops </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the car.</v>

3601
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Is this an Australia or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A course.</v>

3602
02:42:17.530 --> 02:42:21.670
<v Speaker 3>How did you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the beginning?</v>

3603
02:42:21.690 --> 02:42:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3604
02:42:22.171 --> 02:42:23.820
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because otherwise I'm like,</v>

3605
02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:25.620
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I just guessed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why not?</v>

3606
02:42:25.621 --> 02:42:28.740
<v Speaker 3>Just get a horse and code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run your errands.</v>

3607
02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:33.740
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about an Eagle Eagle to fly around </v>

3608
02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:34.530
<v Speaker 3>managing so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just developed an like look,</v>

3609
02:42:34.590 --> 02:42:39.590
<v Speaker 3>grab onto his talents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen a pit bull that's </v>

3610
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.590
<v Speaker 3>like 190 pounds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3611
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:40.020
<v Speaker 3>They're not supposed to be that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3612
02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Somebody made that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bred those pitbulls until it became</v>

3613
02:42:44.011 --> 02:42:46.630
<v Speaker 3>this ridiculous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The average size for Pitbull,</v>

3614
02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:49.230
<v Speaker 3>those fighting dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like 35 pounds.</v>

3615
02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I got big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like 50.</v>

3616
02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3617
02:42:51.250 --> 02:42:54.690
<v Speaker 3>They're not big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these monsters are like chickens with</v>

3618
02:42:54.691 --> 02:42:56.070
<v Speaker 3>giant breasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

3619
02:42:56.610 --> 02:42:58.770
<v Speaker 3>which also comes from selective </v>
<v Speaker 3>breeding.</v>

3620
02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Apparently I thought the chickens with </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant breasts were steroids,</v>

3621
02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:03.990
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this chicken farmer explained to me,</v>

3622
02:43:03.991 --> 02:43:04.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

3623
02:43:04.981 --> 02:43:09.981
<v Speaker 3>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how expensive it would be really pumped </v>

3624
02:43:09.981 --> 02:43:09.981
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have this idea,</v>

3625
02:43:09.981 --> 02:43:11.410
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're putting all the hormones and not</v>

3626
02:43:11.411 --> 02:43:12.250
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3627
02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:13.120
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3628
02:43:13.121 --> 02:43:13.480
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3629
02:43:13.481 --> 02:43:14.290
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>

3630
02:43:14.470 --> 02:43:16.420
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they had to fix on something crazy.</v>

3631
02:43:16.450 --> 02:43:17.590
<v Speaker 3>But most of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3632
02:43:17.591 --> 02:43:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Most of it is they genetically engineer </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3633
02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:22.360
<v Speaker 3>These selectively breed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they get,</v>

3634
02:43:22.390 --> 02:43:25.660
<v Speaker 3>they selectively breed them to the point</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they could barely even walk.</v>

3635
02:43:25.930 --> 02:43:28.700
<v Speaker 3>It's poor things that they can't stay on</v>
<v Speaker 3>their leg.</v>

3636
02:43:28.701 --> 02:43:32.040
<v Speaker 3>So for at least how this guy has </v>
<v Speaker 3>explained it to her,</v>

3637
02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:36.520
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly just selective breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why can they do that with an eagle?</v>

3638
02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:40.000
<v Speaker 3>Get a big ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Ass fucking eagle.</v>

3639
02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:42.280
<v Speaker 3>Have you could teach an eagle to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>for wolves for you.</v>

3640
02:43:42.281 --> 02:43:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen them do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3641
02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:44.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mongolians.</v>

3642
02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lead an eagle loose in the eagle </v>

3643
02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:50.500
<v Speaker 3>will fucking fly down and Jack a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wolf,</v>

3644
02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:52.180
<v Speaker 3>a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are big.</v>

3645
02:43:52.210 --> 02:43:55.990
<v Speaker 3>They're not big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how gangster eagles are.</v>

3646
02:43:56.260 --> 02:43:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading that book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Hawk.</v>

3647
02:43:58.030 --> 02:43:59.870
<v Speaker 3>What's that girl?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3648
02:44:00.610 --> 02:44:01.870
<v Speaker 3>just loved.</v>

3653
02:44:17.821 --> 02:44:18.100
<v Speaker 3>pretty intense.</v>

3654
02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:22.460
<v Speaker 3>It's very intense getting into trust you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're in its hood.</v>

3655
02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:24.610
<v Speaker 3>You have to be with it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the time,</v>

3656
02:44:25.090 --> 02:44:26.890
<v Speaker 3>like in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for days,</v>

3657
02:44:27.580 --> 02:44:30.580
<v Speaker 3>just sitting with it on your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you go on vacations new?</v>

3658
02:44:30.850 --> 02:44:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just take a month off.</v>

3659
02:44:32.351 --> 02:44:34.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to hang out with puking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3660
02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:39.040
<v Speaker 3>eat your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little hood.</v>

3661
02:44:39.130 --> 02:44:41.590
<v Speaker 3>But why couldn't someone engineer an </v>
<v Speaker 3>eagle?</v>

3662
02:44:41.650 --> 02:44:46.370
<v Speaker 3>That was your buddy that flies you </v>
<v Speaker 3>around like a fly back early.</v>

3663
02:44:46.390 --> 02:44:51.390
<v Speaker 3>This wolf jacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a wolf jacking in Eagle and the </v>

3664
02:44:51.390 --> 02:44:51.390
<v Speaker 3>eagle comes down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson Wolf.</v>

3665
02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:53.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that?</v>

3666
02:44:53.021 --> 02:44:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Both jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is insane.</v>

3667
02:44:57.340 --> 02:45:00.140
<v Speaker 3>So the wolf was kicking the eagles ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>and his home.</v>

3668
02:45:00.141 --> 02:45:01.960
<v Speaker 3>He came in and backed him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3669
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:04.840
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't worry about the monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 3>because these guys are doing this now.</v>

3670
02:45:04.930 --> 02:45:06.170
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as men,</v>

3671
02:45:06.290 --> 02:45:11.290
<v Speaker 3>but these eagles are so god damn tough </v>
<v Speaker 3>and their claws are so fucking </v>

3672
02:45:11.290 --> 02:45:11.350
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>

3673
02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:13.340
<v Speaker 3>They essentially have knives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3674
02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:15.760
<v Speaker 3>they're growing their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking dinosaurs,</v>

3675
02:45:15.761 --> 02:45:20.761
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says this is a dinosaur that made it </v>

3676
02:45:20.761 --> 02:45:22.600
<v Speaker 3>right and it makes me wonder what </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs actually looked like.</v>

3677
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Like we always assume that all dinosaurs</v>
<v Speaker 3>were covered with scales like a </v>

3678
02:45:27.630 --> 02:45:29.320
<v Speaker 3>crocodile and show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them will look at this,</v>

3679
02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:30.940
<v Speaker 3>see there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>duking it out.</v>

3680
02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:37.140
<v Speaker 3>The Eagle lands on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started jacking them shoes and he's got </v>

3681
02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:37.140
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got him by the neck.</v>

3682
02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

3683
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:43.710
<v Speaker 3>He's killing is just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just got full mount on the wolf and </v>

3684
02:45:43.710 --> 02:45:46.810
<v Speaker 3>he's clawing them to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just keeps committed distance.</v>

3685
02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Eagles fucked.</v>

3686
02:45:48.850 --> 02:45:50.800
<v Speaker 3>He's got his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is insane.</v>

3687
02:45:51.610 --> 02:45:54.220
<v Speaker 3>It's insane that they can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is nuts.</v>

3688
02:45:54.250 --> 02:45:56.410
<v Speaker 3>That's a big ass ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a Golden Eagle.</v>

3689
02:45:56.411 --> 02:46:01.411
<v Speaker 3>And that's a small wolf by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are not as big as it looks like a </v>

3690
02:46:01.411 --> 02:46:01.720
<v Speaker 3>mid dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy though,</v>

3691
02:46:01.721 --> 02:46:03.790
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now would see feeding him.</v>

3692
02:46:03.791 --> 02:46:06.010
<v Speaker 3>He's giving him a reward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is given them some meat.</v>

3693
02:46:06.370 --> 02:46:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3694
02:46:07.980 --> 02:46:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Always holding the glove meat of</v>

3695
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:13.340
<v Speaker 1>the carcass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gets them back on his arm in the hood.</v>

3696
02:46:13.341 --> 02:46:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3697
02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeez.</v>

3698
02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:20.630
<v Speaker 1>What a wonderful but terrifying animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool hobby.</v>

3699
02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:22.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like bread making bread,</v>

3700
02:46:22.881 --> 02:46:26.370
<v Speaker 1>but where's this starter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3701
02:46:26.371 --> 02:46:27.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they showed these.</v>

3702
02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:33.100
<v Speaker 1>They had these ancient hominid bones </v>
<v Speaker 1>they found and they were trying to </v>

3703
02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:36.551
<v Speaker 1>figure out why they had these claw marks</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them and they were trying to figure </v>

3704
02:46:36.551 --> 02:46:40.961
<v Speaker 1>out what animal had done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they recognize very similar </v>

3705
02:46:40.961 --> 02:46:45.280
<v Speaker 1>patterns of scrapes to what they find on</v>
<v Speaker 1>small primates that are near heartbeat </v>

3706
02:46:45.351 --> 02:46:48.890
<v Speaker 1>eagles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they realized that early humans were</v>

3707
02:46:48.891 --> 02:46:51.740
<v Speaker 1>most likely eaten by eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3708
02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bigger eagle.</v>

3709
02:46:53.810 --> 02:46:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Like a pterodactyl sizing gang of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of birds and large </v>

3710
02:46:58.810 --> 02:46:59.910
<v Speaker 1>predatory birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3711
02:47:00.190 --> 02:47:01.460
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North America,</v>

3712
02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:05.270
<v Speaker 1>like I believe before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3713
02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:07.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say how long ago,</v>

3714
02:47:07.401 --> 02:47:08.720
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it was too long ago.</v>

3715
02:47:09.020 --> 02:47:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Like not even a million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a thing called a Tara Byrd.</v>

3716
02:47:13.030 --> 02:47:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Tera Byrd was like a giant seven foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>tall predatory bird that didn't fly.</v>

3717
02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:23.010
<v Speaker 1>It was like a Standing Burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant beat.</v>

3718
02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Like a huge predatory Karl Malone sized </v>
<v Speaker 1>bird.</v>

3719
02:47:27.650 --> 02:47:30.170
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

3720
02:47:30.171 --> 02:47:35.171
<v Speaker 1>Let's make that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about a magic Johnson sized bird </v>

3721
02:47:35.171 --> 02:47:37.730
<v Speaker 1>with a giant fucking hatchet for a face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even flying.</v>

3722
02:47:37.731 --> 02:47:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3723
02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:43.840
<v Speaker 1>You should see that they do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>superimposed image of the size of a </v>

3724
02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:45.470
<v Speaker 1>normal human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have a six foot tall humans next to</v>

3725
02:47:45.471 --> 02:47:48.770
<v Speaker 1>a terror or like what they looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Tara Byrd.</v>

3726
02:47:48.771 --> 02:47:50.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a generic name isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying,</v>

3727
02:47:51.010 --> 02:47:52.730
<v Speaker 1>and this is North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is right here.</v>

3728
02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:53.840
<v Speaker 1>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3729
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:58.870
<v Speaker 1>so there was A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the entire fossil record even </v>

3730
02:47:58.870 --> 02:48:00.750
<v Speaker 1>just of males is not complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3731
02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:04.220
<v Speaker 1>they're always finding new things </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in order to create a fossil,</v>

3732
02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:07.000
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to like something </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to happen.</v>

3733
02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:08.470
<v Speaker 1>You have to get caught in the mud </v>
<v Speaker 1>sliders.</v>

3734
02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find a terror picture.</v>

3735
02:48:11.690 --> 02:48:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking thing as a soldier </v>

3736
02:48:16.690 --> 02:48:21.011
<v Speaker 1>that gets eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one in the left that looks like </v>

3737
02:48:21.011 --> 02:48:21.790
<v Speaker 1>where the wild things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3738
02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:25.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even look like it's a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3739
02:48:26.300 --> 02:48:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eggs must be huge.</v>

3740
02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ahead.</v>

3741
02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bigger,</v>

3742
02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:35.600
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that fucker.</v>

3743
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't there a movie where people riding</v>
<v Speaker 1>those?</v>

3744
02:48:37.970 --> 02:48:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting that one of them </v>

3745
02:48:42.970 --> 02:48:42.970
<v Speaker 1>has fairly large wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one on the right,</v>

3746
02:48:42.970 --> 02:48:44.540
<v Speaker 1>but the one on the left has like these </v>
<v Speaker 1>nubs.</v>

3747
02:48:44.690 --> 02:48:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like all different terror birds.</v>

3748
02:48:47.370 --> 02:48:51.170
<v Speaker 1>All fucking cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3749
02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:57.960
<v Speaker 1>The one in the forefront.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that the evil red looking beak </v>

3750
02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:02.170
<v Speaker 1>and the one in the backgrounds like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's like almost flamingo ostrich </v>

3751
02:49:02.170 --> 02:49:05.711
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if you were just </v>

3752
02:49:05.711 --> 02:49:07.721
<v Speaker 1>walking along and you saw something </v>
<v Speaker 1>popping its head out of the trees </v>

3753
02:49:07.721 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 1>looking at you funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that</v>

3754
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:09.690
<v Speaker 4>size and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

3755

<v Speaker 4>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's over.</v>

3756
02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:15.420
<v Speaker 4>My Cat's been on a bird killing spree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good for her or him.</v>

3757
02:49:15.421 --> 02:49:17.970
<v Speaker 4>Brings in a couple of week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3758
02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:19.950
<v Speaker 4>It's really out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3759
02:49:19.970 --> 02:49:24.970
<v Speaker 4>you get better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be careful if you let your cat out </v>

3760
02:49:24.970 --> 02:49:24.970
<v Speaker 4>because you can get jacked by coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3761
02:49:24.970 --> 02:49:25.830
<v Speaker 4>it's his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's his life.</v>

3762
02:49:26.370 --> 02:49:29.370
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's brutal clause or no claws.</v>

3763
02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Claws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scott clause.</v>

3764
02:49:31.441 --> 02:49:34.890
<v Speaker 4>And you let them scan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an outdoor and he just.</v>

3765
02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:37.400
<v Speaker 4>He's a nut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't see who's been an outdoor cat.</v>

3766
02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:38.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does he come inside at all?</v>

3767
02:49:38.970 --> 02:49:40.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comes in place in your house.</v>

3768
02:49:41.650 --> 02:49:46.650
<v Speaker 4>Now they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't get them fixed quick </v>

3769
02:49:46.650 --> 02:49:46.650
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have an indoor cat,</v>

3770
02:49:46.930 --> 02:49:49.350
<v Speaker 4>an indoor and outdoor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My minor,</v>

3771
02:49:49.351 --> 02:49:51.080
<v Speaker 4>both indoor because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3772
02:49:51.510 --> 02:49:53.250
<v Speaker 4>I live in a place where a lot of coyotes</v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

3773
02:49:53.270 --> 02:49:58.270
<v Speaker 4>I guess my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my chickens got jacked by a </v>

3774
02:49:58.270 --> 02:49:58.270
<v Speaker 4>coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched it happen.</v>

3775
02:49:58.270 --> 02:49:59.160
<v Speaker 4>I would have hopped the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My chicken in his mouth.</v>

3776
02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a separate chickens get broody </v>

3777
02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:05.260
<v Speaker 4>means they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3778
02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:09.520
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get confused since they're not </v>

3779
02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:11.721
<v Speaker 4>getting fucked by roosters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they think that they have an </v>

3780
02:50:11.721 --> 02:50:11.721
<v Speaker 4>egg that they have to hatch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they have to,</v>

3781
02:50:11.721 --> 02:50:12.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3782
02:50:12.570 --> 02:50:13.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that called?</v>

3783
02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:16.440
<v Speaker 4>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The nurture and egg to sit on it.</v>

3784
02:50:16.780 --> 02:50:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3785
02:50:19.890 --> 02:50:22.300
<v Speaker 4>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something again,</v>

3786
02:50:22.810 --> 02:50:25.630
<v Speaker 4>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just state.</v>

3787
02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:28.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not a um,</v>

3788
02:50:29.370 --> 02:50:34.170
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lay on top of what's it called?</v>

3789
02:50:34.171 --> 02:50:37.710
<v Speaker 4>Like when you take an egg and you put it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in one of those warming things,</v>

3790
02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:43.240
<v Speaker 4>you like lamp goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People will listen to this screaming you</v>

3791
02:50:44.461 --> 02:50:46.680
<v Speaker 4>fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even Remember,</v>

3792
02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:51.320
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew it was a,</v>

3793
02:50:52.600 --> 02:50:56.830
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to avoid the band incubus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3794
02:50:57.210 --> 02:50:58.270
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3795
02:50:58.420 --> 02:50:59.700
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was thinking,</v>

3796
02:50:59.701 --> 02:51:00.750
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was thinking that,</v>

3797
02:51:00.930 --> 02:51:05.930
<v Speaker 4>so we have to take them out and she had </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get outside of regular chicken coop.</v>

3798
02:51:06.481 --> 02:51:11.481
<v Speaker 4>It's just large coop and you have to put</v>
<v Speaker 4>her in one where she has to sit on a </v>

3799
02:51:11.481 --> 02:51:12.990
<v Speaker 4>beam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very small for the amount of time</v>

3800
02:51:12.991 --> 02:51:15.090
<v Speaker 4>they broody that's how much time you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to put them in there.</v>

3801
02:51:15.091 --> 02:51:17.670
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise they could be broody for like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a month.</v>

3802
02:51:17.671 --> 02:51:19.590
<v Speaker 4>They'll pull their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their feathers out,</v>

3803
02:51:20.810 --> 02:51:22.320
<v Speaker 4>cause some health issues.</v>

3804
02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:27.380
<v Speaker 4>They pluck the feathers out of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>chest to feather their nest for an egg </v>

3805
02:51:27.380 --> 02:51:28.350
<v Speaker 4>that's not going to hatch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get a little wacky,</v>

3806
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:30.750
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well their brains are fucking thumbnail,</v>

3807
02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:32.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3808
02:51:32.101 --> 02:51:37.101
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this coyote just figured out a way to </v>

3809
02:51:37.101 --> 02:51:40.131
<v Speaker 4>get into that little cage and jack the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken and jumped over the fence with </v>

3810
02:51:40.131 --> 02:51:40.700
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3811
02:51:40.770 --> 02:51:43.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's definitely a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a couple of neighbors,</v>

3812
02:51:44.100 --> 02:51:46.470
<v Speaker 4>one neighbor lost a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3813
02:51:46.471 --> 02:51:48.090
<v Speaker 4>like 10 years ago too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

3814
02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:51.450
<v Speaker 4>it's like the beginning of coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gives us not a lot going on,</v>

3815
02:51:51.451 --> 02:51:54.450
<v Speaker 4>but enough where if the cat's not smart </v>
<v Speaker 4>but it could happen,</v>

3816
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:58.500
<v Speaker 4>but the cat is so happy and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way he lives and it's like,</v>

3817
02:51:58.560 --> 02:51:59.950
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3818
02:52:00.330 --> 02:52:00.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

3819
02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:02.630
<v Speaker 4>Everyone would be sad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yes.</v>

3820
02:52:02.660 --> 02:52:03.990
<v Speaker 4>His life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3821
02:52:03.991 --> 02:52:08.991
<v Speaker 4>It's probably not the worst way to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>either quick rather than getting </v>

3822
02:52:08.991 --> 02:52:10.290
<v Speaker 4>diabetes and cancer.</v>

3823
02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:11.140
<v Speaker 4>Diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3824
02:52:11.141 --> 02:52:12.550
<v Speaker 4>I hit a diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't whoa.</v>

3825
02:52:12.610 --> 02:52:14.210
<v Speaker 4>So you have to give you the insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3826
02:52:14.380 --> 02:52:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every day.</v>

3827
02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:18.220
<v Speaker 4>Twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably pissed at you.</v>

3828
02:52:18.610 --> 02:52:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea why you shoot me this </v>

3829
02:52:23.610 --> 02:52:23.610
<v Speaker 4>fucking needle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bitch.</v>

3830
02:52:23.610 --> 02:52:26.620
<v Speaker 4>I want pets putting a pill on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a sticky as a fire and its throat.</v>

3831
02:52:26.621 --> 02:52:28.750
<v Speaker 4>That's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things that.</v>

3832
02:52:28.751 --> 02:52:29.970
<v Speaker 4>And the insula.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He probably.</v>

3833
02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:34.840
<v Speaker 4>Did he run from you all the time now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was pretty mellow.</v>

3834
02:52:34.841 --> 02:52:38.650
<v Speaker 4>He's probably extended his life for </v>
<v Speaker 4>another four years.</v>

3835
02:52:38.770 --> 02:52:40.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

3836
02:52:40.031 --> 02:52:42.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just all ended up failing,</v>

3837
02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:44.880
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like I will,</v>

3838
02:52:44.910 --> 02:52:46.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was my wife's cat.</v>

3839
02:52:46.300 --> 02:52:51.300
<v Speaker 4>If I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would have ended up probably would </v>

3840
02:52:51.300 --> 02:52:52.870
<v Speaker 4>not have shots for that long hatchet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is Rosen method.</v>

3841
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Just opened the door and make coyote </v>
<v Speaker 4>calls.</v>

3842
02:52:58.370 --> 02:52:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>

3843
02:52:59.270 --> 02:53:00.080
<v Speaker 4>it was a nice cat.</v>

3844
02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:05.080
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never knew there was this thing as a </v>

3845
02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:05.080
<v Speaker 4>diabetic cat and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3846
02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:06.310
<v Speaker 4>we extended his life for awhile and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3847
02:53:06.311 --> 02:53:08.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other things start to fail.</v>

3848
02:53:08.580 --> 02:53:11.040
<v Speaker 4>You try feeding him a Vegan Diet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3849
02:53:11.710 --> 02:53:13.610
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to cure diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I can things up.</v>

3851
02:53:16.340 --> 02:53:18.680
<v Speaker 4>But people do have their cats and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>feed them vegan food.</v>

3852
02:53:18.830 --> 02:53:19.490
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3853
02:53:19.610 --> 02:53:23.600

<v Speaker 4>Sad irony.</v>

3854
02:53:24.010 --> 02:53:25.820
<v Speaker 4>And their attempt to not be cruel to </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

3855
