<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

5
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.770
<v Speaker 1>how did you do what you did and how are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

6
00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just jumping right in.</v>

7
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's just jump right in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For people who are just tuning into </v>

8
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>courtney one the Moab to 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a 238 mile endurance race </v>

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>through the MOAB,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utah</v>

10
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Deserts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenyans,</v>

11
00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:28.450
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>

12
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And how long did it take you to run?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred and 30.</v>

13
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Eight miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took just under 58 hours.</v>

14
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:38.851
<v Speaker 1>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you beat the second place person by </v>

15
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>more than 20 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>What was the distance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

17
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>The distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was around 20 or so.</v>

18
00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Speaker 1>It was about 10 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you do that?</v>

19
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 1>How this is and your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>

20
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Thirty two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's young for these kinds of races,</v>

21
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be True because these kinds of races,</v>

22
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 1>usually it's like grit and anger at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that gets you through.</v>

23
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 1>You're only 32.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're young and you.</v>

24
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.760
<v Speaker 1>The way you're winning is like so crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've only been doing this like big</v>

25
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>time races like this for a short amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

26
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:16.990
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long?</v>

28
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Running ultra marathons for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe seven,</v>

29
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 2>eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm getting pretty competitive in </v>

30
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 2>the past couple of years.</v>

31
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did you start out the race?</v>

32
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 1>You start off running in high school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 2>back in junior high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school.</v>

34
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:40.571
<v Speaker 2>I ran cross country and track and </v>
<v Speaker 2>continued in during sports through </v>

35
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:45.731
<v Speaker 2>college and tried some marathons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it was just like a natural segue </v>

36
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 2>into trail racing,</v>

37
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the way you're beating </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people's insane.</v>

38
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Not just beating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like demoralizing people.</v>

39
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too nice when you read the second</v>

40
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>place person by 20 hours or 20 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

41
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Ten hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said it was about 10 hours.</v>

42
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're both start at the same time.</v>

43
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>

44
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:11.900
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're finishing 10 hours ahead.</v>

45
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Like you could go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to sleep,</v>

46
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>get eight hours sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a nice meal,</v>

47
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 1>like sit down and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then just,</v>

48
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>just show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean and showered and everything like </v>

49
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

50
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>you're finishing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How cute.</v>

51
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I just slept all night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

52
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

53
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 1>it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a cool thing.</v>

54
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Venture to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to travel with your feet for 238 miles </v>

55
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.440
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was brand new territory for me</v>

56
00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't know how it was going to go.</v>

57
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much brand new territory for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the runners.</v>

58
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like the first ever 2:40</v>

59
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>PM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2:40.</v>

60
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Quite a few.</v>

61
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Tom had done a bunch of 200 mile races.</v>

62
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a picture.</v>

63
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>You hoofing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hoefling crazy.</v>

64
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>So what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so better than everybody </v>

65
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>

66
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>

67
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I had a good day out.</v>

68
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three days such as you try to be too </v>

69
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

70
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.680
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

71
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.830
<v Speaker 1>but I really like objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how are you so much better than </v>

72
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.830
<v Speaker 1>everybody else?</v>

73
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I'm physically better </v>

74
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.240
<v Speaker 2>than any of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

75
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been really trying to learn how to </v>

76
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 2>tap into my brain when it physically </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes hard because I think our brain </v>

77
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.560
<v Speaker 2>can help us overcome so much and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

78
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:36.620
<v Speaker 2>So I'm kind of that mind over matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and,</v>

79
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>and when it physically becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible to try and switch gears into </v>

80
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.710
<v Speaker 2>like have it be a mental thing and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep pushing.</v>

81
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.120
<v Speaker 1>So what are you doing to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like have you studied some forms of </v>

82
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>meditation or.</v>

83
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just experience like I keep on </v>

84
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.701
<v Speaker 2>doing these races that put me in </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable physical states and um,</v>

85
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.180
<v Speaker 2>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try and keep in mind that my brain can</v>

86
00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:09.290
<v Speaker 2>help me overcome this physical pain if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keep going.</v>

87
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.400
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's it,</v>

88
00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:13.100
<v Speaker 2>just just stay tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trial and error.</v>

89
00:04:13.101 --> 00:04:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

90
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So essentially self taught in terms of </v>

91
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 1>like your mental fortitude</v>

92
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

93
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I guess probably could give some of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

94
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>So like my parents or my upbringing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.940
<v Speaker 2>coaches I've had along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

96
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.450
<v Speaker 2>but in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this past couple of years,</v>

97
00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:35.340
<v Speaker 2>it's been just like not letting myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an excuse to stop.</v>

98
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terrifying to everybody else </v>

99
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>because if you did decide to start like </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning meditation or something,</v>

100
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.970
<v Speaker 1>what if like it took you to another </v>
<v Speaker 1>level?</v>

101
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>How do you meditate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

103
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I can't do what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

104
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it's just being comfortable</v>

105
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>with that excruciating agony and pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just like finding a,</v>

106
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.030
<v Speaker 1>a state of mind that you obviously know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to achieve.</v>

107
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's nothing more to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just incredibly hard work.</v>

108
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.780
<v Speaker 1>And just grit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you obviously have bolded those.</v>

109
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean that could be just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

110
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 1>You might have the form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of times people try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overthink things,</v>

112
00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:20.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people do you know,</v>

113
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>where their life sort of never changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're always like doing self help </v>

114
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>seminars and reading all these books and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking nothing changes.</v>

115
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just a safe person.</v>

116
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>They keep screwing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep getting involved in bad </v>

117
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

118
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 1>sometimes maybe it's just there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler thing or simpler answer,</v>

119
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Set your mind to something,</v>

120
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.170
<v Speaker 2>put in the work to get there and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>just execute the plan now is just the </v>

121
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 2>furthest I've ever run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the furthest.</v>

122
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the previous furthest?</v>

123
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the previous furthest was 155 ish miles.</v>

124
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big difference.</v>

125
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

126
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 3>And that was just on a flat track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

127
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 3>So this was really different than what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had done before.</v>

128
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the interesting thing about these</v>

129
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:12.311
<v Speaker 3>mountain races like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's not just a in terms of it's </v>

130
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.830
<v Speaker 3>not just your cardiovascular endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have muscular endurance </v>

131
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 3>because you're climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of elevation change,</v>

132
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:19.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

133
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.700
<v Speaker 3>quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice though because then you get </v>

134
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.921
<v Speaker 3>the reprieve of using different muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hiking muscles might be different</v>

135
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 3>than like your flat running or your </v>
<v Speaker 3>downhill muscles.</v>

136
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.860
<v Speaker 3>So you get to kind of switch it around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>switch the effort around in why is </v>

137
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 3>everybody in this race using trekking </v>
<v Speaker 3>poles?</v>

138
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 3>I noticed that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were helpful.</v>

139
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 3>I didn't use them until the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last quarter of the race,</v>

140
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were helpful just as my feet </v>

141
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.980
<v Speaker 3>were becoming a little more tender and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

142
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.050
<v Speaker 3>my muscles not quite as quick to catch </v>
<v Speaker 3>me on the downhills and the uphill is </v>

143
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 3>just to like dispersed the effort a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit to my arms.</v>

144
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Well Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up that video of the,</v>

145
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 1>the sort of preview video of the mob to </v>
<v Speaker 1>40 when they showed all these people </v>

147
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.871
<v Speaker 1>running over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some precarious section and when</v>

148
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Speaker 1>you're tired you've already run like 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 miles.</v>

149
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Then you hit these crazy precarious </v>
<v Speaker 1>sections.</v>

150
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't die.</v>

151
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And no one's there watching you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like running with other </v>

152
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>runners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

153
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Like this would be a lonely death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No of 200 endurance run as two and 38 </v>

154
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>mile foot race through some of Utah's </v>
<v Speaker 1>most stunning and challenging terrain.</v>

155
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:36.521
<v Speaker 1>And it really is so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Solomon is the sponsor of this.</v>

156
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.400
<v Speaker 3>They're the presenting sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

157
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.470
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a bunch of like sub </v>
<v Speaker 3>sponsor.</v>

158
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I loved their trail shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this section.</v>

159
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.850
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the one that drives me nuts.</v>

160
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you just stumble off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

161
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a wrap.</v>

162
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

163
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 3>and they're making it look like so easy </v>
<v Speaker 3>to run down.</v>

164
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:58.121
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure I was like stumbling my </v>
<v Speaker 3>way down that a lot less gracefully.</v>

165
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come these guys can't do it the way </v>

166
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.111
<v Speaker 1>you do it though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something's going on because like </v>

167
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.900
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of be like insane too for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other people that were running it,</v>

168
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.420
<v Speaker 1>that you win by these giant margins.</v>

169
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

170
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I think you really don't know you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your</v>

171
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 3>diet like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

172
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm Nachos.</v>

173
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Nachos.</v>

174
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean just a normal diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't restrict or like try and include</v>

175
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.340
<v Speaker 3>anything different than the normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the average American.</v>

176
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

177
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so do you supplement with vitamins or do</v>

178
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:44.600
<v Speaker 1>you take anything else?</v>

179
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take a multivitamin.</v>

180
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.040
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

181
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No minerals,</v>

182
00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>nothing critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creatine.</v>

183
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Nothing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

184
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.810
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

185
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>So just essentially a multivitamin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoofing it with Nachos in your belly.</v>

186
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.460
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would expect that someone who is </v>

187
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>so far ahead of the rest of the pack </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would have some,</v>

188
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 1>like you go to Colorado Springs Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 1>training program and they get you hooked</v>

189
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 1>up to these rocky four machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they had drago the Russian guy,</v>

190
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 1>you're doing all this stuff and they got</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a music video soundtrack playing in</v>

191
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:22.851
<v Speaker 1>the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

192
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile you're just drinking beer,</v>

193
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 1>eating Nachos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Does it help live in Colorado?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

195
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:32.120
<v Speaker 1>you're at a good altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

196
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great altitude.</v>

197
00:09:33.381 --> 00:09:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it probably helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

198
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm right outside Denver so there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trails out my door.</v>

199
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.160
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my,</v>

200
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:45.161
<v Speaker 2>like everyday run is on trails climate </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the foothills of Colorado.</v>

201
00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:47.490
<v Speaker 2>So quite a bit of climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

202
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.410
<v Speaker 2>we're already at altitude so it's gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta help.</v>

203
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.580
<v Speaker 1>So talk me through your preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when did it start?</v>

204
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you sign up for this race?</v>

205
00:09:57.981 --> 00:09:59.600
<v Speaker 1>When did you know that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it?</v>

206
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I signed up in May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

207
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.490
<v Speaker 2>but I also was signed up for a 100 mile </v>
<v Speaker 2>race a month prior to Moab in,</v>

208
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.450
<v Speaker 2>so like mid September,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

209
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.480
<v Speaker 2>and so my preparation was mostly for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hundred mile race and then after </v>

210
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.630
<v Speaker 2>the hundred miler it was just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recover,</v>

211
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure my legs and body felt fresh </v>

212
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.241
<v Speaker 2>again and then got squeezed in a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>more weeks of solid training to get </v>

213
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:27.370
<v Speaker 2>ready for Moab.</v>

214
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because you say 100 miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide,</v>

215
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.550
<v Speaker 1>they ain't shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all relative because a marathon to </v>

216
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:41.391
<v Speaker 1>me would kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean you saying that you read 238 </v>

217
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:45.180
<v Speaker 1>miles and then a hundred mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound like much child's play.</v>

218
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 1>How long does it take you to run a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred miles?</v>

219
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually somewhere around 24 hours or</v>
<v Speaker 2>under depending on the trail and the </v>

220
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:55.670
<v Speaker 2>climbing and stuff.</v>

221
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.500
<v Speaker 1>So when you're getting ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

222
00:10:57.501 --> 00:11:01.080
<v Speaker 1>so you're preparing mostly for the 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile race and then it sort of recovery.</v>

223
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And then did the 100 mile race </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially get you in condition for the</v>

224
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:05.820
<v Speaker 1>2:40?</v>

225
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.850
<v Speaker 2>What I hoped is that it can be a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>springboard to the next one.</v>

226
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

227
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>is that condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a mental thing or are we talking</v>

228
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 1>about a physical thing and a mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

229
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I think both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

230
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:20.400
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your body is important.</v>

231
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 2>So like the physical aspect is important</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

232
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just being able to like pound your </v>

233
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 2>legs for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of time,</v>

234
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:33.630
<v Speaker 2>the amount of miles that you need to for</v>
<v Speaker 2>these races is physically learned.</v>

235
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.120
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of daily miles were you </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting in when you're getting ready for</v>

236
00:11:37.121 --> 00:11:37.700
<v Speaker 1>the 100?</v>

237
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I would average about 100 miles per </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

238
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.860
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not even too crazy.</v>

239
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.030
<v Speaker 2>That's not too crazy.</v>

240
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because my friend campaigns was trying </v>

241
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:52.600
<v Speaker 1>to do a marathon a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

242
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 1>he seems insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so cool.</v>

243
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Is that too much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

244
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing great with it.</v>

245
00:11:57.881 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

246
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.270
<v Speaker 1>keenan and a day later than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

247
00:12:03.271 --> 00:12:03.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it up.</v>

248
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.290
<v Speaker 1>You know what you should do like 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles a day buddy.</v>

249
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Speaker 2>It depends on people's bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some,</v>

250
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.420
<v Speaker 2>some people 100 miles per week is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their bodies can't sustain that and </v>

251
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 2>for some like campaigns he can do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon a day and,</v>

252
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.950
<v Speaker 2>and be in great physical form for it.</v>

253
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 1>But he's a meathead and I always wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love him,</v>

254
00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 1>but I say this with all due respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if like he pushes too hard.</v>

255
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe there's like a fine line </v>
<v Speaker 1>between there's like a point of </v>

256
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.891
<v Speaker 1>diminishing return perhaps know where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go so hard that you're kind of </v>

257
00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:42.181
<v Speaker 1>overtraining and even though you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain it really you get better </v>

258
00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:44.170
<v Speaker 1>performance out of being like a pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

259
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

260
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his training,</v>

261
00:12:47.811 --> 00:12:49.820
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's pretty.</v>

262
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.070
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty new to all these ultras as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

263
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

264
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Over the last few years he did the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>

265
00:12:55.401 --> 00:12:59.990
<v Speaker 1>200 last year is 205 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that in [inaudible] 78 hours.</v>

266
00:12:59.991 --> 00:13:03.740
<v Speaker 1>He actually did this race two hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker than you did the 205,</v>

267
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 1>which is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

268
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Probably because he's just humiliated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

269
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.300
<v Speaker 1>She beat me by a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

270
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 1>forget about the second place person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have taken a nice restful </v>

271
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.230
<v Speaker 1>eight hours sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten a fine meal at a restaurant,</v>

272
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.000
<v Speaker 1>had a glass of wine and took a shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brushed your teeth,</v>

273
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.640
<v Speaker 1>painted your toenails if you have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

274
00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Did they all fall off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

275
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Still got 10 cams all fall off there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes pictures of taped up,</v>

276
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.470
<v Speaker 1>like really disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

277
00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:44.471
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're recovering from something </v>

278
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:46.661
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long does it take before you feel </v>

279
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:46.661
<v Speaker 1>normal again?</v>

280
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after this one I felt like a human.</v>

281
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 2>So I finished Sunday night and I felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>human by Wednesday probably.</v>

282
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.040
<v Speaker 2>And got out for some jobs then like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday,</v>

283
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.040
<v Speaker 2>Saturday.</v>

284
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

285
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be done with jogging forever for</v>

286
00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:08.200
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so stupid.</v>

287
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I just take a car next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

288
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.860
<v Speaker 1>So like when you say you felt like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human again?</v>

289
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean by that?</v>

290
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those first couple of nights after I </v>

291
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.921
<v Speaker 2>don't sleep very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like everything is just on </v>

292
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:27.161
<v Speaker 2>overdrive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My legs are throbbing and uncomfortable </v>

293
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:29.270
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to turn your brain off as much</v>

294
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 2>as you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was finally like getting good </v>

295
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.841
<v Speaker 2>normal sleep by Wednesday and it Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 2>messed with my appetite for a couple of </v>

296
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:39.920
<v Speaker 2>days as well where food just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't.</v>

297
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.040
<v Speaker 2>It didn't sound that great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though I was like totally depleted </v>

298
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.040
<v Speaker 2>of nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

299
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.960
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be such a shock for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

300
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

301
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.380
<v Speaker 2>That's probably not good for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

302
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

303
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.570
<v Speaker 1>I say it can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you can be right because maybe</v>

304
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.600
<v Speaker 1>you're recovering and maybe when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover from that extreme exertion your </v>

305
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:07.001
<v Speaker 1>vitality ups because like there's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that say like,</v>

306
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I've read this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you take them out,</v>

307
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 1>if you'd run a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should take six months off.</v>

308
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I've read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually read that.</v>

309
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:19.931
<v Speaker 1>Like someone's recommendation and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes you six months to recover from </v>

310
00:15:19.931 --> 00:15:19.931
<v Speaker 1>marathon marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

311
00:15:19.931 --> 00:15:20.580
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who You fat?</v>

312
00:15:20.581 --> 00:15:23.420
<v Speaker 1>So really talking about who is saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

313
00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously there's people that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do more than you,</v>

314
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:30.660
<v Speaker 1>like people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are writing this stuff down </v>

315
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:30.660
<v Speaker 1>or silly because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

316
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>because cam can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he can run a marathon a day,</v>

317
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.910
<v Speaker 1>obviously he doesn't need six months off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've hung out with him after he's </v>

318
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.911
<v Speaker 1>done this and he's totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't seem like there's </v>

319
00:15:39.911 --> 00:15:39.911
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong with them.</v>

320
00:15:39.911 --> 00:15:43.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is like who are we </v>

321
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.441
<v Speaker 1>comparing to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who is our baseline is our </v>

322
00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:49.751
<v Speaker 1>baseline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a guy who barely works out or as </v>

323
00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:50.720
<v Speaker 1>our baseline you cause you're gonna get </v>
<v Speaker 1>two radically different results.</v>

324
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Kind of take those articles with a grain</v>
<v Speaker 1>of salt.</v>

325
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the thing.</v>

326
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 1>What I was saying to Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

327
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 1>well how do you know how much to train?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

328
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:03.911
<v Speaker 1>no one knows how much to train for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff because it's really just </v>

329
00:16:03.911 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 1>guesswork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the cool part,</v>

330
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:09.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a million pieces to </v>

331
00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 1>the puzzle of ultra running and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and figuring them out is part of the fun</v>

332
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:17.021
<v Speaker 1>of doing this sport now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has it been like for you after you </v>

333
00:16:17.021 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 1>won?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're a,</v>

334
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.260
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to so many people that </v>

335
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.050
<v Speaker 1>really have no interest normally in </v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance running and they've brought </v>

336
00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you up constantly.</v>

337
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like a superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

338
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it sounds crazy to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

339
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:34.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Brian Stevens,</v>

340
00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:39.701

<v Speaker 1>forth while this was going on and you </v>

341
00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:43.511

<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

349
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:56.861
<v Speaker 1>I've never been less productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going online and checking this </v>

350
00:16:56.861 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 1>thing constantly.</v>

354
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.210
<v Speaker 1>but I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you were successful.</v>

355
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.040
<v Speaker 1>You weren't bogged down by all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense that people just know and </v>

356
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.620
<v Speaker 1>social media nonsense could eat up a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your dad.</v>

357
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm still figuring it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't bother.</v>

358
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Just occasionally post things and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore everything else.</v>

359
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll just retweet it via.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just learning about that little </v>

360
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:29.810
<v Speaker 1>retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whenever they is.</v>

361
00:17:29.811 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>

362
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when you,</v>

363
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:39.170
<v Speaker 1>when you finished the race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is the feeling like when you </v>

364
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.240
<v Speaker 1>crossed the line and you look back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even see a person like you,</v>

365
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:46.241
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be able to see them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking binoculars like they are on the </v>

366
00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:47.510
<v Speaker 1>other side of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the curve of the earth.</v>

367
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 1>If you believe that the curve of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth</v>

368
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 4>is literally so far like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are beyond the curve.</v>

369
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 4>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

370
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty miles I would imagine you can't </v>

371
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.401
<v Speaker 4>see straight 20 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine 20 miles you might be </v>

372
00:18:04.401 --> 00:18:05.280
<v Speaker 4>able to see like the top of dudes head </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's like,</v>

373
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.480
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to have one of them crazy by </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows those your glass and you can </v>

374
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:11.480
<v Speaker 4>probably see him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

375
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.191
<v Speaker 4>if you're glassing glassing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what is that feeling like?</v>

376
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 4>It felt amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

377
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.000
<v Speaker 4>with the tracking system that we had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

378
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:27.530
<v Speaker 4>when I left the last aid station,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like 17 miles to go and it was </v>

379
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:32.931
<v Speaker 4>pretty much um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could see that it was certain that I </v>

380
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:38.601
<v Speaker 4>could get to the line first as long as I</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't like take a nap out there or </v>

381
00:18:38.601 --> 00:18:42.000
<v Speaker 4>become like physically incapable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you could take a nap.</v>

382
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 4>That was the thing.</v>

383
00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 4>You can take a nice one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just think about that.</v>

384
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.430
<v Speaker 4>Let me just take a nice nap here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

385
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 4>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five hour nap.</v>

386
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.150
<v Speaker 4>And you still have like five plus hours </v>
<v Speaker 4>ahead of everybody.</v>

387
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be nice.</v>

388
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was nice because we could,</v>

389
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.680
<v Speaker 4>I was running with my husband at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

390
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.700
<v Speaker 4>We could enjoy the trail and like not be</v>
<v Speaker 4>like super anxious about trying to be </v>

391
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 4>really efficient but just try and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>efficient on the course.</v>

392
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.690
<v Speaker 4>But then we saw that getting under 58 </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours was possible.</v>

393
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.930
<v Speaker 4>So then I got a little bee in my bonnet </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

394
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 4>about trying to push the pace a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit more.</v>

395
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 4>I've never really been a great phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh you should come to Minnesota.</v>

396
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:31.161
<v Speaker 4>We've got all sorts of good graces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So does your husband run the same kind </v>

397
00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:33.960
<v Speaker 4>of races that you run or did he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like hop in every now and then?</v>

398
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he runs 50 milers and 50 k's,</v>

399
00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:39.810
<v Speaker 4>so 31 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he didn't enter this race.</v>

400
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.590
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't.</v>

401
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.530
<v Speaker 4>He just kind of helped you along,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jumped in certain spots.</v>

402
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.620
<v Speaker 4>So how does he get these spots?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to drive all relaxed and if you</v>

403
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:53.390
<v Speaker 4>picture a 238 mile loop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

404
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.660
<v Speaker 4>he had to drive to all of the places on </v>
<v Speaker 4>this course.</v>

405
00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.680
<v Speaker 4>So maybe he spent the day in the car the</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of days in the car and I had a </v>

406
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fantastic crew of friends out there.</v>

407
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 4>And in these races you can have pacers </v>
<v Speaker 4>for certain sections.</v>

408
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.690
<v Speaker 4>So I could have a buddy run with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

409
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 4>who was fresh and like their brain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their eyes and their legs were.</v>

410
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm more alert to help me just keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>track of the course.</v>

411
00:20:17.761 --> 00:20:21.360
<v Speaker 4>Flags like staying on course and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

412
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.840
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're doing this for this </v>

413
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:26.840
<v Speaker 4>amount of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the total hours again?</v>

414
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.760
<v Speaker 4>Fifty rate under 58.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you're doing it for this amount </v>

415
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:31.860
<v Speaker 4>of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much sleep are you getting?</v>

416
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I slept 21 minutes.</v>

417
00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.000
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is so crazy.</v>

418
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.380
<v Speaker 4>That was two separate naps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like 10 and 10 and 11.</v>

419
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Really the one minute nap and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>

420
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.540
<v Speaker 4>The best sleep I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it really?</v>

421
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.150
<v Speaker 4>It really was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well just why did you get up though?</v>

422
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:01.900
<v Speaker 4>After a minute?</v>

423
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did the 20 minute nap </v>

424
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 2>intentionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I crawled in the back of our crew car.</v>

425
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 2>We had a sleeping bag back there and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to get some good rest after it was</v>

426
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:17.050
<v Speaker 2>like middle of the second night and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't sleep very well.</v>

427
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just really uncomfortable and </v>

428
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was still like pretty amped up so </v>

429
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.250
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't shut my brain off even though</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like becoming pretty delirious.</v>

430
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I left that aid station after </v>

431
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.641
<v Speaker 2>laying in the car for 20 minutes and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was on the trail with one of my good </v>

432
00:21:35.641 --> 00:21:39.571
<v Speaker 2>friends and Pacers and I was falling </v>
<v Speaker 2>asleep as I was running like Zig zagging</v>

433
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:42.700
<v Speaker 2>all over the trail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't keep my eyes open.</v>

434
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.120
<v Speaker 2>So at one point I was bent over and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like phase planning towards the </v>

435
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.880
<v Speaker 2>ground and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just laid down,</v>

436
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:51.460
<v Speaker 2>like take a nap right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right on the trail.</v>

437
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like laying down already snoring </v>

438
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:56.640
<v Speaker 2>as I'm like one minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one minute,</v>

439
00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.090
<v Speaker 2>wakes me up one minute later and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like more alert than I've ever been.</v>

440
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.130
<v Speaker 2>And then we were super pumped up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the time because we were like,</v>

441
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.390
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one minute nap.</v>

442
00:22:05.391 --> 00:22:10.391
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the craziest thing I've ever </v>

443
00:22:10.391 --> 00:22:10.880
<v Speaker 4>heard in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of people like,</v>

444
00:22:10.881 --> 00:22:12.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to Cam,</v>

445
00:22:12.801 --> 00:22:17.801
<v Speaker 4>I think he took us similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really short nap and it just like </v>

446
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:20.450
<v Speaker 4>rejuvenate's you in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

447
00:22:20.451 --> 00:22:23.060
<v Speaker 4>I've heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The like if you're really tired,</v>

448
00:22:23.061 --> 00:22:25.380
<v Speaker 4>a 20 minute nap will make a huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

449
00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.800
<v Speaker 4>If you could just lie down and I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>always ignored that.</v>

450
00:22:27.801 --> 00:22:30.320
<v Speaker 4>Like how is that gonna be better next </v>
<v Speaker 4>time?</v>

451
00:22:30.321 --> 00:22:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Try just one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm lazy.</v>

452
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.510
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would stay asleep when he woke you up </v>

453
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.860
<v Speaker 4>after one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will you like,</v>

454
00:22:39.861 --> 00:22:41.510
<v Speaker 4>why'd you wake me up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

455
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.700
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why'd you let me sleep so long?</v>

456
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:49.130
<v Speaker 4>It had been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it had been at least 30 </v>

457
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.130
<v Speaker 4>minutes and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

458
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.170
<v Speaker 4>we gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why'd you let me sleep so long?</v>

459
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.010
<v Speaker 4>It was like that was one minute one </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole minute ready go.</v>

460
00:22:55.011 --> 00:22:58.970
<v Speaker 4>And you were just out cold was cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I rem cycle like dreams and everything.</v>

461
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.160
<v Speaker 4>I remember them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

462
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.050
<v Speaker 4>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the deepest sleep.</v>

463
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what was cool is as I was laying on </v>

464
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.010
<v Speaker 4>the trail for one minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was dark and beautiful stars out and </v>

465
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.810
<v Speaker 4>there were elk bugling like up on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hill.</v>

466
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:18.470
<v Speaker 4>So it was cool that I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't hallucinate that that was real.</v>

467
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.980
<v Speaker 4>You hallucinate at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just had some hallucinations.</v>

468
00:23:21.981 --> 00:23:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you see?</v>

469
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the forest at night,</v>

470
00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:30.551
<v Speaker 2>everything just becomes something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there were tons of like faces and </v>

471
00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:33.380
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy playing a cello.</v>

472
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a leopard hanging out in a </v>

473
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.690
<v Speaker 2>hammock.</v>

474
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.820
<v Speaker 4>Vivid are these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean pretty like where I think they're</v>

475
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 4>real and I'm like waving at them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're waving at the Leopard in the </v>

476
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 4>Hammock?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

477
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.790
<v Speaker 4>I didn't wave to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I waved to the cello player.</v>

478
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:55.090
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But did you know he wasn't real as you </v>

479
00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:55.090
<v Speaker 4>were running by?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

480
00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean now that I've done these quite a </v>
<v Speaker 4>few times in the night,</v>

481
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 4>I usually see some things and so now </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like Kinda cool to acknowledge</v>

482
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:04.520
<v Speaker 4>that it's happening and try and </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember.</v>

483
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:07.940
<v Speaker 4>So I can tell my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell my friends afterwards.</v>

484
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.580
<v Speaker 1>So is there any part of you that thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

485
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:13.070
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy with a cello in the woods,</v>

486
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:14.920
<v Speaker 4>or is there</v>

487
00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:20.340
<v Speaker 1>just a recognition that you're freaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>out because you're running 58 miles or </v>

488
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:20.340
<v Speaker 1>58 hours?</v>

489
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.470
<v Speaker 4>I think just a recognition like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh,</v>

490
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.820
<v Speaker 4>guy with cello.</v>

491
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 1>So you're just so focused on what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that even the most bizarre thing,</v>

492
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 1>like a leopard in a hammock.</v>

493
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

494
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.790
<v Speaker 4>it just happens now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I know there's not actually one,</v>

495
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.110
<v Speaker 4>but how often does this take place?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

496
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.370
<v Speaker 4>how many of these have you done these </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultra marathons?</v>

497
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:48.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And did they start the hallucinations </v>

498
00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.690
<v Speaker 4>started in the early ones?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

499
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:53.730
<v Speaker 4>basically like my first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred milers where you go through the </v>

500
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.630
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always the nighttime where the </v>

501
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:57.630
<v Speaker 4>shadows just like play tricks on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

502
00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.960
<v Speaker 4>and so I'm like in the mountains of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Colorado and there's giraffes and like </v>

503
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.511
<v Speaker 4>flying eels and all sorts of weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>things and at first I was freaked out </v>

504
00:25:06.511 --> 00:25:07.410
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

505
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.490
<v Speaker 4>but now it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

506
00:25:09.491 --> 00:25:12.070
<v Speaker 4>that'll be a fun story to tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>

507
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Have you talked to a doctor or anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

508
00:25:14.851 --> 00:25:17.100
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to the mind when.</v>

509
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

510
00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I'd be fascinated to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is,</v>

511
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:26.090
<v Speaker 1>what's happening that's causing you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have these like extreme visual </v>

512
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.710
<v Speaker 1>hallucinations because you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>they looked real.</v>

513
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think it's just like shadows and </v>

514
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.481
<v Speaker 4>your brain is too tired to like process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it just jumbles them together into </v>

515
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.310
<v Speaker 4>something that would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

516
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not freaking you out.</v>

517
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:43.980
<v Speaker 4>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

518
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 4>cello guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey Man.</v>

519
00:25:45.501 --> 00:25:46.420
<v Speaker 4>Rock on dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

520
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.060
<v Speaker 4>thanks for the tunes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you hear him?</v>

521
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was just like silent including a </v>

522
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 4>child,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is creepy.</v>

523
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 4>It itself.</v>

524
00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the only hallucinations or was </v>

525
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:01.390
<v Speaker 1>there anything else weird</v>

526
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.140
<v Speaker 4>during this one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

527
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.200
<v Speaker 4>those were like the significant ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise,</v>

528
00:26:06.201 --> 00:26:10.760
<v Speaker 4>just a lot of like random faces on trees</v>
<v Speaker 4>or rocks and stuff like that.</v>

529
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.480
<v Speaker 4>Now</v>

530
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 1>as you're running right and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running for 50 whatever,</v>

531
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:19.781
<v Speaker 1>miles or 58 hours and you're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving forward because you're a point in</v>

532
00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:25.271
<v Speaker 1>time where your body like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what does it feel like de you look </v>

533
00:26:25.771 --> 00:26:29.120
<v Speaker 1>in constant pain or are you just numb to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

534
00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens?</v>

535
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Kinda,</v>

536
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:37.030
<v Speaker 4>you go in waves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you'll be riding this wave where </v>

537
00:26:37.051 --> 00:26:42.051
<v Speaker 4>you're just feeling like amazing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>really fresh and like your legs can </v>

538
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 4>cruise pretty well and nothing</v>

539
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 2>hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

540
00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:49.701
<v Speaker 2>everything's feeling really good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then that wave will eventually come </v>

541
00:26:49.701 --> 00:26:51.150
<v Speaker 2>crashing down where things are hurting </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

542
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:54.330
<v Speaker 2>And then you might be like whimpering </v>
<v Speaker 2>along for a little bit,</v>

543
00:26:54.331 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 2>but the cool part about these is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>those waves,</v>

544
00:26:57.421 --> 00:26:58.380
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

545
00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:00.840
<v Speaker 2>they always come and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go.</v>

546
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:03.390
<v Speaker 2>So you ride this like high and low the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole race.</v>

547
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when it gets really low,</v>

548
00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:11.001
<v Speaker 2>when you're feeling awful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have to remember that you're </v>

549
00:27:11.001 --> 00:27:13.470
<v Speaker 2>going to feel better again soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just got to keep chugging along.</v>

550
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.620
<v Speaker 2>So you're in pain and then somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another you feel better even though you </v>

551
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:18.620
<v Speaker 2>don't stop running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

552
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it work?</v>

553
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a switch flips or um,</v>

554
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.560
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'll like intentionally during</v>
<v Speaker 2>those lows take more calories in </v>

555
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 2>thinking maybe that will help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like give my body some something to</v>

556
00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 2>burn for awhile to make it happy again.</v>

557
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.270
<v Speaker 2>What kind of stuff can you eat while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running this much?</v>

558
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm in one this length.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a lot of um,</v>

559
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:46.610
<v Speaker 2>like water gatorade and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>this powder you can put in water called </v>

560
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.370
<v Speaker 2>tailwind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has electrolytes and 200 calories per</v>

561
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:55.371
<v Speaker 2>bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting in calories and then </v>

562
00:27:55.371 --> 00:27:58.320
<v Speaker 2>like normal athletic foods like honey </v>
<v Speaker 2>stinger products,</v>

563
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:03.350
<v Speaker 2>which are like gels and shoes and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I was eating boatloads of the </v>

564
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Cheese Chiesa Dia's at all the aid </v>
<v Speaker 2>stations.</v>

565
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.700
<v Speaker 2>They serve cheese case a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

566
00:28:11.701 --> 00:28:16.701
<v Speaker 2>It was like a whole buffet line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything you wanted were real about </v>

567
00:28:16.701 --> 00:28:16.860
<v Speaker 2>these aid stations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

568
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.760
<v Speaker 2>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

569
00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

570
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.600
<v Speaker 2>So you could eat cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>case ideas and just keep running.</v>

571
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would stop at each aid station,</v>

572
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>demolished a cheese Chiesa Dia,</v>

573
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 2>like hang out for just a second to let </v>
<v Speaker 2>my body reset and then keep cruising.</v>

574
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which normally I'm not very good at </v>

575
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 2>eating real food during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this just felt like too much.</v>

576
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:42.350
<v Speaker 1>There's Cam with the Bacon cheeseburger </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover you a blanket.</v>

577
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing.</v>

578
00:28:43.281 --> 00:28:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Like there's points in the race where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely cold.</v>

579
00:28:45.951 --> 00:28:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

580
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:51.510
<v Speaker 2>It got really cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we hit nine degrees on the </v>

581
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.510
<v Speaker 2>second night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are you wearing?</v>

582
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of jackets,</v>

583
00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:58.270
<v Speaker 2>like a windbreaker jacket and a rain </v>
<v Speaker 2>jacket and some gloves.</v>

584
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.060
<v Speaker 2>And like a headband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some pants,</v>

585
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.230
<v Speaker 2>nothing like absurd.</v>

586
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.280
<v Speaker 1>So just the fact that you're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving,</v>

587
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you stay fairly warm and the windbreaker</v>
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>

588
00:29:08.371 --> 00:29:08.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

589
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.780
<v Speaker 1>the rain jacket to stop rain or are from</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind.</v>

590
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Just layers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to like try and insulate </v>

591
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.850
<v Speaker 1>the body heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you eating those?</v>

592
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little waffle things,</v>

593
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 1>those bee stingers we've had them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

594
00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 1>that'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or awesome.</v>

595
00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:26.910
<v Speaker 1>So you're just trying to take in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the densest stuff,</v>

596
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 1>like sugars and cheese in case of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

597
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Just anything that would stay in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get nauseous and start </v>

598
00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:36.560
<v Speaker 2>losing it on the trail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

599
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Cam said he doesn't go to the bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire time.</v>

600
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't have to just food just </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes</v>

601
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.990
<v Speaker 4>in and just burn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

602
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Is that the case with youtube?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Question to ask women bring?</v>

603
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:54.390
<v Speaker 4>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he said he didn't poop for like </v>

604
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.110
<v Speaker 4>three days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's healthy cam.</v>

605
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 4>He's got a lot of healthy problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk to him.</v>

606
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 4>Maybe listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't listen to me.</v>

607
00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use the restroom while I was out </v>

608
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did You have to pee?</v>

609
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.210
<v Speaker 4>Was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy because I would think that </v>

610
00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:12.210
<v Speaker 4>you're sweating so much through would </v>
<v Speaker 4>just go right through your skin.</v>

611
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure the science of it for awhile I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was paying way too much,</v>

612
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:21.210
<v Speaker 4>like multiple times per mile and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has something to do with the amount </v>

613
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:24.370
<v Speaker 4>of salt that you're taking in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was another question I had.</v>

614
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 4>Do you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you taking salt tablets?</v>

615
00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:31.740
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't until I was having this problem</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it was like we got to try and </v>

616
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.850
<v Speaker 4>stop this [inaudible] that's not good </v>
<v Speaker 4>either to go as often.</v>

617
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Has that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

618
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.310
<v Speaker 4>So then I took some salt tabs or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever mills.</v>

619
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Did that clear it up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

620
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.510
<v Speaker 4>Now what are those like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what milligrams,</v>

621
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 4>how much salt you're actually taking in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

622
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.920
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>S,</v>

623
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:53.010
<v Speaker 4>s caps or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just a normal like you can buy </v>

624
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.310
<v Speaker 4>them at any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any athletic store.</v>

625
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this is just a little pill of salt.</v>

626
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.710
<v Speaker 4>I think it's mostly for runners </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>

627
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 4>That's all I've seen used them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you could.</v>

628
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.960
<v Speaker 4>You could probably have some if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted.</v>

629
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:08.800
<v Speaker 4>What's the thought process behind it </v>
<v Speaker 4>though?</v>

630
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:13.801
<v Speaker 4>The top processes that your body is </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing through all these minerals and </v>

631
00:31:13.801 --> 00:31:17.190
<v Speaker 4>the salt helps you retain water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what about other minerals?</v>

632
00:31:17.191 --> 00:31:19.780
<v Speaker 4>Do you have to take magnesium or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else were you doing that?</v>

633
00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:22.480
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know and I don't even really </v>
<v Speaker 4>know the,</v>

634
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:27.430
<v Speaker 4>the exact contents of that tailwind </v>
<v Speaker 4>powder that I was putting in.</v>

635
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 4>I know it has lots of electrolytes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that that's supposed to help,</v>

636
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:36.781
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not sure if it has some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other pieces that people need during </v>

637
00:31:36.781 --> 00:31:38.180
<v Speaker 4>these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now before the race gets started,</v>

638
00:31:38.181 --> 00:31:42.190
<v Speaker 4>do you hyperhydrate or you do drink a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ton of water to get ready or.</v>

639
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried.</v>

640
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing too crazy but crazy.</v>

641
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.810
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about food before the race?</v>

642
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.670
<v Speaker 4>You just eat like a pig and get ready?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

643
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.300
<v Speaker 4>no just normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just normal.</v>

644
00:31:55.301 --> 00:31:56.310
<v Speaker 4>Normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Natchez.</v>

645
00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:01.200
<v Speaker 4>Just normal beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like when your,</v>

646
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.420
<v Speaker 4>like as you're leaving like as ready,</v>
<v Speaker 4>set,</v>

647
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:09.421
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the state of mind you go into </v>

648
00:32:09.421 --> 00:32:12.720
<v Speaker 4>when you know that you're about to run </v>
<v Speaker 4>238 miles and kick everybody's ass?</v>

649
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.510
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was exciting,</v>

650
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.940
<v Speaker 4>it was this big adventure that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had high expectations of myself while </v>

651
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 4>at the same time having no expectations </v>
<v Speaker 4>of myself because I didn't know,</v>

652
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.000
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know how it was going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

653
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.510
<v Speaker 4>and I really wanted to just enjoy being </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there,</v>

654
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:36.511
<v Speaker 4>like moving my body with my feet for </v>
<v Speaker 4>multiple days was really exciting so I </v>

655
00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:39.180
<v Speaker 4>was pumped at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the beginning and um,</v>

656
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 4>spent those first</v>

657
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.060
<v Speaker 2>probably 50 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like running with various people through</v>

658
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:49.061
<v Speaker 2>the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like canyon walls just like </v>

659
00:32:49.061 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 2>towering on every side and just trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to enjoy that.</v>

660
00:32:51.141 --> 00:32:56.141
<v Speaker 2>Like this is just the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start to comprehend or think </v>

661
00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:58.490
<v Speaker 2>about like how far you have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to freak yourself out.</v>

662
00:32:58.491 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 2>So like just be right now.</v>

663
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 1>So you just sort of stay in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was trying to do.</v>

664
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just left foot,</v>

665
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:05.390
<v Speaker 1>right foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left foot,</v>

666
00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:07.230
<v Speaker 1>right foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

667
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:07.880
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

668
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:09.080
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

669
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Easy as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there ever a moment while you're </v>

670
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:14.170
<v Speaker 1>doing this where you want to stop</v>

671
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.160
<v Speaker 2>and quit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

672
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to quit.</v>

673
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

674
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I knew that the cutoff time was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was Tuesday night and so no matter what </v>

675
00:33:26.761 --> 00:33:31.761
<v Speaker 2>happened out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to make sure I'm finished </v>

676
00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:31.830
<v Speaker 2>this race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I was,</v>

677
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming in Tuesday night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if it meant I had to sleep for </v>

678
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.780
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many hours or multiple times or if I had</v>

679
00:33:39.781 --> 00:33:41.940
<v Speaker 2>to like death march my way around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>desert.</v>

680
00:33:41.941 --> 00:33:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Death March,</v>

681
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like slow.</v>

682
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

683
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a harsh way of looking at though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh sorry.</v>

684
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:52.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

685
00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:54.380
<v Speaker 1>don't apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

686
00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.550
<v Speaker 1>So I did notice that there were some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were still running,</v>

687
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you guys had finished.</v>

688
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after Cameron finished,</v>

689
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:07.361
<v Speaker 1>I stopped looking at the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time for quite a while and then I </v>

690
00:34:07.361 --> 00:34:09.170
<v Speaker 1>went like eight hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine hours later and I'm like,</v>

691
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are still running.</v>

692
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are warriors.</v>

693
00:34:12.881 --> 00:34:14.920
<v Speaker 2>They're so impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

694
00:34:14.921 --> 00:34:18.430
<v Speaker 2>they were out there putting on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>headlamp for the fifth night.</v>

695
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a long time to be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were,</v>

696
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:27.060
<v Speaker 2>it was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to hang around the finish line </v>

697
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:27.790
<v Speaker 2>and watched quite a few of those stuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

698
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

699
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:31.600
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the best parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleet and ice cream.</v>

700
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:32.830
<v Speaker 2>A drinking beer.</v>

701
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:40.350
<v Speaker 1>But did you think to yourself like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell did I finished so much </v>

702
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:42.110
<v Speaker 1>faster than anybody?</v>

703
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

704
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the heck are these people?</v>

705
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Like so incredible and still going </v>
<v Speaker 2>after.</v>

706
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think I'd be able to keep </v>

707
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.320
<v Speaker 2>pushing myself on that fourth day into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fourth night,</v>

708
00:34:57.321 --> 00:34:59.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's mentally really hard.</v>

709
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be.</v>

710
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do understand that you stopped.</v>

711

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

715

719
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:26.380
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you stop and you think about when </v>

720
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you reflect and you look back on it were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week past,</v>

722
00:35:27.181 --> 00:35:30.000
<v Speaker 1>it was about more than two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long ago was it?</v>

723
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one week.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's still.</v>

727
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:45.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm still working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just the whole adventure.</v>

728
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.790
<v Speaker 4>All the places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all the sites.</v>

729
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 4>I got to see the people that I got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet.</v>

730
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.310
<v Speaker 4>The fact that my feet carried me that </v>
<v Speaker 4>far.</v>

731
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:58.311
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm coming Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ron Solomon choose which ones and </v>

732
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.580
<v Speaker 4>they're called the sense ride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you tried them?</v>

733
00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.180
<v Speaker 4>I see you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got some Solomon's.</v>

734
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.840

<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

735
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:10.880
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

736
00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:16.350
<v Speaker 4>They're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a lot of grip when I'm not </v>

737
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.100
<v Speaker 4>wearing those vibrams or were those five</v>
<v Speaker 4>finger shoes too?</v>

738
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 4>I sort of alternate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do you run the.</v>

739
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.980
<v Speaker 4>You run the sidewalks in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are just running trails.</v>

740
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.640
<v Speaker 4>You run around here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

741
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.780
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

742
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:31.850
<v Speaker 4>But it's not like Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with altitude and a lot </v>

743
00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:31.850
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You also,</v>

744
00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:32.100
<v Speaker 4>you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't someone just die?</v>

745
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.710
<v Speaker 4>Some endurance guy just got bit by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rattlesnake near you?</v>

746
00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in Golden,</v>

747
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:37.200
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yelp,</v>

748
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 4>which is where I live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

749
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 4>What happened to that dude?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just really unfortunate.</v>

750
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:46.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't actually know the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was out on a trail,</v>

751
00:36:46.561 --> 00:36:51.400
<v Speaker 4>like it's a couple miles from my house </v>
<v Speaker 4>and got bit and had some like,</v>

752
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.990
<v Speaker 4>weird reaction to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he had help pretty quickly,</v>

753
00:36:55.210 --> 00:37:00.210
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and got to the hospital in pretty good </v>

754
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.721
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But unfortunately something about his </v>

755
00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:04.210
<v Speaker 4>body and that bite like wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

756
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I've thought rattlesnakes,</v>

757
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.150
<v Speaker 4>like you have a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

758
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.170
<v Speaker 4>usually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

759
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not good,</v>

760
00:37:12.901 --> 00:37:17.901
<v Speaker 4>but it's not good at few hours and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty much if you read anything about </v>

761
00:37:17.901 --> 00:37:20.850
<v Speaker 4>what to do after a rattle snake bite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things are wrong.</v>

762
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pretty much can't do anything.</v>

763
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.910
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't suck the venom out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't like slice it open and you</v>

764
00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:31.911
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just get to the hospital as calmly as </v>

765
00:37:31.911 --> 00:37:32.520
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't suck the venom out.</v>

766
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.150
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>

767
00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:37.850
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan Akroyd movie or he got like Venom is</v>

768
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 4>bought and he was telling someone to </v>
<v Speaker 4>suck the.</v>

769
00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.650
<v Speaker 4>Remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that.</v>

770
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:52.130
<v Speaker 4>But that word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're going to see it here and it's </v>

771
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.481
<v Speaker 4>like he's furiously typing because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why I remember it was because Sam</v>

772
00:37:55.471 --> 00:37:58.490
<v Speaker 4>kinison was mocking him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was mocking it,</v>

773
00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.710
<v Speaker 4>but they almost all had some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>feud back in the day anyway.</v>

774
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Well if he wasn't in city slickers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

775
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:05.670
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

776
00:38:05.671 --> 00:38:10.671
<v Speaker 4>that's why Sam Kinison was mocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got kicked off the original city </v>

777
00:38:10.671 --> 00:38:11.100
<v Speaker 4>slickers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was in it.</v>

778
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:16.340
<v Speaker 4>He was in the original cast and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't get along with somebody and they </v>

779
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 4>got rid of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

780
00:38:16.741 --> 00:38:18.520
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't have helped if he did suck </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in.</v>

781
00:38:18.521 --> 00:38:20.010
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people think that you should do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

782
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old wives' tale or something.</v>

783
00:38:22.891 --> 00:38:25.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say you're supposed to cut it,</v>

784
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.230
<v Speaker 4>cut it open and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to do that either.</v>

785
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.120
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you make a tourniquet?</v>

786
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.080
<v Speaker 4>I think that's actually a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

787
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the latest thing</v>

788
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I read that's the best to do is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a sharpie along circle where the </v>

789
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 3>bite is and mark the time and then like </v>
<v Speaker 3>every 20 minutes as you're.</v>

790
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 3>If you have to hike yourself out or like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to get somewhere to go get</v>

791
00:38:48.461 --> 00:38:51.310
<v Speaker 3>help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>circle it again 20 minutes later to show</v>

792
00:38:51.311 --> 00:38:56.311
<v Speaker 3>where the swelling has gotten to so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctors have a better idea of like </v>

793
00:38:56.311 --> 00:38:58.030
<v Speaker 3>how quickly it's moving through you.</v>

794
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I saw horrible thing online to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>young man got bit in his arm and his </v>

795
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 1>skin started to die and there's tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to die,</v>

796
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>necrosis.</v>

797
00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:14.730
<v Speaker 1>And so they had to do all these massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin graphs and just massive surgeries </v>

798
00:39:15.251 --> 00:39:20.251
<v Speaker 1>and it had essentially rotted down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bone and you can see like the bone </v>

799
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:21.760
<v Speaker 1>in his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was rough,</v>

800
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.830
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived.</v>

801
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've gone through more than 10</v>

802
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:28.620
<v Speaker 1>surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez.</v>

803
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awful.</v>

804
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.020
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't know the rattle snakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do that to you.</v>

805
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

807
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I killed one just a couple of weeks ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your bare hands stomped it.</v>

808
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stomped on every chance I get.</v>

809
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.010
<v Speaker 1>People say you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fuck them.</v>

810
00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if they're near my house like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

811
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have little kids like any rattle snake</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I saw him in Colorado.</v>

816
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen one out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw one in Santa Barbara actually.</v>

817
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.980
<v Speaker 1>That was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in Montecito,</v>

818
00:40:05.981 --> 00:40:10.981
<v Speaker 1>which is like this really nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>residential community and we're driving </v>

819
00:40:10.981 --> 00:40:11.770
<v Speaker 1>up the road and I saw what I thought was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a coyote.</v>

820
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.410
<v Speaker 1>The coyote would a tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

821
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just out on the street.</v>

822
00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Just out on a regular street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

823
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.700
<v Speaker 1>it was a big fucker to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can probably 70,</v>

824
00:40:21.701 --> 00:40:22.620
<v Speaker 1>80 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

825
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Those are scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

826
00:40:23.981 --> 00:40:26.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not big for a mountain lion.</v>

827
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:29.820
<v Speaker 1>They get to be like 1:15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really interesting on here as</v>

828
00:40:29.821 --> 00:40:34.000
<v Speaker 1>people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone here is so urbanized that their</v>

829
00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what a mountain lion </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

830
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.430
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

831
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.160
<v Speaker 1>they think it's the lion king.</v>

832
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.910
<v Speaker 1>There's this one that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a name too.</v>

833
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:47.911
<v Speaker 1>It's like p two or p 41 or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went on a killing rampage at an </v>

834
00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:54.121
<v Speaker 1>Alpaca farm and killed like 11 alpacas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and goats.</v>

835
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And doesn't even eat them.</v>

836
00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:01.830
<v Speaker 1>He just went on a rampage and this woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a depredation permit to kill it </v>

837
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:07.770
<v Speaker 1>because it's her Alpaca farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like this lion is just decided to </v>

838
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.520
<v Speaker 1>start fucking up or animals and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what she does for a living.</v>

839
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And she got all these death threats from</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal rights activists.</v>

840
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean like death threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she was terrified.</v>

841
00:41:16.661 --> 00:41:19.450
<v Speaker 1>So she decided not to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going to hire someone to kill this</v>

842
00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like if you love animals,</v>

843
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.510
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you want to stop the animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's murdering all her animals?</v>

844
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:27.900
<v Speaker 1>You fucking crazy assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

845
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.310
<v Speaker 1>it's not doing it for food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is unusual.</v>

846
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the apparently they have a reaction.</v>

847
00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:35.270
<v Speaker 1>They can get into a pen when there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of them in there.</v>

848
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.240
<v Speaker 1>They just can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

849
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:42.430
<v Speaker 1>they just can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just see them all there and they </v>

850
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 1>just Jack One and Jack the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wasn't even eating them.</v>

851
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.790
<v Speaker 1>He didn't eat any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

852
00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen one out on a run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've always got my eyes peeled.</v>

853
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.240
<v Speaker 1>It would be so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

854
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 1>they're terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're terrifying animals and you know,</v>

855
00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:58.181
<v Speaker 1>for the most part they're important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're an important part of the </v>

856
00:41:58.181 --> 00:42:00.821
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the weird thing about here is we've </v>

857
00:42:00.821 --> 00:42:04.301
<v Speaker 1>sort of sectioned off their habitat by </v>
<v Speaker 1>our highway system and so there's some </v>

858
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:10.331
<v Speaker 1>of them that are stuck in the Santa </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monica mountains and the genetic </v>

859
00:42:10.331 --> 00:42:13.241
<v Speaker 1>diversity is not very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually had a coyote expert on here </v>

860
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 1>who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he works for the,</v>

861
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.690
<v Speaker 1>what did he work for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

862
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:22.390
<v Speaker 1>what was the actual organization he </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked for far with.</v>

863
00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.290
<v Speaker 1>How was it</v>

864
00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.410
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of park ranger type fellow.</v>

865
00:42:31.411 --> 00:42:33.660
<v Speaker 1>A really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was telling us about,</v>

866
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that they have,</v>

867
00:42:35.461 --> 00:42:38.070
<v Speaker 1>like in Griffith Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a mount mine in Griffith Park,</v>

868
00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:43.460
<v Speaker 1>people jogging and ride their bikes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is just out there eating deer </v>

869
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.750
<v Speaker 1>all day long and they have to capture </v>
<v Speaker 1>him every couple of years.</v>

870
00:42:45.751 --> 00:42:48.920
<v Speaker 1>They have to dart him because his </v>
<v Speaker 1>collar,</v>

871
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

872
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.470
<v Speaker 1>the tracking device on his collar runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of batteries,</v>

873
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.530
<v Speaker 1>so every couple of years they've got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put the whack on this guy,</v>

874
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.410
<v Speaker 1>put them to sleep and repeat them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>

875
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want to relocate?</v>

876
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

877
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the good things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>California is that we don't have a lot </v>

878
00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.330
<v Speaker 1>of car accidents with deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

879
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.770
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very uncommon.</v>

880
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you said you're from Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota,</v>

881
00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota has a lot,</v>

882
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.010
<v Speaker 1>lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

883
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.920
<v Speaker 1>a lot of car accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

884
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And these places where they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>apex predators,</v>

885
00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:26.730
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot more.</v>

886
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have out there?</v>

887
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Like as far as you have wolves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota?</v>

888
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think like way north there's even </v>

889
00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:43.001
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's got to be Moose and you </v>

890
00:43:43.001 --> 00:43:43.001
<v Speaker 1>have mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota.</v>

891
00:43:43.001 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about any mountain lions </v>
<v Speaker 1>out here.</v>

892
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:49.901
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of coyotes which get the </v>

893
00:43:49.901 --> 00:43:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Fonz and then there's mountain lions </v>
<v Speaker 1>which decimate the deer.</v>

894
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.260
<v Speaker 1>So no car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few deer.</v>

895
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.940
<v Speaker 1>California is like a really low dear </v>
<v Speaker 1>densities state.</v>

896
00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a.</v>

897
00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:04.380
<v Speaker 1>there's good to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Northern Minnesota fighting cougars now </v>

898
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.230
<v Speaker 1>believed to be broadcast fighting each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

899
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.160
<v Speaker 1>They're up in a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

900
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.530
<v Speaker 1>that's a bobcat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's this tail?</v>

901
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:17.570
<v Speaker 1>This one is the one on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is that probably to hide some </v>

902
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 1>cardboard cutout to cut out the size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Cougar Mountain.</v>

903
00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:25.640
<v Speaker 1>My left is compared to the photograph of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a box,</v>

904
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.890
<v Speaker 1>just probably doing it for the photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

905
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

906
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Passing the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

907
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.290
<v Speaker 4>I saw a bobcat that I thought was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cougar.</v>

908
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 4>I saw a bobcat with the cubs and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

909
00:44:37.861 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the home ranch.</v>

910
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:41.860
<v Speaker 4>And I thought it was a cougar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

911
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.420
<v Speaker 4>Well I just saw the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like this big cat in the road and </v>

912
00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:47.420
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

913
00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.921
<v Speaker 4>Is that an outline?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we eventually figured out that </v>

914
00:44:51.921 --> 00:44:52.430
<v Speaker 4>it was a bobcat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get to a good size.</v>

915
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.850
<v Speaker 4>We do have bobcats soda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I got a question for you.</v>

916
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Can you talk about the run rabbit run </v>
<v Speaker 4>race you had that you won or that end?</v>

917
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.440
<v Speaker 4>I'll let her describe it because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds pretty crazy what happened.</v>

918
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:14.860
<v Speaker 4>So the hundred mile race that I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing a month before my lab at about 12 </v>

919
00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:21.321
<v Speaker 4>miles roughly to the finish line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my vision started blurring like in the </v>

920
00:45:21.321 --> 00:45:22.030
<v Speaker 4>periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

921
00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 4>and over the course of the next couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>of miles closed in until it was pure </v>

922
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 4>white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't see anything.</v>

923
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:34.850
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I just stumbled my way along roughly </v>

924
00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:37.170
<v Speaker 4>10 miles of trails to get to the finish </v>
<v Speaker 4>line.</v>

925
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.650
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much I would say like 98 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>blind.</v>

926
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:44.160
<v Speaker 4>I could see my feet like right in front </v>
<v Speaker 4>of my feet,</v>

927
00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:49.161
<v Speaker 4>but it was just white out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was running and falling everywhere.</v>

928
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 4>It was probably hilarious if people were</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching.</v>

929
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:56.570
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hit my head also on Iraq.</v>

930
00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.070
<v Speaker 4>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

931
00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.530
<v Speaker 4>one of the Times I fell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had blood dripping down my face,</v>

932
00:46:01.531 --> 00:46:05.430
<v Speaker 4>like stumbling along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally couldn't see the trail.</v>

933
00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.020
<v Speaker 4>Still one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

934
00:46:07.021 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Managed to finish and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hold the lead.</v>

935
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.510
<v Speaker 4>You're a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give seminars on how to be a savage.</v>

936
00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.700
<v Speaker 4>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>

937
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 4>what did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened to your vision?</v>

938
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so since then there's been tons of </v>

939
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.890
<v Speaker 4>people kind of talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it happens in an ultra is </v>

940
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.150
<v Speaker 4>quite often they are thinking it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>corneal edema.</v>

941
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:31.290
<v Speaker 4>So basically like I wear contact lenses </v>
<v Speaker 4>to see,</v>

942
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:36.470
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the like contact mixed with the air </v>

943
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:41.301
<v Speaker 4>and the dryness and all sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause like a kind of fluid or I'm not </v>

944
00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:46.941
<v Speaker 4>really sure how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever thought about getting Lasik or </v>

945
00:46:46.941 --> 00:46:47.460
<v Speaker 4>something?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who have done lasik also get this</v>

946
00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:51.950
<v Speaker 4>corneal edema.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for now I'm just a stay in,</v>

947
00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:57.090
<v Speaker 4>stay in with the context because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been learning how to deal with </v>

948
00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:00.531
<v Speaker 4>those a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did that concern you at all when you </v>

949
00:47:00.531 --> 00:47:03.650
<v Speaker 4>were about to run 238 miles?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

950
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 4>I really didn't want to go blind again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

951
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.500
<v Speaker 4>But I actually had that course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

952
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:11.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right off a cliff.</v>

953
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:18.560
<v Speaker 4>I was using eye drops just like get some</v>
<v Speaker 4>like tears going in there.</v>

954
00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:24.980
<v Speaker 4>And I wore glasses for this whole race </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Moab because that's supposed to help </v>

955
00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:29.901
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grit from now when you back and you won</v>

956
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 1>that race and you were basically almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind,</v>

957
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take for your vision to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover?</v>

958
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six hours.</v>

959
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

960
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

961
00:47:38.381 --> 00:47:40.930
<v Speaker 1>that must have been a relief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a relief.</v>

962
00:47:40.931 --> 00:47:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty sick of it.</v>

963
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:47.341
<v Speaker 1>By the time I finished we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you concerned that it could be </v>

964
00:47:47.341 --> 00:47:47.341
<v Speaker 1>potentially permanent?</v>

965
00:47:47.341 --> 00:47:47.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't feel permanent.</v>

966
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:52.861
<v Speaker 3>It felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think because it went white and </v>

967
00:47:52.861 --> 00:47:55.030
<v Speaker 3>because it like moved in slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like topical.</v>

968
00:47:55.031 --> 00:47:55.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

969
00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really consider while I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>racing if it was permanent,</v>

970
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:04.111
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amped on finishing the race at that </v>

971
00:48:04.111 --> 00:48:04.111
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

972
00:48:04.111 --> 00:48:08.020
<v Speaker 3>but once I finished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one seemed overly concerned about it.</v>

973
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Like we went to the hospital and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were more concerned with checking </v>

974
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:13.180
<v Speaker 3>out my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

975
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.800
<v Speaker 3>so it didn't feel like that urgent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

976
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:17.860
<v Speaker 3>But it was weird.</v>

977
00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you think about quitting?</v>

978
00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:25.310
<v Speaker 1>No Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you're blind and you got a </v>

979
00:48:25.651 --> 00:48:29.170
<v Speaker 1>concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked like carried night.</v>

980
00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what the hell?</v>

981
00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hit my head and it thunked pretty </v>

982
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.040
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was liquid dripping on my</v>

983
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:42.041
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I put my hand up to touch it and I </v>

984
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:43.640
<v Speaker 3>couldn't see my hand in front of my face</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see if it was blood or not.</v>

985
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea.</v>

986
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.570
<v Speaker 3>What is this course like you're running </v>
<v Speaker 3>on?</v>

987
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:50.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in steamboat Colorado,</v>

988
00:48:50.151 --> 00:48:55.151
<v Speaker 3>so mountains and I'm pretty rough trails</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this section where I fell.</v>

989
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

990
00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:02.120
<v Speaker 3>But the last six miles of the race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you finally get to like a fire road.</v>

991
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 3>So a little bit wider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little more room for error if you go </v>

992
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 3>crooked.</v>

993
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 1>That's just so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>

994
00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.380
<v Speaker 1>how are you knowing where to stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>

995
00:49:12.381 --> 00:49:15.980
<v Speaker 1>you're just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a picture of the course.</v>

996
00:49:15.981 --> 00:49:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're running that course blind?</v>

997
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Well that sections quite a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical than the section I went blind </v>

998
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.530
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say technical,</v>

999
00:49:24.531 --> 00:49:27.710
<v Speaker 1>what exactly do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like big rocks and cliffs,</v>

1000
00:49:27.711 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing I wanted to be,</v>

1001
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.560
<v Speaker 1>why would that be technical?</v>

1002
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:32.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1003
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 3>that's just the word that I associate </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like trickier trail,</v>

1004
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.330
<v Speaker 1>like you have to be more used technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're saying?</v>

1005
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I've heard that term before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I always ask like,</v>

1006
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:45.550
<v Speaker 1>people talk about like technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrain,</v>

1007
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:46.350
<v Speaker 1>like do you know,</v>

1008
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the root word for it.</v>

1009
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess you just can't just flat out </v>
<v Speaker 1>just huff it.</v>

1010
00:49:54.211 --> 00:49:55.890
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1011
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Like your foot placement is critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit tricky.</v>

1012
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Kind of looking down a lot while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

1013
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.360
<v Speaker 1>You can't just run straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1014
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1015
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.200
<v Speaker 1>because most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're running on a flat trail,</v>

1016
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of looking ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're assuming the road is going to be </v>

1017
00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:14.841
<v Speaker 1>the same with the left foot as it is for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right foot and the left say that </v>

1018
00:50:14.841 --> 00:50:14.841
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1019
00:50:14.841 --> 00:50:17.430
<v Speaker 1>you can't right now when you do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

1020
00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you got to constantly looked down.</v>

1021
00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:24.561
<v Speaker 1>That is when I would be concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like mountain lions or something like </v>

1022
00:50:24.561 --> 00:50:24.561
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1023
00:50:24.561 --> 00:50:24.561
<v Speaker 1>because you're not looking.</v>

1024
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:29.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they probably think you're to get </v>

1025
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:29.730
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>

1026
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:29.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1027
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1028
00:50:30.161 --> 00:50:33.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure if you end up seeing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain lion,</v>

1029
00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 4>it's already too late for you.</v>

1030
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about that kid in Alaska?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got eaten by a bear and a race.</v>

1031
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unfortunate.</v>

1032
00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Called his mom to call this mom before </v>

1033
00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.101
<v Speaker 1>the bear attacked him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bear that's following </v>

1034
00:50:49.101 --> 00:50:49.101
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1035
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:50.160
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1036
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean animals are a real part of it out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1037
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.420
<v Speaker 4>There was also a guy who was jogging </v>
<v Speaker 4>along,</v>

1038
00:50:56.421 --> 00:51:00.440
<v Speaker 4>minding his own business and a hawk came</v>
<v Speaker 4>and tried to swoop him,</v>

1039
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:05.470
<v Speaker 4>scoop his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had scratches across his whole head </v>

1040
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:06.960
<v Speaker 4>from the talents of this hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1041
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.670
<v Speaker 4>Pull up that picture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.720
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the Hawk thought he was food,</v>

1043
00:51:14.721 --> 00:51:17.000
<v Speaker 4>so he was going to grab them and bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>them to the nest.</v>

1044
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:22.300
<v Speaker 4>Gangster Hawk was this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that little thing like a,</v>

1045
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:24.460
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an an adult.</v>

1046
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:25.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure</v>

1047
00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:30.530
<v Speaker 1>if a hawk landed on my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you I'm going to have a </v>

1048
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:33.231
<v Speaker 1>stuffed hawking here right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have that fucker and I'm </v>

1049
00:51:33.231 --> 00:51:36.290
<v Speaker 1>going to have like a plastic hand around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neck.</v>

1050
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Fucking assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have hawks in my yard all the time.</v>

1051
00:51:40.451 --> 00:51:43.020
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get my chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

1052
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I think they got one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them went missing and we're </v>

1053
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1054
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

1055
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:54.800
<v Speaker 1>That's from the the whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Escaped Harris Hawks are attacking </v>

1056
00:51:55.861 --> 00:51:59.040
<v Speaker 1>runners and walkers prompting fears </v>
<v Speaker 1>there now breeding in Britain.</v>

1057
00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an England.</v>

1058
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a huge gap for people who are </v>

1059
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:08.550
<v Speaker 1>just listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking like 11,</v>

1060
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.320
<v Speaker 1>12 inch gash is on this guy's head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole head.</v>

1061
00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 1>His whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole top of his head is like a </v>

1062
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 1>track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like train tracks,</v>

1063
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.780
<v Speaker 1>like two straight lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a cool scar.</v>

1064
00:52:18.781 --> 00:52:20.660
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make the beautiful scar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1065
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.890
<v Speaker 1>What happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gangster Shit.</v>

1066
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he did.</v>

1067
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:28.320
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my.</v>

1068
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.380
<v Speaker 1>This hawk is trying to take me away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1069
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:35.100
<v Speaker 1>did someone help me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the hawk.</v>

1070
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:36.900
<v Speaker 1>That one looks too small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris Hawk.</v>

1071
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So this is an escaped hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying.</v>

1072
00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:44.840
<v Speaker 1>So is this a hawk that like essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a captive hawk and now they got </v>

1073
00:52:46.231 --> 00:52:51.231
<v Speaker 1>loose and they don't know how to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do and maybe </v>

1074
00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:56.030
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it liked thought this guy was a </v>

1075
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.000
<v Speaker 1>give it a shot.</v>

1076
00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:01.920
<v Speaker 4>I recall hearing what I now know is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bird's wings flapping behind my head and</v>

1077
00:53:01.921 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 4>then suddenly just tell him.</v>

1078
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no warning.</v>

1079
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:08.120
<v Speaker 1>She thought it was a mugging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought he got mugged.</v>

1080
00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy bird.</v>

1081
00:53:11.841 --> 00:53:14.180
<v Speaker 1>The bird thinking they could kill a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1082
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

1083
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:20.800
<v Speaker 1>That is like gangster burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Escaped bird attacking human.</v>

1084
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that again real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you say?</v>

1085
00:53:25.591 --> 00:53:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Whilst the attacker was originally </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought to be a buzzard,</v>

1086
00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.990
<v Speaker 1>no one had become aggressive during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nesting season.</v>

1087
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Experts pointed out the native birds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prey seldom strike in the summer months.</v>

1088
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris Hawk.</v>

1089
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

1090
00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:45.340
<v Speaker 1>those things that the claws and those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about eagles the </v>

1091
00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:45.340
<v Speaker 1>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like imagine like a,</v>

1092
00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:49.820
<v Speaker 1>something that can swoop down and grab a</v>
<v Speaker 1>salmon out of a river and fly off with </v>

1093
00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.750
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ridiculous things they have at the</v>

1094
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 1>bottom of their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pick up like small deer and stuff.</v>

1095
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can.</v>

1096
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:59.860
<v Speaker 1>The Mongols use them to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

1098
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.700
<v Speaker 1>attack wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1099
00:54:01.701 --> 00:54:06.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have trained eagles that they </v>

1100
00:54:06.701 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 1>swooped down and they grab wolves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed the wolves.</v>

1101
00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 1>They drop them from the Pi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just kill them.</v>

1102
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.990
<v Speaker 1>They kill them with their talents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their towns are so strong.</v>

1103
00:54:12.991 --> 00:54:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like knives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just grab a hold her neck and stick</v>

1104
00:54:15.931 --> 00:54:18.660
<v Speaker 1>the towns into the side of the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to watch.</v>

1105
00:54:18.661 --> 00:54:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these aren't big wolves.</v>

1106
00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:23.040
<v Speaker 1>These are like coyote size wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>

1107
00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:24.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1108
00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:29.020
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this thing just trying to run </v>

1109
00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:29.190
<v Speaker 1>away and this eagle just knows what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1110
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Swoops down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just grabs him by the neck and wrestle </v>

1111
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:36.881
<v Speaker 1>them to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the Mongolian guys come over </v>

1112
00:54:36.881 --> 00:54:36.881
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can watch it here.</v>

1113
00:54:36.881 --> 00:54:41.600
<v Speaker 1>So they're trained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See they have those little strings </v>

1114
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:41.670
<v Speaker 1>coming off the back of your legs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's wolves like fuck.</v>

1115
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And so this dude just releases the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eagle.</v>

1116
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 1>The Eagle swoops down and just death </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the sky.</v>

1117
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Just Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to think that this was </v>

1118
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.700
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they trained these things to do this </v>

1119
00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.491
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they would kill the wolves and </v>

1120
00:55:01.491 --> 00:55:05.061
<v Speaker 1>take their skins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they like make jackets or </v>

1121
00:55:05.061 --> 00:55:08.361
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Wolf knows what's going on too and </v>

1122
00:55:08.361 --> 00:55:08.361
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so much bigger than the eagle.</v>

1123
00:55:08.361 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really crazy because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>does an ego way,</v>

1124
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:11.880
<v Speaker 1>like 20 pounds or something like that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran a little faster there.</v>

1125
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:16.950
<v Speaker 1>This tired ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are though.</v>

1126
00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved birds.</v>

1127
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even a huge bird is a fraction of </v>

1128
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the size of that wolf and then just </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding them down.</v>

1129
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Then we expand freaks it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think.</v>

1130
00:55:29.551 --> 00:55:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a superior murdering </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

1131
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:32.850
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1132
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I think like when it comes to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature's killers,</v>

1133
00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:39.290
<v Speaker 1>eagles are just far superior to a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

1134
00:55:39.291 --> 00:55:40.960
<v Speaker 1>they have air on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1135
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.990
<v Speaker 1>they swooped down on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is cool.</v>

1136
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They moved through three d space,</v>

1137
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a whole different thing.</v>

1138
00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:49.290
<v Speaker 1>So did they ever get your chickens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1139
00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I know that a hawk has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we'd know.</v>

1140
00:55:52.081 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I saw a coyote get one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a coyote run over the fence with a</v>

1141
00:55:55.441 --> 00:56:00.441
<v Speaker 1>chicken in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting with my wife and my kids </v>

1142
00:56:00.441 --> 00:56:03.411
<v Speaker 1>were playing some game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like monopoly or some shit and we look </v>

1143
00:56:03.411 --> 00:56:06.231
<v Speaker 1>out the window and I see a coyote </v>
<v Speaker 1>running through the backyard with a </v>

1144
00:56:06.231 --> 00:56:08.841
<v Speaker 1>chicken in his mouth and he just hops </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fence and I opened the door just to </v>

1145
00:56:08.841 --> 00:56:09.760
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucker like that.</v>

1146
00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:14.810
<v Speaker 1>He was gone and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very complicated scenario </v>

1147
00:56:16.561 --> 00:56:19.920
<v Speaker 1>because he actually had talked my dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to helping him.</v>

1148
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:20.990
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1149
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a pretty sure it was girl</v>

1150
00:56:23.321 --> 00:56:25.520
<v Speaker 1>coyote and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dog.</v>

1152
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:32.400
<v Speaker 1>have a big dumb dog and he thought that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this Murphy wants to play with the </v>

1153
00:56:32.441 --> 00:56:34.960
<v Speaker 1>triggers and told help them because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog can.</v>

1154
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:38.680
<v Speaker 1>My dog is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a nice dog to people,</v>

1155
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:44.040
<v Speaker 1>but he's not nice to chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's murdered a few chickens in the </v>

1156
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.040
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

1157
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I think so far he's killed six of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens.</v>

1158
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1159
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:50.500
<v Speaker 1>he broke into the fence recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I talked about this.</v>

1160
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:54.020
<v Speaker 1>We were outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1161
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had heard something.</v>

1162
00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:02.280
<v Speaker 1>We heard these chickens squawking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>making up all this noise and I look and </v>

1163
00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is the dog in the chicken coop?</v>

1164
00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:07.360
<v Speaker 1>He clawed through the chicken wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a massive,</v>

1165
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:12.390
<v Speaker 1>he's a big man and he's just smash the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken wire enough so he could get his </v>

1166
00:57:12.851 --> 00:57:17.851
<v Speaker 1>body in there and just went on a rampage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just was murdering and chickens.</v>

1167
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.910
<v Speaker 1>See just their instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1169
00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:26.310
<v Speaker 1>they just can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like a friend of mine said that he </v>

1170
00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:30.991
<v Speaker 1>had a dog that did that once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed his chicken and he took the </v>

1171
00:57:30.991 --> 00:57:35.041
<v Speaker 1>dead chicken and tied it on the dog's </v>
<v Speaker 1>head and then chained the dog to a tree </v>

1172
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:37.450
<v Speaker 1>and left him there for a couple hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1173
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:42.990
<v Speaker 1>he said it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said the dog never fucked with the </v>

1174
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:44.990
<v Speaker 1>chickens again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

1175
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to try that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1176
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:48.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1177
00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.530
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my golden retriever,</v>

1178
00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 1>he's a sweetheart and I think he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed the chicken too.</v>

1179
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he killed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he showed up with one in his mouth </v>

1180
00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:02.130
<v Speaker 1>and it was dead and we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out if he killed it or if it was </v>

1181
00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:02.130
<v Speaker 1>already dead because sometimes they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

1182
00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.250
<v Speaker 1>She because we don't like to think he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid.</v>

1183
00:58:04.251 --> 00:58:07.900
<v Speaker 1>He's still a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he might've died two dogs,</v>

1184
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.610
<v Speaker 1>just dogs and chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1185
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a classic relationship now.</v>

1186
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how we got on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1187
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:16.030
<v Speaker 1>runners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals.</v>

1188
00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>

1189
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever bring any sort of first aid </v>

1190
00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:23.290
<v Speaker 1>with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you bring like a backpack when you're</v>

1191
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 1>running?</v>

1192
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on where I'm going or how </v>

1193
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 3>long I intend to be out there.</v>

1194
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:34.910
<v Speaker 1>So like when you're running moab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you bring any sort of a backpack or </v>

1195
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.910
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>

1196
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a pack that was carrying water and</v>

1197
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:41.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm like an emergency blanket and jacket</v>
<v Speaker 3>just in case and food.</v>

1198
00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 3>So when you have an emergency blanket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that one of those thin like sort of a</v>

1199
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:50.030
<v Speaker 3>silvery blankets just folds down into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very small those really work?</v>

1200
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean fortunately I've never had to use</v>

1201
00:58:53.851 --> 00:58:56.330
<v Speaker 3>one and an actual emergency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1202
00:58:56.340 --> 00:59:01.320
<v Speaker 3>you know how after marathons they give </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone like a tin foil wrap basically.</v>

1203
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the same thing where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like holding in your body heat.</v>

1204
00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:08.730
<v Speaker 3>So if worse comes to worse out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got something to,</v>

1205
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.190
<v Speaker 3>to help you get through it rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1206
00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:12.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1207
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were running a new drinking </v>

1208
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:17.600
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

1209
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.050
<v Speaker 1>do you have bottles of water or do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a hydration bladder in a tube?</v>

1210
00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you run it?</v>

1211
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 3>The guy was using has bottles</v>

1212
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.330
<v Speaker 1>so it can carry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at one point I had two and a half</v>

1213
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:30.200
<v Speaker 1>liters of water with me for like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hot long section.</v>

1214
00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:35.210
<v Speaker 1>How long did that last?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before I made it last for 20 miles.</v>

1215
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1216
00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Two and a half liter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a tiny amount of water to </v>

1217
00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:43.990
<v Speaker 1>drink for 20 miles of running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1218
00:59:43.991 --> 00:59:44.680
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1219
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was a really hot,</v>

1220
00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:48.920
<v Speaker 3>exposed day out there in the desert.</v>

1221
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been running like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim was telling me that he did the big </v>

1222
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:57.781
<v Speaker 1>foot 200 and there was a stretch where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he miscalculated and you realize that </v>

1223
00:59:57.781 --> 01:00:01.381
<v Speaker 1>terrain and he didn't have any water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You to go for several hours with no </v>

1224
01:00:01.381 --> 01:00:02.180
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done that before?</v>

1225
01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:04.170
<v Speaker 3>That's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1226
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:06.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I've ever had to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>several hours,</v>

1227
01:00:06.671 --> 01:00:09.310
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten to the point where it's like</v>

1228
01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:14.650
<v Speaker 3>miles and miles away still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're fresh out of water.</v>

1229
01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:16.900
<v Speaker 3>So that's got suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1230
01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:17.390
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1231
01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:22.410
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of a performance hit does that </v>

1232
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:22.410
<v Speaker 3>take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it depends.</v>

1233
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:26.570
<v Speaker 3>Like also it can take a big toll out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you mentally if you stress out about it </v>

1234
01:00:26.861 --> 01:00:28.240
<v Speaker 3>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're just like,</v>

1235
01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:33.420
<v Speaker 3>well this is the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only solution is to get to the next </v>

1236
01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:33.430
<v Speaker 3>aid station.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

1237
01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:37.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is just a blip on the radar.</v>

1238
01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.530
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting approach</v>

1239
01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:44.690
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I wanted to get to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how it transcends and how your,</v>

1240
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mental fortitude sort of like how </v>

1241
01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.051
<v Speaker 1>it manifests itself in everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your ability to just deal with shit</v>

1242
01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>is so superior to the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you hear people complain like </v>

1243
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>starbucks is out of fucking Venti lattes</v>
<v Speaker 1>is such bullshit,</v>

1244
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no more Combo macchiatos like </v>

1245
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>normal everyday complaining stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what a lot of people sort of engage</v>

1246
01:01:11.071 --> 01:01:16.071
<v Speaker 1>in sort of a recreation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people love to complain about </v>

1247
01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:16.071
<v Speaker 1>nonsense,</v>

1248
01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:16.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1249
01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Well how do you deal with that to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own?</v>

1250
01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:23.520
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just let it happen.</v>

1251
01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.100
<v Speaker 3>If that Venti Latte was going to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>your day,</v>

1252
01:01:26.101 --> 01:01:28.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm really sorry that they're out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1253
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>but there's got to be a part of you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes like how.</v>

1254
01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people are just really very weak</v>

1255
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>in terms of their ability to overcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversity.</v>

1256
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:44.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they just aren't giving </v>

1257
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:47.281
<v Speaker 3>themselves enough credit and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all capable of way more than we </v>

1258
01:01:47.681 --> 01:01:51.160
<v Speaker 3>think we are if we just like jump in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>go for it,</v>

1259
01:01:51.161 --> 01:01:52.150
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

1260
01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think like you realize that </v>

1261
01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:00.121
<v Speaker 1>more the more you push yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do you understand yourself more </v>

1262
01:02:00.121 --> 01:02:00.121
<v Speaker 1>after running 200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

1263
01:02:00.121 --> 01:02:00.400
<v Speaker 1>eight miles?</v>

1264
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1265
01:02:02.671 --> 01:02:04.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to like find my physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>boundary.</v>

1266
01:02:04.891 --> 01:02:07.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to find the mental boundary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where,</v>

1267
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:12.620
<v Speaker 3>where can I take this and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn about myself and about the world </v>

1268
01:02:12.661 --> 01:02:14.550
<v Speaker 3>and meet people along the way.</v>

1269
01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I think that that must give you immense </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence to overcome bound obstacles.</v>

1270
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:25.041
<v Speaker 1>Boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that you can do what you </v>

1271
01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:28.071
<v Speaker 1>can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can just put your mind into </v>

1272
01:02:28.071 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>this state of just dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant grime.</v>

1273
01:02:30.451 --> 01:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>You're falling asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're half blind.</v>

1274
01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean the site is more than half blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>98 percent of blind.</v>

1275
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:39.390

1326
01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:57.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1327
01:04:57.930 --> 01:04:58.130
<v Speaker 4>directing she can't run the $200,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she definitely,</v>

1328
01:04:58.131 --> 01:05:00.770
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could wish I could run with you</v>
<v Speaker 4>courtney.</v>

1329
01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:04.370
<v Speaker 4>She does a lot of a 100 mile races and </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1330
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:05.480
<v Speaker 4>it was a great runner.</v>

1331
01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.000
<v Speaker 1>500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is next level.</v>

1332
01:05:09.001 --> 01:05:11.010
<v Speaker 1>What is the longest anybody has ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>run?</v>

1333
01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the longest race ever?</v>

1334
01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1335
01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

1336
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:23.190
<v Speaker 4>So there's races that are called six day</v>
<v Speaker 4>races and it's just on a small loop and </v>

1337
01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:29.101
<v Speaker 4>you try and go as far as you can do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>loop as many times as you can in six </v>

1338
01:05:29.101 --> 01:05:33.301
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not actually sure what the </v>

1339
01:05:33.301 --> 01:05:36.031
<v Speaker 4>record for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm certain that it's higher than </v>

1340
01:05:36.031 --> 01:05:38.820
<v Speaker 4>2:38.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when she's talking about a 500,</v>

1341
01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.950
<v Speaker 4>3000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 mile race,</v>

1342
01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:43.570
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Relay race.</v>

1343
01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.880
<v Speaker 4>But marathon team look up six day are </v>
<v Speaker 4>world record.</v>

1344
01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:54.790
<v Speaker 4>Welcome to the 21st annual self </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcendence,</v>

1345
01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:56.350
<v Speaker 4>3,100</v>
<v Speaker 4>mile race.</v>

1346
01:05:56.351 --> 01:05:58.030
<v Speaker 4>You know why they said the self </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcendence?</v>

1347
01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.120
<v Speaker 4>Because after 2000 miles you run with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

1348
01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:07.060
<v Speaker 4>He's literally with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You transcend your running on air.</v>

1349
01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifty two days.</v>

1350
01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Fifty two days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They must log an average of 59 point six</v>

1351
01:06:16.691 --> 01:06:18.600
<v Speaker 4>miles a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking wait.</v>

1352
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.410
<v Speaker 4>I think this is the one in New York.</v>

1353
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:23.410
<v Speaker 4>It's just around like a city block in </v>
<v Speaker 4>New York or something.</v>

1354
01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:28.530
<v Speaker 4>The runners begin 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>AM and run for extended periods </v>

1355
01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:28.660
<v Speaker 4>throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taking breaks as needed.</v>

1356
01:06:28.661 --> 01:06:31.200
<v Speaker 4>If they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can continue as late as 12 midnight</v>

1357
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:35.050
<v Speaker 4>when the course closes for the night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

1358
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty cool.</v>

1359
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the community has got to be a very </v>

1360
01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.790
<v Speaker 4>strange community of like ironed willed </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings.</v>

1361
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.550

<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

1367
01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean I just like to find other human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings that are capable of putting their</v>

1368
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:12.380
<v Speaker 4>mind and their body into that position </v>

1375
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.980

<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>

1376
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:38.050
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about how much they win when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they fucking play golf.</v>

1377
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:43.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're knocked a ball in the whole way </v>

1378
01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:43.350
<v Speaker 4>to go fatso.</v>

1379
01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:50.170
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't impress me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you do is like,</v>

1380
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:55.230
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like it's massively </v>
<v Speaker 4>underrated in terms of society's </v>

1381
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:56.200
<v Speaker 4>appreciation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1382
01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.960
<v Speaker 4>Well a lot of people don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 4>these are happening.</v>

1383
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:04.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm like ultra marathons are a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>alien thing to a lot of people.</v>

1384
01:08:04.271 --> 01:08:07.030
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't aware of them so I became </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends with Cam.</v>

1385
01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:08.860
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was that crazy.</v>

1386
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:14.310
<v Speaker 4>So what mileage are you running now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only run a couple run like three of </v>

1387
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:15.260
<v Speaker 4>the most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone is like four.</v>

1388
01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:18.570

<v Speaker 3>trails.</v>

1389
01:08:18.571 --> 01:08:20.610
<v Speaker 3>That would be cool for you to just check</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1390
01:08:20.611 --> 01:08:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Trail running is so awesome.</v>

1391
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1392
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>mostly what I'm doing is like super </v>
<v Speaker 1>steep hills.</v>

1393
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>That's where I like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of hill sprints.</v>

1394
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it's.</v>

1395
01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>It's made a big difference in my martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts training.</v>

1396
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing it for like six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight months maybe.</v>

1397
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:39.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>January I think I started running so </v>

1398
01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.191
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incorporated with all sorts of other </v>

1399
01:08:42.191 --> 01:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>changes just makes a huge difference in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my wind.</v>

1400
01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Like and I never used it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to feel like my.</v>

1401
01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:48.200
<v Speaker 1>The thought like I guess it was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>laziness or just didn't want to try it,</v>

1402
01:08:48.201 --> 01:08:53.201
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people's thought processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if you do cardio like specific to </v>

1403
01:08:53.271 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>your athletic event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1404
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Like if you do Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do Jujitsu.</v>

1405
01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Just do a lot of rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a lot of sparring and your cardio </v>

1406
01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:02.080
<v Speaker 1>will go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you do kickboxing?</v>

1407
01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Just do a lot of kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the bag a lot and your cardio go up.</v>

1408
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:09.580
<v Speaker 1>It will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I maintain that just it was just </v>

1409
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:13.541
<v Speaker 1>sheer cardio from running is a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and that your capacity for cardio </v>

1410
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:19.150
<v Speaker 1>is expanded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you do hit a hill </v>

1411
01:09:19.150 --> 01:09:20.420
<v Speaker 1>running or sprints things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1412
01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you,</v>

1413
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.990
<v Speaker 1>do you do anything else other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>running?</v>

1414
01:09:23.991 --> 01:09:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you involved in any other athletics?</v>

1415
01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:27.090
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

1416
01:09:27.091 --> 01:09:32.091
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played on some like adult coed </v>

1417
01:09:32.091 --> 01:09:34.290
<v Speaker 3>volleyball and soccer teams recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1418
01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.970
<v Speaker 3>otherwise just running right now.</v>

1419
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an illegal longterm goal or </v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything that you'd like to </v>

1420
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:41.200
<v Speaker 1>accomplish?</v>

1421
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1422
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:44.990
<v Speaker 3>I just want to keep pushing the limits </v>
<v Speaker 3>and finding,</v>

1423
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:50.050
<v Speaker 3>finding out what's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going a little bit faster or a little </v>

1424
01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:50.060
<v Speaker 3>bit further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1425
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:54.560
<v Speaker 3>and getting to see parts of the world is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm hoping for in this next year.</v>

1426
01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:58.730
<v Speaker 3>How many other women when these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been in the past couple of years</v>

1427
01:09:58.731 --> 01:09:59.630
<v Speaker 3>there has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1428
01:09:59.631 --> 01:10:03.380
<v Speaker 3>it's becoming a little more frequent to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a female overall winner.</v>

1429
01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for a long time that wasn't the </v>

1430
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.810
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1431
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why do you think that is?</v>

1432
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:13.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm like the confidence </v>

1433
01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:17.201
<v Speaker 3>or the time women are putting in or like</v>
<v Speaker 3>just figuring out nutrition stuff.</v>

1434
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:23.260
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno what's been the like thing that </v>

1435
01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:23.260
<v Speaker 3>switched it over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1436
01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:25.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not as absurd as it used to be for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1437
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is absurd.</v>

1438
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's absurd to not just win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the wind by such an enormous margin,</v>

1439
01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what an inspiration you must be to </v>

1440
01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.011
<v Speaker 1>other young runners that are coming up </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now and just know that that's </v>

1441
01:10:40.011 --> 01:10:40.011
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone can,</v>

1442
01:10:40.011 --> 01:10:40.140
<v Speaker 1>can do that.</v>

1443
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1444
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:46.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope to inspire future generations.</v>

1445
01:10:46.351 --> 01:10:48.060
<v Speaker 3>My niece like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1446
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:50.160
<v Speaker 3>that'd be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's happening,</v>

1447
01:10:50.161 --> 01:10:50.520
<v Speaker 3>but okay.</v>

1448
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:55.570
<v Speaker 1>This is 100 percent happy trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no desire to do it and you've </v>

1449
01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:56.030
<v Speaker 1>inspired me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1450
01:10:56.031 --> 01:10:56.730
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1451
01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the four minute mile,</v>

1452
01:10:58.641 --> 01:10:58.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1453
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That before,</v>

1454
01:11:00.491 --> 01:11:03.030
<v Speaker 3>who was the guy that Jesse Prefontaine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1455
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:03.740
<v Speaker 3>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy is.</v>

1456
01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Who was it that broke the four minute </v>
<v Speaker 3>mile?</v>

1457
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Was it like Alan,</v>

1458
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say Jesse Owen,</v>

1459
01:11:09.421 --> 01:11:11.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whoever,</v>

1460
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:13.410
<v Speaker 1>whoever the gentleman was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it broke the four minute mile.</v>

1461
01:11:13.411 --> 01:11:15.400
<v Speaker 1>They used to literally think it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically impossible.</v>

1462
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Bannister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Bannister,</v>

1463
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:18.450
<v Speaker 1>thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once he broke it,</v>

1464
01:11:18.451 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>then a bunch of people broke afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realized it could be possible,</v>

1465
01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another one of the reasons why </v>

1466
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>when someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1467
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.380
<v Speaker 1>if you run a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take six months off.</v>

1468
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Like shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows what people can do mean.</v>

1469
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:36.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really true that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are boundaries to human </v>

1470
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:37.080
<v Speaker 1>performance that have not been explored </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

1471
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1472
01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people like you,</v>

1473
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.180
<v Speaker 1>you're like at the tip of the spear of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>

1474
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.140
<v Speaker 1>You realize that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

1475
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:48.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are like in,</v>

1476
01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:53.071
<v Speaker 1>in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a whole lot of </v>

1477
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 1>people that can ever say that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>run $238.</v>

1478
01:11:55.140 --> 01:12:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's maybe one or two other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have ever walked the face of</v>

1479
01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:02.520
<v Speaker 1>the earth that have done what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1480
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:07.850
<v Speaker 1>they might not have ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe there's some crazy </v>

1481
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:09.120
<v Speaker 1>aborigine are some indigenous people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't know about.</v>

1482
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Someone who lives in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mountains or something like that </v>

1483
01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:14.420
<v Speaker 1>has done something crazy like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>

1484
01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:19.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people have ever done what you </v>

1485
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.310
<v Speaker 1>did?</v>

1486
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:20.330
<v Speaker 4>I think there are 95 finishers at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rab to 40.</v>

1487
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:24.860
<v Speaker 4>But how many people have done it in less</v>
<v Speaker 4>than 58 hours this year?</v>

1488
01:12:24.861 --> 01:12:27.320
<v Speaker 4>Just one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think it'll keep falling.</v>

1489
01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:29.390
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my thought process.</v>

1490
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And do you think that there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>left?</v>

1491
01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think you left anything on the </v>

1492
01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:38.540
<v Speaker 1>table as far as like when you crossed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the line,</v>

1493
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>was there a thought like I could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done that maybe like five minutes </v>

1494
01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>faster?</v>

1495
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1496
01:12:44.931 --> 01:12:45.530
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1497
01:12:45.531 --> 01:12:50.531
<v Speaker 4>you can cut out time at aid stations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do sections more efficiently.</v>

1498
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:56.050
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my hope is there's always room for </v>

1499
01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:58.271
<v Speaker 4>improvement and if I went back next year</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would absolutely be trying to push the</v>

1500
01:12:58.671 --> 01:13:01.940
<v Speaker 4>pace and drop my time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you try to get an under 50?</v>

1501
01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'd just have to see how the day</v>

1502
01:13:04.341 --> 01:13:07.940
<v Speaker 4>was unfolding and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what sort of obstacles were coming up?</v>

1503
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:13.270
<v Speaker 1>If you did it under 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you some people would just </v>

1504
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.270
<v Speaker 1>throw themselves off the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

1505
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like me playing basketball </v>

1506
01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:22.030
<v Speaker 1>against Jordan and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this anymore.</v>

1507
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:24.530
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1508
01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:25.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven.</v>

1509
01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:29.400
<v Speaker 4>That'd be almost eight hours cut off and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I can.</v>

1510
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.120
<v Speaker 4>That'd be a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1511
01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:34.650
<v Speaker 4>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why not a person that came in second,</v>

1512
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:40.310
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that person who came in second would be </v>

1513
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.310
<v Speaker 4>a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1514
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:42.660
<v Speaker 4>I just beat everybody's ass and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy race.</v>

1515
01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:48.160
<v Speaker 4>He means so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a little bummed out right now.</v>

1516
01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.500
<v Speaker 4>He sit at home going fucking 10 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet that guy gets a good night's sleep</v>

1517
01:13:52.501 --> 01:13:56.360
<v Speaker 4>and brushes his teeth and forgets about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it for a little while,</v>

1518
01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:59.310
<v Speaker 4>gets in his car and then he's in traffic</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the light turns red.</v>

1519
01:13:59.311 --> 01:14:03.810
<v Speaker 4>He was fucking 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 hours.</v>

1520
01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:11.900
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope you're not thinking that shot </v>

1521
01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:11.900
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

1522
01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:11.900
<v Speaker 4>You're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sean.</v>

1523
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I would be thinking to good news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beat me by 10 days.</v>

1524
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of it in terms of,</v>

1525
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:19.810
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1526
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the high watermark now I guess.</v>

1527
01:14:22.001 --> 01:14:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine there's any other way to</v>

1528
01:14:25.301 --> 01:14:27.970
<v Speaker 1>put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won the first one,</v>

1529
01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 1>but you want it by such a ridiculous</v>

1530
01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.880
<v Speaker 4>margin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:14:31.881 --> 01:14:35.870
<v Speaker 4>We'll see next year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What people are capable of now.</v>

1532
01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Candice and her crazy idea for 500 </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles.</v>

1533
01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:40.330
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to indulge her in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous quest?</v>

1534
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1535
01:14:41.751 --> 01:14:46.751
<v Speaker 4>she threw it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had like immediately positive </v>

1536
01:14:46.751 --> 01:14:49.550
<v Speaker 4>response from everyone in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this group of course.</v>

1537
01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.080
<v Speaker 4>But just fucking psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1538
01:14:51.081 --> 01:14:53.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was saying maybe 20,</v>

1539
01:14:53.391 --> 01:14:55.520
<v Speaker 4>19.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'd be able to pull it together.</v>

1540
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:56.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

1541
01:14:56.301 --> 01:15:01.301
<v Speaker 4>Why does she need that much time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the logistics involved and then </v>

1542
01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:03.410
<v Speaker 4>there's like permitting you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And where would you,</v>

1543
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:04.940
<v Speaker 4>where would she have one of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things?</v>

1544
01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:10.120
<v Speaker 4>She didn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about the surface of the sun or the </v>

1545
01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:10.120
<v Speaker 4>moon?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1546
01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:10.120
<v Speaker 4>let's all go to the movies.</v>

1547
01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cold.</v>

1548
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

1549
01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.200
<v Speaker 1>No gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like cheating.</v>

1550
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.290
<v Speaker 1>It's only like one sixth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1551
01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:22.160
<v Speaker 1>sixth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth's gravity.</v>

1552
01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1553
01:15:23.211 --> 01:15:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the limit?</v>

1554
01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the limit of a human in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like mean?</v>

1555
01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:34.220
<v Speaker 1>You said that when it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were wrecked for days,</v>

1556
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really weren't eating well,</v>

1557
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:41.390
<v Speaker 1>but when you cross that finish line and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone said,</v>

1558
01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.180
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real</v>

1559
01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 4>finish line is another 80 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just would've kept going.</v>

1560
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's,</v>

1561
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:53.800
<v Speaker 4>if that was real and I had 80 more miles</v>
<v Speaker 4>to cover,</v>

1562
01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:56.620
<v Speaker 4>I would figure out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What have is 180?</v>

1563
01:15:56.710 --> 01:16:01.710
<v Speaker 4>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many more miles did you think you </v>

1564
01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:01.710
<v Speaker 4>have left in your body?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

1565
01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:05.460
<v Speaker 4>there a point where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just tissue would just give out </v>

1566
01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:05.770
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1567
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:11.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like for this 500 mile ratios </v>

1568
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:14.520
<v Speaker 4>suggesting there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's thinking a 10 day cutoff or </v>

1569
01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:14.520
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

1570
01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.410
<v Speaker 4>So then you just got to build in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>good sleep.</v>

1571
01:16:17.411 --> 01:16:22.411
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sorry candice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we weren't supposed to talk about </v>

1572
01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:22.411
<v Speaker 4>this yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1573
01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:27.990
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like that's 10 days is not.</v>

1574
01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.650
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>

1575
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:31.300
<v Speaker 4>but no one's going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1576
01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:36.301
<v Speaker 4>You're just going to keep running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to just go 50 miles a </v>

1577
01:16:36.301 --> 01:16:36.301
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

1578
01:16:36.301 --> 01:16:36.301
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could like,</v>

1579
01:16:36.301 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 4>you can build that into your plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1580
01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.840
<v Speaker 4>But no one's going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean for this one,</v>

1581
01:16:40.841 --> 01:16:45.841
<v Speaker 4>people had sleep plans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's aid stations out there that had </v>

1582
01:16:45.841 --> 01:16:48.550
<v Speaker 4>like cots and blankets and you can stay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say for six hours,</v>

1583
01:16:48.551 --> 01:16:51.520
<v Speaker 4>they'll let you sleep there before they </v>
<v Speaker 4>boot you to the course.</v>

1584
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:53.380
<v Speaker 4>Six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six hours get up.</v>

1585
01:16:53.381 --> 01:16:54.310
<v Speaker 4>Lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1586
01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:57.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they just want to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>turning them over in case there's a need</v>

1587
01:16:57.431 --> 01:17:00.850
<v Speaker 4>for more or that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they wake you up at six hours.</v>

1588
01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:06.060
<v Speaker 4>Apparently I didn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any personal experience </v>

1589
01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:06.060
<v Speaker 4>doing it off the car.</v>

1590
01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Just live right on the ground right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1591
01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

1592
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.200
<v Speaker 3>not getting up right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>

1593
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess for this one they'd have to </v>

1594
01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:18.620
<v Speaker 3>have sleep stations out there and I mean</v>

1595
01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I see what I'm getting at is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating part of this to me is that </v>

1596
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.331
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries are in least somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored because what you did was in a</v>

1597
01:17:31.371 --> 01:17:35.050
<v Speaker 1>way very revolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you did was like,</v>

1598
01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:40.080
<v Speaker 1>like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just flip the whole thing on its </v>

1599
01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.491
<v Speaker 1>head by coming in 10 hours and 20 plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles ahead of the second place person.</v>

1600
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Like now people are going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1601
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.680
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's possible?</v>

1602
01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe there's someone out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can do that at Courtney.</v>

1603
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1604
01:17:52.731 --> 01:17:56.420
<v Speaker 3>There is like glue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't met them.</v>

1605
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:59.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm really exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's the question.</v>

1606
01:17:59.511 --> 01:18:04.511
<v Speaker 3>That's the cool part is if people just </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep like wandering that then we'll be </v>

1607
01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:06.800
<v Speaker 3>breaking down all sorts of barriers.</v>

1608
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:11.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fascinating about it to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a completely outside observer is that</v>

1609
01:18:11.881 --> 01:18:16.881
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is you're essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unexplored territory and even the </v>

1610
01:18:18.871 --> 01:18:20.280
<v Speaker 1>training protocols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1611
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Like your protocols different than cams </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure that Sean,</v>

1612
01:18:23.851 --> 01:18:28.851
<v Speaker 1>God's got a different thing that he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's got their own little </v>

1613
01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:29.930
<v Speaker 1>methods and wasn't there a guy that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>leading for awhile but he had a,</v>

1614
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:31.920
<v Speaker 1>he had a bail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 150 miles.</v>

1615
01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:33.060
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't take it anymore.</v>

1616
01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was going back and forth for awhile</v>

1617
01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.330
<v Speaker 3>with a guy until maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1618
01:18:38.331 --> 01:18:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 150 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened to him?</v>

1619
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:45.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his legs or his quads or </v>

1620
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.510
<v Speaker 3>something was given out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not positive.</v>

1621
01:18:46.511 --> 01:18:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get to have it.</v>

1622
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Your conversation with him in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that happen often where someone </v>

1623
01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:56.111
<v Speaker 1>just comes out of the gate too hard or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe like he's trying to keep up with </v>

1624
01:18:56.111 --> 01:18:56.540
<v Speaker 1>you and he outpaced himself?</v>

1625
01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately they're called dns or did </v>

1626
01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:02.100
<v Speaker 3>not finish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1627
01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.600
<v Speaker 3>and those happened pretty frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the percentage if you had to </v>

1628
01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.660
<v Speaker 3>guess?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was 100 plus people entered,</v>

1629
01:19:07.661 --> 01:19:08.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 200,</v>

1631
01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:14.060
<v Speaker 3>the Moab race had way less than a </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>

1632
01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:16.300
<v Speaker 3>like hundred mile race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example.</v>

1633
01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.640
<v Speaker 3>We left dnfs way less people dropped </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1634
01:19:18.641 --> 01:19:19.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1635
01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:22.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's like the mindset </v>
<v Speaker 3>going in,</v>

1636
01:19:22.031 --> 01:19:24.430
<v Speaker 3>you just know it's this big adventure </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1637
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:26.410
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to be out there for </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple days,</v>

1638
01:19:26.411 --> 01:19:29.560
<v Speaker 3>so you're ready for that versus a 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>mile race.</v>

1639
01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:33.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean people are breaking down barriers</v>
<v Speaker 3>with how fast those can be done.</v>

1640
01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then you're,</v>

1641
01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:40.500
<v Speaker 3>you're going out guns blazing from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>start and then you've got a higher </v>

1642
01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.970
<v Speaker 3>potential for a blow up that just can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be fixed.</v>

1643
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.240
<v Speaker 1>So is that what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>

1644
01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:47.430
<v Speaker 1>your muscles just break down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

1645
01:19:47.970 --> 01:19:50.190
<v Speaker 1>what is it called autolysis or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1646
01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Your muscles start eating themselves.</v>

1647
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just like no response.</v>

1648
01:19:53.481 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 3>You're getting nothing back from um.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1649
01:19:56.151 --> 01:19:59.550
<v Speaker 3>And what is that thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those crossfit people get robbed?</v>

1650
01:19:59.551 --> 01:20:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Doe myelocytic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1651
01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever get that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never gotten it wrapped.</v>

1652
01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Rhabdo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhabdomyolysis.</v>

1653
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something about like,</v>

1654
01:20:07.321 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 3>your muscles</v>

1655
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:10.650
<v Speaker 1>are breaking down into your bloodstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

1656
01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

1657
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:17.570
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be horrible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently you like way more common </v>

1658
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:20.220
<v Speaker 1>today than it muscle breakdown damages </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kidneys.</v>

1659
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way more common today because of,</v>

1660
01:20:23.551 --> 01:20:28.551
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these crossfit classes and people push </v>

1661
01:20:28.551 --> 01:20:29.900
<v Speaker 1>themselves and push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is like,</v>

1662
01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:32.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not a matter of what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1663
01:20:32.221 --> 01:20:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courtney ran 248 miles.</v>

1664
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I can run it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1665
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:37.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

1666
01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.330
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have to build up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stupid kids.</v>

1667
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Just do it tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1668
01:20:43.021 --> 01:20:45.030
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the crazy thing about all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1669
01:20:45.031 --> 01:20:46.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that like you're,</v>

1670
01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:50.880
<v Speaker 1>you're building like a mountain one lego</v>
<v Speaker 1>block at a time.</v>

1671
01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And someone who's like,</v>

1672
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:56.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well her mountains like 5,000</v>

1673
01:20:56.071 --> 01:20:57.900
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just fucking build a footnote.</v>

1674
01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 1>So it takes a long ass time to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>that mountain.</v>

1675
01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1676
01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for me,</v>

1677
01:21:03.011 --> 01:21:08.011
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been training for this long stuff </v>

1678
01:21:08.011 --> 01:21:10.381
<v Speaker 3>for seven years now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I wasn't like instantly successful at</v>

1679
01:21:11.191 --> 01:21:16.191
<v Speaker 3>the hundred mile distance and it's taken</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of training and a lot of just </v>

1680
01:21:16.191 --> 01:21:16.390
<v Speaker 3>learning along the way</v>

1681
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:22.580
<v Speaker 1>now because of the fact that you ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>this 238 mile race at a certain pace and</v>

1682
01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:28.260
<v Speaker 1>did so phenomenally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like your body is now going </v>

1683
01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.940
<v Speaker 1>to be stronger for the next one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

1684
01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:34.710
<v Speaker 3>I hope if I treat it nicely for a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit here and let it fully recover,</v>

1685
01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:40.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that then I can try and springboard off </v>

1686
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:40.020
<v Speaker 3>of this for the next day.</v>

1687
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Plenty Nachos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of beer.</v>

1688
01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just loaded in.</v>

1689
01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.240
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any other kinds of training?</v>

1690
01:21:44.241 --> 01:21:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any weight lifting or yoga or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else you incorporate?</v>

1691
01:21:48.831 --> 01:21:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>

1692
01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1693
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the gym mostly at the gym.</v>

1694
01:21:53.081 --> 01:21:58.081
<v Speaker 3>I do core work and like throw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw around a couple of five pound </v>

1695
01:21:58.081 --> 01:22:02.020
<v Speaker 3>dumbbells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But otherwise,</v>

1696
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:07.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think yoga would be a great thing to </v>

1697
01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:07.200
<v Speaker 3>incorporate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just haven't,</v>

1698
01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.700
<v Speaker 3>I haven't gotten the motivated to head </v>
<v Speaker 3>to those classes.</v>

1699
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:15.060
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you stretch a sometimes,</v>

1700
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:20.130
<v Speaker 1>but wouldn't you think that that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a good thing to do?</v>

1701
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh absolutely.</v>

1702
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you do it?</v>

1703
01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean I try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:28.020
<v Speaker 3>It's just not like incorporated into my </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal routine.</v>

1705
01:22:28.021 --> 01:22:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Very well.</v>

1706
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you think maybe like things along </v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines,</v>

1707
01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:37.121
<v Speaker 1>like maybe yoga or weightlifting or </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching would maybe possibly advance </v>

1708
01:22:37.121 --> 01:22:38.300
<v Speaker 1>you to another level?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1709
01:22:38.301 --> 01:22:40.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean I might as well try and see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1710
01:22:40.791 --> 01:22:41.900
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1711
01:22:41.901 --> 01:22:46.901
<v Speaker 1>you're so far ahead now that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it's a matter of like </v>

1712
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.490
<v Speaker 1>what could possibly make you better like</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1713
01:22:51.491 --> 01:22:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously trying to win by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

1714
01:22:54.921 --> 01:22:58.520
<v Speaker 1>A margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would think obviously what you're</v>

1715
01:22:58.521 --> 01:23:00.830
<v Speaker 1>doing now is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what if it ain't broke,</v>

1716
01:23:00.831 --> 01:23:01.880
<v Speaker 1>don't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1717
01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.430
<v Speaker 1>But are you your very best?</v>

1718
01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope not.</v>

1719
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:12.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to keep trying to strive for </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher.</v>

1720
01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Just keep putting lego blocks up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep building.</v>

1721
01:23:15.570 --> 01:23:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I love Lego's.</v>

1722
01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Who Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like it's a fairly good </v>

1723
01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:23.120
<v Speaker 1>analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1724
01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:27.381
<v Speaker 1>that it seems that it's a slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arduous process of improvement and it </v>

1725
01:23:27.931 --> 01:23:32.931
<v Speaker 1>takes discipline and constant focus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant attention and just time in.</v>

1726
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And enjoying it too.</v>

1727
01:23:35.071 --> 01:23:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a huge part of it for me as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well as I'm loving it still.</v>

1728
01:23:39.311 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1729
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:42.160
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>success as well,</v>

1730
01:23:42.161 --> 01:23:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the enthusiasm that you have?</v>

1731
01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it's gotTa be if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're out there grinding everyday </v>

1732
01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.440
<v Speaker 3>for hours and you're just hating it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1733
01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:53.090
<v Speaker 3>then you won't be jazzed to go to any </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting line.</v>

1734
01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's</v>

1735
01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:58.300
<v Speaker 1>sort of what you were saying about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water thing that if you're low on water,</v>

1736
01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:03.330
<v Speaker 1>like don't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let it freak you out to just deal </v>

1737
01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>with it and it will be less like of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really does apply to life,</v>

1738
01:24:04.961 --> 01:24:05.440
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

1739
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:07.240
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1740
01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter if you run or not,</v>

1741
01:24:09.341 --> 01:24:14.341
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm just figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with situations like that without </v>

1742
01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:17.920
<v Speaker 3>freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And having a record day is huge.</v>

1743
01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Now what about runner's high?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How high do you get when you run in like</v>

1744
01:24:21.511 --> 01:24:23.220
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

1745
01:24:24.150 --> 01:24:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1746
01:24:25.411 --> 01:24:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I just get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get runner's high.</v>

1747
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.840
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1748
01:24:31.841 --> 01:24:36.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you're out there like </v>
<v Speaker 3>cruising along some beautiful trails and</v>

1749
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:41.730
<v Speaker 3>you're in an amazing place and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel really good and maybe you're </v>

1750
01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:45.520
<v Speaker 3>with people or maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely can feel really awesome,</v>

1751
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:49.210
<v Speaker 1>but people like sort of chased that </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1752
01:24:49.211 --> 01:24:54.211
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that that is like </v>

1753
01:24:54.211 --> 01:24:56.731
<v Speaker 1>the only way they stay sane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you got to go out and get their </v>

1754
01:24:56.731 --> 01:24:59.221
<v Speaker 1>medicine in that running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have like an end goal?</v>

1755
01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Like do you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you look at like this running career </v>

1756
01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:06.090
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1757
01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:09.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get to be x amount of age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to accomplish a certain amount of</v>

1758
01:25:09.311 --> 01:25:13.420
<v Speaker 1>things and then stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it just life?</v>

1759
01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is just life.</v>

1760
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:20.840
<v Speaker 3>The cool part about this running stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you alluded to it earlier,</v>

1761
01:25:20.841 --> 01:25:24.140
<v Speaker 3>but people in their forties and fifties </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sixties,</v>

1762
01:25:24.141 --> 01:25:28.910
<v Speaker 3>they're doing these races and I'm still </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoying the trails and I hope to.</v>

1763
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:32.840
<v Speaker 3>I hope to still be doing it when in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1764
01:25:32.841 --> 01:25:33.710
<v Speaker 3>in 30 years,</v>

1765
01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.840
<v Speaker 1>my friend Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dad who was a holocaust survivor </v>

1766
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:41.100
<v Speaker 1>who's 80 years old just ran a marathon </v>
<v Speaker 1>in six hours.</v>

1767
01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>

1768
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:43.830
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing</v>

1769
01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Doug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1770
01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:48.820
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't run a marathon.</v>

1771
01:25:48.821 --> 01:25:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know burt can't that fat.</v>

1772
01:25:50.861 --> 01:25:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Fuck sorry Brent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

1773
01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:59.180
<v Speaker 1>It's inside joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a total inside joke,</v>

1774
01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 1>but his are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Dad is like,</v>

1775
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>how</v>

1776
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.570
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does one do that?</v>

1777
01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:07.970
<v Speaker 4>How does it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is an 80 year old man run a marathon</v>

1778
01:26:07.971 --> 01:26:09.500
<v Speaker 4>in six hours?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

1779
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:10.910
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1780
01:26:10.911 --> 01:26:12.080
<v Speaker 4>Just grinding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1781
01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:17.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the oldest competitor that you </v>

1782
01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 4>guys had in that race?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 69,</v>

1783
01:26:18.411 --> 01:26:19.670
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1784
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:23.000
<v Speaker 4>How did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He finished.</v>

1785
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

1786
01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Sixty nine years old and he runs 238.</v>

1787
01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:32.900
<v Speaker 4>I think he had something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1788
01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:37.170
<v Speaker 4>he's 69 years old and it was like his </v>
<v Speaker 4>6,800</v>

1789
01:26:37.171 --> 01:26:40.770
<v Speaker 4>plus mile race he'd ever done or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something crazy like that.</v>

1790
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:42.840
<v Speaker 4>At that age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're on borrowed time.</v>

1791
01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:46.810
<v Speaker 4>Why not just burn that candle with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>blowtorch?</v>

1792
01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:50.340
<v Speaker 4>Fuck the wick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just throw that candle in the fall.</v>

1793
01:26:50.341 --> 01:26:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Kaino.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1794
01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:53.550
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe he's making more time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might be.</v>

1795
01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:55.080
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't be Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patrick.</v>

1796
01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rhonda Patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's this brilliant moment of added fat</v>

1797
01:26:58.241 --> 01:27:03.241
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posted something on twitter just a </v>

1798
01:27:03.241 --> 01:27:06.871
<v Speaker 1>couple of days ago that regular rigorous</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical exercise can expand,</v>

1799
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:11.830
<v Speaker 1>lowers the biological age by as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine years.</v>

1800
01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it seems like you find that.</v>

1801
01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some crazy study they did on </v>

1802
01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:19.200
<v Speaker 1>extended.</v>

1803
01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.750
<v Speaker 4>Since any rigorous exercise</v>

1804
01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.160
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a physical exercise reduces cancer </v>

1805
01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.130
<v Speaker 1>incidence is lower than the rates of </v>
<v Speaker 1>recurrence inhibits tumor growth.</v>

1806
01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1807
01:27:27.671 --> 01:27:29.180
<v Speaker 1>It's one that I retweeted.</v>

1808
01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:31.620
<v Speaker 4>It was here it is</v>

1809
01:27:32.010 --> 01:27:37.010
<v Speaker 1>intensity exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delayed biological aging by nine years </v>

1810
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:40.670
<v Speaker 1>as measured by telomere length.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was just like scientific analysis of </v>

1811
01:27:41.371 --> 01:27:42.420
<v Speaker 1>your telomeres.</v>

1812
01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.590
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like what,</v>

1813
01:27:44.591 --> 01:27:46.210
<v Speaker 4>nine years every time you.</v>

1814
01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:47.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1815
01:27:47.191 --> 01:27:52.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean like people who are </v>

1816
01:27:52.191 --> 01:27:52.191
<v Speaker 1>rigorously exercising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say if you,</v>

1817
01:27:52.191 --> 01:27:56.500
<v Speaker 1>you're 39,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your telomeres results showed that </v>

1818
01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:59.160
<v Speaker 1>regular activity accounted for </v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly longer.</v>

1819
01:27:59.161 --> 01:28:04.161
<v Speaker 1>Telomeres in US adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the longer telomeres found an act of </v>

1820
01:28:04.161 --> 01:28:05.850
<v Speaker 1>adults accounted for nine years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced cellular aging.</v>

1821
01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Regular physical exercise activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduces disease risk possibly due to </v>

1822
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:11.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1823
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.530
<v Speaker 1>preservation of telomeres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1824
01:28:13.770 --> 01:28:18.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the long telomeres are nucleo </v>

1825
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:22.970
<v Speaker 1>protein caps positioned at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chromosomes and agent causes telomeres </v>

1826
01:28:23.041 --> 01:28:26.910
<v Speaker 1>to shorten significantly and results in </v>
<v Speaker 1>gradual sell deterioration.</v>

1827
01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And that makes sense because you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that don't exercise and they get </v>

1828
01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:33.660
<v Speaker 1>older and they look like shit as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to someone who does exercise and they'll</v>

1829
01:28:33.661 --> 01:28:35.040
<v Speaker 1>stand right next to them and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1830
01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Does those two people the same age?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1831
01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:37.530
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1832
01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.960
<v Speaker 4>That's cool that they're studying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will be interesting to see like how</v>

1833
01:28:40.961 --> 01:28:43.240
<v Speaker 4>that unfolds as they learn more.</v>

1834
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:44.670
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1835
01:28:44.671 --> 01:28:49.671
<v Speaker 1>You're requiring more of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body has to maintain this much </v>

1836
01:28:49.671 --> 01:28:50.280
<v Speaker 1>higher work rate than the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1837
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:52.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

1838
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:54.720
<v Speaker 4>How much sleep do you get a night?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A normal night.</v>

1839
01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:56.760
<v Speaker 4>Normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably seven or eight hours.</v>

1840
01:28:57.130 --> 01:28:58.520
<v Speaker 4>So just normal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:01.050
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing anything crazy?</v>

1842
01:29:01.130 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other than</v>

1843
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:07.100
<v Speaker 1>the actual accomplishment physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not doing anything crazy </v>

1844
01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:07.110
<v Speaker 1>outside of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1845
01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you get massages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1846
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:10.160
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1847
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you wear those crazy pants?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are those?</v>

1848
01:29:13.930 --> 01:29:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those crazy pants.</v>

1849
01:29:15.121 --> 01:29:17.190
<v Speaker 1>It's Smush your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are those things called?</v>

1850
01:29:17.191 --> 01:29:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Compression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those.</v>

1851
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:23.090
<v Speaker 1>The Cam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they send them to me and I sent them to </v>

1852

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1908
01:31:26.251 --> 01:31:27.420
<v Speaker 4>So most of the time when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>

1909
01:31:27.421 --> 01:31:29.160
<v Speaker 4>do you use music or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No?</v>

1910
01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:32.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't often use music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some days I will,</v>

1911
01:31:32.281 --> 01:31:37.281
<v Speaker 4>but especially out on trails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we just talked about all these </v>

1912
01:31:37.281 --> 01:31:39.270
<v Speaker 4>animals that can kill you that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>using music.</v>

1913
01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't hear the rattle that suck.</v>

1914
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like the wings flapping behind your </v>

1915
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:48.490
<v Speaker 1>head before you get a scalping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Now did they test you guys for drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally.</v>

1917
01:31:52.251 --> 01:31:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Some races have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one did not.</v>

1918
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.010
<v Speaker 1>So you can be jacked up to the gills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people?</v>

1919
01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 1>How many people you think were juiced up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the gills and they still couldn't </v>

1920
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:03.580
<v Speaker 1>beat you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one at this race,</v>

1921
01:32:03.581 --> 01:32:08.581
<v Speaker 1>no one was Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's someone out there is one person </v>

1922
01:32:08.581 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 1>who's on epo for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't believe it.</v>

1923
01:32:09.610 --> 01:32:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One person,</v>

1924
01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:15.670
<v Speaker 3>like none of that stuff is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>filtering into the trail running scene.</v>

1925
01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:20.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a $0 prize on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I understand that.</v>

1926
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Why is someone going to epo for that?</v>

1927
01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>logical.</v>

1928
01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:26.850
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was actually a,</v>

1929
01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:31.920
<v Speaker 1>an article that was written about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley ceos that were taking epo</v>

1930
01:32:33.690 --> 01:32:38.690
<v Speaker 1>and doing triathlons and a marathon </v>
<v Speaker 1>races and they were taking these </v>

1931
01:32:39.391 --> 01:32:44.391
<v Speaker 1>endurance drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a performance enhancing drugs just </v>

1932
01:32:44.391 --> 01:32:47.541
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just to try to up their </v>

1933
01:32:47.541 --> 01:32:50.391
<v Speaker 1>performance in these amateur events that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big thing that it's a very common</v>

1934
01:32:51.151 --> 01:32:52.530
<v Speaker 1>thing lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1935
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1936
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know where the fuck they </v>

1937
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.910
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>

1938
01:32:58.910 --> 01:33:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what all that would </v>

1939
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.510
<v Speaker 3>involve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1940
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:04.990
<v Speaker 3>I like to think better of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the trail running community and that </v>

1941
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:06.320
<v Speaker 3>people are pushing just their natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>limits without,</v>

1942
01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:08.820
<v Speaker 3>without seeing what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1943
01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:09.920
<v Speaker 3>any sort of drug reps.</v>

1944
01:33:10.130 --> 01:33:11.710

<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1945
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:16.920
<v Speaker 1>But I just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>anytime guy,</v>

1954
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:36.990
<v Speaker 1>he'd fight anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would hop off a bar stool and beat </v>

1955
01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:37.550
<v Speaker 1>the shit out of people we used to rent </v>

<v Speaker 1>worked,</v>

1963
01:33:57.130 --> 01:34:02.130
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can take whatever you wanted </v>

1964
01:34:02.130 --> 01:34:02.130
<v Speaker 1>and there was no drug testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1965
01:34:02.130 --> 01:34:03.860
<v Speaker 1>The early days.</v>

<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much is,</v>

1968
01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.110
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to trail </v>
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>

1969
01:34:11.111 --> 01:34:14.620
<v Speaker 1>like what you're doing is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're living at elevation,</v>

1970
01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.940
<v Speaker 1>which is phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1971
01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Then you're also just constantly putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the work and grinding and it's a full</v>

1972
01:34:21.521 --> 01:34:26.521
<v Speaker 1>time job now and you're obviously a </v>
<v Speaker 1>special athlete when it comes to your </v>

1973
01:34:26.521 --> 01:34:28.780
<v Speaker 1>ability to focus and you went fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind lady.</v>

1974
01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:31.390
<v Speaker 1>He lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you kept running,</v>

1975
01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:36.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no drugs out there that can </v>

1976
01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:36.740
<v Speaker 1>fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

1977
01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:37.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that's going to give you</v>

1978
01:34:37.961 --> 01:34:41.020
<v Speaker 1>that kind of mental fortitude to push </v>
<v Speaker 1>past blindness.</v>

1979
01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're getting better about.</v>

1980
01:34:43.791 --> 01:34:48.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more trail races are starting </v>

1981
01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:49.820
<v Speaker 3>to implement a drug testing just to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

1982
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm cut it out before it even becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing</v>

1983
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:54.490
<v Speaker 1>that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1984
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1985
01:34:55.301 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Weed out all the performance enhancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1986
01:34:57.501 --> 01:34:58.790
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be,</v>

1987
01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:00.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1988
01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you test for and what don't you</v>

1989
01:35:03.141 --> 01:35:04.070
<v Speaker 1>test for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's,</v>

1990
01:35:04.110 --> 01:35:05.690
<v Speaker 1>what's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1991
01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.730
<v Speaker 1>multivitamins or okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

1992
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:09.440
<v Speaker 1>what about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1993
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 1>there's some weird stuff that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

1994
01:35:12.501 --> 01:35:14.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some really good stuff from GNC,</v>

1995
01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're having issues with that in the UFC</v>

1996
01:35:17.451 --> 01:35:22.451
<v Speaker 1>were guys take just over the counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff at GNC and it turns out it </v>

1997
01:35:22.451 --> 01:35:22.451
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1998
01:35:22.451 --> 01:35:23.480
<v Speaker 1>steroids in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1999
01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's super common that these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2000
01:35:26.170 --> 01:35:29.420
<v Speaker 1>all these muscle building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and rail stack that,</v>

2001
01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:31.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that stuff is they,</v>

2002
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:35.180
<v Speaker 1>they literally put performance enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs in them,</v>

2003
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.290
<v Speaker 1>which is why they work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it's just your job as an athlete</v>

2004
01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:42.800
<v Speaker 1>to know what's on the ingredient list </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is it okay?</v>

2005
01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw it actually has a list of things</v>

2006
01:35:46.311 --> 01:35:50.570
<v Speaker 1>that have tested positive for steroids </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is crazy.</v>

2007
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I had Jeff Novitsky on who was the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Usada and now works for the UFC.</v>

2008
01:35:55.011 --> 01:36:00.011
<v Speaker 1>He's a drug enforcement program and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to catch people cheating and we </v>

2009
01:36:00.011 --> 01:36:02.460
<v Speaker 1>pulled up the Usada website and your jaw</v>
<v Speaker 1>drops,</v>

2010
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:07.510
<v Speaker 1>like what supplements you're buying from</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a regular mom and pop vitamin </v>

2011
01:36:11.571 --> 01:36:13.820
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just crazy steroids in them.</v>

2012
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just take a multivitamin.</v>

2013
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:18.020
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2014
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Just a women's multivitamin or a women's</v>
<v Speaker 1>multivitamin.</v>

2015
01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Is there a difference now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2016
01:36:25.251 --> 01:36:27.350
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a marketing scheme </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

2017
01:36:27.351 --> 01:36:32.351
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think that there's anything </v>

2018
01:36:32.351 --> 01:36:33.620
<v Speaker 1>that you could take that would possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance your performance in any way?</v>

2019
01:36:33.630 --> 01:36:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there that's legal?</v>

2020
01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean is there,</v>

2021
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:42.110
<v Speaker 1>what is something that other runners </v>
<v Speaker 1>rely on?</v>

2022
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Is there something that like you hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk about like vitamins or </v>

2023
01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:48.130
<v Speaker 1>supplements or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2024
01:36:48.131 --> 01:36:53.131
<v Speaker 1>I think more the conversation is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the diets and like changing up </v>

2025
01:36:53.811 --> 01:36:58.811
<v Speaker 1>what you eat or what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what food groups you live in and all of </v>

2026
01:36:58.811 --> 01:37:03.370
<v Speaker 1>that is more what I hear talk about and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not interested in cutting out </v>

2027
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:07.310
<v Speaker 1>carbs or cutting out fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want it all.</v>

2028
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:11.300
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the guys that ran.</v>

<v Speaker 1>is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really neat.</v>

2043
01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Can't be stressed enough is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's body is different.</v>

2044
01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.900
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran a hundred miles in 11 hours.</v>

2045
01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Forty minutes and 55 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a monster.</v>

01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Four hundred and two laps on a track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

2051
01:38:12.601 --> 01:38:14.430

<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2052
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:18.450

<v Speaker 1>with almost no carbs.</v>

2053
01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2054
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:21.180
<v Speaker 1>You're just not interested in trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2055
01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2056
01:38:22.261 --> 01:38:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see a need for it.</v>

2057
01:38:24.211 --> 01:38:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2058
01:38:26.290 --> 01:38:27.410
<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>

2059
01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they aren't enjoying </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

2060
01:38:29.441 --> 01:38:34.090
<v Speaker 2>but the things that I enjoy involve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not worrying about it.</v>

2061
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you regulate your sugar intake </v>

2062
01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.060
<v Speaker 1>at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know if you've run as much as you run,</v>

2063
01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:44.220
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to think about your diet </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

2064
01:38:44.250 --> 01:38:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2065
01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe that could be one of the,</v>

2066
01:38:47.650 --> 01:38:50.830
<v Speaker 2>the lego pieces that I try and find </v>
<v Speaker 2>tune,</v>

2067
01:38:50.831 --> 01:38:54.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's not on my to do list for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>near future.</v>

2068
01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2069
01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.410
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if it ain't broke,</v>

2070
01:38:57.411 --> 01:38:59.990
<v Speaker 1>don't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if someone like comes creeping up,</v>

2071
01:38:59.991 --> 01:39:03.890

<v Speaker 1>you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2074
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I might need to kick in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterburners.</v>

2075
01:39:12.850 --> 01:39:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that when you would go to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutritionist or to tighten up your diet?</v>

2076
01:39:16.670 --> 01:39:18.380

2082
01:39:35.441 --> 01:39:37.610
<v Speaker 2>of that nature and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2083
01:39:37.611 --> 01:39:42.611
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't motivate me to change my </v>

2084
01:39:42.611 --> 01:39:42.611
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People beating me.</v>

2085
01:39:42.611 --> 01:39:44.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take more than that.</v>

2086
01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.240
<v Speaker 1>It just is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2087
01:39:46.241 --> 01:39:51.241
<v Speaker 1>you need to train harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to like put in more work for </v>

2088
01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:54.361
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that the fuel that </v>

2089
01:39:54.361 --> 01:39:56.311
<v Speaker 1>you use in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously me giving you any advice is </v>

2090
01:39:56.311 --> 01:39:59.461
<v Speaker 1>fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that the fuel that </v>

2091
01:39:59.461 --> 01:40:00.580
<v Speaker 1>goes into your body has some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on your performance?</v>

2092
01:40:00.581 --> 01:40:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must surely</v>

2093
01:40:01.630 --> 01:40:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Shirley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also just want to live life and </v>

2094
01:40:06.630 --> 01:40:07.090
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2095
01:40:07.091 --> 01:40:09.550
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to be counting how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many Kale</v>

2096
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:12.970
<v Speaker 1>he says I'm eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2097
01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:14.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a good attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2098
01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:19.080
<v Speaker 1>obviously your enthusiasm is a huge part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your success and your mental state.</v>

2099
01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be argued at all that that's not </v>

2100
01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:29.761
<v Speaker 1>a huge part of your success is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just to keep enjoying your life in </v>

2101
01:40:30.801 --> 01:40:34.840
<v Speaker 1>living the way you're living perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuels that mental state.</v>

2102
01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

2103
01:40:35.911 --> 01:40:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking they're all intertwined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who knows,</v>

2104
01:40:39.121 --> 01:40:44.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what thing could be tweaked to make it </v>

2105
01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:44.121
<v Speaker 2>better?</v>

2106
01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:44.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2107
01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2108
01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.900
<v Speaker 1>it's all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2109
01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:47.950
<v Speaker 1>the Jack Nicholson in the shining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2110
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:50.340
<v Speaker 1>too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No play makes jack a dull boy,</v>

2111
01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:51.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2112
01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it John or Jack?</v>

2113
01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Who is he in the movie was jacked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny.</v>

2114
01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Johnny adult boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2115
01:40:58.760 --> 01:40:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's Johnny.</v>

2116
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2117
01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2118
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if like maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the ultimate grind of discipline </v>

2119
01:41:08.670 --> 01:41:12.840
<v Speaker 1>and no reward is just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not beneficial to performance that </v>

2120
01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.070
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of a balance that must</v>
<v Speaker 1>be achieved,</v>

2121
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:20.910
<v Speaker 1>enjoying yourself and being enthusiastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and appreciative and also disciplined.</v>

2122
01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I think a good balance of all that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

2123
01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:26.050
<v Speaker 1>We'll listen.</v>
