<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the Philadelphia conference that I,</v>

3
00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:05.201
<v Speaker 2>that I sent you,</v>

4
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:06.160
<v Speaker 2>which is about,</v>

5
00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:06.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 2>about what people's guilt.</v>

7
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm guilty.</v>

8
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm guilty.</v>

9
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.230
<v Speaker 2>What did they do?</v>

10
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

11
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I was white.</v>

12
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.870
<v Speaker 2>There was a white privilege conference.</v>

13
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I love that article because weighted this side,</v>

14
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

15
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:19.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>

18
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.411
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

19
00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 2>why is my Twitter blowing up?</v>

20
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.791
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

21
00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:22.624
<v Speaker 2>Joe retweeted me.</v>

22
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.793
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

23
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Speaker 2>so there was this white privilege conference,</v>

24
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 2>which was a kind of politically correct talk fest,</v>

25
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

26
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

27
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 2>and it basically ended up consuming itself entirely because the people who were</v>

28
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:38.260
<v Speaker 2>attending it decided that the conference itself had become too white.</v>

29
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 2>So they went,</v>

30
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.791
<v Speaker 2>they will get it.</v>

31
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:40.624
<v Speaker 2>They were all there.</v>

32
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Speaker 2>So they had this Hashtag um,</v>

33
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.600
<v Speaker 2>white privilege conference.</v>

34
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 2>So what WPC,</v>

35
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.683
<v Speaker 2>so white,</v>

36
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.501
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

37
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 2>and it started after one of the speakers there who was a white historian,</v>

38
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.091
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

39
00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 2>went over time and won an Asian American,</v>

40
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.091
<v Speaker 2>attend a,</v>

41
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 2>a woman tweeted out,</v>

42
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 2>great keynote,</v>

43
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.490
<v Speaker 2>but going over time a lot.</v>

44
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 2>It is another example of white supremacy,</v>

45
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag white privileged conference so wise.</v>

46
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>And he also made them</v>

47
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 2>stake of using the n word in his speech.</v>

48
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean he obviously was using it in a historical context cause he was talking</v>

49
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 2>about race in America.</v>

50
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 2>But once that happened,</v>

51
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.531
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

52
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean what could possibly go wrong using the n word at a conference about white</v>

53
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:20.191
<v Speaker 2>guilt,</v>

54
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

55
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Then everyone starts tweeting inward.</v>

56
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Never acceptable from Hashtag white folks lips deeply offensive and traumatizing</v>

57
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 2>hashtag white privilege conference.</v>

58
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 2>So white and that was from a white</v>

59
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.291
<v Speaker 1>tweeter.</v>

60
00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>So then it's like a snake eating its fucking tail.</v>

61
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:35.111
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

62
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:38.740
<v Speaker 1>All these white people just accusing one another of being too white.</v>

63
00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>You're all white.</v>

64
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.713
<v Speaker 1>We get it,</v>

65
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.643
<v Speaker 1>we get it.</v>

66
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>It's would Michael Shermer calls virtue signaling.</v>

67
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.493
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

68
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

69
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

70
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>They're letting the good,</v>

71
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect for a term there.</v>

72
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:54.711
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to find someone who's made some sort of an error and they're</v>

73
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.890
<v Speaker 1>attacking them with full force.</v>

74
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

75
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's also like they're ignoring context on purpose.</v>

76
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like by saying that the word is,</v>

77
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>it's never acceptable to say the n word.</v>

78
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.130
<v Speaker 1>By saying that and putting that in a tweet,</v>

79
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

80
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>

81
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

82
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 1>if there's a reason to say it,</v>

83
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>if you were explaining something that happened,</v>

84
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:19.000
<v Speaker 1>what someone said,</v>

85
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 1>how they said it,</v>

86
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>you are allowed to repeat the word.</v>

87
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you're not allowed to repeat the word around grown adults is to</v>

88
00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:27.130
<v Speaker 1>pretend that word is magic.</v>

89
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>So pretend that word's going to conjure demon.</v>

91
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.571
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

92
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 2>it also empowers the word I.</v>

93
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:31.251
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

94
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I feel stupid for even having used the phrase,</v>

95
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:34.340
<v Speaker 2>the end would cause ordinarily I just say nigger,</v>

96
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 2>if I'm talking about the existence of that was shot the podcast on,</v>

97
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:37.751
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

98
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm Australian so I don't understand context.</v>

99
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:40.634
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

100
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I was talking about this a,</v>

101
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm on my podcast about,</v>

102
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I do think that we,</v>

103
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 2>we've gotten away from like where is the other person's heart and what is their</v>

104
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:50.114
<v Speaker 2>intention?</v>

105
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

106
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

107
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.283
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

108
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.123
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

109
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.053
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

110
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you could think of it like an Amoeba around your physical body,</v>

111
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.273
<v Speaker 1>cloud</v>

112
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

113
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.103
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

114
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 3>pulsating thought forms.</v>

115
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.813
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

116
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

117
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 3>as you're imagining,</v>

118
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.113
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

119
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

120
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.613
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

121
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 3>the beautiful elements of life and things,</v>

122
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

123
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be in a kind of order and uh,</v>

124
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.590
<v Speaker 3>and maybe kind of wafting upward it,</v>

125
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 3>these are like,</v>

126
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.173
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

127
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

128
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 3>the spiritual positive,</v>

129
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

130
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 3>kind of frameworks sometimes that you're seeing life through when you're</v>

131
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:34.354
<v Speaker 3>tripping,</v>

132
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

133
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 3>and seeing the connections between things,</v>

134
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 3>lines forming and things like that.</v>

135
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.470
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

136
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 3>the more kind of organic geometries that that show up,</v>

137
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 3>you see this intelligence of life and the,</v>

138
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

139
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

140
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 3>the light of divine intelligence that came through for Allison,</v>

141
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 3>like in this language,</v>

142
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

143
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 3>it's seems to be weaving things together and when you're in touch with that</v>

144
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 3>infinite light that seems to be the source,</v>

145
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

146
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.460
<v Speaker 3>then that is it.</v>

147
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Speaker 3>You can keep it upwardly moving and very evolutionarily caught cosmically</v>

148
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 3>consciously moving forward.</v>

149
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.750
<v Speaker 3>And when then you're thinking regretful thoughts or thinking negative thoughts</v>

150
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 3>and anger and things like that.</v>

151
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:28.760
<v Speaker 3>There's a constriction that goes on in your heart I think,</v>

152
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 3>and kind of shuts things down in that kind of like you were saying,</v>

153
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 3>twisting in,</v>

154
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 3>curling in and darkening and,</v>

155
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 3>and things are,</v>

156
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.163
<v Speaker 3>are all,</v>

157
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

158
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 3>things that when you're journeying,</v>

159
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.610
<v Speaker 3>you see them manifest literally and you're the flow of your,</v>

160
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 3>the theater of your imagination.</v>

161
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 3>And so I think you really beautifully described that.</v>

162
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.653
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

163
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 3>just in that I was totally there.</v>

164
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a disease of consciousness.</v>

165
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very similar to catching a cold that,</v>

166
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:03.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

168
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>you don't see the cold,</v>

169
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a disease,</v>

170
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.611
<v Speaker 1>you don't see it,</v>

171
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>but it affects you.</v>

172
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's an analogy to be made about diseases of consciousness that</v>

173
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you can get locked into these terrible ways of looking at the world.</v>

174
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I found for a while I enjoyed living within very strict guidelines.</v>

175
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>It was just easier when we go to a restaurant because I used to joke that I</v>

176
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>would like to be buried and a bread basket with a fuck ton of butter,</v>

177
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>like bread and butter is my thing.</v>

178
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

179
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>and when we go to a restaurant and they bring the bread,</v>

180
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:39.491
<v Speaker 1>like I just,</v>

181
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:40.324
<v Speaker 1>I don't even touch it.</v>

182
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not mine.</v>

183
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.241
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

184
00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>it was so,</v>

185
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>it was nice to not even have to think about all these things.</v>

186
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

187
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

188
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

189
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

190
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>a few months ago I just thought,</v>

191
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like this is really doing anything for me anymore.</v>

192
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.560
<v Speaker 1>And I miss my lean cuisine dinners,</v>

193
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>which is what I used to eat.</v>

194
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] cuisine.</v>

195
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.781
<v Speaker 1>They're not bad.</v>

196
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:00.614
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

197
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I know all the things you can miss.</v>

198
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

199
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>healthy choice dinners as well.</v>

201
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck you doing with that process?</v>

202
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.304
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

203
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I know I had stopped eating the process of which I missed.</v>

204
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I missed the bullshit I missed.</v>

205
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I missed the wood pulp wood.</v>

206
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>What is Wood Paul?</v>

207
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>It's probably some kind of filler in there.</v>

208
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying there's like wood pulp in your food in Parmesan cheese,</v>

209
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

210
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't that come out recently?</v>

211
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

212
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

213
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

214
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Jamie knows Jamie,</v>

215
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:31.161
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

216
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:31.530
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

217
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.781
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

218
00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:34.330
<v Speaker 1>What kind of Parmesan cheese and just the,</v>

219
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

220
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you know the bottle of Kraft parmesan cheese.</v>

221
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.990
<v Speaker 1>It came out that a certain percentage of it is like wood shavings or something.</v>

222
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.833
<v Speaker 1>Hearts.</v>

223
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

224
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Why are they putting wood in your cheese so that there's a,</v>

225
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>it's day just plants though.</v>

226
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.431
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

227
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:49.821
<v Speaker 1>Cheese.</v>

228
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>You sprinkle co what?</v>

229
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Cellulose.</v>

230
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.081
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

231
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:54.891
<v Speaker 1>Hotly contested.</v>

232
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:55.780
<v Speaker 1>But perhaps now for reasons,</v>

233
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

234
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Think FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company,</v>

235
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:02.460
<v Speaker 1>castle cheese incorporated had doctored it's so-called Parmesan with it.</v>

236
00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose.</v>

237
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Also known as wood pulp.</v>

238
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

239
00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 1>well if you say cellulose,</v>

240
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:09.580
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sound right.</v>

241
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

242
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Cellulose just sounds like like fiber from plants.</v>

243
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Plant material.</v>

244
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

245
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

246
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Well there shouldn't be plant material and fucking cheese.</v>

247
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:19.544
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

248
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>assholes should go to jail for that.</v>

249
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Putting fucking wooden cheese.</v>

250
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't just do that and you can't mix cheddar cheese with wood and call it</v>

251
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:28.484
<v Speaker 1>Parmesan.</v>

252
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.920
<v Speaker 1>So attached should have its own new variety name,</v>

253
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.441
<v Speaker 1>wood,</v>

254
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:33.861
<v Speaker 1>pulp,</v>

255
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>cheesy thing,</v>

256
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.280
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

257
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Just call it that.</v>

258
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

259
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>People would buy it.</v>

260
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>My mouth is watering.</v>

261
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

262
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you're eating lean cuisine and saying,</v>

263
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is in the processed frozen dinners that I like,</v>

264
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I like.</v>

265
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like when I smoked,</v>

266
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:48.921
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

267
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:49.101
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

268
00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the fiberglass in the cigarettes that I like.</v>

269
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
