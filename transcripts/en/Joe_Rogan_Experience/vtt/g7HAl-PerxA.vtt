1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.070
All right,
we're alive.
We're going in.
I'm here with Nick Depaulo.
Brian red band.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello Ladies and gentlemen.
And we're looking at the Cha,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.040
the tunnel that they dug under,
I believe his name is El Chapo.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.290
El Chapo Guzman.
Uh,
respect,
respect for everyone.
You know,

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.150
forget about all this terrible shit.
I'm sure that guy has done.
Listen,

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.160
you got to,
you got to give props when they're due.
This guy had,

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.980
I mean he's got a fucking plan.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.720
He executed it like God Damn Clint Eastwood Movie.
This is a movie.

9
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.740
I'm a contract.

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.630
The work that the tunnel was perfect for Chrysler and he was in jail for a year.

11
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.960
So I wonder if it took a year for them to do this.
Oh Christ.

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.010
He's wondering how they did it.

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.890
Probably got a crew of six and they did it in three hours.

14
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.400
They talk to fucking mile tunnel.

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.050
Here's a video of him going into the hole to see if he could find the video

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.780
cause you actually see him go up.
See Ya.
He just fucking,

17
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.660
he just goes over to buy.
Whereas toilet is and just steps down into,

18
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.430
I'm not kidding,
man.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
That was a staircase.

19
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.510
It's like a movie and it's going to end with Trump.
You know,
all my God,

20
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.340
the baby's can be trumped.
Do you know his,
his um,
his son said something.

21
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:15.570
He texted something.
Jesus Christ.

22
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:17.400
How terrified must trumpy right now.

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.690
Do you imagine this fucking guy who can dig a tunnel a mile under the ground?

24
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.080
It comes up behind Trump Trump's house.
He's trying to kick your ass.

25
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.860
Isn't it weird that history is tweeted now?
Like it's in the past?

26
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:32.640
It used to be like by horse and messaged carrier.
Now it's strange.

27
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.230
So strange people on the run have,
you know,
well,
you've tested Twitter.

28
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.080
When you find out something happened,
like somebody died,

29
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.960
what do you do immediately?
I go to Twitter immediately.

30
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.420
I just go look in the timeline and that's for sure.
Something who it is.

31
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.230
Depends who it is.
A died my check my space on a couple of those guys.
Yeah,

32
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.540
like you would he would he see like rip?
Like,
like,
uh,

33
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.120
Leonard Nimoy was a big one for me.
I was like,
aw,
fuck's Bach.

34
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.830
Fucking Spock died and immediately went to Twitter and Bam.
It was right there.

35
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.480
I had a look at this.
He's got a motorcycle.
Sorry.
When we're watching this,

36
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.830
the hunt for El Chapo,
El Chapo was a fucking motorcycle and a juggle whiskey.

37
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.950
Like what does that jog on the front seat?
Can,

38
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.690
he's going to fucking party as soon as he gets on that thing.
I want to,

39
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:25.750
I want a motorbike and a gallon.
A cider.
This is like El Machete.

40
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.130
I mean it really is like he gets down through the hole.

41
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:32.850
There's a motorcycle with fine line rails on rails,

42
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.050
like a ride at fucking Disney and he's,
and he's gone look at that tunnel costs.

43
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:41.970
5 million took a year to build.
Holy Shit.
Boy.

44
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:46.020
The authorities are really fucking on top of it.
Huh?
How funny is that though?

45
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:48.270
That they take a wild guess at 5 million pitch?

46
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.430
You don't know how much we can get that price.

47
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.080
Just guessing what we call home depot and they said the,
uh,

48
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.720
the two by fours or late 60,
all the amount of 30 out of this place.

49
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.350
And I think you've got to factor in and union costs.
This is where,

50
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.860
this is his toilet.
So he,
what he did was they built it right behind the stall.

51
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.140
So I guess he has like a little bit of privacy there and that's where they

52
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:12.700
fucked up.
They gave him like a little bit of Shit or privacy.
Yeah.
Which,
which,

53
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.050
you know,
why would he do that?

54
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.080
Well now they know you can't give the Guy Shit or privacy.

55
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:21.940
If you catch them now you have to shit in the front of yourself.
I mean,
come on.

56
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:24.760
This is crazy.
This is like,
it's a colonoscopy.
Look Joe,

57
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.740
my butthole looks that good.
We're very happy.
It's that wide and clean.

58
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.900
It's ready to go licked out

59
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.210
this all protein powder stuck at assign fucking Elaine energy drinks and Joe

60
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.340
Coffee and all that.
They'll shakes and Moose.

61
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.960
That's my prostate and the wire hanging out on electronic prostate.
You see,

62
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:48.820
they're going to be able to make artificial penises.

63
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.240
They say within the next five years they're going to have lab created penises.

64
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.270
I'm already on the list.
He didn't like a year ago.

65
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.150
Can you imagine having the first generation of them?
Well,
I was at,
um,

66
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.530
I was in Miami the other day and I saw this woman that had an artificial,

67
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:06.280
but like the most obvious hot artificial butter or saying bad mouth.

68
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.020
It was so bizarre.
It was so strange.
But what happened was just went crazy.

69
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.310
You know,
she didn't say,
well,

70
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:14.530
and we'll get it and want to get a little butt lift out a little.
No,

71
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:17.830
she went nuts.
Here's El Chapo.
Watch this.
Watch them walk through this.

72
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.700
This is hilarious.
He's just hanging out.
Yeah.
You know,

73
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:25.750
just in my cell another day,
no big deal.
And then they give them like a knock,

74
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:28.510
knock,
knock.
He goes,
all right,
let's fucking do this.
And it goes back there.

75
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.050
Steps down.
Uber's here.
It's over.
How the fuck,

76
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.720
how the fuck do you know?
Respect that.
And for him,

77
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:39.920
5 million.
Like what a bargain.
You know,

78
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.030
it looked like he was doing that trick that people do when they walk behind a

79
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:44.440
wall that are potty.
They go like,
Hey,

80
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.280
do that when you're drunk.
The fake staring in the face tick.

81
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.100
That's exactly what it looked like.
That's hilarious.
And he's gone.

82
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.580
He's gone for now.
They had to be some cooperation and that was like too easy.

83
00:04:57.581 --> 00:05:02.260
Now I know why you assume that you know you always think the worst of people and

84
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.000
I think that's one of your fault buddy,

85
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.380
which I'm like fucking strong points when you look at that and it's like,

86
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.560
I mean if that's about as clear an example of an inside job as you're ever going

87
00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:17.050
to fucking fuck nobody hurt digging,
nobody heard nothing.

88
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.490
Nothing motorcycle starting up do you guys didn't notice that there's one lone

89
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:23.650
house that was just built a mile away.

90
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.800
He didn't know exactly where was the output?
Was it a house?

91
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.570
I thought I heard a dirt bike starting up in El Chapo.
No,
nothing.
My friend,

92
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.090
I smelled whiskey jug forum guy gas out there.

93
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.350
It gets a fucking jug of whiskey or whatever it was in that job.
Definitely.

94
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:41.700
It'd be Taylor.
I'm assuming it was booze made maybe a little,
a lot of fellows.

95
00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:46.210
I mean it was a ton true.
Well,
he had a regular cell so they,
you know,

96
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.770
it wasn't like Goodfellas style.

97
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.770
Remember those guys just in the stacks coming in.

98
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.230
They're slicing the garlic with the razor blade.

99
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.680
You know who just knew how to make the sauce.
Yeah,
that fucking sauce.

100
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.950
I tried that after that.
I tried slicing the garlic with a route in.

101
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:05.590
I believe it's very annoying.
Yeah,
it's so not worth it.

102
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.920
My grandmother would even do that shit.

103
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.370
That's the kind of shit you do when you were in jail.
So He's no pussy.
You're,

104
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.960
you're lost and trapped in this horrible environment where people tell you what

105
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:19.910
to do every day.
I just decided to find out new ways to chop garlic,
but they,

106
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.790
some people did live like that,
right?
Like that's real shit.

107
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.780
Like really did have like cordoned off areas in jails.

108
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.600
How the fuck did they ever pull that off?
Same Way El Chapo.

109
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.240
But that's even kind of crazier cause at least El Chapo,

110
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.720
you could kind of say you didn't know until the end if there's a whole section

111
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:40.721
of your jail carpets over the fucking bar so he can't see in and you smell

112
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.350
cooking and the guards getting mad because they don't have fans.

113
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:49.010
So they're frying steaks in there.
Yes.
Smokes cat and everywhere.

114
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.170
Those two guys that brought,
brought up upstate New York,
in that prison,

115
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:57.470
you were allowed to put sheets up to block the view of the,

116
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.710
we can put sheets in front of you.
So yes,
that was allowed.

117
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.940
So it became like a really shitty apartment.
Yeah,
exactly.

118
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.720
Exactly.
I mean,

119
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:12.650
how was that allowed in a prison that doesn't seem like prison ish and hillbilly

120
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:14.300
bill.
I mean,
what the fuck that's gotta be?

121
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.610
One of the weirdest things about being a prison is that you don't,

122
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.670
no one sees you see everybody like no one.

123
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.080
And was any privacy feel like constantly exposed to it.
That's very unnatural.

124
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.350
Just that alone.
I mean you got to,

125
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.750
but obviously you see something like this where all he had was like a little,

126
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.350
little tiny wall over the shitter,
like next to the shitter.

127
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.060
I don't even like shitting at Fenway,
you know?

128
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:37.310
I can't imagine being in a cell than other guy three feet away.

129
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.220
There's those decisions you have to make though,
right?
Like Airport Shit,

130
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.901
you've got to go,

131
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:45.650
we're just going to do this regardless of how disgusting it smells in there and

132
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:47.330
what what was in the toilet already.

133
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.940
Sometimes you just got to get rid of a package.
Those are the worst.
The airport,

134
00:07:50.941 --> 00:07:52.410
especially international terminal,

135
00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:56.170
she got 11 different odors coming out of live in different stuff you could carry

136
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.930
next fucking coffee from Colombia food court.

137
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.380
I was in Miami the other day and I had to go through immigration and when I was

138
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:04.790
going through the immigration thing,

139
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.990
there's this giant fucking line of people and everywhere you looked as he Ebola

140
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:13.850
signs does he signs like if you have an elevated temperature,
don't do this,

141
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:15.390
don't do that.
And they have all these,

142
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.250
there's like four or five Ebola signs right in front of me.
Warning.

143
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.480
Have you been to Liberia?
Have you been to?
We went,
we were in Costa Rica.

144
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.260
It's Liebherr.
[inaudible] but it's spelled Liberia.

145
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.850
You know,
my wife is like,
are we going to get Ebola?

146
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.650
Like is very bold on this fucking no,
it's Africa like us.
The need for borders,

147
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:39.890
Joe.
But what about those poor people that have Ebola?

148
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.990
What do we over fuck everybody in the world of fucking,

149
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.380
I just don't think that we deserve it.
I know you don't even know.

150
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.990
I'm Rose's country.
How dare you
hate this?

151
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.930
America,
can I.
Dot.
I love this country.
I just think that other people are,

152
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.010
they are fucked.
We

153
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.630
<v 1>need to help him there.
There we are.
We're in trouble.</v>

154
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.021
There's not enough.

155
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:05.090
There's no way we'd be paying way more if we were actually helping Africa.
Now.

156
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.950
That's true.
I just need what we're rebuilding.
You know,

157
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:11.010
if like if we rebuild Iraq,
imagine if we just decided to do that.

158
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:14.240
Just start rebuilding infrastructures of cities just without war.

159
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.260
It's going there.
Big Time.
Government contracts just rebuild like Liberia,

160
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.850
Liberia,
if you've never seen it,

161
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:25.320
there's a vice documentary on it and have a summer home over there inside or

162
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:29.310
outside the shit way cause it's like an area where people just shit on the

163
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:30.020
street.

164
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.280
You've got to make sure you want to make sure you're not downwind of that.

165
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.020
Real estate prices are very north east,

166
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.060
south of the property value.
It's,
well uh,

167
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.000
Shane Smith from vice went down there years ago and they did this,
um,

168
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.690
this documentary on how crazy Liberia was.
You'll love this.

169
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.590
One of the things that happened in Liberia is I believe it was a place where

170
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:56.040
they put a lot of slaves once they were set free once,

171
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:58.170
like American slaves and went back to Africa.

172
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:00.970
I think that was also a big part of Liberia and the,
the,

173
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.330
the government collapsed there.
I give you,

174
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:04.560
if you're really interested in the story,

175
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.750
don't listen to it for me cause I'm going to butcher it.

176
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.930
But Shane's a vice piece kind of details where that country went wrong and you

177
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:15.870
know,
it's,
it's fucking chaos there now.

178
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.060
Like they had their server like eat these little carts where they serve food on

179
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:21.800
the side of the road.

180
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.110
They were serving human meat and you don't have this guy recognized,
get that.

181
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:25.944
And Los Anica

182
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.540
recognizes it because he had her eating human meat,

183
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:32.580
so he knew what it tasted like,
so he turned the guy in.

184
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.670
It is what part of that story was I suppose to love.
You Go,

185
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:38.490
you'll love them that you're going to end slavery.
You loved all of that.

186
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:42.480
I thought you'd be in this.
You'll go,
you'll love this,

187
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:45.240
and you went right into the slavery part.
Like I'm pro slavery.

188
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.920
That's not what I'm saying.
You love this because it's fascinating.
Oh,
you love.

189
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:52.800
It's because it's fascinating.
Not because you love it.
I didn't say specific.

190
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.540
I love it.
You were saying everybody does that to me.

191
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.190
You have one too many appearances on Fox News.
They just like Nicholas.

192
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.360
You're our go to guy.
They won't even have me on anymore.
Really?

193
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:06.870
They're like just to racist.
No,
fucking racist.

194
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.260
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
I don't think you want to just say that.

195
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:14.100
I win the argument,
Joe.
It's true how it works.
That is true.
I know it is true,

196
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:19.080
right?
That's one of the for your racist or sexist or misogynist,
like,
oh shit.

197
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.730
By the way,
all words that were made up,

198
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:23.970
they're not even part of the fucking Latin.
They were made up for the causes.

199
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:25.260
I don't know if you know that,
but uh,

200
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:30.300
I'm a fan of America and we don't go by Latin language.
We have American English.

201
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.180
We're done with that Latin shit.
We add onto it as we like CIS gender.

202
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.190
You've got to start adopting that.
Don't even understand what that means.

203
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.900
CISGENDER.
Do you know what that means?

204
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:45.470
That means if you are heterosexual and you are the gender of your birth,

205
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.510
so if you are a heterosexual white man,

206
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:53.800
you are a cis gendered white man.

207
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.840
<v 0>What does that mean exactly?
Let's just adopt it.
Let's get something straight.</v>

208
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.860
Flat.
It's exactly,
exactly.

209
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.210
And gender is not a social construct and we get that right.
How dare you?

210
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.140
Some girls second by social construct last night.
Oh,

211
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.920
you fucking lesbian pipe.
I look at the sauce.

212
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.220
I'll fucking outrageous a statement by Nick Depalo.
Um,
genders.

213
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:24.640
Definitely not a social construct.
It's a,
there's males and females,

214
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.200
but there's also a spectrum inside that male and female and there's women who

215
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:32.160
are men or men or women and they absolutely think that's absolutely right.

216
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.930
I don't think it does.
You can deny it at a certain point in time.

217
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:37.270
Right now that's just biology.

218
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.110
But I'll say CIS gender just cause it's fun just because I feel silly saying it.

219
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:45.690
It's got the word [inaudible] in.
It almost seems like a pro lesbian thing.
Yeah.

220
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.970
Sis Gender.
Yeah.
Umbro gender,

221
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.870
Bro.
Gendered.
That's,
that's a guy who wants things the old fashioned way.

222
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.470
Now.
All of that to reactionary.
Yeah.
Reactionary.

223
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:02.350
I used to think as someone who reacts to things quickly,
everybody did,

224
00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:03.580
and then it's a right wing.

225
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.780
It's reacting to things in a right wing slant because somebody said that about

226
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:10.300
my act,
about me being a reactionary,
like what do they mean?

227
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.370
Does he mean I jumped down the throats?
A heckler?
Yeah.

228
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.330
Well it sounds like that's what it should mean,
right?

229
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:18.160
It's what everybody thinks it initially.

230
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.430
That's one of those weird words like how do you make up a new word?

231
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:25.090
Why do you have the same word is reaction,
reaction,
you know best saying.

232
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.740
I mean like you already have reaction.

233
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:29.920
We all know what that means and everybody knows what Arie means.
You add it,

234
00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:32.680
you're doing it right.
You're reactionary.
What are you doing?

235
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:34.720
Why are you making a new definition yet?
Fuck.

236
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:39.010
Am I looking at you like Brian made a dictionary,
Webster over there.

237
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.030
Why?

238
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:45.030
I tried to say 1000th 1000th that is not easy and I can't do it in 1000 thousand

239
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.030
yeah,
I had to think about that.
Can you do that?
Well,
1000th 1000th,

240
00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.460
that's not easy.
I just fucked it up.

241
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.570
But you had a concentrate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that weird.
Yeah,
it's a weird one.

242
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.310
But if you had a hair lip,
it's a real pitch.
I was like freaking out for top guy.

243
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.970
Is Jack Jockeying Phoenix?
Is he like the most successful here?

244
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:16.510
Lift guy ever or is it the guy who was Stacy Keach?

245
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.560
Which guy has that ever been asked?
It's the best question.
I'm looking.

246
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.480
It's a good to question.
She had a hair lip said Ryan.

247
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:29.110
He just doesn't believe he didn't believe he did or am I confusing?

248
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:32.380
I always computers.
What was that show he was on?

249
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.900
He's been on a lot of stuff.
That detective show.
I'll wait a minute.
I think Kate,

250
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:41.570
she's alive.
I'm confusing him with a guy that Jamie,
you'll find out.
Is he alive?

251
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.680
All right.
Stacy,
how does the ONA introductions for opiod?

252
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.300
Anthony didn't know that.
Yes.
Is that right?
Yes.

253
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.940
See if you could find Stacy Keach reading opie and Anthony introduction cause

254
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:56.510
it's fucking awesome.
I always confuse him with a guy that was in,

255
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.350
you know what with Dinero and Charles Grodin.
Uh,

256
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.870
you know the Oh road movie flushes man.
Midnight run.

257
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.810
What's the guy's name?
But he reminds me,
Stacy Keach,

258
00:15:10.811 --> 00:15:13.070
the handsome guy who just died.
He's dead by the way,

259
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.760
with a mustache to played the bad guy.
Serrano.
What the fuck?

260
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.490
This is what happens and I sleep two hours a night.
I'm like member's name Eric.

261
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.260
Nope.
Make some motions over there.

262
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:23.360
I was going to go to you is one of my backup guy.

263
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.850
There's a few of those guys like that.
Like Stacy Keach was always in those.

264
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.180
Charles Grodin.
No,
not groans.
And your guy that played the bad guy.

265
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:36.640
He's been in every gap for Dennis freelance dentist.
He just died a while ago.

266
00:15:36.641 --> 00:15:38.960
Died.
He died,
which shocked me.
He looked like a healthy,

267
00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:42.500
like handsome guy who was going to live.
Well,
there's still did.

268
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.370
How was it being sarcastic?
He did look yellow.
It was very vibrant.

269
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.830
He was a Chicago cop in real life.
Well that's

270
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.590
probably the stress you probably right to be drank like a fish.
Right?
Well,

271
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:57.290
I was talking to this lady yesterday,
Doctor Rhonda Patrick.

272
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.760
He's brilliant doctor,

273
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:03.110
and she was talking about the effects of aging on the effects of partying,

274
00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:07.370
drinking,
and he then just bad health and how much it can age your body,
age,

275
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.090
literally your biological body.
I don't know why I'm looking at Dennis Farina

276
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.470
with Dennis Furry.
It's good stuff.
But Dennis Farina freak out in here.
No,

277
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.120
you'd be all right.
You sure we're friends.
All bleed together.

278
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.860
I'll hold your hand,
but uh,
Dennis Farina,

279
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:29.780
by going through all those years as a cop,

280
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:33.110
you've got to think the fucking stress of that.
You,
you,
you,
you pay for that.

281
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:34.220
You pay with that for a long time.

282
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.260
But that's one of the reasons why he was so believable.
I can sense right.

283
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.760
How good was that's right.
And snatched it.
Yeah.
You believe,

284
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:43.610
even though he was sort of tongue and cheek while he was doing it,

285
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.470
he was still on board.
That he observed that he was that fucking guy.
You know,

286
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.850
he was a good actor,
man.
Yeah.
He was bombing to shout.

287
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.570
That was a bummer.
But listen to this Stacy Keach thing.
This is the Stacy Keach,

288
00:16:56.571 --> 00:16:57.780
opie and Anthony.
Thank you.
York City

291
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.520
I would love to say we have the best job in America and did it Kumiai and

292
00:17:11.521 --> 00:17:14.400

293
00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:19.130
And the gym North out loud laugh.
How do we explain the show?
We should start,

294
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.210
<v 0>oh,
here</v>

295
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.551
<v 2>is the treatment.</v>

296
00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:25.720
And make up the opie and Anthony show a popular radio program known for the

297
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.640
cream style of entertainment.
Very few limits.
Oh Shit.

298
00:17:30.641 --> 00:17:32.300
This is a freak show out.
Anyway.

299
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:35.830
Anybody want to come on his self as it guests under the right circumstances?

300
00:17:35.831 --> 00:17:40.360
Something weird going to happen.
I don't give a fuck.
Laugh out loud,

301
00:17:40.361 --> 00:17:41.194
That's what I love.

302
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.220
In the past they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and they've even

303
00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:48.990
got from their show suspended from satellite radio and listen to our show you

304
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.580

You know what we are every day and to conquer,
fall down the jokes.

305
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:55.740

Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.
Use

310
00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:17.320
<v 0>The opie and Anthony show.
So powerful.
The hell do we.
That's about,</v>

311
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.910
that's about as good an intro as any radio guys ever gotten except Stacy Keach

312
00:18:22.911 --> 00:18:27.911
region afro like Joe Rogan started his podcast five years ago.

313
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.690
Well,
I started a podcast because of opiate.
Anthony is that Brian and I,

314
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.800
we had done some other shit before.
We'd done like Justin TV and um,

315
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.820
we had done like these little things where you,
you know,

316
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:43.700
you do like a little a live read off the laptop camera and talk to people and

317
00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:46.610
you check Twitter questions and shit.
We fucked around with that a few times.

318
00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.470
But when Anthony set up his green screen in his basement and started doing that

319
00:18:51.471 --> 00:18:55.560
live from the compound show,
it was like,
Whoa,
Tom Green,
Tom Green,

320
00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.713
sane.

321
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.760
He had servers in his house like those fucking long giant fucking sewer cables

322
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.220
running through his living room.
All we had the whole deal.

323
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.990
He had a whole server room.
You would go in the room.
They,

324
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.060
it was everything like those,
those homes out Jesus' hands and shit.
You're like,

325
00:19:14.061 --> 00:19:17.490
whoa.
I talked to him Monday,
add him on this show and uh,

326
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:21.050
he meets at this doughnut place now.
He has a studio now in Burbank.

327
00:19:21.051 --> 00:19:24.350
He moved it out of his house and he meets at this doughnut place,
next store.

328
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.130
And I for his studio audience as he's like,
he'll periscope and go,

329
00:19:28.131 --> 00:19:29.660
anyone who comes into his doughnut place,

330
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.070
you can be a part of my studio audience.

331
00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:34.790
And then they all go over to his studio and they did the show in front of wow.

332
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.240
Just complete strangers.
He meets at a doughnut place.
That's perfect for him.

333
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.610
Yeah.
He was a super pioneer.
Tom Green's show that fucking original MTA show.

334
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.870
Very,
very underrated show.
He's a pioneer.
He's a funny,

335
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:52.230
a good dude man.
Very,
very good dude.
Yeah,

336
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.560
he's a good dude.
We need more of them down here.
I think.

337
00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:57.920
I did think he was on that fucking celebrity pool show that I did

338
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.130
too.
And that girlfriend,
that TV.
That's hilarious.
Yeah,
he's just,
yeah,

339
00:20:04.131 --> 00:20:05.800
he was on that and I'm pretty sure piece of,

340
00:20:05.801 --> 00:20:10.310
he's always been like a really cool dude,
you know,
just so interesting.
Weird guy.

341
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:10.911
And you know what,

342
00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:14.150
it didn't start doing standup until later in life and got really good.

343
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.450
Like he had a showtime special and I was sitting in front of the TV and I think

344
00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:20.690
he'd only been doing standup like four or five years and it was funny.

345
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.990
It was funny.
It was well written,
it was well put together.

346
00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:26.840
He had really good points.
Has been about texting,

347
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.750
what people's thumbs are going to look like and what they're,

348
00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.910
how they're going to change.
It was fucking hilarious.
It was really good.

349
00:20:31.911 --> 00:20:35.300
It was like well acted out.
I was like,
this guy looks like a 10 year comic,

350
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.390
but it's just because he had done so many other things and he's like really used

351
00:20:38.391 --> 00:20:42.000
to comfortable in front of Peter.
Tom Green's bad motherfucker.

352
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.860
He killed it Monday man.
He had the crowd going crazy.

353
00:20:45.861 --> 00:20:48.010
He did a 20 minutes sat to

354
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.450
<v 1>on the show.
I'm sure he's an animal.
He's good and he's working hard too.</v>

355
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.400
That's another thing about that guy.
He's always doing something.

356
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:57.220
He's always working,
you know,
he doesn't,
you know,
it doesn't rest.

357
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.590
It's always trying to improve things.
So like him,

358
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.760
like that definitely influenced us.
But opie and Anthony did about the,

359
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:06.160
by the way,
they held their show like they were,

360
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:08.970
the only show that I ever went on was a hang that's,
you know,

361
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.080
I brought guys in and I'm like,
Hey,
this is my friend Eddie,

362
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.480
this is my friend Brian is my friend Joey.
This is my friend Ari.

363
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.750
I brought guys in and they were like,
you know,
who's this guy bring them in,

364
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.990
you know,
and they're just so cool like that there.
So they were,

365
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.670
what they did was they turned it into like a fun place to hang out.

366
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.260
So everybody got funny air because of that.
Like it was way like Patrice,

367
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:31.030
this kind of Shit Patrice to at ONA,

368
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.650
you literally could not have done that on any other radio format because people

369
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:39.040
had no Patrice give him the room,
like let them get these rants out.

370
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.640
You had to know like when the rants or come,

371
00:21:40.641 --> 00:21:44.350
we gotta help them along and you've got to not like want to be the center of

372
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:46.300
attention.
Like they had the best,

373
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.830
the best control of the room because like opie would just lay back.

374
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.580
He would just late like literally you'd see him push back and let Norton and

375
00:21:54.581 --> 00:21:57.270
Patrice and you,
you guys would all be fucking yelling at each other.

376
00:21:57.271 --> 00:21:59.770
It'd be hilarious.
Well it's smart actually.

377
00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:02.320
I mean when you've been doing radio that long,
trust me,

378
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.510
there's nothing better than having good guests with it.

379
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.780
You can sit back and let him go cause you're tired of carrying this shit.

380
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.110
But think about how few shows wherever like that's right.
Right.
No,

381
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:14.620
it's a great wrestle few shows.
When you did that show with rd,

382
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:18.130
did they have like a format they had you guys stick to the radio show?

383
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.390
Well yeah because that was a unique situation because it uh,
we were all on TV.

384
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.890
Simulcasts a direct TV.
It had to be,
it had to be more structure,

385
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:28.630
which was to me was the problem,
you know,

386
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.970
and already two already want it to less structure to the men at the dumb idiot

387
00:22:32.971 --> 00:22:36.250
TV gun vault,
which is with a lot of ticket paid what we did and stuff.

388
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.550
But you know,
it takes kind of the fucking,
the craziness.

389
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.640
You can get away with a lot of shit on radio and you can get a lot of what it

390
00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:46.060
will wait with a lot of shit on radio and you can get a lot of away with a lot

391
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:47.020
of shit on the Internet.

392
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.060
And when you look at like something that's on direct TV like that,
I'm like,
boy,

393
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.840
this isn't there a better way to advertise.

394
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:55.060
Can you guys have just like a ticker at the bottom?

395
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.130
Like wouldn't that be a better way to advertise?

396
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:02.540
It just seems like breaking it up and doing every 15 minutes to do like however

397
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:03.101
long it is,

398
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:06.130
like seven minutes or eight minutes off the air where it's just bullshit and

399
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.900
commercials,
then you come back,
it breaks up the whole flow,
like conversations,

400
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:13.960
like the best conversations like this conversation,
like we're having fun.

401
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.140
So a ganache and it keeps going.
Yeah,
we're banging.
Or if we go,
all right,

402
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:18.240
we'll be right back.
Uh,

403
00:23:18.241 --> 00:23:20.710
we have a word from and then we'd have to start all over again.

404
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.570
It is its momentum and rhythm.
You're right.

405
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.690
It's like the difference between driving on the highway and taken side roads.

406
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.180
Like if you took side roads and there's an open highway next to you,

407
00:23:28.181 --> 00:23:31.800
you're an asshole.
Like when you doing,
you know,
but some people they take the

408
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.470
side roads driving motherfuckers.
I'll tell you that,
that,

409
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.820
that weighs app to have that on your fonts.
Amazing.
Cause I,
you know,

410
00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:46.010
I lived out at 15 years ago.
I don't remember the,
to the fucker.
I've

411
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.360
<v 0>been relying on this thing all week.</v>

412
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.020
It's been taking me around traffic and I'm supposed to be on the one on one had

413
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:53.840
kicked me off and I'm looking at people sitting and traffic and like you said,

414
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:58.010
up over hills and shit.
But I'm still moving to them.
I'd rather move and be late,

415
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.950
but you don't even late.
It gets you there faster.
I mean,

416
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.830
it's fucking unbelievable.
Amazing to hear what they're doing though.

417
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.010
Some people in neighborhoods are pissed off because that sometimes ways will

418
00:24:07.011 --> 00:24:08.360
direct it to their neighborhoods.

419
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:12.530
So now these people in neighborhoods are putting fake like reports.
Uh,
yeah.

420
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.940
Once again,
selfish and disrupt.
Damn selfish motherfuckers.

421
00:24:16.941 --> 00:24:21.260
Nick Depaulo little traffic in the fucking bell area.
Get the,
yeah.

422
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:25.040
Well do you remember when cops two cops are pissed because it lets people know

423
00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:28.640
what the cops I've seen is,
you know,
seems to be open season on the cops are,

424
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.650
that's a legitimate point.
Cops are faking it.

425
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.160
They're like putting fake cop like warnings up in spots.

426
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.690
So that would the DELAC looking around everywhere.

427
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.480
Good fighting back now is that when we

428
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.090
come back with deception,
I don't think that should be legal because a,

429
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.540
it's our tax dollars.
I don't,
I don't want to pay tax dollars.

430
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:51.310
Somebody is fucking lying to me.
That's bullshit.
You're lying to ways dare you.

431
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:56.650
It's like I'm the shit that's going on.
What was this other case?
Um,

432
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.960
oh Pida and seaworld that uh,

433
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
a seaworld guide infiltrated Peta and was working from the inside at Peta to try

434
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:09.260
to destroy Peta but can saying a bunch of ridiculous shit.

435
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:13.150
And he was an employee of seaworld.
Is that right?
Oh Man.
I'm out.

436
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.000
Be a good document.
Let me make sure I'm getting that right because it's,

437
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.120
it might be the other way around.

438
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.450
See world either way it would make for a great movie.
Right.

439
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.910
That'd be like a good Jim Carrey movie.
Yeah.

440
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.980
Are you guys ready for divorce fest this year?
Uh,
once they,
Ashley Madison,
uh,

441
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.860
passwords get put into a searchable database online and it's going to,

442
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.680
it's going to cause a way,
but shit that's going on.
It's going to be crazy.

443
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.900
We finally get all who finally let met gay people marry each other.

444
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.260
Got That right?
Yeah.
Now regular Mary just talks.
Yeah.

445
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.550
Like looking at all my friend's wife's going,
Huh?

446
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.480
Why stick to whack?
And it,
it's good.
We'll move.
It's a good move.
It's way safer.

447
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:57.200
Peter says undercovers seaworld employee animal rights activists.

448
00:25:57.201 --> 00:26:02.090
So I did have it right.
That's hilarious.
Really overzealous seaworld employee,

449
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.890
like Paul Blart Mall cop style.
He'll be a great movie.

450
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.170
You can't just call somebody.
You know,
I,
if I was in the movie world,

451
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.520
I would call somebody,
but Melissa McCarthy will be the whale.
Oh,
how dare you.

452
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:22.280
And she's a funny woman around.
Uh,
she's very funny.

453
00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:25.310
She's very physically funny for sure.
She's a very talented,
yeah.

454
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.730
It's funny cause Billy Gardell is a funny comic.
You know Billy,
right?
Yeah.

455
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.970
They don't like on the show.
He's like almost like a straight guy.

456
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.720
Of course wouldn't want the husband getting one over on the wife.
What'd you Joe?

457
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.540
They don't allow that.
Nick does not.
Why is that?

458
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:43.270
What's so what's up with that fuck has jerk offs run Hollywood.
Is that it?

459
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.590
Is that what people want to see?
Do people want to see that?

460
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:48.020
I don't want to see that you don't walk in.

461
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.600
Holly has been hijacked by fucking feminists.
Wow.

462
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.150
I really think am I wrong then if you guys can't relate that and I'm fucking

463
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:55.350
leaving I think.

464
00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:58.740
Do you ever notice the pattern of emasculation and movies and it fucked the last

465
00:26:58.741 --> 00:27:03.450
20 years?
I think there's people that are seriously concerned with coming off as

466
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:08.070
progressive and even if they think differently than what would be the

467
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:08.940
progressive choice,

468
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.670
they will make the progressive choice cause they get like social brownie points.

469
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.000
I definitely think that's true,
but I don't think that pertains to sitcoms.

470
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.960
I think like it's not as funny if the dude gets over on the CIC for someone to

471
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.820
come on.
This is a true story.
One hairstyle,

472
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.260
I might have told you this on the last time I was here,
they had a deal with a,

473
00:27:26.261 --> 00:27:28.290
this was years ago,
Dennis Larry's company.

474
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.060
When we come out here and take a bunch of meetings and forget for like,
you know,

475
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.730
they had a sitcom idea and at first of all,
every meeting,

476
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.790
75% of the room was female executives.

477
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.500
And of course the first question in every meeting was what's the wife's role?

478
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.920
Every fucking one.
So by the time we got to NBC,
which was the last one,

479
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.140
and I had fucking had it,
and they're like,
so what's the wife?
I go and again,

480
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:55.380
I was just kidding.
But I go,
oh,
I don't know.
I see.
Like in the pilot,

481
00:27:55.381 --> 00:27:57.510
she's pregnant and I pushed her down the cellar stairs

482
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.090
and I'm expecting like Dennis to start laughing and in Serpico Jimmy Syrup and

483
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:06.630
they all just look at me.
You could have fucking her and a pen.
So the next day,

484
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.620
next day,
Jimmy SerpBook had to send a dozen roses to the lady from MPs.

485
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.430
Oh my God,
I can't get a Gig.

486
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.260
Thank God you throw me a news radio and a few breaks on the fires and I'd still

487
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:25.530
be using my fucking,
you know,
my high school acting.

488
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.400
You almost got fucked over the news radio gig.
We had to go back and get,
yeah,

489
00:28:29.401 --> 00:28:33.060
that was hilarious,
man.
There was some shenanigans behind the scenes.

490
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.320
Somebody who was trying to get their friend in on the part that nick was
playing.

491
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.610
And I had cast nick as my one brother and Callan is my other brother.
I'm like,

492
00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:42.660
if you want it to be funny,

493
00:28:42.661 --> 00:28:46.290
how about I bring you two really funny standups than I'm actually friends with.

494
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:50.730
Like let's just do it this way.
And so Paul Simms was like,
yeah,
fuck it.
Perfect.

495
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.760
Like you saw,
you had seen some stand up,
you'll you guys hilarious.
Perfect man.

496
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.050
And so,
uh,
you,
you came in and all of a sudden,
you know,
nick calls me up.
He goes,

497
00:28:58.051 --> 00:28:59.430
Hey,
I guess I didn't get the fucking job.

498
00:28:59.431 --> 00:29:02.790
I don't know what happened and what what and that we had to go back down there

499
00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:07.490
and they had cast somebody else and we made them switch it around you.

500
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.800
I didn't even get home and call you.
You.
You came running out.

501
00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:14.040
Remember I was walking to my,
all right,
that's right.
I was walking to my car,

502
00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:16.440
got one.
Then there's another one down the fucking toilet.

503
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.460
I'll be back in Boston and another six weeks of this keeps up and Joe comes

504
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:23.010
running out of nowhere and goes,
they fucked up to,
and then I'm going,

505
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:26.610
now I'm saying,
thinking of myself is Joe just been a great guy.

506
00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.430
I don't want to fuck over a guy who actually was better than me in the audition.

507
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.990
No,
I know you.
No,
no,
no.
It wasn't that at all.
It wasn't that at all.

508
00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:37.590
You was already decided.
Somebody I didn't know that somebody snuck in.

509
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:42.100
It was the decision was made by Paul who was the producer.
He

510
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.010
<v 3>thought you were hilarious and he loved the idea.
Since we're already friends,</v>

511
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.041
I guess it'd be perfect.

512
00:29:46.041 --> 00:29:48.730
Don't know each other and we look like we could be brothers.

513
00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.930
We have this antagonistic relationship on the show with know and I beat the fuck

514
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:56.410
out of each other.
He throws me through a glass window was like,
student is fun.

515
00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.910
I got some through like one of those candy glasses.
You don't even feel it man.

516
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.840
It's just like does it dissolves you go flying,
you hit it and it just dissolves.

517
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:08.140
It's real weird.
Like you're waiting to get cut open.
You know you went into like,

518
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.770
oh this is going to be ugly.
And just,
yeah,
that was fun.
And we had another scene,

519
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:15.140
where are we supposed to,
I don't put a beaten you up or one of the brothers,

520
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.400
but we were hitting you with a glass coffee pot over the head and we started

521
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:21.590
stopping on Ya.
And they watched him through the thing and they go,
hey,

522
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.530
it looks like Goodfellas.
Looks like killing somebody
to Italian for this.

523
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.670
I had a suit jacket off.
Don't miss like Deniro and stomping on

524
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:35.590
the glass.
Fake Glass Coffee Pot.
That was awesome.
That sugar glass.
Yeah,

525
00:30:35.591 --> 00:30:37.500
that was fun.
I forgot about that.
Yeah.
No,

526
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.140
it's funny how your memory fucks with you Joe.
No,
no,
no,
no.

527
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.150
20 years.
Those 20 years ago.
Really?

528
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:50.590
I don't want to hear that.
Isn't that crazy?
I think it was nine to five.

529
00:30:50.591 --> 00:30:51.820
You're right.
I,
I moved out now.

530
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:55.720
I was out in La in 1995 to 99 so it was one of those years and uh,

531
00:30:55.721 --> 00:30:57.490
that's what I can't believe I'm driving around out here.

532
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:03.030
I'm looking at people who were my age when I came off.
Yeah,
the cycle.

533
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.220
You guys used to look at me out here.
They don't even look at me now.
Gay Guys.

534
00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:09.700
I got a friend that we could work on a few days and we can get it back.

535
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.900
We'd get it back.
You're not,
you're a handsome guy.
P 90 exit again.

536
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.600
Last time you were here you were telling me about you did the p nine dx.

537
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:19.650
He lost a ton of weight.
I get fit.
I did that.
You know,

538
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:20.830
he's supposed to do it for three months.

539
00:31:20.831 --> 00:31:24.010
I did it for like 13 months in turn my hips into fucking fine powder.

540
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.100
So now I'm doing Shaunti undoing Shaunti.

541
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.550
What does she mean it and sanity you to stay with it.

542
00:31:30.551 --> 00:31:33.080
You've got your [inaudible].

543
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.720
What's better?
P90X or that?
Well,
this is all body weight.
Is that what it is?

544
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:43.730
Yeah,
there's no way.
You know what Joe,
it's pretty close.
I,

545
00:31:43.731 --> 00:31:46.490
I did this insanity if the thing had this little,
but you know what?

546
00:31:46.491 --> 00:31:49.900
I fucking like it.
Here's the funny thing.
Joe Is the hilarious thing.

547
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.310
I'm doing this and everybody,

548
00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:55.390
I figured everybody in the video is in their twenties and you know,
at old 30th,

549
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:58.950
the oldest and a,
so I'm doing a lot of the modified exercises.
You know,

550
00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:02.020
they always have the fat chick on the front.
It's doing modified.

551
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.310
Everybody else is doing like one hit,
one out,

552
00:32:04.311 --> 00:32:05.920
pushups and me and Catherine and going like this,

553
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:12.340
this will get me in shape by 2046 like I,
but you know what?

554
00:32:12.341 --> 00:32:16.180
It gets your heart rate through the roof.
I mean,
and,
and uh,

555
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.570
I just do it to maintain now,
you know what I mean?
But at work,
I mean it's a,

556
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.010
you can get really good workouts from bodyweight exercises.
Yes.

557
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.950
This is a bunch of them that you can do.

558
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:30.610
There's like a bunch of a full body weight routines that you could do that are

559
00:32:30.611 --> 00:32:33.810
fucking incredible.
They'll kill you.
They break you down.
Yeah.
These have the,

560
00:32:33.811 --> 00:32:34.060
you know,

561
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.450
you're doing those burpee pushups and suicides and 30 minutes so that you know,

562
00:32:38.451 --> 00:32:40.010
and you get a break every five minutes.
You got

563
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.100
<v 0>like a ten second break and it keeps my,
you know,</v>

564
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.500
it allows me to have cigarettes after I work on,

565
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.680
you could do that on the Xbox with the camera that records you.
So it tells you,

566
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:54.730
it knows if you're not doing the arm high enough and point much like you're

567
00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:55.904
white,
your person.

568
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.570
I look at my belly if want to see if that'll tell me I'm not doing it right.

569
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.670
I've always said that that was,

570
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.500
there would be a really good way to teach martial arts.
They have that.

571
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.420
Do they have it?
They have,

572
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:10.190
they have all that stuff now and it uses the body like body tracking and it can

573
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:13.750
tell like how,
how much calories you've burned.
And it's,

574
00:33:13.751 --> 00:33:17.740
it's really cool that I would like to teach you because if,
um,

575
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.560
if you did an instructional and you're showing a guy like how to throw a kick,

576
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:26.360
if you put it on a computer where the lines of the guy's legs were clearly

577
00:33:26.361 --> 00:33:27.020
defined,

578
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.280
you would know if he's like knee wasn't high enough or if his hands were down or

579
00:33:31.281 --> 00:33:32.660
for his back.
What is this?
It right here.

580
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:36.110
You have c has quick workout with Greg Jackson.
Oh.

581
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:39.240
And so the one on the right is the guy,
the little thing and the triangles

582
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.750
video of you and see,
wow,
that's crazy.
And it's like what?

583
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:45.740
Infrared or something like that.

584
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:50.150
So I could tell where your hot spots are and read your heart rate to Oh my God.

585
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:51.920
By looking at Xbox one,

586
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.150
what heart rate by looking at you?

587
00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:01.180
It's thermal camera and we can't beat Isis really fucking shitting me.

588
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.160
Okay.
It's because we don't want to be nice as we want to keep an enemy out of

589
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:09.130
whatever.
Maybe.
Do you think that,
no,
I hear it's frank

590
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.250
UFC personal trainer hitting the Mitts with Frank Mir.
Oh Wow.
Look at this.

591
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:19.430
You throw your punches at his hands.

592
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.190
How many people are going to punch her fucking TV?
This is a terrible idea.
No,

593
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:29.540
anything that's standing close to your TV or TV since this came out.

594
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:33.680
I'll people do stand closer TV.
Matt Bacak whack,
whack,
whack.

595
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.600
So it's a good idea.

596
00:34:35.601 --> 00:34:40.400
I think the way it would be better though is if it was a split screen and the
uh,

597
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.830
the character was begging your characters and much,

598
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:47.360
much larger because you need right now it's a little green guy that was in the

599
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:51.120
Flintstones sitting on your shelf.
Kazoo,
Kazoo.

600
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.540
That's what I'll looks like.
That's exactly what it looks like.

601
00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:02.330
Cause you remember Kazoo?
That's Kazoo.

602
00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:04.950
I know you can find what's a second,
cause I remember,
I feel like,
I know

603
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:12.800
I'm,
I'm not sure.
No,
that's not it.
Um,

604
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.070
that's kind of like maybe like less k.
Yeah.

605
00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.600
K actually who did the voice,

606
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:25.400
Harvey Harvey Coleman from the Carol Burnett show.

607
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:29.660
Wow.
Funny motherfucker.
That was a great fucking show.

608
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.080
He's been gone a while to think about that man.

609
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.950
Someone like the Calbert Carol Burnett show.

610
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.670
That was a show back when there was only like three hits rise.
How Paul exactly.

611
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.330
And they were good.
They were very good.

612
00:35:40.331 --> 00:35:45.331
The honeymooners is a good fucking shot him for like that kind of a sitcom.

613
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.920
It is a good fucking show.
My wife's,
she dvrs the Carol Burnett show now.

614
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.100
I watched a couple of the laugh my balls.
Good man.
I mean the writing,

615
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:57.580
is it funny and smart and what's up?
You want to hear his voice?
Yeah.
Yeah.

616
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:00.563
Wait,
that's,

617
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.560
yeah,
maybe what's going on there?
Look into it first.
That's a song.

618
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:16.590
The the song.
Um,
oh,
uh,
Lucille ball.
That's another fun.

619
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.360
I Love Lucy was a great fun show.
I liked her,

620
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:21.510
the dialog between her and her husband,

621
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:24.450
but when I got into this silly shit with her,
fallen into chocolate and shit,

622
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.470
I dunno.
She lost me a little bit.

623
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.700
They're well written show and he came up with it.
The camera,

624
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.110
the three camera shoot thing.

625
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.590
That was back when it was okay for a white chick to bank a Cuban guy too.
Yeah,

626
00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:42.240
they can't do it.
And beat up by,
well before was like sophisticated.

627
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.360
Like in the 50s and the 60s the hotels,

628
00:36:45.361 --> 00:36:49.560
we would go down there on plantation.
It was very mobbed up,
you know,

629
00:36:49.561 --> 00:36:51.990
they'd go down there and gamble.
It was a wild place.

630
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:54.360
So a guy from Cuba was like a romantic guy.

631
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.140
Like a guy was a fucking musician from Cuba was like,
Whoa,

632
00:36:58.141 --> 00:37:00.900
this guy's like exciting.
He's exotic.
You know.

633
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.440
It was like a good thing for her to be doing this guy with his funky accent.

634
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:09.960
Whereas from then on,
from,
from the embargo on,
it became,
you know,

635
00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:14.961
this enemy that lived off our shores and the Castro years and all that crazy

636
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:20.541
shit and the bay of pigs and the fucking Russian missiles where they're putting

637
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:24.280
missiles in Cuba facing America Macaque.
Fucking crazy.
Yeah.

638
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:28.530
And that was all those post I love Lucy,
which is pretty fucking fascinating.

639
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.690
I blame it on her now.
Like now that you mention it,

640
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.790
now you feel like in red here they put it together.

641
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.570
That Fred Mertz,
I'll tell you,
he was a real antique Cuban guy.

642
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.780
I saw Carol Burnett last year.
I saw her in a restaurant.

643
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:47.130
Did you really get in there Carol Burnett's hanging in there as you look good

644
00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:51.480
man.
Don't live.
Yeah.
She looked very healthy,
very healthy,
very vibrant.

645
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.870
Talking to the waitress and I was on a talk show.
She did.
She looked,

646
00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.780
she's gotta be over 80.
She gotta be way over.
And how about Betty White?
She said,

647
00:37:59.781 --> 00:38:00.300
you know,

648
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.690
she's 82 and I just saw Betty White jogging by this building like 10 minutes for

649
00:38:03.691 --> 00:38:08.060
real.
No.
Yeah.

650
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:11.250
That's how you know when things are bad for you.
Do 80 year old ladies do it.

651
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:15.300
Yeah,
then don't do it.
I used to make fun of these workouts,

652
00:38:15.301 --> 00:38:18.240
people jumping around in the living room and fuck these people were like,

653
00:38:18.241 --> 00:38:22.020
they're going to get in shape.
I do this how I live for it.
You love those things.

654
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.010
They do.
They,
uh,
my problem and you know this Joe,

655
00:38:26.011 --> 00:38:29.490
when you get your heart rate up,
it's the next two days I'm starving,
right?

656
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.840
I can't stop and I have no willpower.
And my wife,
she's one of these people that,

657
00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:37.090
you know,
fucking eats anything,
doesn't gain weight.
I can't,

658
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.570
I can't go to bed until I eat.
Like,
you know,
three cylinders.
I can't help my,

659
00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.850
so what do you do this?
We'd killed it.

660
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.630
No worries at all.
No coke.
Do I have to go back to doing coke?

661
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.960
Then I wouldn't have to exercise if I did that.
Yep.
I think it's just,

662
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.110
you got to give yourself moderation.

663
00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.110
Give yourself one night a week where you really go off and you allowed to have

664
00:38:59.111 --> 00:39:03.910
sandwiches.
You allowed to fucking stay up and eat cookies and milk.
I swear I do.

665
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.780
I have like a night a week where I just eat like a fucking slob in front of the

666
00:39:07.781 --> 00:39:09.850
TV.
But that's like going,
you know,

667
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:14.140
that's like go and get a nice blow job and then fucking no blow jobs for another

668
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:17.740
six days.
But you,
so you need it again.
You need those cookies.

669
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.630
I don't eat cookies and shit.
I don't like,
but what do you eat?
What's your thing?

670
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:27.130
I don't know.
No,

671
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.520
I don't even lie.
I'm not even like a junk food guy,
but my wife is.

672
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.670
I opened the thing and there's a fucking eight pound bag of smart Cheddar

673
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:37.690
popcorn.
I love cooking for myself late at night when everyone's asleep,

674
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.950
cook all the time.
Sometimes I'll just cook a full meal for myself late at night,

675
00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.460
late at night,
two o'clock in the morning.
I'll make vegetables.

676
00:39:45.461 --> 00:39:49.560
I'll make some pasta.
Why not?
What is,
you're a fucking,
I'm a grown ass man.

677
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.740
You're going to work out the next kettlebells.
God dammit.
No,
you're right.

678
00:39:53.741 --> 00:39:56.500
Life's too short.
Yeah.
Why not know I'm a fucking comic.

679
00:39:56.501 --> 00:39:58.600
If I want to be up at two o'clock in the morning,
I mean that's,

680
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:01.900
I never went to bed before four o'clock in the morning until I was almost 30

681
00:40:01.901 --> 00:40:05.200
years old.
I guess work even now though,

682
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.100
do you make proper meals or do you make inventions and like sometimes it's

683
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:11.410
bullshit.
You know,
sometimes I'll,
I'll do a blue apron.

684
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:14.800
I'll do one of those blue apron meals.
You ever seen that one of my sponsors.

685
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:17.570
I'm not trying to work in a spa.
I know we're going to like that.
Great.

686
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.050
They give you this,
um,

687
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.560
detailed to directions for how to cook something with photographs and all the

688
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:26.830
right portions,
all the right food and the right portions and you just cook it.

689
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.800
You just follow it,
your kids idiot proof and it's great.

690
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.990
Like you don't have to measure anything.
He just said,
oh,

691
00:40:31.991 --> 00:40:33.370
next step opened that packet,

692
00:40:33.371 --> 00:40:36.730
throw that in there and mix that up and then put the fish on the grill,
you know?

693
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:38.640
See and it's,
yeah,
see a great show.

694
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.780
You're making a nice fish in the grill at two in the morning.

695
00:40:40.781 --> 00:40:45.670
I'm making a six pound bird,
Joel stuffed with Mozzarella cheese and Salami.

696
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:49.000
And my favorite thing is grilling meat in my underwear late at night.

697
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:54.160
Fuck underwear.
I just
discard the shit.

698
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.290
Yeah,
the hot splatters.
I want to protect my balls and shaft,
the very least.

699
00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.830
Everything else.
Like I'll do a little hot grease splatter on my stomach.

700
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:08.080
It looks sexy.
Memorial war wounds.
Do you still do the kettle bells?
Yeah,

701
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:12.550
I still do that.
Thank you.
There's a great video.

702
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:15.100
I do call the extreme kettlebell cardio workout.

703
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.020
It's this one little kettle bell.

704
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.360
You could do it like a 35 pounder or if you want to get crazy,

705
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:21.610
you go to 45 pounds.
So it's not a heavy weight,

706
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:26.570
but swinging at p Diddy's kit you?
No,
he swung it.

707
00:41:26.571 --> 00:41:28.990
The coach almost perfect.

708
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.130
I was in such a rush to get it out of.
Damn.
Coffee's delicious.

709
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.900
I'm going to have to fucking take a hit of that joint slumming it.

710
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:43.550
They might not say it out.
Is that right?
So what did he did he not,

711
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:47.780
he didn't make contact.
He swung it.
Yeah,
just being as level head itself,

712
00:41:47.781 --> 00:41:52.100
you know?
Um,
you know,
how's that work?
That's all good.

713
00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.940
I got off.
He,
you know,
he didn't drop.
Yeah,
they dropped the chairman.

714
00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:01.080
They didn't want to press charges for him,
which probably means a big,

715
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.050
huge thing of cash.
Fucking yeah.

716
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.780
Tech coaches have had a bit of a history himself.
Like,
he's the guy who at trip,

717
00:42:09.781 --> 00:42:12.710
the guy on the sideline when he was coaching for the jets.
Oh,

718
00:42:12.711 --> 00:42:14.120
read against the Miami Dolphins.

719
00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:16.430
The guy was returning a covering a punt and you know,

720
00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:18.500
he ran out of bond in this coach sticks is put out.

721
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.680
They got 'em on slow motion trip and the guy that's hilarious.

722
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.270
Like a guy for that.
I'm a why that sounds like a real fun guy.
Coach.

723
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.040
Sounds like it'd be really hard not to beat that guy's ass.
It's like sal,

724
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:34.700
I in news or something.
You know.
So a time that I'm from Long Island,
but uh,

725
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.110
I don't know almost,

726
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:40.520
I know almost nothing about sports unfortunately already came on,
do the podcast.

727
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:45.080
He was so upset with me.
He was so upset with me.
He was like,

728
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:49.510
I told him I was,
I turned Vegan and you know,
started [inaudible].

729
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.650
No,
no,
but I mean it was like that.
He was like,
what really?

730
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.130
You don't fall for anything?
I was like,
no,
I don't follow any of,

731
00:42:57.131 --> 00:43:01.070
they're not baseball.
Like,
he's like,
he was incredulous.
He's like,

732
00:43:01.071 --> 00:43:04.180
there's no way you got enough going on.
Oh yeah,

733
00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:08.330
I'm at some fucking hottest sport going.
Well,
I watched professional pool.

734
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.940
It's not like I'm not into stupid shit.

735
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:12.960
I just don't have enough time for any other,

736
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.500
did you play him and Paul because he can show you please.
Good.

737
00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:18.950
I know he played good.
Yeah,
we a little people like in Newark when he was 12.

738
00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:23.180
And that's what he said.
I believe him.
He plays good art.
He's a fun dude,
man.

739
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.120
Absolutely funny fucking dude.
He was a perfect example of a,

740
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:32.240
a great joke that,
you know,
people didn't just cry too soon.

741
00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.480
They said,
you can't even say this.
And this was when,
um,

742
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:40.790
he already said that he was banging his black chick and he goes in the middle of

743
00:43:40.791 --> 00:43:44.360
it,
she goes,
I can't breathe.
He goes,
hey honey,
let's not make this political

744
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.990
right after Eric car twice.
I mean,

745
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:55.310
it was fucking hilarious.
And so many people were mad at him.

746
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.490
I could not stop laughing when I heard it.

747
00:43:58.491 --> 00:44:01.840
I could not stop laughing just because,
not because I,
you know,

748
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.740
think it's funny that the guy got choked at that amount was going against that.

749
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.150
But that is a God damn funny.
It's funny.
And if you can't,

750
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.410
you can't see the funny in that.

751
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.340
It's either because you're friends with Eric Gardner or you're an asshole.

752
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:15.830
All right.
That's it.
Yeah,
that's it.
You don't think that's funny.
Come on.

753
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:20.420
That's fucking funny and hilarious.
Absolutely.
That's already,

754
00:44:20.421 --> 00:44:23.950
he's a fucking character,
man.
I mean,
I just,
I'm Jo,
have you have you have a plan?

755
00:44:23.951 --> 00:44:26.520
Don't this club tonight.
Ventura Harbor Comedy Club.

756
00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.990
Really good doing that next month.
All right.
That's really good.
I think counting,

757
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.330
I haven't done it.
Callen just did it though.
You said it was amazing.

758
00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:37.080
It was Callen yeah.
I'm pretty sure it's calendar or Dunkin Glue.
Fuck did it.

759
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.610
I Dunno.
I think it was Callen.
Yeah.
But I've heard great things.
Yeah.

760
00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:45.640
There next month that Harry is very ignored like Ventura and into Santa Barbara.

761
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.290
Santa Barbara's very,
that's what,
that's what worries me.
It's great spot.
No,

762
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:52.050
it's no,
I mean ignored by comics.
Yeah.

763
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:55.350
Fucking Santa Barbara is one of the best places,
you know?
And if you go,

764
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.430
they don't,
not that far up.
Thank God.
No,
Santa Barbara is an hour from here,

765
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.560
but this hasn't been sure.
This isn't been Ventura.
Ventura is close.

766
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.910
It's 45 minutes.
Yeah,
45 minutes.
That's good spot,
man.

767
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.950
They're doing a levity out there.
They're going to do a levity out in a,

768
00:45:10.951 --> 00:45:13.920
in that area now.
They really,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I saw it the other day.

769
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:14.760
I was driving by,

770
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.400
maybe they'll let me do the one that's 20 minutes from my fucking house.

771
00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.200
Are you going to live here again?
No.
There's one.
I live in Westchester County,

772
00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:24.360
New York.
I thought you meant out of here and you go over it.
You know,

773
00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:25.680
you go over the Tappan Zee Bridge.

774
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.470
It's literally the levity live there right at the malls.

775
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.550
Like 22 minutes from me and I haven't done a weekend yet.
Never.
Nope.

776
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.820
How dare they,
they have problems that I'm doing.
One in January,
finally,

777
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:39.510
Jesus Christ,
levity live.
Oh,
you're booked in January but,

778
00:45:39.511 --> 00:45:42.210
but for the first time I should've done it eight times.
That's what I'm saying.

779
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:44.970
Yeah.
Fucking I'm going to gonna it Wednesdays there,

780
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.150
which is what have you been in that?
Well I haven't been there dude.
Great.

781
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.060
I went over there,
gone out.
Jesus.
That's what we need.
Another club in a mall.

782
00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.060
You walk in there it is fucking gorgeous.

783
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:57.900
It's the sound system is as good as anything I've ever talked into them my life.

784
00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.380
And it's just a gorgeous club.
Wow.
Plugging you guys.

785
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.540
Thank you guys that didn't cook me for three years.
You're welcome.

786
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:07.640
Best sound system I've ever heard in a club or any place is um,

787
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.310
that Terry Fator theater at the Mirage everybody performs.

788
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:12.870
If it's a over 400 seats,

789
00:46:12.871 --> 00:46:15.990
I don't know about Diaz was on stage and I was in the back of the room and I

790
00:46:15.991 --> 00:46:20.130
could hear him crystal clear cause then you know they designed that for the

791
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:23.120
Terry Fator guy.
The a ventriloquist.
If you're a ventriloquist like,

792
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:26.220
cause we have to have a post sound is super important.

793
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:30.480
So did the whole room was just like sound engineered.
It's amazing.

794
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.710
I never thought of that before.

795
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.530
So like a club like laugh Boston had a problem when they first opened.

796
00:46:34.531 --> 00:46:36.810
They fixed it.
I worked there and it was great,

797
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.480
but before they had like an acoustic problem.

798
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:44.240
I think you told me that somebody told me that and they fixed it till he was
Ari.

799
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.130
I think it was our,
he may has already told me I had never worked there,
but Ari,

800
00:46:47.131 --> 00:46:48.900
Ari worked there in the beginning it was like,

801
00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:52.310
you know some problems here like people are struggling to hear shit.
Yeah.

802
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.650
That's the worst.
If you ever done a gig like that.
Oh Yeah,

803
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:59.640
you've done like those Lausanne comedy gigs,
the Improv's I can Pittsburgh.

804
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:03.090
You could hit fungos in there and fucking practice punting and you couldn't hit

805
00:47:03.091 --> 00:47:03.924
the ceiling.

806
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.650
They like the key to a good comedy club and how people who opened comedy clubs

807
00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:11.490
don't know this at this point because comedy club's been around for fucking ever

808
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:16.200
is a low ceiling.
Yes.
The first thing you want.
It keeps the energy in the room,

809
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:19.470
in the climate space and the audience's faith.
That's the first thing you do.

810
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:23.310
I get to the Improv a couple of years ago,
I couldn't,
somewhere in Pittsburgh.

811
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:24.780
I fucking,
I'm like,
hello,
hello.

812
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.290
I sounded like Lou Gehrig during that speech when he's,
I'm the luckiest man,
man.

813
00:47:28.291 --> 00:47:28.471
Man.

814
00:47:28.471 --> 00:47:32.110
On the face of the earth there are therapists and they couldn't understand me.

815
00:47:32.111 --> 00:47:35.770
Joel,
between my Boston accent and between the fucking echo in,

816
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.040
it was like I was playing to like,
you know,
a 400 Guatemalans.

817
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:42.190
They just staring at me going,
oh,
and understand this person doesn't it?

818
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.760
Then I just go,
Jack Lambert,
the whole crowd would go nuts.

819
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.000
It's the worst one.
They can't hear you.
It's the most frustrating thing,

820
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:53.890
but one of the most frustrating things about being a comic.

821
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.130
How about when you can't hear yourself but the monitors aren't working or

822
00:47:57.131 --> 00:47:57.880
something?

823
00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:02.830
It's like talking into a dead microphone that really fucking scream a whole
show.

824
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:06.670
I did a show in Vegas once we're had to scream because they couldn't hear me

825
00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:10.720
because it was such so echoy in stem here.
Ah,
by the time I was done I was like,

826
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.330
can I get him to have a voice anymore?

827
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.800
But sometimes when the monitor and you can't hear yourself,

828
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.590
you tend to talk louder,
but they can hear you.
Right.
Maybe that was a two.
Yeah.

829
00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.940
That happens too though.
People like,
what do you,
why is he yelling?

830
00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:26.140
Screaming to the Bachelor party once and I had like a little carry on a speaker

831
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.190
with a little tiny,

832
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:30.070
like a one of those things that you would plug into your guitar to practice

833
00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.510
medicine.
That was the,

834
00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:35.110
but they had a speaker or they had a cord that was plugged into it and this

835
00:48:35.111 --> 00:48:38.260
really tinny microphone and I'm standing right in front of the guys.

836
00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:40.330
They're like,
right where you are and I'm holding a microphone.
I'm like,

837
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:42.730
why do I even have a microphone?
You guys are right here.

838
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.910
This is the most ridiculous fucking show of all time.

839
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:51.150
Just standing in a bar in a basement somewhere in Boston doing comedy,

840
00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:54.300
holding a microphone,
looking at guys right in front of me with,
you know,

841
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:55.890
my voice is loud.

842
00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:01.600
Sounds still didn't you deal Gig,
you did a Gig,

843
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.850
one of those Boston gigs.
That was one of those,

844
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:07.650
there was a disco or they would clear out the date.
Quincy.
Yes.

845
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.750
Yes.
A fight with somebody there.
No,
probably not.

846
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:16.240
Not any punches thrown.
That was the rumor.
The rumor was that no,

847
00:49:16.241 --> 00:49:17.680
I beat the shit out of somebody.
No,

848
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.930
I've been to fight and we talked about this last time.

849
00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:23.530
I've been at two fights in my life and and on as far as comedy and they were

850
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:28.300
both at clubs called giggles.
What was in cs and what was in Saugus mass.

851
00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:30.420
They had nothing to do with each other.
That's just,

852
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.180
that's telling you something then,
you know,

853
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.950
I shouldn't be at a place called giggles,
but uh,
yeah,

854
00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:38.800
but I know the one you're talking about.
I had heard the Quincy,

855
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.780
it was a one night or we all did it and like you said,

856
00:49:41.781 --> 00:49:43.030
the people be dancing and shit.

857
00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.820
All a sudden you have the needle go across the record.
That's all.

858
00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:47.770
And all sudden did,
did,
did,

859
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:51.220
did put a bag over the crystal ball that spinning over the dance floor and here

860
00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:55.040
comes Joe Rogan and people are still dancing the fuck him,
you know,

861
00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:00.050
they turn off,
they wouldn't even tell the people is a comedy show.
Hey,

862
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.900
they didn't even know that there's going to be a comedy show and you're up to

863
00:50:01.901 --> 00:50:05.680
how I have talked to like fucking hell.
We want a dance.
It's so stupid.
They did.

864
00:50:05.681 --> 00:50:09.730
So many of those good comics would do it.
I remember Jonathan Katz talking about

865
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:13.720
Barry Crimmins and we all know the money.

866
00:50:13.721 --> 00:50:16.360
If you need the money and you lived in Boston,
it's an easy gig.

867
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:21.010
You drive an hour,
you make 200 bucks.
That's right.
And you could do and the 80s,

868
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:23.680
you could do Christ's like a 18 months in,

869
00:50:23.681 --> 00:50:26.620
I was closing two or three rooms on a Friday night,
coming home with six,

870
00:50:26.621 --> 00:50:27.890
$700 in cash.

871
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.993
<v 3>It was crazy,
man.</v>

872
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:33.230
I mean there was so many outside booking agents between Billy Downs,

873
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.740
Barry Berry.
And,
uh,
then there was a,

874
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:39.980
there was a bunch of other smaller ones and it was like Sherry Hirsch and normal

875
00:50:39.981 --> 00:50:43.610
the foe.
They had gigs like in western Massachusetts,
John Schuler,

876
00:50:43.611 --> 00:50:45.860
if you wanted to go to Connecticut and everybody,

877
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:50.150
like Boston comedy had so many fucking rooms,
man,
every pub.

878
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.270
And when people always ask me that when I started out at every pub and

879
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:58.010
restaurant in New England,
not just Massachusetts,
you can look at my book.

880
00:50:58.011 --> 00:51:01.370
My first year I'd be at like a ski lodge in Burlington,
Vermont on Monday night,

881
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.250
Tuesday night,
a Chinese restaurant in Providence,
Rhode Island,

882
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.460
Wednesday night back in the city.
It stitches,
you know,

883
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:12.190
Thursday at a Mexican restaurant in Franklin,
Massachusetts asset.

884
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:15.230
If you ever talked to Louis Ck,
he's got them all memorized.
He can tell you.

885
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.660
Oh yeah,
he still remembers him.
I remember Mike Clark Colomy.

886
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:22.910
I've been in the business about eight months.
It's snowing like a bastard.

887
00:51:22.911 --> 00:51:25.250
I'm living on Comm Ave in Boston and shitty apartment.

888
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:28.550
Mike calls me one in the afternoon.
He goes,
you want to do a Gig in new London,

889
00:51:28.551 --> 00:51:32.450
Connecticut.
I look outside,
there's a blizzard.
The snow was blowing sideways.

890
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:36.050
We've already got like 11 inches.
Oh go.
Yeah,
he goes,
you want to work?

891
00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:39.710
My brother Lenny,
you know Lenny was our idol then and I'm like,
I'm fucking,

892
00:51:39.711 --> 00:51:40.544
I'll be there

893
00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:46.220
talking about a three hour drive and it's blizzard.
I get there,
it's,

894
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:50.930
it's main Lenny and his nine people in the audience.
And the guy goes to Lenny,

895
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:54.770
I need an hour out of you,
like real sternly.
And Leonie's like,

896
00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.640
okay mother fucker.

897
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.090
He starts to get going to me and then we're sitting at the table and he goes to

898
00:51:59.091 --> 00:52:01.310
the,
the guy that owns the play,
he goes,
Dick,
come on,

899
00:52:01.311 --> 00:52:03.590
sit down over here about two minutes in the compensation lending and knocks a

900
00:52:03.591 --> 00:52:06.230
cup of coffee over on.
And I know he did it on purpose.

901
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.900
It's so intentional because he knocks it on,
you know,

902
00:52:11.901 --> 00:52:14.810
he knocked on the guy that's gonna make them do an hour and he was like,

903
00:52:14.811 --> 00:52:16.010
oh sorry,
Jesus Christ.

904
00:52:16.011 --> 00:52:20.810
And he's laughing lens laughing at me and then land it goes on and does an hour

905
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:25.520
without taking a break.
Like,
there was 600 people there.
I mean,
I was,
this is,

906
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:29.030
that's when I was like,
oh my God,
it's a headliner.
He didn't take a break.

907
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:34.280
It was one 60 minute run on sentence and he murdered those nine people.

908
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.120
I couldn't even figure out how to get the mic out of the stand.

909
00:52:37.121 --> 00:52:40.130
Joe is one of those clip Mike's.
I'm like,
I can think comes unplugged.

910
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.080
That's hilarious.
And Lenny goes on and just,
just,
I go,
oh my God.

911
00:52:45.081 --> 00:52:48.140
That's how it's done.
And just,
and I don't mean working the audience,

912
00:52:48.141 --> 00:52:50.570
I mean an hour of jokes in front of like nine people.

913
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:54.500
That was that style of comedy too.
Like Lenny embodied that style,

914
00:52:54.501 --> 00:52:58.400
that fucking attack style comedy.
You know,
that there was,

915
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:03.440
Lenny was one of the,
well,
the first guys that I ever worked for,
I worked for,
um,

916
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:08.690
uh,
Warren Mcdonald.
I opened up for him.
Yes.

917
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:13.430
I opened up for him in like a chickopee mass.
That's George,
his older brother.

918
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:15.050
Yeah.
George McDonald,

919
00:53:15.051 --> 00:53:19.550
who was a open mic night guy when I was coming up with Mike,
he was the host.

920
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.900
Oh Christ.
Wow.
That guy's been,
yeah,

921
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:27.720
it said comedy hell on the settlement side.
Stitches for us now I pulled up,

922
00:53:27.721 --> 00:53:28.554
I saw the marquee.

923
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:32.930
<v 0>Ugh.
That was a cool little room to that little room.
Only fat.</v>

924
00:53:32.931 --> 00:53:34.900
Like w w what would that fit like a hundred,

925
00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:39.790
125 people at the most.
What a great little room

926
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:44.690
<v 3>I was opening for.
Uh,
uh,
Lenny had his own show on Friday night there.</v>

927
00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.650
And um,

928
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.950
this is when I was going back and it's my second year and I had just moved down

929
00:53:48.951 --> 00:53:51.410
to New York.
I had moved down when New York,
I was driving back and forth.

930
00:53:51.411 --> 00:53:54.710
We had an apartment,
me and Louie down here.
I had to go back to stitches.

931
00:53:54.711 --> 00:53:57.860
I took the train back and the train was late and shit.
So I'm,

932
00:53:57.861 --> 00:53:58.850
I'm late getting stitches.

933
00:53:58.851 --> 00:54:02.420
It's Lenny show and Kenny Rogers since like the middle and Shit can imagine.

934
00:54:02.421 --> 00:54:06.020
I'm the rookie on the show.
I get there late.
Kenny's already on.

935
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:09.440
Oh No,
they uh,
like furious.

936
00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:13.190
So I go out stitches a had a little ticket booth.

937
00:54:13.191 --> 00:54:16.130
That's how you entered the stage from the ticket?
Both on the side.

938
00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.730
So I go out there,
I don't have more than 20 minutes.
Right.
Joe,
at that point,

939
00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:22.220
I don't have 20 good minutes.
I run out of material.
I'm like,

940
00:54:22.221 --> 00:54:27.140
good night everybody.
I go,
good night.
I got to go off stage.

941
00:54:27.141 --> 00:54:31.040
That door's locked.
So now I'm up on a stage.
I can't get out.

942
00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:32.720
The only way I can get out,
jump off the front of it.

943
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.830
If your audience is staring at me,
the door's locked.
They won't let me.

944
00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.820
So I go back to the microphone and it's not going.

945
00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.640
So what do you do for a living?
Oh my God.

946
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:44.810
They wouldn't unlock the top like five minutes.
And then I went over to the,
I go,

947
00:54:44.811 --> 00:54:48.380
come on guys.
And now the audience is laughing at me and shit.
They Kenny,
right?

948
00:54:48.381 --> 00:54:52.250
It's an open door.
He goes,
fucking be on time on the fucker.
Uh,
that was a lesson.

949
00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:55.960
<v 0>Those road gigs were often hazardous.</v>

950
00:54:56.350 --> 00:55:00.100
<v 3>Is that where you did the,
you're open Mike.
Your first one.
It stitches.
Yeah.</v>

951
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:04.250
<v 0>Yeah.
That was my first time.
August 27th,
1988</v>

952
00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:09.500
that was Jonathan Katz.
He was the host.
Wow.
Yeah,
it's wild.

953
00:55:09.501 --> 00:55:13.850
I did it the spring before and I remember,
um,
uh,

954
00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.780
fuck man.

955
00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:19.820
A couple really good comics went up that night to like guys that were local guys

956
00:55:19.821 --> 00:55:23.930
who go in town do the open mic like pros but the big one,

957
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:29.360
well there was a couple of big ones but um,
teddy bears.
Ron was the biggest one.

958
00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.470
Teddy bears one slayed it so smooth as silk.

959
00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:38.300
And I remember being just a raw sort of rough first day ever opened.
Mike,

960
00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:42.140
you can't get any rar.
I remember watching teddy bears.
Ron just going,
fuck,

961
00:55:42.141 --> 00:55:45.140
he's so smooth.
He was just so slick.

962
00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:47.530
<v 3>Yeah,
he would hook.
It's right.
He would mc the,</v>

963
00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:52.150
some of the open mikes and stitches and he'd go on as a character called Allston

964
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:54.910
Brighton,
which is the two towns outside of an

965
00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.220
English accent.
And I'm going,
this guy was on a tonight.
Joey sucks.

966
00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.190
He was just doing some character.
Hello.
That got to be,

967
00:56:03.191 --> 00:56:06.940
I had stitches and just do the shitty jobs on purpose and I'm going,

968
00:56:06.941 --> 00:56:09.430
this guy was on a tonight cause you,
you don't know anything about comedy.

969
00:56:09.431 --> 00:56:13.180
Then I go,
how the fuck is this guy?
And been on it with Johnny Carson and I go,

970
00:56:13.181 --> 00:56:14.710
who is it?
He he'd go on his walls.

971
00:56:14.711 --> 00:56:16.990
I thought his name was Austin Brighton for the first six months.

972
00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:20.860
And then I see him at next one night.
Get like a standing ovation.
Yeah.

973
00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:23.980
You see him to real.
I was real act and I was like,
oh my God,

974
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:28.960
I know nothing about what I do.
Did you ever see his tonight show set?
Yes.

975
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.590
Fucking yes.
Oh yeah.
One of the best tonight show sets ever.
Yeah,

976
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.410
it's in that mobile.
You wouldn't stand up stood out.
Well they show,

977
00:56:35.411 --> 00:56:37.270
I'm sitting down I think in that movie,
but yeah.

978
00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.710
And then he just went off the rails.
But when,

979
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.740
when he was in his prime is when nick and I,
nick was like,

980
00:56:44.741 --> 00:56:48.430
you were like a little bit ahead of me like maybe a year,
I think.
Uh,

981
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:51.600
I know you something like six months to a year,
months.

982
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:55.000
I did the spring of 87 was my first open mic.
So we were,

983
00:56:55.001 --> 00:56:58.780
we were both there when teddy was in his prime,

984
00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:02.140
like when he was just hot and fucking,

985
00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:06.850
just smooth and just would go up.
Right.
He had this style,

986
00:57:06.851 --> 00:57:09.370
this was so casual.
And if there was a lot of guys,

987
00:57:09.371 --> 00:57:13.600
like Lenny had this amazing style of I'll fucking attack.
Ah,
right.

988
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:16.010
And it was just Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam.
Right.

989
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:19.840
But Teddy would go up and make it look so effortless.
He was the only one.

990
00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:23.890
You're right.
That wasn't doing that Boston attack.
He had his own,

991
00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.820
he was a little more evolved.
He was so good.
He was so good.

992
00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.300
But the alcohol is what,
uh,
pills,
alcohol,
the whole deal,

993
00:57:31.301 --> 00:57:36.220
whatever it was that grabbed them.
I did one night with him and the hawks,
right.

994
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:40.330
And I get there and I'm opening for him some restaurant,
like in a hot,

995
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:45.040
and then he comes in and I,
I bring him up and as I'm coming off the stage,

996
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:47.680
he goes,
he goes,
I'm double parked.
Move my car.

997
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.390
So he gives me his keys and I go out and I move his car and I come back in and

998
00:57:52.391 --> 00:57:56.530
I'm watching them and I'm having a few drinks and then I get my car and I go see

999
00:57:56.531 --> 00:57:59.790
this girl in land that I was seeing at the time.
And uh,

1000
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:03.670
I call and check my answering machine messages,
you know,

1001
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:08.390
at my house and Wilbon my apartment and it's a bit,
uh,
Nick,
uh,
teddy bears.

1002
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:13.300
Yeah.
It's uh,
the show ended an hour ago or you have my fucking keys,
my car keys.

1003
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:14.530
I left with this case

1004
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:21.100
now the messaging was like eight messages.
He's now now and he's a horrible,

1005
00:58:21.101 --> 00:58:24.340
like alcohol will kill this guy.
So the next piece,

1006
00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:27.100
it's like 40 minutes late and nick,
if fucking Asshole,

1007
00:58:27.101 --> 00:58:29.980
I'm fucking you still at the fucking club.

1008
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.150
Oh my God.
I had to fucking,
uh,
you know,

1009
00:58:34.151 --> 00:58:36.310
find him and get him his keys.

1010
00:58:36.311 --> 00:58:38.710
But he left like six messages and he was getting more drunk.

1011
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:42.760
I played them over and over for comics.
I know he couldn't even talk.

1012
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.591
It's like four of them.

1013
00:58:43.591 --> 00:58:47.320
While I was with this girl who I wanted to bang for years,
you know,

1014
00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:50.430
and I fucking,
after the first few metric,
I'm not leaving it for another round.

1015
00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:54.790
I go,
he's fine.
He's in the [inaudible] and the poor bass who was stranded,

1016
00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:57.430
they're told,
I don't know.
I could go up to them and three in the morning,
man,

1017
00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.230
maybe it was good that you didn't give praise.
Drove drunk.
Yeah.

1018
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:04.660
He wasn't drinking.
No.
When I left I think I drove him to drink.

1019
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.160
You know what I mean?
Cause he hates message.
You can hear him getting worse.

1020
00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:10.510
Can you imagine?

1021
00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.530
And I'm fucking sitting there and you know I didn't check my messages for a

1022
00:59:13.531 --> 00:59:15.310
while after I got that girl's apartment.

1023
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:20.980
That's my Teddy Burger on store.
I missed that disco gig.

1024
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.190
The disco Gig had already

1025
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:23.720
<v 0>closed by the time I was getting paid.</v>

1026
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:27.590
I heard about it when I was doing open mics and the Quincy Yance flow one that

1027
00:59:27.591 --> 00:59:31.860
you've gone.
I did one that was in the waiting room of a restaurant and the Co,

1028
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.600
the standup Mike,
it was a Mike Clark Gig,
you know,
it was a one time only.

1029
00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:38.990
It was only me one man show and they canceled it right after I did it.

1030
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:42.080
I called Mike as soon as I got home,
it was the most ridiculous thing.

1031
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:46.700
The PA system was attached to the standup microphone and it was a big fish

1032
00:59:46.701 --> 00:59:50.810
restaurant down the Cape so that there was this big waiting room of people.

1033
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:56.720
So you'd be on the stage.
So I'm saying there's no way we can do this.

1034
00:59:56.721 --> 01:00:00.620
And Les Johnson Party attune Treading Johnson party too.

1035
01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:05.090
And the first time he did it,
I just went,
no fucking way.
This can't be real.

1036
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:08.270
And it was so ridiculous that the audience just started laughing.

1037
01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.730
Like whereas I was probably bombing before,

1038
01:00:10.731 --> 01:00:14.090
that probably wasn't going so well because it was just,

1039
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:16.760
nobody knew there was going to be a comedy shock.
I had a band,

1040
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:20.780
the band stopped and then really of that,
I never did that.
I don't even know if,

1041
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.660
I don't remember if they introduced me,
my memory fucking blows.

1042
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:28.910
Sometimes I can get,
I get like real crystal images of rec.
Really important shit.

1043
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:32.090
Well there are times like when you told me that I ran after you in the car,

1044
01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:34.160
I was like God,
I was swore I called them.

1045
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:38.150
Now you see you got me up on the way to the car.
Yeah.
But now that you say it,

1046
01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:39.710
now I know that I ran out and now,

1047
01:00:39.711 --> 01:00:42.980
but when I'm like why did I have that stupid fake memory in my head?

1048
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:45.380
Cause I remember you were running out and I'm going off.
Fuck,

1049
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:47.960
is he going to yell at me?
I must have fucking blown this audition.

1050
01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.520
I think dreams kind of fuck with your past memories because I dreamt something

1051
01:00:52.521 --> 01:00:56.930
once a long time ago and I remembered that I had told somebody about this dream

1052
01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:01.760
and then I forgot that that was,
that was real,
wasn't real.
Cause I,

1053
01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:05.150
I say I was talking about my friend and I was like,
oh yeah.
And she,

1054
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.270
she works I think at this place downtown and I'm like,
wait,
no,

1055
01:01:08.271 --> 01:01:12.090
that's something I try weed man,
you guys don't,

1056
01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:17.150
no,
no,
no,
not at all.
I know.

1057
01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:20.720
I remember so much shit.
I remember when it wipe it off completely,

1058
01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:24.830
but I remember way too much sugar.
I think a short term though,
for sure.

1059
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:27.410
No doubt about it.
Fucks with a short term.

1060
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.650
We can be talking about something and I'll go,
what did we just say?

1061
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:34.160
Like there's like blips of missing information,

1062
01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:39.530
but I think that those blips exist because there's a vacuum created by all this

1063
01:01:39.531 --> 01:01:42.980
new shit that's flying at you and I think the new shits find out,
you know,

1064
01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:44.420
if you're still trying to hold onto your thought,

1065
01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.830
you just had a couple moments ago,

1066
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.150
you're resisting the Zen of the experience of the marijuana.

1067
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:55.430
So if you just relax,
it's funny because I,
it's a catch 22 of me because I,

1068
01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:59.430
I'm having,
I have insomnia,
I have a fucking horrible time.

1069
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:02.900
It doesn't matter what time zone I'm in,
what planet,
what state?
If I go to bed,

1070
01:02:02.901 --> 01:02:06.500
I wake up two hours later.
You wake up angry and complaining?
No,
I feel good.

1071
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:11.030
I feel rested at for that,
for that moment,
but I'm not going to get up.

1072
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:12.500
It's only four in the morning,
right?
Two,

1073
01:02:12.501 --> 01:02:16.490
I try to go back to sleep and I'll wake up an hour and a half later and I'll

1074
01:02:16.491 --> 01:02:17.570
wake up at eight and then not.

1075
01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:22.120
And I feel horrible and it's affecting me on stage even now.

1076
01:02:22.121 --> 01:02:24.900
And when we just tell them stories are a couple of names.
I couldn't remember.

1077
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:28.310
What were we talking about?
New Mood.

1078
01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:32.560
How I couldn't remember the actor's name,
you know,
and,
and uh,
it,

1079
01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:36.690
it's fucking weird.
But,
but,
but everybody's like,
yes,
he's smoked weed at all.

1080
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:38.040
It'll put you to sleep.
But it also,

1081
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.710
I know it does a number of your memory if you get into that,

1082
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.300
get in the habit of doing it right.
Yeah.
Well,
I think if you did it every day,

1083
01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:48.630
all day,
it would definitely fuck you up a hundred percent.

1084
01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:52.290
But I think if you'd do it a little bit every now and again,
it's good for you.

1085
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:56.160
I really do not need it every night.
To do.
You should do mountains.
Get Melatonin.

1086
01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.350
That's the first thing everybody's suggested.
Or exam t do it.

1087
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.080
I've tried everything.
I've drank cat piss of fucking,
that's your problem.

1088
01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.910
That's what's keeping it a slug with caffeine.
Isn't it?

1089
01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:10.500
In a store keeping you solve?
Is that fucking anger?

1090
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:15.870
No,
it's a,
have you ever have done all that shit?

1091
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.910
Have you ever had that cat shit coffee?

1092
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.210
You ever heard of that coffee called Kopi Lou os a cat shit or raccoons?

1093
01:03:21.211 --> 01:03:23.150
What's a civet?
It's like a Thai thing.

1094
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.130
It's a good way to get to go any further with the conversation.
I'm all set.

1095
01:03:26.131 --> 01:03:28.890
Thanks.
I'll stick these people's Sanka

1096
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:34.250
<v 4>[inaudible] brothers two words.</v>

1097
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:37.710
Sankoh's one

1098
01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:43.070
<v 0>perfect.
Uh,
what?
Uh,
Jesus Christ,
that is so fucking funny.
Same number.</v>

1099
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:45.320
Sancocho I do the,
um,
the,

1100
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:48.680
there's this animal called civic eats the coffee beans and then shits them out.

1101
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:51.020
And when it goes through its digestive tract,

1102
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:54.830
the digestive enzymes break down the outer layer of the coffee

1103
01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.980
<v 4>for that is called the coffee filter.</v>

1104
01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:01.490
I don't need it to go through a fucking cat's ass fucking feline cunt.

1105
01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:05.040
You're missing the points.
Sure.

1106
01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:10.680
<v 0>Digestive enzymes.
The cat's stomach make it a smoother,</v>

1107
01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.030
smoother cough.

1108
01:04:12.031 --> 01:04:15.630
And this companies were in Liberia with this still wiping their ass of banana

1109
01:04:15.631 --> 01:04:20.100
leaves and rocks.
Okay.
They eat a bunch of cranberries and stuff.
Yeah,

1110
01:04:20.101 --> 01:04:22.300
that's the little animal.
Look at that little fucking,

1111
01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.990
if I were looking at the poop,
it looks like a,
what's that again?

1112
01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:27.190
<v 4>Day by day.</v>

1113
01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:34.850
It's how paydays are made.
That's a fucking payday bar.

1114
01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.100
<v 0>See that being,
those beans have all been sort of strip.
Yeah,
I'm all set.</v>

1115
01:04:39.101 --> 01:04:41.260
I'd rather have a Columbia guy crushing him with his bare feet.

1116
01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:44.320
So apparently their bodies don't digest the actual beans.

1117
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.360
So they eat the outside.
The outside of a coffee bean.

1118
01:04:49.361 --> 01:04:53.580
I've read somewhere that green.
Uh,
there's like the,
the outside of like a friend,

1119
01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:58.210
like the juice from an actual green.
It's green beans.
Green before it.
Yeah.

1120
01:04:58.211 --> 01:05:00.580
And it was like a little red too,
but it's supposed to be really good for you.

1121
01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:01.600
Whatever that is.
Yeah.

1122
01:05:01.601 --> 01:05:04.030
I saw that on a doctor Oz and I actually ordered this shit.

1123
01:05:04.031 --> 01:05:08.530
It's supposed to help you lose weight.
Dr Oz mother fucker though.
I know.
I know.

1124
01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.980
I Google the motherfucker.
I said he's,
I said he's so handsome.
I have to go to,

1125
01:05:11.981 --> 01:05:15.340
they should know why you're mad at him.
The American Medical Association.

1126
01:05:15.341 --> 01:05:16.960
Very dead.
Yeah,
they got,

1127
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.100
they got pissed at him that he had to go before Congress because of,
uh,

1128
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:25.330
some fake diet pill.
He got shoned did he get on?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
It was ugly.

1129
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.270
But it's amazing.
You can get on that bear.
Yeah,

1130
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:31.690
but that's just cause he's Oprah's bitch.
Yeah.
Somebody,
she won't have to Oprah.

1131
01:05:31.691 --> 01:05:36.240
And her day,
Oprah,
just spelling her lies,
starts peeling off numbers.
Ch,
ch,

1132
01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:40.160
ch,
ch.
You know,
what do we have to do to make this go away?
Go ahead.

1133
01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.860
She has to get Oprah's money.
Glad she went away.
Well,

1134
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:47.190
she went away because she made more money than any human being ever and she's

1135
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.250
like,
what the fuck's the point?
Do not.
Nobody wanted to hear from Randy Moore.

1136
01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.360
How would he even get ratings?
Fucking network.
Dare you and Victor.

1137
01:05:53.361 --> 01:05:56.630
Paula please fucking first of all these race,

1138
01:05:56.631 --> 01:06:01.631
these ratings are racist as a bunch of white males running that rating board and

1139
01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:05.920
they deny Oprah's real true rate.

1140
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.620
It's probably would be the argument in court today.
They don't even know.

1141
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:09.700
I don't think.
Do you think,
how am I,

1142
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:12.680
how accurate do you think they really are at knowing ratings nowadays?

1143
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.010
They're way more accurate because they're actually getting,

1144
01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:20.011
I heard they're actually getting numbers from a cable boxes and stuff nowadays.

1145
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:24.550
Hmm.
Can they do that without your consent?
I liked the Nielson family myself.

1146
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.361
It's probably in that,

1147
01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:29.050
that's a great big dude on tracked at the beginning when you turn on your cable

1148
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:33.340
box and the Nielsons were like,
how many families?

1149
01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:37.780
And they were three.
They live right next to me.
Fucking loud,
obnoxious.

1150
01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.700
Always had the TVS on.
There wasn't that many people that did the,

1151
01:06:41.701 --> 01:06:44.080
when they did the knee,
they still do it right.
They still do it.

1152
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:47.890
They have a Saturday where I just told her pretty sure at that they just knocked

1153
01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:51.370
on your door and so what do you watch that many families are?
They still do it.

1154
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.650
I remember growing up,
my friend's dad was like,

1155
01:06:53.651 --> 01:06:57.310
I vice president was this big insurance company and they had one on their TV,

1156
01:06:57.450 --> 01:07:00.790
but it was kind of weird.
They had one.
Does it let this Leslie Nielsen,

1157
01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:04.840
let's say it's one of the families.
There's a,

1158
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.010
that's a funny guy,
man.
Think about that guy.
That guy's entire life now.

1159
01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:12.470
300 homes.
1300 a piece,
Huh?

1160
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:15.460
Okay.
Two largest local,
oh,

1161
01:07:15.461 --> 01:07:19.090
this is New York and Los Angeles will have their sample sizes increased by 300

1162
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.060
homes next year.
About 1300 a piece.

1163
01:07:22.061 --> 01:07:27.061
So that's New York and Los Angeles is 2,600 this is in 2,600 homes of people,

1164
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:31.510
but that's just a 2,600 homes in.
That's,

1165
01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:35.200
but that's just a in New York and La.
That's 51,000 Puerto Ricans right there.

1166
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.220
How dare you,
how dare you and nick to call left coast.

1167
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:43.360
Can't laugh at any of this shit.
Everybody just claimed fucking nervous lots.

1168
01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.600
It's turned into Mexico.
You're afraid to fuck in Lebanon.
Is that what it is?

1169
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:49.900
It's just more liberal out here.
Right?
Do you think it's more liberal on here?

1170
01:07:49.901 --> 01:07:51.820
Do you feel the difference when you just stand that I,
well,

1171
01:07:51.821 --> 01:07:54.370
I haven't really done standup,
but just,
yeah,
just,

1172
01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:59.260
just going into her to at lax I can see it's much more liberal and going into

1173
01:07:59.261 --> 01:08:02.830
her hurts.
Oh,
hurt the car.
This know why.
What's going on then?
I don't know.

1174
01:08:02.831 --> 01:08:04.160
I didn't see anybody that spoke English.

1175
01:08:04.161 --> 01:08:07.840
She guide mumbling to me in some accent and it was right up.

1176
01:08:07.841 --> 01:08:11.860
The place was rudderless.
No fucking manager.
40 people in line,

1177
01:08:11.861 --> 01:08:14.830
three poopin people behind the counter and nobody taking charge.

1178
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:18.530
Nobody that looked like me.
Nobody looked like you.
Wow.
Yeah.

1179
01:08:18.531 --> 01:08:19.700
It's DePaul a little just,

1180
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:22.250
well now you can fucking live in this world and put up with that shit,

1181
01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:26.640
but you can't do it.
No,
I can do it.
You just saying you asked me.
No,

1182
01:08:26.641 --> 01:08:30.760
it's my renting me my fucking cars.
No,
that's not what I'm saying.

1183
01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:34.180
Just let them just let the white guy fucking managers.

1184
01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:38.400
What's one thing we can do?
Oh,
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1185
01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.100
You guys,
when are you wake the fuck up?

1186
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.240
Man,
the fuck up,
bro.
Car rental managers.

1187
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:52.190
I'm just much more liberal.
I'm fucking kidding.
These are jokes.

1188
01:08:52.191 --> 01:08:56.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't we don't,
Oh yeah,
I forgot you had advertisers.
No,
not,

1189
01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:00.260
not right now.
Not Anymore.
What happened?
I don't.
I do them later.
A splice them,

1190
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:04.550
man.
How are you doing?
You even,
you can have control over that.
Yeah.

1191
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.260
I think this is the way to do it.
Absolutely.
Yeah,

1192
01:09:06.261 --> 01:09:09.230
because this way we just have a conversation,
you know the way,
the way,

1193
01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:11.210
the other way of like interrupting doing.

1194
01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.820
In the beginning it was always awkward because it gets to be sitting there and

1195
01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:17.000
I'd have to go through five minutes of stupid ads and then doing it in the

1196
01:09:17.001 --> 01:09:20.950
middle was always out of the question,
so now we'll just do it.
This who you way

1197
01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:28.970
it looks like in 2005 Nielsen started using things like Tivo and cable boxes and

1198
01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:32.840
stuff like that and even finding when people turned off a shows,

1199
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:36.950
they even know how accurate as if they the first commercial break if people left

1200
01:09:36.951 --> 01:09:39.440
the show.
So it's super accurate now.

1201
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:43.820
That's some big brother type shit right there.
It's weird.

1202
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.691
I mean,

1203
01:09:44.691 --> 01:09:47.930
just the only way to find out really is you got to do that and why does it

1204
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:51.390
bother us?
Because it doesn't bother us when you see like youtube hits.
No.

1205
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.460
If you put up a youtube video and it gets 17 million units,

1206
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.750
well it's all right there.
You could see it.
17 million heads.
Yeah.

1207
01:09:56.790 --> 01:10:00.650
They don't want you to know the numbers.
Yeah,
it's deigned.
It's weird and radio,

1208
01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:03.140
it's hard to get numbers real hard to get numbers and Rachel,

1209
01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:05.780
they don't want you to know that you could be making them a ton of money.

1210
01:10:05.781 --> 01:10:07.340
They're going,
no,
you only have 70 listeners.

1211
01:10:07.341 --> 01:10:10.610
This is why we don't think they know when it comes to radio,

1212
01:10:10.611 --> 01:10:15.300
like that Arbitron book.
I think that is just that.
The whole thing's a mess.

1213
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:19.350
They keep changing it.
Now they have things.
People walk around with a clip,

1214
01:10:19.351 --> 01:10:22.430
done it their belt mid,
supposed to click it.
If it listening to it.

1215
01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.280
That's so stupid.
They're not going to click that and exactly what they do.

1216
01:10:25.281 --> 01:10:29.120
They're assholes anyway.
You don't want them.
Exactly.
You're wearing that,

1217
01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:32.330
I don't want you as the listener unless you're getting a lot of money for that

1218
01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:35.250
dude.
Let's say,
give me like 500 bucks a week to whether it's stupid thing.

1219
01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.520
I don't know why you would wear that.
So it could be like a Shizam based thing,

1220
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.510
you know,
like,
so as things are playing,
you listen to it,
but even then,

1221
01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:47.510
you know what I mean?
Like Shizam like picks it,
you know,
that's that APP.

1222
01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:48.770
Do you know of?
No,
I don't.
It's great.

1223
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:51.540
Like if there's a song playing and you don't know what it is like with the
phone,

1224
01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.550
you hold it up and it tells you,
tell you like instantly.
And my wife told him,

1225
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.720
it's so crazy.

1226
01:10:56.721 --> 01:10:59.840
Like it doesn't even make sense that it works and it works so well.

1227
01:10:59.841 --> 01:11:02.990
Like you look at it happening,
you can go on.
That is,
it's instant.

1228
01:11:02.991 --> 01:11:04.970
It just knows the beat they should have that.

1229
01:11:04.971 --> 01:11:09.230
If you're in a nightclub and you're gonna
pick up a chick,

1230
01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:12.710
you hold it up to her as if she's fucking crazy.
And I tells you her,

1231
01:11:12.711 --> 01:11:14.010
I killed her work that way.

1232
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.040
But if they could tell you your heart rate from x box one,

1233
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.790
imagine if you could fucking put it in front of a girl and just tell you how

1234
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:21.624
crazy she is.

1235
01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:25.620
Can you give me like a one to 10 just scans your body and let's see now like

1236
01:11:25.621 --> 01:11:30.060
look,
look what's going on in her head as a fucking pink pong game of different

1237
01:11:30.061 --> 01:11:34.650
personalities and throwing balls at each other.
Let's go home.
We're religious,

1238
01:11:34.651 --> 01:11:36.270
I'm a child of God.
Let's suck his cock.

1239
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:41.730
Just trying to figure out which way to go.
Always completely unstable.

1240
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.200
If they could find out your heart rate,

1241
01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:45.780
that would mean how the fuck are they finding out your heart rate,

1242
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:48.450
but looking at you on some screen,
unless you're wearing a device,

1243
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:52.200
must be wearing a device.
Are you wearing anything?
It's thermo.

1244
01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:54.710
I think it's got three cameras pointing at you and they're all different because

1245
01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:56.310
that's not just like a regular video camera.

1246
01:11:56.670 --> 01:12:00.090
So the three cameras pointing at you,
what are they reading?
Tons.
Thermal.

1247
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:03.780
The others like this where you are displaced in the room,
but it's reading,

1248
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:07.110
reading,
like heat.
Really waging that into us.

1249
01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.820
It's an APP or talking about Xbox one.
So,
uh,
if it's gauge and heat,

1250
01:12:11.821 --> 01:12:15.540
do you have to program in how warm your room is?
How much you weigh,

1251
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:16.501
how big you are?

1252
01:12:16.501 --> 01:12:20.570
It can tell he knows when you've been sleeping and it's tons of little quick,

1253
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:23.850
tons of little dots over you.
So it reads like it's super accurate.

1254
01:12:23.851 --> 01:12:27.630
Like it can read your hands,
like going like this,
you know that accurate?

1255
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:31.830
It's pretty at the new one.
Xbox one.
What the fuck man,

1256
01:12:31.831 --> 01:12:34.080
I'm missing out on all this.
You could easily get an x.

1257
01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:35.400
He should have an Xbox one.

1258
01:12:35.401 --> 01:12:39.480
Should I use the last time you watched the last UFC on the next box one and it

1259
01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:42.020
was so easy.
It's just like order through expo.

1260
01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:45.270
I'm moving towards doing less shit.
That's what I'm moving towards.

1261
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:50.250
I'm not moving towards doing anything more.
This is,
I'm enjoying relaxing lately.

1262
01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:54.580
That's a lost art.
You know,
everybody's hustling going by.

1263
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:58.830
I had your money fuck up and relax.
And 10 years ago,
what'd you have?
Oh yeah.

1264
01:12:58.831 --> 01:13:01.440
What you been doing?
What would you do?
Who should I do?

1265
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.920
You could be smoking pot and floating in my pool.
Ah,
there you go.

1266
01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.650
Big Margarita and a pool and that was,

1267
01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.390
I don't want smoke pot changed that answer.
You should have a fishing pond,
Joe.

1268
01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:17.220
I have a part on a canoe and fish and smoke weed all day.
That's right.

1269
01:13:17.221 --> 01:13:20.660
That day.
No seriously.
That sounds perfect.

1270
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.550
Fun Day thing of Heinekens in between your legs.

1271
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.270
Isn't it funny that you're alone?
Like nobody gives a fuck if you kill a fish.

1272
01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.560
You know people don't care about fish.
But if there was like,
like uh,

1273
01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:36.320
like wild game preserves near four seasons in Hawaii and dudes were coming in

1274
01:13:36.321 --> 01:13:39.300
and like gutted Mousse or something like that,
people would freak the fuck out.

1275
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:43.800
You can come with a Marlin big 1500 pound Marlon.
Nobody gets a shit.
Delicious.

1276
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:47.250
Very tough.
It is.
It's very delicious.

1277
01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:49.620
But it's just weird that we don't,

1278
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:51.630
we don't give a shit if someone kills efficient front of us.

1279
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:55.800
Like we have like very clear hierarchies and it's not even about the size of the

1280
01:13:55.801 --> 01:13:57.870
animal.
It's about whether or not the animals cute.

1281
01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.990
Like if you have like a squirrel,
you kill a squirrel in front of a p,

1282
01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:06.000
they'll fuck people freak out if you kill a squirrel.
But people eat squirrels.

1283
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:07.440
A lot of parts of the world,
people eat squirrels.

1284
01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:11.640
But if you kill a tuna in front of them,
like a 500 pound tuna does it.

1285
01:14:11.641 --> 01:14:14.650
Most people don't even bat an eye weird.
Right.
I hate that.

1286
01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:18.550
And you see like a Japanese cutting goof fans off sharks?
Yeah.

1287
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.940
Is it the Japanese?
It's the Japanese show.
Yes.
Don't get all nervous.

1288
01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:26.530
I can make it up.
Do you see that surfer with the shark on live TV?

1289
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:29.380
I'm not saying we should kill all the sharks.
They cut the fins off them though.

1290
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:31.780
And let the,
let the rest of the fish drown.

1291
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.020
Did it'll get eaten nine nine one one to 10 it's a good thing.
But they use,

1292
01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.920
they using it for aphrodisiac,
making soup with it and shit.

1293
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:41.080
Well I think it's just delicious.
Shark's fin soup.

1294
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:44.330
I think the aphrodisiac is like the horns like Rhino Horn,
right?

1295
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:49.120
How your Dick Tiger Dick Tiger Dash.
They do something with tigers.

1296
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.650
I don't know if it's tiger deck,
but I can,

1297
01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:55.030
that is fucked up though.

1298
01:14:55.031 --> 01:14:58.360
They cut the fins off and just jumping in the water and they let him fucking

1299
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:03.010
drown.
What's kind of sociopathic?
Yeah.
It's kind of creepy behavior.

1300
01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:06.820
Replace the fence if you're going to take it,
put a fake one on.
Yeah.

1301
01:15:06.821 --> 01:15:07.360
Not only that,

1302
01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.220
like when can you use that meat for something like he's selling the shark meat,

1303
01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.120
pet food or something like that.
Sure.
You know,
I mean it's probably good protein.

1304
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:19.300
Like why would you just let it all go to waste like that?
That seems so silly.

1305
01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:22.900
And then there's the numbers,
like how many they kill.
They kill a lot.

1306
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.660
You get that shark fin soup.
You got to kill a lot of fucking sharks.

1307
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:31.840
But that surfer video is ridiculous.
Yeah.
Oh God.

1308
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.060
It's terrifying that I'm surprised you didn't see like a,

1309
01:15:35.061 --> 01:15:38.030
you know him shitting his pants all over the board.
It's amazing.

1310
01:15:38.031 --> 01:15:39.920
He didn't get bed.
It's amazing.

1311
01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:44.990
I mean that thing is thrashing around and that was a big fin.

1312
01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.650
Big fucking with no little Maaco Shark.
What if that was a shark shark?

1313
01:15:48.651 --> 01:15:51.200
That was like a 10 foot shark,
right?
If your guests,
the nine 10 foot,

1314
01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.770
how big did they think it was Jamie?
I didn't.

1315
01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.480
I didn't see it seemed like it was like a 10 foot shark,

1316
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:59.390
but it's definitely big enough to fucking kill you.
Hell yeah.

1317
01:15:59.450 --> 01:16:01.670
Why does surfers and not carry weapons on him?

1318
01:16:01.671 --> 01:16:04.880
Like why don't they have like a a like some kind of Taser or something that they

1319
01:16:04.881 --> 01:16:07.220
can wear around their neck and it in emergencies.
Pop it off.

1320
01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:11.390
It should have an APP for that.
I know.
Maybe it will help you.

1321
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:15.060
You know how you wrote like a lot of guys they'll paddle board out there if

1322
01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:19.550
there's like a new sport and just like with a spear.
I think sharp.
Yeah,

1323
01:16:19.551 --> 01:16:24.200
because like you draw the sheriffs,
you fucking Miss Dude.
That's a good show.

1324
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:28.750
Pitch.
That one pitch that well you could do,

1325
01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:33.890
you can probably get away with doing it if you did it with chain mail.

1326
01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:37.340
If you had some sort of a fine chain mail shark suit on,

1327
01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:39.380
he could probably get away with doing that.

1328
01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.900
But you know to see whether or not you got bit,

1329
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:49.820
he knows what a bad ass paddleboard or you would have to be to take that risk.

1330
01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:54.840
I fuck dude,
that could go wrong.
Yeah.

1331
01:16:54.841 --> 01:16:57.150
That would be enough to keep me out of the wine the rest of my life.
Well,

1332
01:16:57.151 --> 01:16:58.400
that was in South Africa.
Right?

1333
01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:02.370
South Africa is one of the worst spots worlds for a shark attacks about North

1334
01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:05.640
Carolina.
This year they will walk on up on shore and biting people.

1335
01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:10.040
Richmond covers makes waves with homemade cage.
Oh,
I

1336
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.850
<v 3>saw those people.
These people walked out with a shark cage on it.</v>

1337
01:17:13.851 --> 01:17:18.590
Looks like a birdcage.
Yeah.
Not bad move.
Got 'em on TV.
That's a six,

1338
01:17:18.591 --> 01:17:22.400
five or six foot.
Great White.
By the way,
it was only six foot.
Oh Wow.

1339
01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.830
That's big enough.
Yeah.
That's plenty big to fuck you up.

1340
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:28.940
You know you are sharks,
man.

1341
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.740
What a crazy animal that guy's face.
Yeah.
I'd rather be bitten by the shark,

1342
01:17:32.741 --> 01:17:36.560
I think.
Well,
I got,
was that John Madden's gay son?

1343
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:40.640
One thousand one thousand I don't think you'd get away from me.

1344
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:46.820
What a great idea.
[inaudible] just such a strange animal.
Did the,

1345
01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:52.140
the Dave Dave got to a stage of existence where they just maintain the exact

1346
01:17:53.631 --> 01:17:55.460
same form for hundreds of millions of years.

1347
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:57.950
It's all he'd been doing for hundreds of millions of year.

1348
01:17:57.951 --> 01:18:01.460
Like they never improved.
Like if they stopped swimming,
they drown.

1349
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:03.590
It's a total shitty design.
They can't sleep.

1350
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:06.770
They just swim around and Jack Things.
I can relate to that,

1351
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:10.220
but that it's hilarious when you think about it.
Like it's a cleanup crew.

1352
01:18:10.221 --> 01:18:13.790
It's like literally like the cleanup crew for the ocean.
That's why I can't stop.

1353
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:15.440
It's not allowed to do what it wants to do.

1354
01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.630
We can't just gorge itself and then just chill out.

1355
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:21.170
No one has to keep moving or it done.
What a fucking bummer.

1356
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.180
What a bomber existence.

1357
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:28.750
You've got to keep moving ahead called Kansas time for that fucked all as a term

1358
01:18:29.721 --> 01:18:34.550
for when you have to keep moving.
Tony Soprano had it.
Oh,
perpetual motion.

1359
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:38.290
You have to keep moving.
Is that a perpetual motion?

1360
01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:42.890
Trying to,
I forget how many people pretended to be Italian after this.

1361
01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:47.200
Pronto's so large percentage.
I don't know.

1362
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:51.950
The good fellas.
Yeah,
all those movies.
It's amazing how many mob movies are,

1363
01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:55.460
it's really think about like the amount of movies made about the Italians.

1364
01:18:55.461 --> 01:18:59.050
The one guy just died from a godfather,
right?
The uh,

1365
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.950
she just died yesterday.
Two days ago.
Who's at fuck,

1366
01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.820
hold on from the Godfather.
You mean the movie and actor or an actual guy?

1367
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:12.240
Marlin Brando.
A

1368
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.120
verb or Berber.
Okay.
Alex rock star.

1369
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.080
No,
that's Mo Green.
Oh,
green.

1370
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:26.810
He fucking two days ago even look like him.

1371
01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:31.690
What's that supposed to be him?
Yeah,
that's him.

1372
01:19:31.691 --> 01:19:35.870
Ri while he looks at him and all that.
Mo Green.
Did he catch one in the,

1373
01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:40.200
I choked on a breadstick at the office.
Oh,
that's fucking racist,
man.

1374
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:44.730
God,
Brian White.
Give me Wagga be you all have gotten when Italian chin,

1375
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:48.920
he has a running joke about all garden.

1376
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:52.280
It slips in all of garden into conversations.

1377
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:56.120
I had the best chunk governor on the olive garden.
I can't remember.
Oh,
a bit.

1378
01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:58.790
I mean I would love to hear it and people.

1379
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.820
You're the trucking Gogel I'll look at him.

1380
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:04.190
My first algorithm in that bottom image.

1381
01:20:04.191 --> 01:20:08.460
That's when like right after he won the academy award.
Yeah.

1382
01:20:08.461 --> 01:20:11.820
Those are the glasses,
my green hat on when he got it.
Getting massage

1383
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.620
does something great about those sweet Justin classes really go.
Yeah.

1384
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:22.200
I believe he's a Boston guy.
Mo Green.
I did not hear that.

1385
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:24.890
Very good theory is that looks more like more grain there.

1386
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:31.560
That's it.
We all go.
Everybody's,
Hey Michael,
how you doing?

1387
01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:37.290
I mean,
all,
we're not going anywhere.
You're going to be okay.
Oh Christ.

1388
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:39.960
What's going to one 10,
one 11 before I go?
Really?
Oh Shit.

1389
01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:43.710
I'll start shitting my pants about a week from now.
But what makes you say that?

1390
01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:47.680
I'm kidding.
He 90,
I'll be gone.
So yeah,
but you gotta stay in it.
You gotta put,

1391
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:50.310
you got to call again.
What's it called again?

1392
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:53.190
That's a extreme in my mind's not even know.

1393
01:20:53.191 --> 01:20:56.680
This one's been out a few years to yeah,
30 minute insanity or whatever.

1394
01:20:56.681 --> 01:20:59.810
And anyone,
you know what I'm talking about t I've seen the commercial.
Uh,

1395
01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:03.270
definitely say the commercial is working out.
He's jumping around for 30 minutes.

1396
01:21:03.271 --> 01:21:05.980
I don't know how you can talk and still,
you know,

1397
01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.820
doing that type of Rebecca decide so it's still been able to speak.

1398
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.470
You got to get a fit.
Unbelievably fit.
Yeah.
When you're demonstrating moves,

1399
01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:16.470
like if you don't,
your martial arts moves,
you get exhausted.

1400
01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:19.080
Like what could talk and you know,

1401
01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.350
throwing kicks and you're trying to explain what you're doing.
You get very good,

1402
01:21:22.351 --> 01:21:26.160
real quick talks nonstop for 30 minutes while he's jumping around and it's,

1403
01:21:26.161 --> 01:21:27.420
people give up.
Like there's,

1404
01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:30.970
there's people that have to sit out like halfway through there.
Absolutely.

1405
01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:34.920
Why you picked some really fucking Weirdo.
It's a lot of time.
It really is hard.

1406
01:21:34.921 --> 01:21:38.190
But how about the,
there's another girl out there,
autumn,

1407
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:43.110
Autumn calibrates her name?
No,
she's a beach body.
One of those.

1408
01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:46.350
Tony Horton.
Probably Chaise and um,

1409
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:51.590
just Google autumn calibrates and she's got the 20 to 21 day fix out of

1410
01:21:52.571 --> 01:21:55.850
something.
Tom,
it's an infomercial at Tom Bergeron,
but you should see it.

1411
01:21:55.851 --> 01:21:56.670
Look at a body on it.
I've,

1412
01:21:56.670 --> 01:22:01.260
I've never seen anybody who doesn't juice or isn't a bodybuilder.
You kidding me?

1413
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:06.360
She and shaped fit.
She looks very fit.
Unbelievable.
30 minute workout though.

1414
01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:11.220
What is her Jane Fonda's?
It's really easy.
School is,
it doesn't evolve.

1415
01:22:11.221 --> 01:22:16.190
One of the things you hold onto this whole shake,
shake weight

1416
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:22.230
fucking exist.
Hence the most ridiculous workout tool ever.

1417
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.900
She grab onto somebody is having a seizure.

1418
01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:28.010
It's hard to find someone as a seizure when you were trying to get work out of

1419
01:22:28.011 --> 01:22:30.120
it.
What was Suzanne Somers one?

1420
01:22:30.121 --> 01:22:33.570
The one that you put in between they have vibrating five mass.

1421
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.120
I bought a used one and licked it but 20 minutes.
Do you know,

1422
01:22:36.121 --> 01:22:39.180
I know a Jujitsu guys who got the thigh master so that they could work the

1423
01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:41.790
inside leg muscles.
So they get squeezed guys buys,
is that right?

1424
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:46.470
But they have info commercials with Jane Fonda.
Get off your bullshit?
No,

1425
01:22:46.471 --> 01:22:48.630
for real.
Is it a merger with a coffee?

1426
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:53.460
It's probably the coffee but they have a infant commercial that Jane Fonda with

1427
01:22:53.461 --> 01:22:57.760
vibrating the vibrating workout thing and it's what some of the funniest shirt

1428
01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:01.140
is linear.
It is thighmaster I bought a used one on Ebay.

1429
01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.500
So then would it smell like I sniffed it for like an hour and set it back?

1430
01:23:05.650 --> 01:23:06.580
Not Acceptable.

1431
01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:11.350
<v 0>Yeah.
It smells like pineapple.
Find me one that's been used by an American.</v>

1432
01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.710
That's the new Hitachi right there.

1433
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.350
I'm not playing around with your goddamn coconut thighmaster

1434
01:23:19.530 --> 01:23:24.100
for sexy hips and thighs.
Oh my God.
What the hell is that?

1435
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.480
Oh Gel
and off to the infomercial.

1436
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:32.440
Bronzing Gelatin.
Hilarious ties together and then orange them.

1437
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:39.130
Exactly how our girls using this to masturbate because it has to be for that,

1438
01:23:39.131 --> 01:23:43.210
right?
Not,
I guess you could get everything warmed up first with that.

1439
01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:44.230
I'll give you,

1440
01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:49.230
you were hell bent on stimulating or simulating some sort of a wild gorilla fuck

1441
01:23:49.811 --> 01:23:52.830
fest.
Will you do is you just squeeze the shit out?

1442
01:23:52.831 --> 01:23:56.890
I think to your legs reach fatigue and you know all the while you've got to like

1443
01:23:56.891 --> 01:24:00.610
play with yourself and then once you realize that your legs are about to give
in,

1444
01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:03.190
that's when you start shoving the dildo inside you.

1445
01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:08.620
I'm not saying you should do this.
I'm just saying that's how I would handle it.

1446
01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:11.890
I just heard shoving the deal done with yourself.
That's all I heard out of that.

1447
01:24:12.190 --> 01:24:16.060
I was just thinking if you really wanted to have,
uh,
you know,

1448
01:24:16.090 --> 01:24:18.850
if you want to use the thighmaster four orgasms,

1449
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:20.170
if you were trying to master it with it,

1450
01:24:20.171 --> 01:24:24.720
that'd be the only way to use it to make your legs tired unless you turn it on.

1451
01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.340
So it's like this,
like a pyramid,

1452
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.270
like the balls at the top and then you put it down and the girls sit on it and

1453
01:24:31.271 --> 01:24:35.650
pushed down.
Like they tried it,
like vibrates.
That's probably what they're doing.

1454
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:40.330
It was back to you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he bronze.

1455
01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:41.860
The bronze is actually in Gel.

1456
01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:44.770
We put it between the legs and have their husband stick the head and then they

1457
01:24:44.771 --> 01:24:49.030
clamp it on their husband's neck.
You know what I know,
like,
I don't like that.

1458
01:24:49.031 --> 01:24:52.660
Those,
Oh my God,
facts are sometimes made up fake.
Half of them are fake.

1459
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:55.090
Sometimes they're made up because there was one about the vibrators.

1460
01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:59.440
The vibrator was the second or third,
you know,
of the uh,

1461
01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:04.240
electronically connected things,
electrically powered,
uh,
things from the,

1462
01:25:04.241 --> 01:25:06.370
in the household.
I was like,
what?
And they're like,

1463
01:25:06.371 --> 01:25:09.270
it beat the washing machine and something else.
And I was like,
wait a minute.

1464
01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:14.280
That's the third most what I used to know the one of the quickest created like

1465
01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:18.340
one of the,
the third oh,
rarely third electric creation.

1466
01:25:18.341 --> 01:25:20.090
That's probably bullshit invention.
Yeah.

1467
01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.820
It was probably came up with Edison's wife.

1468
01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.730
Even say it like you're delivering a pledge.
Like

1469
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.720
they used to have those in doctor's offices.

1470
01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.600
They used to stimulate women to orgasm and doctor's offices.

1471
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:41.400
That was a a normally mean used to go to the right doctor,

1472
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:47.060
the right dentist,
not a laughing gas and just how many say me?

1473
01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:53.260
I have philosophy.
We talked since the Cosby thing.

1474
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.260
Oh come on.
That's,
he's fine.

1475
01:25:56.261 --> 01:25:59.320
This is a racist society trying to pull down another black man,
Joe.

1476
01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:02.770
That's what I never raped anybody,
man.
Why you getting all over his shit?

1477
01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.010
Chuck for public

1478
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:08.480
<v 3>enemy who I love dearly on his a Twitter thing.
He called him a doctor,</v>

1479
01:26:08.481 --> 01:26:13.100
Cosby doc.
Extra Huxtable cheat.

1480
01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:17.960
You know what actually he is a doctor in real life,
but he's a,

1481
01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.970
he's an honorary.
Yes,
exactly.
Yeah,

1482
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.360
but I think they rescinded that or did they take that and they take that back?

1483
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:26.960
They took something back,
took some honorary something or another.
He had back,

1484
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.221
I don't know if it was that,

1485
01:26:28.221 --> 01:26:32.340
but then they built a stone statue of him in front of Grambling there.
What?

1486
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.930
She Tampa,

1487
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:37.610
there's so many funny things that Cosby did in the past that now are a lot more

1488
01:26:37.611 --> 01:26:41.750
funnier now because of all these,
you know,
like he,
like when coke two came out,

1489
01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:44.810
there was a commercial and I forget what the tagline was.
Oh,
I know.

1490
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:48.770
Saying it's like trust me and he's like holding.
Yeah,
I see what you're saying.

1491
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:49.700
Yeah.
And then like,

1492
01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.030
there's like a Cosby show where he makes Chili and goes down and I have my

1493
01:26:53.031 --> 01:26:57.740
special ingredient that makes you go get sleepy and then like he walks into like

1494
01:26:57.741 --> 01:27:02.120
Rudy huck look,
the kids are like eating the chili was like no,
really,

1495
01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:04.700
really says I have my special ingredient.

1496
01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:09.080
There's a car now when you watch them in retrospect,

1497
01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:11.640
they fit that narrative perfectly.
Oh my God.

1498
01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:15.740
So now I've been just thinking of like every single Cosby movie I wanna Watch

1499
01:27:15.741 --> 01:27:17.420
now and find like all the secret things.

1500
01:27:17.421 --> 01:27:19.400
Like what was the one where he was like a,

1501
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:22.850
it was a one where he's pulling a Putin pop out of it.
Unconscious girl's ass.

1502
01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:28.120
What movie was up by like going through like old fat and stuff and

1503
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:33.890
so funny.
Guilty.
What was co thank Gail fucking t.

1504
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:36.020
There was a commercial for coke to that.
I've got a fine,

1505
01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:38.590
that seems like a tough one to argue.
I didn't like pause button.

1506
01:27:38.591 --> 01:27:42.420
Have it like this.
I'm a pretty,
I respected,
but I never found the phonic.

1507
01:27:42.650 --> 01:27:43.790
When I was working at Chris Rock,

1508
01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:47.930
the whole show went to see Cosby and I didn't want to go.
Really?
Yeah.

1509
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.770
Oh yeah.
We're going to see him in Vegas.

1510
01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:55.340
I'm going to take a trip to Vegas just to see him because everybody was telling

1511
01:27:55.341 --> 01:27:58.340
me like,
you got to see him,
that he's the best.
You got to see him.

1512
01:27:59.320 --> 01:27:59.870
They were saying,

1513
01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:03.830
they were saying like he sets up these bits and they're just fucking perfect and

1514
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:12.670
I felt that way about Jay Charbonneau.
J Sharma,
a name from the pile.

1515
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:15.610
You just hurt my feelings.
Stitches.
I forgot about.

1516
01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:19.280
He was the angry guy that I loved him.
He's always angry.

1517
01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:24.080
Holy Shit.
How do you maybe potty is fucking with my memory if you can,
bro.

1518
01:28:24.190 --> 01:28:26.420
All these fucking with your memory.
That's been proven.

1519
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.760
It hasn't been proven on Fox News.
No,
Not Fox News.
Pauly shore.

1520
01:28:30.761 --> 01:28:34.430
His mom put crisis.
That's,
I don't think she did pot.
No,

1521
01:28:34.431 --> 01:28:36.350
she'd probably be never touched a weight in your right.
First of all,

1522
01:28:36.351 --> 01:28:40.250
how dare you.
Second while I think it was some other stuff.
It was what?

1523
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:44.530
It was genetic to Parkinson's.
Oh,
I was just throwing that out there.

1524
01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:48.220
I don't know.
She had a dizzy.
Yeah,
she does know.
Yeah,

1525
01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.360
she's had been ill for a long time.

1526
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:54.110
I think she's got parking either Parkinson's or muscular sclerosis.

1527
01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.990
I don't know what a or multiple sclerosis.
Multiple Sclerosis.
No,
I'm up.

1528
01:28:58.010 --> 01:29:01.290
I loved Mitzi.
She passed me the first night I showed up in La.

1529
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:05.610
She was in the crowd choose and then in the original Rome and it was like open

1530
01:29:05.611 --> 01:29:07.530
mic or a new pot,
pot luck or whatever,

1531
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:10.080
the fine like three guys on up and just ate their own shit.

1532
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:13.230
Like Jay Leno had had the best set and he got like six labs,

1533
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:16.980
j London and then I just fuck.
I went on and you know,

1534
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:20.820
that's when I was doing it four times a night,
you know,
30 nights a month.

1535
01:29:21.210 --> 01:29:23.130
And she just happened to be there and she was fucking little.

1536
01:29:23.131 --> 01:29:26.500
Your hat was falling off.
She got that.
Adam,
do you guys,

1537
01:29:26.501 --> 01:29:29.460
you come in anytime you want the money.
She couldn't have been sweeter.

1538
01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:34.260
Do you miss living out here?
Uh,
I don't miss it,
but I,

1539
01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:38.580
in retrospect,
looking back,
I enjoyed it more than I thought I did.
And I mean,

1540
01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.910
you enjoyed it more than you thought it did when I first,

1541
01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:45.450
when I was so happy to get back to New York and I got in La at all,

1542
01:29:45.451 --> 01:29:49.620
but now they look back on and I had good times.
It wasn't bad.
No,
not bad.
There's,

1543
01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:52.980
there's definitely a difference in the vibe.
You know,
that's the,

1544
01:29:52.981 --> 01:29:56.790
the different vibe that you get when you're in La.
It's just,

1545
01:29:56.791 --> 01:30:00.120
it's just way different than the vibe that you get in New York and especially at

1546
01:30:00.121 --> 01:30:03.420
like comedy clubs,
The New York Comedy Club vibe.
It's like very hostile.

1547
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:05.140
It's a different kind of vibe though.

1548
01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.790
The comedy cellar is like a tourist trap and really?
Yeah,

1549
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:11.220
low Louise show is so popular.

1550
01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:15.300
People come from all over now and they see the comedy cellar,
you know,

1551
01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:19.440
they showed at the beginning of Lucia and like the early shows there are like

1552
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:23.700
sometimes you like,
Whoa,
how did that joke,
swing and mess.
Then after the show,

1553
01:30:23.701 --> 01:30:26.790
the Dome,
I was like,
well that helped 14 people there from like fucking Sweden.

1554
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:29.550
They're all German and uh,

1555
01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:33.000
that's like the early show that I guess the second and third shows it gets back

1556
01:30:33.001 --> 01:30:35.790
to,
but it's not hostile.
It's on the campus of Nyu.

1557
01:30:35.791 --> 01:30:40.500
It's all college kids and they have their brains filled,
you know,
PC,

1558
01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:44.580
Mush,
PC,
college kids.
His mother fucking know it.

1559
01:30:44.581 --> 01:30:49.500
All little punks.
Yeah.
Well Seinfeld's too edgy forum.
So we'll,

1560
01:30:49.501 --> 01:30:52.590
Seinfeld is a racially diverse.

1561
01:30:52.650 --> 01:30:57.650
He didn't diversify as cars and coffee show sounds racist.

1562
01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:02.070
Sounds racist.
Even their problem with him,
they think he's too Ed.
Hey Jamie,

1563
01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:04.070
there's a dude outside.
They don't want to bring in a,

1564
01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:05.370
it was a guy that I met last night.

1565
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:08.010
I wanted to sit down with nick and I don't want to bring this guy in.

1566
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:11.040
His name is screaming.
His name is Adam should be out there right now.

1567
01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:17.750
I can get this guy last night that is a counselor in Florida and uh,

1568
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:21.330
I,
I have to leave tomorrow.
I was trying to figure out what way to,
uh,

1569
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:25.240
to have this guy talked to me about what the fuck he did when I hear about scam,

1570
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:29.010
a money scam,
a crazy money's cam.
This guy was,
uh,
working with,
uh,

1571
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.090
drug rehabilitation people in Florida and like,
you know,

1572
01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:38.630
fucking dealing with people that have all these drug addictions and all the

1573
01:31:38.801 --> 01:31:41.530
different prescriptions that they would put them on and how much money they

1574
01:31:41.531 --> 01:31:42.130
would get.

1575
01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:47.130
He was telling me that they would charge the people like $1,500 a day to keep

1576
01:31:47.171 --> 01:31:50.860
someone,
a patient and their institution.
Can you set up a microphone over here?

1577
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:52.143
Is that possible?

1578
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:53.383
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1579
01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.970
<v 3>Mixing it up.
Nick the Apollo.

1580
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.160
<v 0>Nick,
dip.com.
What are you doing next?
We've got going on.</v>

1581
01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.600
I don't know the out here for question.
I,

1582
01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:10.720
I'm still selling the album and I got such a kick after I did your show and

1583
01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:13.360
Adams and everybody else is out here.
I got a spike in sales,

1584
01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:17.170
so I thought I'd refresh it.
You're like a businessman.
You made a smart business.

1585
01:32:17.171 --> 01:32:21.650
Move out to la.
I did.
That's nice.
So,
you know,
uh,

1586
01:32:21.850 --> 01:32:24.530
do you ever need me to tweet anything?
I'd be more than half.
Seriously.

1587
01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:29.530
I shouldn't have said that.
I'll be hound me.
Give me a hard time.
But I uh,
yeah,

1588
01:32:29.531 --> 01:32:32.340
no,
I did a thing.
And Amy Schumer 12 angry men.
Oh yeah.

1589
01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:37.460
How was that act with Paul Giamatti and Jeff Goldbloom and John Hodge show is

1590
01:32:38.251 --> 01:32:42.790
smashing killer right now.
So,
uh,
you know,
things are kicking him.

1591
01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:44.950
She,
it's getting interesting because she's,
uh,

1592
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.130
she's experiencing some backlash from some shit that she so said no,

1593
01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:52.110
people are mad at her now.
It's interesting.
It's a little fucking sick,
isn't it?

1594
01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.550
Joe Will,
what are we doing here?
They eat themselves.

1595
01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:56.600
Yet there was a final magazines.

1596
01:32:56.610 --> 01:33:01.580
You see the cover of the magazine with her sucking on a c three Po.
Yeah.
And uh,

1597
01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:05.150
yeah,
we'll,
all these people were saying that like that's a,

1598
01:33:05.151 --> 01:33:09.180
an a front to feminism and people are mad at her now and you know,
it's,

1599
01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:12.400
it doesn't promote feminism for her to suck on a robot's file.
Exactly.

1600
01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:14.140
I mean the rate,
like you said,
they're eating each other,

1601
01:33:14.170 --> 01:33:16.260
but she did it and she did them Hispanic,

1602
01:33:16.450 --> 01:33:19.290
but it's not Hispanic people getting mad at her.
It's white liberal people.

1603
01:33:19.291 --> 01:33:22.810
Exactly.
Exactly.
I never have a problem with,
uh,
you know,

1604
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:25.450
like minorities in the audience.
They never have her palm with my shit.

1605
01:33:25.690 --> 01:33:28.990
It's always white little liberal kids trying to defend the,
uh,
feelings.

1606
01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:33.250
Seriously.
Come on in and Adam,
come on and have a seat.
It's fucking embarrassing.

1607
01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.210
Well,
it's uh,
it is,
uh,
put those headphones on too,
if you would.
Yeah,

1608
01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:39.490
it's a fucking,
it's a real problem with comedy.

1609
01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:43.060
Comedy's a big part of what comedy is.
The same shit.

1610
01:33:43.061 --> 01:33:45.250
You don't really mean because it's the funny thing to say.

1611
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.370
And if you're going to cut off that and you're gonna make it like really

1612
01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:51.220
difficult to people for people to express themselves,
honestly,

1613
01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:53.770
you're gonna get shittier and Shittier comedy,
you know,

1614
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.890
you're going to have to only say what you mean always,
you know,

1615
01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:01.930
I say what I mean know and they have a problem with that toe that too.

1616
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.730
But I mean even joking around about shit,

1617
01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:08.740
some things are clearly in just what's up dude pulled that thing up to your face

1618
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.600
better,
their their works man.
So I met this guy last night,

1619
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:17.560
he started talking to me about a co two will tell him,
tell him the whole story.

1620
01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:21.910
Which part of the Medicare part of those issues talk into the microphone.

1621
01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:26.020
Does he ever done a podcast for anything like this?
I wrote a book,
right?
Yeah.

1622
01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:30.370
And what's your of yeah,
two of those things man.
And what is the book?

1623
01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:34.150
The first one is mastering life transitions and the second one is a chemical

1624
01:34:34.151 --> 01:34:36.100
incarceration addicted to the process.

1625
01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:41.230
And so you were working with people that are drug addicted and you felt like it

1626
01:34:41.231 --> 01:34:44.230
was like a money scam.
It is.
I mean it's,

1627
01:34:44.231 --> 01:34:47.920
it's a process they set up to a you from,
from the beginning.
Uh,

1628
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:50.620
I mean they bring you in for a 30 day rehab.
And what I'm talking about.

1629
01:34:50.621 --> 01:34:53.140
A government funded facilities,
you know,
medicare facilities,

1630
01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:57.200
they get you to come in and for 30 days they basically switch out whatever hard

1631
01:34:57.201 --> 01:34:58.010
drugs you're on with

1632
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.280
<v 6>their synthetic drugs.
Right?
Why they make,
you know,</v>

1633
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:06.050
the facility owners get $1,500 a day per patient inpatient facility,

1634
01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:09.650
and then they're discharged.
You're kind of pushed to say,
hey,

1635
01:35:09.651 --> 01:35:13.910
discharge them to our outpatient facility because then they make another five to

1636
01:35:13.911 --> 01:35:17.270
$700 a day per patient affordability of four to eight weeks.

1637
01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:23.120
How ridiculous is that government scam less government Joe?
Well,
it's government.

1638
01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:26.840
It's crazy because the patients want the drugs in the hospital,

1639
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:30.800
but the hospital owners take care of the patients,

1640
01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:35.750
almost like their VIP clients at the Ritz Carlton.
That's so crazy.

1641
01:35:35.751 --> 01:35:39.530
Adam.
Tell everybody full name man.
Adam Lowry.
Yeah.
And uh,

1642
01:35:39.531 --> 01:35:43.040
what's the name of your book?
Um,
the second one is chemical incarceration,

1643
01:35:43.041 --> 01:35:44.120
addicted to the process.

1644
01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:48.650
The first one is mastering life transitions and it's all what is,

1645
01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:52.550
are they both on the same subject?
Uh,
no.
Mastering life transitions was,

1646
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:56.150
I came up with my own theory,
uh,
is called Tsb t trans rational structure,

1647
01:35:56.151 --> 01:35:59.120
behavior theory.
Holy Shit.
Yeah,
that's what I said.

1648
01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:02.030
A whole bunch of psychobabble shit.
But uh,

1649
01:36:02.031 --> 01:36:05.570
then I summed it up to the cognitive rampage and that's essentially what I call

1650
01:36:05.571 --> 01:36:09.890
it,
the cognitive rampage.
Ah,
that's actually the website,
cognitive rampage.com.

1651
01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:14.410
Can I use that for a CD to cry man,
please man,
go ahead and fucking great name.

1652
01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:19.070
Cognitive rampage.
What w what's cognitive rampage and tail?

1653
01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.253
Well,
for me,

1654
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:23.510
when I'm talking or I'm giving my delivery or I'm giving my speeches or whatever

1655
01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:27.860
I'm talking about,
I get really rampaging and I get intense.
I mean,

1656
01:36:27.861 --> 01:36:31.220
I'm trying to fucking help somebody's life.
You get all Donald Trump be like,

1657
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.000
that's different.
That's different.
I mean,

1658
01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.510
I just got tired of that therapist that sit there and you will tell me how that

1659
01:36:38.511 --> 01:36:41.630
makes you feel and then,
you know,
treats you in some pump,

1660
01:36:41.631 --> 01:36:44.060
has manner and dance around you for a half and a fucking hour.

1661
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:45.290
Hope and you figure some shit out.

1662
01:36:45.710 --> 01:36:48.770
So for people that get hooked on drugs and they get involved in some sort of

1663
01:36:48.771 --> 01:36:52.200
recovery program like that with the instantly take the drugs that they're on and

1664
01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:55.010
they put them on another drug that just has a similar effect.
But it's illegal.

1665
01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:00.200
I mean,
they really don't do anything.
No,
nothing.
That's,
that's common.

1666
01:37:00.201 --> 01:37:02.990
That's like with most of the time what happened?
That's period.
What happens?

1667
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:05.990
What's crazy is you could walk into a drug treatment.

1668
01:37:05.991 --> 01:37:09.340
Now these are medicare funded now medicare,
not like passages in Malibu,

1669
01:37:09.341 --> 01:37:11.330
but not like that.
But if you walked in,

1670
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:15.170
you're supposed to be greeted by a physician and diagnosed within the first day

1671
01:37:15.171 --> 01:37:17.540
or two.
Makes Sense.
What a cut costs.

1672
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:22.460
You walk in and a high school graduate fills out your admission paper and throws

1673
01:37:22.461 --> 01:37:25.460
on your diagnosis.
Bipolar,
right.

1674
01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:30.230
You can't even diagnose anybody with that until they're off drugs until they're

1675
01:37:30.231 --> 01:37:31.100
back at baseline.

1676
01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:34.940
But you can't take them into your inpatient unless they have one of those labels

1677
01:37:34.941 --> 01:37:36.920
so they can get paid for.
Well,
there you go.

1678
01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.250
So the legal way of diagnosing someone's being bipolar,

1679
01:37:40.251 --> 01:37:42.110
you got to wait until they're free of all drugs.
That's right.

1680
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:45.530
So they do it illegally.
That's right.
And everybody knows,

1681
01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.560
everyone knows at the willow and Naples,

1682
01:37:48.561 --> 01:37:51.980
west government where I was fucking government.
Yes,

1683
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:55.040
he's right in that and this sense,
right?
Like that's not,

1684
01:37:55.210 --> 01:37:59.160
at least it's keeping people off the streets,
I guess.

1685
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.280
But how much money is being spent and it's all tax dollars,
right?

1686
01:38:02.281 --> 01:38:05.640
If it's Medicare,
oh,
all of it.
It's all of our money.
I mean,
what,

1687
01:38:05.641 --> 01:38:07.800
what's funny is the patients think it's their money.

1688
01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:12.060
So when they're sitting in the rehab,
it's,
Hey doc,
I need my pills.
Right?

1689
01:38:12.061 --> 01:38:14.640
Therapists,
you need to discharge me here and do this for me.

1690
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:18.510
I'm a sense of their fucking travel agent.
I mean,
the book,
what I talk about,

1691
01:38:18.511 --> 01:38:22.830
addicted to the process.
What incentive does somebody have to quit doing drugs?

1692
01:38:22.831 --> 01:38:26.670
All right.
Let's say you have a very minimal education.
Nothing going for you.

1693
01:38:26.671 --> 01:38:30.180
Yeah.
I can quit doing heroin and cocaine and maybe go,
I don't know,

1694
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:31.800
clean shit for a living or something,

1695
01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.670
but then I can't even have a drink to waste away that shit day I just had.

1696
01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:39.270
So what they do is they'll come into a 30 day treatment facility,

1697
01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:44.410
do their 30 days,
but its bed and breakfast.
It's drugs,
it's smoking,
it's sex.

1698
01:38:44.411 --> 01:38:49.080
Even in most of them.
Yeah.
They take away ambition,

1699
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:53.040
government programs,
it's,
they do the bathrooms become fucking hostels.

1700
01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.210
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
And then after 30 days by law,

1701
01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.340
I have to find them where they're going to live,

1702
01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.910
where they're going to get their next drugs from and how they're going to get

1703
01:39:02.911 --> 01:39:03.930
there and their doctor.

1704
01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:09.240
So it eliminates all the ambition they might have to get their shit together.

1705
01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:13.650
Completely enables him.
Wow.
That's insane.
Do you want to quit?

1706
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:17.130
Would you want to quit?
I do.
30 days.
I was on heroin for a while.
Not me,

1707
01:39:17.131 --> 01:39:19.140
but let's say I was,
and I walk in,
I do 30 days.

1708
01:39:19.141 --> 01:39:23.460
I meet some new finance chicken AA meeting that sees life the way I do and we're

1709
01:39:23.461 --> 01:39:26.670
going to conquer this together so we get discharged to say,
I don't know,

1710
01:39:26.671 --> 01:39:28.290
I've always wanted to see Savannah.

1711
01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:31.770
Well by law I got a discharge and find their house,
find their doctor,

1712
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:35.340
what we then fly them there or send them on a bus.

1713
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:39.960
Then they go to outpatient facility four to eight weeks on our dime.
Again,

1714
01:39:39.961 --> 01:39:43.690
just to hang out with more people that don't want to quit party some more for a

1715
01:39:43.691 --> 01:39:46.740
while only to relapse and go,
well I guess a,

1716
01:39:46.741 --> 01:39:48.900
I'll admit myself to this savanna rehab.

1717
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.750
Then do another 30 days come out and now they go,
well,

1718
01:39:51.751 --> 01:39:53.010
I've always wanted to go to Vegas.

1719
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:56.670
Where's the ambition to get clean or the incentive and wealthy whizzy and

1720
01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:59.610
incentive to work.
You're going to go out and get a 40,000 a year job.

1721
01:39:59.611 --> 01:40:02.730
You can get that benefit.
Is this.
It seems like I would have heard of this.

1722
01:40:02.731 --> 01:40:05.100
That's why he freaked me out when we were talking last night.

1723
01:40:05.101 --> 01:40:08.460
Like it was after the show and I was talking to them when there's a bunch of

1724
01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:11.760
people around is dom I rare we're hanging out with and it was,

1725
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:15.660
it was hard to like get a real bead on how deep this went,

1726
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:17.910
just with all those other people around all that.

1727
01:40:17.911 --> 01:40:21.030
But what you're saying doesn't make any sense because it seems like,

1728
01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.200
not that I don't believe you,

1729
01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:26.130
but it seems like that would have been so obvious a long time ago.

1730
01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:30.160
That's a ridiculous way to do things.
You can't because if I'm like,

1731
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:32.010
what would be a licensed therapist?

1732
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:35.670
If I say anything I get blackballed from ever working at any facility again.

1733
01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:39.750
Oh my God.
No therapist after you go get $150,000,
you know,

1734
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:42.510
a degree,
you got debt,
you've got to pay.

1735
01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:46.290
If you speak out against what's happening,
you're blackballed.
And that's it.

1736
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:50.020
And all of these facility factors know each other.
Wow.
What's your,

1737
01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:52.440
what's your title?
You'll work title?
Well,

1738
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.790
technically I can't say therapist anymore.

1739
01:40:54.791 --> 01:40:58.000
I'm not a licensed therapist cause fuck that.
I don't want it.

1740
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:01.530
I gave it back and I don't believe in practicing and some conservative structure

1741
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:06.610
change somebody's life.
Um,
and so it's just me with a master's degree.

1742
01:41:06.611 --> 01:41:10.300
Uh,
some life coaching stuff.
A freelance.
Okay.
What is your,

1743
01:41:10.301 --> 01:41:13.630
what is your degree in mental health counseling.
Wow.

1744
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:17.710
What a trip that must be to be embedded in that system.
Like that dude,

1745
01:41:17.711 --> 01:41:20.170
it fucking killed me to be straight with you man.
Uh,
you know,

1746
01:41:20.171 --> 01:41:22.150
when I first got in I was,
you know,

1747
01:41:22.151 --> 01:41:25.800
cause I really changed my life from the shit I used to be in.
Turn it around,

1748
01:41:25.810 --> 01:41:28.240
show up,
ready to,
you know,
help people and get involved.

1749
01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:33.010
Only to see everyone around me corrupt.
They,
they've given the fuck up.
Wow.

1750
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:37.270
That's so crazy that there's so much of a money grab going on.

1751
01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:41.830
I never had heard that before.
And nobody has a reason.
I mean,

1752
01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:43.540
the facility owners are making millions.

1753
01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:47.290
The people getting treatment or getting her drugs in,
uh,

1754
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:49.870
in bed and breakfast place.
Why would they want to say anything?

1755
01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:53.170
Therapist can't say anything.
He'll lose his fucking job.
I want to do heroin.

1756
01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.790
Come on nick.
Let's,
uh,
let's do some heroin for a couple of months.

1757
01:41:58.510 --> 01:42:01.840
From what I hear is a box in as much better.
The synthetic stuff that we may say,

1758
01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:05.480
you're white.
She hit her on the corner of your mouth.
What is the box?

1759
01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:08.560
This is the other thing you were telling me last night.
They replaced the heroin.

1760
01:42:08.561 --> 01:42:11.470
The people come in,
they have a heroin addiction.
They replace it with suboxone,

1761
01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:15.100
but the differences that heroin is pretty cheap and suboxone is fucking really

1762
01:42:15.101 --> 01:42:18.520
expensive.
There you go.
Like what does the difference in the money?
Well,

1763
01:42:18.521 --> 01:42:21.430
now you can get suboxone pills on the street for 20 bucks to 40 bucks.

1764
01:42:21.431 --> 01:42:25.630
Depends on who has it and it's cheaper than your fucking copay.
Wow.

1765
01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:29.230
Your copay when you buy it from the pharmacist is more expensive than buying it

1766
01:42:29.231 --> 01:42:33.730
on the street many times.
It depends on your plan.
D So many pro tips.

1767
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:38.560
So many protests.
Brian's ready to get out of here.
He's like,
I have felonies.

1768
01:42:38.561 --> 01:42:43.390
Jumped Brian's apartment,
new apartment,
nice and skinny heroine.

1769
01:42:43.391 --> 01:42:46.630
Chicken with their blue baby crawling on the ceiling.
Gray,
blue baby.

1770
01:42:46.631 --> 01:42:51.280
But you do want skinny heroine.
Get tastes in music.
Just tasteful tattoos,

1771
01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.110
some knuckle tattoos,
a shady pasts,
but she's good cuddler.

1772
01:42:58.750 --> 01:43:03.220
Have you been in a Rehab Jogi Oh,
I just said kind of.
I see the picture now.
Very,

1773
01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:08.410
very boot Koski 76 you can't go on 60 minutes or anything cause you'll be well

1774
01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:10.990
cast.
One of the owners I worked for actually,

1775
01:43:10.991 --> 01:43:15.130
he's already even been arrested for Medicare fraud in 1985 and he still owns

1776
01:43:15.131 --> 01:43:16.180
four hospitals today.

1777
01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:20.800
Mind maybe all of the people that you're learning this from our fraud.

1778
01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:24.370
And so you're just like outing all your bosses and they don't actually do this.

1779
01:43:24.490 --> 01:43:27.390
Oh well now my,
my boss,
my direct bosses.

1780
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:31.780
Now Leo [inaudible] was my mentor manager.
Leo also mentioned names Bro.

1781
01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:36.010
Those listening.
He's a good dude.
But um,

1782
01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:40.410
this was in Florida.
Yeah.
So that's such a fucking whacked out state.
I,

1783
01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.750
is that like everywhere in the country or is it just Florida has this,
well,

1784
01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:46.990
what's crazy is Florida has its own Medicare fraud phone number.

1785
01:43:46.991 --> 01:43:48.790
Why every other state calls one number.

1786
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:56.570
That's some shit.
It's hilarious man.
It is.

1787
01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:00.770
Oh my God.
What a wacky ass fucking state.
So what he was telling me last night,

1788
01:44:00.771 --> 01:44:03.350
we were talking about the uh,
Oxycontin Express,

1789
01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:06.620
that documentary about all the people that were getting these uh,

1790
01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:09.500
oxycontin prescriptions from those pain management centers.

1791
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:11.120
And he said that they had replaced,

1792
01:44:11.121 --> 01:44:13.010
it was a boxing and they just start telling me,

1793
01:44:13.011 --> 01:44:15.500
cause he told me was a drug counselor.
I was like,
oh,

1794
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:17.810
I need to fucking hear what's going on down there.

1795
01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:22.580
And I didn't expect a can of worms that you opened up.
I was like,
what?
I can't,

1796
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:27.680
how much,
how much money is going on through what?
And that's just Florida.

1797
01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:32.390
That's just Florida to what happens in Massachusetts or California or something

1798
01:44:32.391 --> 01:44:34.640
like that.
Like they're different.
I haven't done therapy there.

1799
01:44:34.641 --> 01:44:37.790
But what's funny is all of the patients that wind up at the willow or on the

1800
01:44:37.791 --> 01:44:40.670
rounds,
so they come from California,
they come from Boston,

1801
01:44:40.671 --> 01:44:44.630
they come from all these places and they're,
the willow is just around to do,

1802
01:44:44.631 --> 01:44:47.510
they have a timeframe where they have to get out by,
and it depends.

1803
01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:51.970
Different plans.
So they have like 90 lifetime days that um,

1804
01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:53.270
every year rebirth.

1805
01:44:53.630 --> 01:44:58.580
And then you have 160 days during the year so you can go in 30 days,
come out 30,

1806
01:44:58.581 --> 01:45:02.900
wait 30 it repopulates again.
Now the patients though that people that use this,

1807
01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:06.140
they know the systems better than the doctors do better than the insurance

1808
01:45:06.141 --> 01:45:07.070
specialists and everything.

1809
01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:11.810
The place I was at actually has a salesforce upfront.

1810
01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:16.520
They call the people that come through their alumni and frequent fliers and so

1811
01:45:16.521 --> 01:45:20.170
they will call him and go,
hey,
it's been awhile since you've been in who?
Whoever,

1812
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:25.070
um,
why don't you come in for a medication adjustment?
Wow.
It's illegal as fuck.

1813
01:45:25.610 --> 01:45:30.260
And they call them in for medication adjustment.
And so who's instigating that?

1814
01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.510
Is it the employees?

1815
01:45:32.511 --> 01:45:35.900
Is there a director that tells the employees what they have to do?

1816
01:45:35.901 --> 01:45:39.020
Like how does that work?
They keep it really,
really close.

1817
01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:42.470
So there's two or three friends that are close with the owners that work in the,

1818
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:45.050
well,
it's not sales department,
it's the admissions department,

1819
01:45:45.051 --> 01:45:48.920
but we all know it as the sales department.
It's like an Audi dealership.

1820
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:53.120
The undercoating that's like Fargo.

1821
01:45:53.730 --> 01:45:56.720
You want to get that undercoat got 50 thousands of bucks in points,

1822
01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:59.810
but they won't call you to Vegas unless they know you have days left.

1823
01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:03.560
What if you don't have days?
They can pull up your chart and go,
all right,

1824
01:46:03.561 --> 01:46:06.890
he's got 10 days.
He's usually here every three months.
He hasn't been back.

1825
01:46:06.891 --> 01:46:09.290
I wonder how he's doing.
Let's call him up.
Hey,

1826
01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:12.170
I know you're fighting sobriety and may have been sober for three months,

1827
01:46:12.171 --> 01:46:14.510
but why don't you come back for medication adjustment?

1828
01:46:15.970 --> 01:46:19.130
If you were really feeling sober and you would,

1829
01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:23.630
you would kinda like graduated past the demons of the pills and you were off of

1830
01:46:23.631 --> 01:46:27.320
it,
but then you got that phone call.
I got that phone call.
It's like,
look,

1831
01:46:27.321 --> 01:46:29.870
I got it for you.
How about a medication adjustment baby?

1832
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:33.320
The dope boys have left the corner and put on white coats and moved into

1833
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:37.310
psychiatric hospitals.
That's another good album.
Medication adjustment.
Yeah,

1834
01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.170
I like that.
That's a good name.
That's a good one.
Medication adjustment.

1835
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:46.250
I liked that one.
You know,
thoughts and white coach.
That's amazing man.

1836
01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:47.180
That's amazing.

1837
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:49.800
It's amazing that that's the system in place where at least in Florida,

1838
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:53.430
so is that how they're making up for the money that they lost by selling all the

1839
01:46:53.431 --> 01:46:56.460
oxycontin's it's a pharmaceutical companies are,

1840
01:46:56.461 --> 01:46:57.600
they're always out to get the money.

1841
01:46:57.601 --> 01:47:01.020
So now there's a box in the story is pretty fucking crazy.
Uh,

1842
01:47:01.021 --> 01:47:02.400
in the 70s is when's the box?

1843
01:47:02.401 --> 01:47:06.390
And started to come out and the government was going to subsidize the payment

1844
01:47:06.391 --> 01:47:10.680
and anybody to build this,
please build this pill for us.
Um,
we know it works,

1845
01:47:10.681 --> 01:47:13.860
et Cetera.
Pfizer and all the big boys said,
fuck you.
We're not touching it.

1846
01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:14.970
We know it's addictive as hell.

1847
01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:18.450
They left it alone and a mustard company that made from us.

1848
01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:22.950
You see it's quite cold and
it's got people hooked on Shit.

1849
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:26.430
So they were going out of business and they accepted the offer of the
government,

1850
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.810
got paid,
took the subsidies and develop the drug suboxone problem was,
yeah,

1851
01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:36.240
when you were making Pfizer look good,
wow,
you're really fucking,

1852
01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.850
so that's coming from a right wing.

1853
01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:43.590
The problem is they had laws on the books that a physician cannot prescribe a

1854
01:47:43.591 --> 01:47:45.450
narcotic to get someone off a narcotic.

1855
01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:50.220
So then they spend the next 30 years changing the laws.
Now here comes the pill,

1856
01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:52.950
we're ready to market it.
Right?
So it works kind of like Methadone.

1857
01:47:52.951 --> 01:47:55.740
But in the marketing meeting we'd go,
look guys,
we can't rebrand methadone.

1858
01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:58.830
What are we going to do?
So they all sit around and they go,
well look,

1859
01:47:58.831 --> 01:48:01.740
everybody go in these facilities is in Aa or in a right,

1860
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:05.550
so higher power stuff.
So what did they do?

1861
01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:09.300
The first stamp that they put on this pill as a Christian Cross and they dub it

1862
01:48:09.301 --> 01:48:12.770
the miracle drug.
Yes sir.

1863
01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:17.240
Fed it to everybody.
Hold on.
So when you get as a,
boxing has a cross,
he used to,

1864
01:48:17.241 --> 01:48:20.000
not anymore.
They changed it leaves.
Let me see that picture Jamie.

1865
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:24.290
The little orange,
he'll find it.
Oh my God,
that is evil.

1866
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:28.940
And that's some shit.
I didn't even think about that.
But Nan 12 step,
they uh,

1867
01:48:28.941 --> 01:48:32.750
all the alcoholics anonymous NNA they all guide based,
right?
Higher power.

1868
01:48:33.050 --> 01:48:37.400
Not a lot of paper.
The best acid was Jesus Christ acid.
That's what I'd heard.

1869
01:48:37.401 --> 01:48:40.550
Right.
Is that [inaudible] you for,

1870
01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.800
do you remember how many guys you to try the Moses Week?

1871
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:46.880
But do you remember any guys came from alcoholics anonymous in a stand up

1872
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:50.000
because they've learned how to stand up in front of those groups and making

1873
01:48:50.001 --> 01:48:54.080
everybody laugh.
Dave Fitzgerald,
remember David's Gerald died of cancer.
Yeah.

1874
01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:59.150
Funny fucking guy.
He was a funny guy.
Look at this.
Jesus Christ is generally,

1875
01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:02.370
that is,
is he literally,
yeah,
that is that a cross,

1876
01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.430
it's a sweater to crime into be both.
Is it really meant to be both?

1877
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:11.780
He tried to pin it on Christians who came up with,
Oh man,

1878
01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:15.800
this is a Jewish thing.
It's crazy,
right?
You look at stats,

1879
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:19.510
what the fuck's an eight and it's that gay rights thing.
The no hates in nature.

1880
01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:26.870
It's gay rights and Jesus together in harmony in heroin.

1881
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:30.470
It's amazing.
I'll go with eight milligrams of the cross please.
Yeah,

1882
01:49:30.471 --> 01:49:33.800
it's definitely a more swordlike like cross like,

1883
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:36.740
but if you were like a supercross person,

1884
01:49:36.741 --> 01:49:40.700
I hated Christians.
It's just a tall cross

1885
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:47.800
knife.
It does a little bit.
But why that not lighting.

1886
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.850
It's heroin addiction with heroin with a pointy thing.

1887
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.090
I think it's tower Sabic God him surrender.

1888
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:58.480
You can help people on drugs or I just said it's tower so

1889
01:50:03.090 --> 01:50:07.600
it's a,
that is really fucking crazy though that that's how they do it now.

1890
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:09.670
They're giving it to alcoholics too,
to get them off of that.

1891
01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:11.380
Give you a little heroin.
You get off of alcohol.

1892
01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:13.660
It's hilarious in that some shit man.

1893
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:17.260
It's hilarious that they were just allowed to do that and they could just decide

1894
01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:19.380
they're going to just give you drugs 90 days.

1895
01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:22.420
So why you kick a user who's only been clean 30 days.

1896
01:50:22.421 --> 01:50:26.050
You give him 90 days supply of suboxone and send him on his way to some other

1897
01:50:26.051 --> 01:50:29.290
city.
So did they have to take piss tests when they go into these rehab places?

1898
01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:32.620
So they might be on suboxone and who knows what the fuck they are.

1899
01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:34.620
They trade them,
they trade them.

1900
01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:38.980
We have athletes pissing into cups every two weeks.
But people who need the help.

1901
01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:43.880
Exactly.
Right.
Shit,
we paid $1,500 a day and we don't drug test the middle.
Right.

1902
01:50:43.930 --> 01:50:46.660
We drug test them when they get there just to find out all this shit they're on.

1903
01:50:46.661 --> 01:50:51.520
So if they give him other shit,
they don't accidentally kill him.
Wow.
That's it.

1904
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:53.740
I want to know if this is all across the country.

1905
01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.590
I want to know if this is like California.
I was in Michigan course.

1906
01:50:56.591 --> 01:50:57.424
It's only in Florida.

1907
01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:02.080
[inaudible]

1908
01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:06.160
it's one of the craziest places ever.
So he just plays to get drugs.
Yeah,

1909
01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:08.500
I would agree,
right?
Yeah.
What a good state.

1910
01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:10.780
Now you don't even need insurance or money.
It's hard to get.

1911
01:51:10.781 --> 01:51:13.870
Pot is going to go to Vermont.
It's not an easy spot to get pot.
Right.

1912
01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:18.440
It's a little shifty.
Yeah.
You got to park and meet somebody.
Go.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1913
01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.470
As opposed to walking into a government run facility.

1914
01:51:20.650 --> 01:51:23.380
This is Elsie getting it delivered to you with your breakfast morning.

1915
01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.630
Can I speak to my Senate to plays?
You need a buzz.

1916
01:51:25.690 --> 01:51:29.260
I mean they're essentially giving them pills and giving them a house to live in.

1917
01:51:30.010 --> 01:51:30.520
Yeah,

1918
01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:33.790
and then transport to any city they want to go hang out with more drug addicts

1919
01:51:33.791 --> 01:51:36.040
and have some more fun paid for it.
That's right.

1920
01:51:36.190 --> 01:51:39.190
Now I understand where Nick Depaul's anger coming from.
Damn right.

1921
01:51:39.250 --> 01:51:43.570
That's where that Breitling rage slash snooze rage fucking.

1922
01:51:43.810 --> 01:51:48.310
He keeps saying that.
Joe on MSNBC,
Fox red eyes,
a good show.

1923
01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:53.860
They don't pay and fucking,
there's no exposure.
I quit doing it.
They don't pay.

1924
01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:56.350
They don't pay you at all?
Nope.
Whoa.

1925
01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:59.170
I used to bus gut feels balls and I was doing it.
I go,
what the fuck?

1926
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:00.250
You're on a three in the morning.

1927
01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:03.910
It's not exactly a lot of exposure and I'm getting no money and now you want me

1928
01:52:03.911 --> 01:52:07.260
to research the topics but don't they have like a s scale?

1929
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:10.870
They don't have none of that.
Which is funny.

1930
01:52:10.871 --> 01:52:14.680
I know cause I you think how successful you know,
and also it was Corey,

1931
01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:17.560
those shows are good because they have guys like you want,

1932
01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:21.100
I mean that's what makes them fun.
You know guys like you and Norton and Anthony,

1933
01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:25.740
right?
You opened Anthony Fan brother.
Tell him fuck yeah man.

1934
01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.390
It makes me sad that there's still split up.

1935
01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.120
I thought they would have worked the shit out by now.
Got Back together again.

1936
01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:37.120
Yeah.
Poor Anthony.
Hopefully they will.

1937
01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:40.900
I hope they will.
So you,
you stopped doing this,

1938
01:52:40.901 --> 01:52:44.080
you gave up your license and a,
what are you doing now?
What kind of,

1939
01:52:44.170 --> 01:52:47.060
you're doing more counseling now and now I can't send an allowed to say

1940
01:52:47.061 --> 01:52:49.070
counseling and therapy because of the license thing.

1941
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:52.550
But so now you're doing like a,
you're just helping people with their lives.

1942
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:55.190
Actually I do a thing that a cold,
full synergy,
right?

1943
01:52:55.191 --> 01:52:58.640
It's some fun language play Shit.
But for the most part,
man,

1944
01:52:58.641 --> 01:53:00.050
I believe in feeding the mind,

1945
01:53:00.051 --> 01:53:03.260
feeding the body and feeding whatever it is you believe equally on a daily,

1946
01:53:03.290 --> 01:53:05.270
you know,
keeping a balance,
you know,
the uh,
you know,

1947
01:53:05.271 --> 01:53:07.970
feeding the body relaxes the mind except that kind of stuff,
you know.

1948
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.310
And so what I'm doing is I use my theory and instead of sitting down doing this

1949
01:53:13.311 --> 01:53:16.370
talk therapy,
so tell me about your fucking childhood or some shit.

1950
01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:20.330
Cause none of that shit really matters.
But to a point,
but a,

1951
01:53:20.331 --> 01:53:23.390
it's going right into helping people kind of look at what their life philosophy

1952
01:53:23.391 --> 01:53:23.930
is.
You know,

1953
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:27.650
helping them build a more rational life philosophy to make decisions and build a

1954
01:53:27.651 --> 01:53:30.500
purposeful routine is what I call a purpose restructure.
Yeah.

1955
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:35.780
So do you get clients from,
you get them privately now?

1956
01:53:35.781 --> 01:53:36.510
Like how do you,

1957
01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:38.920
so they have to know about you from someone else or something like that?
Yeah,

1958
01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:41.060
for the most part they uh,
how they find out about you,

1959
01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:43.960
you usually a friend of a friend or somebody that knows,
um,

1960
01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:48.380
I have this fucking talent of helping out the worst of the worst man.
You know,

1961
01:53:48.381 --> 01:53:51.840
the people that have been,
you know,
15,
20 years on heroin and you know,

1962
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:53.910
hard stuff and um,

1963
01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:57.650
we do some out of the box treatments ever start ever since I started listening

1964
01:53:57.651 --> 01:53:59.840
to your show.
Oh

1965
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:03.183
terms,

1966
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.600
just an open idea to look into it myself to make those decisions.
But TDC,

1967
01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:13.490
TMT,
it kills mosquitoes.
Yeah.
Finished.

1968
01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:16.220
Sanka Sanka

1969
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:20.450
my wife and I tell you last night,
just finished the uh,

1970
01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:24.290
little silicide and retreat if you will,
me and her at the Joshua Tree.

1971
01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:28.380
Did you tell the drug addicts about this?
Yeah.
You look,
let them know.
Yeah.

1972
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:30.040
You could try some other stuff.
Yeah,

1973
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:33.560
that would be amazing if they had a fucking mushroom place where you can go just

1974
01:54:33.561 --> 01:54:34.970
like they're doing with the suboxone shit.

1975
01:54:34.971 --> 01:54:37.550
If you had like a halfway mushroom house.
Well,
like you said,

1976
01:54:37.551 --> 01:54:40.160
that Shit changes your perspective sometime right.
On life.

1977
01:54:40.161 --> 01:54:43.930
So it might even work in it does it?
Does it,
it would work afraid of that shit.

1978
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:46.910
It would work way better because you'd want to get the fuck out of that halfway

1979
01:54:46.911 --> 01:54:49.340
house.
That's the first thing you'd want to do.
You'd be ambitious.
It'd be like,

1980
01:54:49.341 --> 01:54:52.310
I got to get,
this is not what I'm,
I'm doing the wrong thing.

1981
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:54.170
I got to get my life in order.
Like what am I doing here?

1982
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:57.710
Accepting a government check and taking mushrooms as well.

1983
01:54:57.711 --> 01:55:00.410
You walk into a facility and they go bipolar.
Nicco thank you.

1984
01:55:00.411 --> 01:55:04.860
I can collect that check now.
Exactly.
So now you collect those.
Now you just let,

1985
01:55:04.890 --> 01:55:07.200
it's a very small,
you're not getting rich off of it.
I mean,

1986
01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:08.840
not to take any ambition away,

1987
01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:12.940
but if I give you a nineties a box in and you only need 30 and you sell the 60

1988
01:55:12.941 --> 01:55:15.680
day ago,
what are you gonna do with that money?
Uh,
you go,

1989
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:20.270
so what does it as a box and like one a day and they would give him 90 for 90

1990
01:55:20.271 --> 01:55:24.770
days or 90 for 30 to 90 for 30 days.
Oh my God.
So they get a three a day.

1991
01:55:24.771 --> 01:55:28.100
So you'd just be barbecued all day long.
She's on toasted.

1992
01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:31.150
I'd have people sitting in my group therapy nodding,
right?

1993
01:55:31.151 --> 01:55:33.440
Write drooling is a box in the fuck out.

1994
01:55:33.441 --> 01:55:38.441
Collada pins the box in and dilauded does crazy that this is a therapy program

1995
01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:42.690
that you guys would be talking to.
People just jacked out of their mind out.

1996
01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:44.090
So maybe Brody's

1997
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.360
<v 1>on to something this whole time.</v>

1998
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:52.290
That's how I was that trashcan outside.
Oh,
that's so loud.
Maybe Bro.

1999
01:55:52.291 --> 01:55:57.180
It is on us.
Shit.
Yeah.
I mean,
he's been weening himself off lately,
supposedly.

2000
01:55:57.260 --> 01:56:01.080
What did they have him on call on him in a,
I don't know,
a ton.

2001
01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:03.330
I need to have the guns,
a boxing day,

2002
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:06.630
and I've had heard suboxone because that's the thing.
When you said that name,

2003
01:56:06.631 --> 01:56:10.380
I was like,
if I heard that name from OT before,
maybe,
I don't know.
See,

2004
01:56:10.381 --> 01:56:13.710
I don't know enough about those fucking pills to know exactly what that means.

2005
01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:18.390
You know,
like,
I didn't know that Oxycontin is different than oxycodone.

2006
01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:21.660
It's different than Viking,
but they're all kind of similar.
Right.

2007
01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:25.710
After all that oxycotton express stuff,
they changed the Kim,
the compounds in it,

2008
01:56:25.711 --> 01:56:29.360
so it become less addictive and also so you couldn't smoke it anymore.
Really?

2009
01:56:29.370 --> 01:56:33.360
Yeah.
That's why they changed it.
Wow.
That's amazing.

2010
01:56:33.361 --> 01:56:36.300
So that documentary did a world of good,
huge,
huge.

2011
01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.370
If anybody who hasn't seen that,
you've got to watch it.

2012
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:40.290
But there wasn't that long ago they were running this.

2013
01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.090
If they had these pain management centers,

2014
01:56:42.091 --> 01:56:45.090
he'd show up with the pain management center.
Ah,
my back,
the doctor would go,

2015
01:56:45.091 --> 01:56:48.840
yeah,
my knees fucking drugs.
Just walk right there.

2016
01:56:49.590 --> 01:56:51.900
And it was another desk right there that at the drugs,

2017
01:56:52.110 --> 01:56:55.110
I mean like literally he was like in the same room with him and he would go

2018
01:56:55.111 --> 01:56:56.070
right to the pharmacist.

2019
01:56:56.071 --> 01:56:59.340
The pharmacist write you a little thing and give you a package and you're out

2020
01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:02.520
the door and you've got drugs.
One of the clients I work with,
his,

2021
01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:06.450
his scan that he used to do is he would get like three or four big charter
buses,

2022
01:57:06.451 --> 01:57:09.600
those giant ones and fill it with senior citizens from another state.

2023
01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:13.700
Drive him down to Florida and promise them a trip to Florida sightseeing and

2024
01:57:13.710 --> 01:57:16.380
lunch.
Drive him down here,
get all their scripts,

2025
01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:20.390
filled them all completely drive him back and keep all of their medications.

2026
01:57:21.490 --> 01:57:25.830
Whoa.
Yeah.
So did he get the scripts from them?

2027
01:57:25.831 --> 01:57:29.220
Did they have to sign the scripts over all of it so it was part of their deal.

2028
01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:30.660
They realized it.
They go,
yeah,

2029
01:57:30.661 --> 01:57:33.070
you can do this and there's that legal or is that all?

2030
01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:35.160
That's all ego that was hitting the pill mills.

2031
01:57:35.161 --> 01:57:38.250
You were just talking about Jesus Christ.
That's get a bus.

2032
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:44.360
How much money could you make off of a bus of old pills?
Go to Miami figures,

2033
01:57:44.370 --> 01:57:48.180
60 people,
30 to 90 pills at 20 to 50 a pill.

2034
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:49.680
I'm not even smiling not to be a criminal.

2035
01:57:49.681 --> 01:57:53.220
That just pissed me off about all this shit.
Okay.
I don't think this is,

2036
01:57:53.250 --> 01:57:56.430
this is one of those legal,
this isn't legal.
No,
no.
Right.

2037
01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:59.280
It is legal to have those pain management centers and to just,

2038
01:57:59.281 --> 01:58:01.770
you just walk in off the street and they're cracking down on the island.
Florida.

2039
01:58:01.771 --> 01:58:03.930
They're,
they're really pushing them out now because of that,

2040
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:06.240
because of the documentary,
they've really shut them down,

2041
01:58:06.241 --> 01:58:09.240
but all they've done now is turned to psychiatric facilities.

2042
01:58:09.241 --> 01:58:12.840
There's three different levels of psych facilities and now Obama put out another

2043
01:58:12.841 --> 01:58:13.380
five.

2044
01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:17.450
Was it 5 million or 5 billion to open up more because there's a need for said

2045
01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:19.450
Obama.
He said the o word for nick.
The shit,

2046
01:58:22.050 --> 01:58:26.640
the government ain't coming from my side of the fucking sounds good cause it's

2047
01:58:26.641 --> 01:58:29.850
wrapped in the shroud of we're helping more mental health facilities.

2048
01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:33.990
I always wrap the boy shit a shit.
Exactly.
It's a good,

2049
01:58:34.050 --> 01:58:36.510
it's a convincing argument against big government for sure.

2050
01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:38.490
It's a convincing argument that people,

2051
01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:41.680
when you give them the opportunity to make a shitload of money by controlling a

2052
01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:42.190
segment

2053
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:46.540
<v 6>of anything,
whether it's,
you know,
whatever it is,
mental health,
anything.</v>

2054
01:58:46.541 --> 01:58:49.840
As soon as they figured out there's a spot where they could start extracting

2055
01:58:49.841 --> 01:58:54.040
money.
They just do take your ambition away and make you,
that's you.

2056
01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:56.650
You focus on that a lot,
right.
And it's totally true.
I mean,

2057
01:58:56.651 --> 01:58:59.420
at anybody says it's not the idea that you,

2058
01:58:59.450 --> 01:59:02.080
you become reliant violate you violate human nature.

2059
01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:06.790
Human nature is if someone has to scratch and scrounge,
you get ambitious.

2060
01:59:06.791 --> 01:59:10.060
You figure your way out of a hole.
That's what most people do.
And you know,

2061
01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:13.240
a lot of the,
you know,
the people that I've seen in these hospitals,
you know,

2062
01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:15.760
you see a glimmer of hope that want to do that,

2063
01:59:15.761 --> 01:59:19.030
but then they're hit by the same phrase,
I get way fucking tired of hearing.

2064
01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:21.880
It's not your fault.
You don't have a disease.

2065
01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:26.050
Geez us a golf fuckers.

2066
01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:29.790
That's like a blanket statement for the times we live in.
When you get nowhere,

2067
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:33.280
nobody's responsible for anything are accountable for any that happened in the

2068
01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:36.160
70s too.
And Mr. Carl Rogers came out with positive psychology.

2069
01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:39.100
When we sit in front of you and tell you how great you are at everything despite

2070
01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:40.390
how shitty you are at everything.

2071
01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:44.230
And so as we start to tell you you're great at everything,
now we can go,
well,

2072
01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:47.830
it's not a disease.
It's all right.
It's a disease.
I mean it's not your fault.

2073
01:59:47.831 --> 01:59:52.150
So you know,
just BNA the rest of your life do nothing.
Um,

2074
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:57.160
when you agree,
sorry to interrupt you,
but it is kind of a disease to a point.

2075
01:59:57.161 --> 02:00:00.070
What they're really trying to say is that after a long time of doing it,

2076
02:00:00.071 --> 02:00:03.130
we don't know what's up with your brain.
And you know you had Carl Hart,

2077
02:00:03.170 --> 02:00:07.000
Dr Karl Horn on here,
a huge follower of him.
Yeah,
he's awesome.
When he did,

2078
02:00:07.001 --> 02:00:08.350
you had it on here.
The brain scans,

2079
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:12.140
everyone's seen the famous brain scan of methamphetamine and not this person's

2080
02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:13.480
on Meth,
this person's not.

2081
02:00:13.481 --> 02:00:16.570
And you see the dark blue part and the light up part of the brain.

2082
02:00:17.150 --> 02:00:19.450
What they don't tell you is that's normal differentiation.

2083
02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:22.570
If all of us took a brain map right now,
it would all be different.

2084
02:00:22.571 --> 02:00:26.260
And the difference between the person on math and not all meth is within normal

2085
02:00:26.261 --> 02:00:30.310
range.
It means fucking nothing really.
It means absolutely nothing.

2086
02:00:30.610 --> 02:00:34.960
Whoa.
So people just sort of acclimate to it.

2087
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:38.010
They see a picture,
you know,
it's Mcdonald's.
I wanted to,
yeah,
that,
yeah,

2088
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:42.610
that's it.
Oh,
hilarious.
And he would say it means absolutely nothing.

2089
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:46.900
It's all normal differentiation.
Wow.
So it varies throughout the day.

2090
02:00:46.901 --> 02:00:50.830
It varies based on what you're doing.
Yeah.
Wow.
I remember,
uh,

2091
02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.820
he says that 85% of the people using methamphetamine have never been to rehab,

2092
02:00:54.821 --> 02:00:58.990
never been on disability and work.
Yeah.
He was very illuminating.

2093
02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:02.500
A lot of things to do was saying about what would it actually feels like to get

2094
02:01:02.501 --> 02:01:04.240
off of a drug.
It's like everybody makes it out.

2095
02:01:04.241 --> 02:01:06.160
Like it's this horrible thing that withdrawal.
He was like,

2096
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:08.130
it's like having the flu.
It seems like.

2097
02:01:08.131 --> 02:01:10.960
It's like you feel shitty for a little while.
Alcohol and Benzos,

2098
02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:14.530
benzodiazepines are truly the only two drugs you can die.
Detoxing from.

2099
02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:18.100
Alcohol is the worst.
It affects every cell,
every organ in your body at once.

2100
02:01:18.101 --> 02:01:21.730
Isn't that we took out Amy Winehouse.
I think that's what took her out.
I think.

2101
02:01:21.731 --> 02:01:25.480
Uh,
she got off of alcohol withdrawal symptoms just whacked around.

2102
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:27.760
Not Crazy fucking alcohol did around.

2103
02:01:29.290 --> 02:01:33.330
So how can you fix this thing?
How can this thing be fixed?
Oh,
she's done.

2104
02:01:33.710 --> 02:01:34.610
She's done nothing.

2105
02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:39.700
The first thing is decriminalization period.
I mean you,

2106
02:01:39.701 --> 02:01:42.740
you don't lock somebody up when they just need help trying to get their life

2107
02:01:42.741 --> 02:01:47.120
together and a drugs are a fucking symptom.
Stop treating the symptom.

2108
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:50.990
I mean we got people all cooped up telling them they got fucking personal

2109
02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.850
defects,
whatever the fuck that means.

2110
02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:57.220
And then sitting them in a circle and go a few of those.
No,
no.

2111
02:01:57.290 --> 02:01:59.480
But your higher power made you perfect.
Oh okay.

2112
02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:04.790
I was trying to get better but not anymore.
We can just,

2113
02:02:04.791 --> 02:02:07.890
we can just start a Kickstarter and tried to get a border around Florida.

2114
02:02:07.891 --> 02:02:09.090
I'd give it to like Puerto Rico or something.

2115
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:14.060
At what point do you get offended when someone has a Kickstarter?

2116
02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:16.730
Do you get offended when someone likes you?

2117
02:02:16.731 --> 02:02:19.100
We want to kickstart like a tour or kickstart,

2118
02:02:19.101 --> 02:02:23.300
like a tee shirt line or like starting like,
hey,
pay my rent.
People like,

2119
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:27.890
that's a lot.
Like I like,
like I saw kickstarted him and Stimpy,

2120
02:02:27.891 --> 02:02:32.570
I forget his name.
Uh,
very popular artists and he wants to do a new cartoon.
I,

2121
02:02:32.571 --> 02:02:33.920
you know,
it's that kind of stuff.

2122
02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:38.060
I'm mad like creating something that isn't he rich enough or ready now.

2123
02:02:38.061 --> 02:02:40.780
I don't know if you've kept up money.
Might have been doing blow.
Yeah.

2124
02:02:40.781 --> 02:02:44.570
I get sick kids.
That's the one I always see.
Yeah,
there's a lot of that one,
hey,

2125
02:02:44.571 --> 02:02:46.640
my kid's sick.
Those go fund me ones.

2126
02:02:46.641 --> 02:02:48.350
The problem with it was like somebody will tweet them,

2127
02:02:48.351 --> 02:02:52.490
would you please retweet this?
You know,
like,
I definitely want to,
if it's real.

2128
02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:55.730
Right.
I definitely don't want to it's face.
Exactly.
So you don't,

2129
02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:59.060
it's hard to tell until you got to do a little fishing around before you or you

2130
02:02:59.061 --> 02:03:00.050
just kind of say,
well,

2131
02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:03.290
and then it's just too much work because I have to research and see if this kid

2132
02:03:03.291 --> 02:03:08.180
even exists.
I think the x Ray,
the kid's liver and yeah,
I need a blood sample.

2133
02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:08.961
If you're in Florida,

2134
02:03:08.961 --> 02:03:12.620
they would give you the right school and urine male that kids love to me,

2135
02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:16.610
Fedex,
that pissed me tomorrow and I'll send you six bucks.

2136
02:03:16.730 --> 02:03:18.500
It's nice that people do that though.

2137
02:03:18.501 --> 02:03:22.220
Like when something legitimately does come up and someone can help somebody.

2138
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:23.180
I think it's cool.

2139
02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:26.090
I think it's one of the cooler things about the internet that we have that and

2140
02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:29.150
that's ultimately what charity really should be,
right?

2141
02:03:29.151 --> 02:03:32.900
It shouldn't be like something that the government provides the people each

2142
02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:34.160
other.
Right.

2143
02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:40.490
I need for the government essentially to,
we have so many hands in the pot.

2144
02:03:40.491 --> 02:03:43.580
I mean,
if we were all on an island and we all got some sort of virus,

2145
02:03:43.581 --> 02:03:47.770
we got to finish the,
the whole,
um,
uh,
antibacteria right?
We gotta,

2146
02:03:47.771 --> 02:03:49.160
we gotta finish the antibiotic,
right?

2147
02:03:49.161 --> 02:03:51.890
To be able to cure it with what we're doing in the United States is going,

2148
02:03:51.891 --> 02:03:55.430
here's 10.
Oh Shit,
here's 10 problems out of these 10 problems.

2149
02:03:55.431 --> 02:03:58.880
All of you get one antibiotic.
There you go.
And then we'll be fine.

2150
02:03:59.390 --> 02:04:02.780
That's what we're doing.
I mean,
you eventually got to pull everything and go,

2151
02:04:02.781 --> 02:04:05.870
all right,
we have to fix this first and then we'll move on.
You know,

2152
02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:10.250
one person or one field or one group of people has to finish the antibiotic to

2153
02:04:10.251 --> 02:04:12.830
help out with the virus before we're just passing out to everybody.

2154
02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:17.420
Did you ever feel while you were working there that you were engaged and like a

2155
02:04:17.421 --> 02:04:20.240
system that will never be fixed?
Fuck yeah.
I mean,

2156
02:04:20.241 --> 02:04:23.990
you must feel like they broke me,
man.
I,
no shit.
It broke me man.
I was,

2157
02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:26.600
I walked in,
uh,
you know,
ready,
like I said,

2158
02:04:26.601 --> 02:04:30.110
ready to help the world and do what I can.
And by the time I had to leave,

2159
02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:35.090
you know,
kind of asked me to leave,
uh,
after about a year or so,
I was just like,

2160
02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:36.680
what the fuck?
You know,

2161
02:04:36.681 --> 02:04:39.180
I started feeling bad for the patients that are caught up in it.

2162
02:04:39.181 --> 02:04:41.760
Cause now you're hooked on it so much.
You believe it.
I mean,

2163
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:44.710
and a lot of people just doing what the white coat tells him.
I mean that's,

2164
02:04:44.730 --> 02:04:47.760
that's how it kind of,
we're taught,
you know,
so you trust your doctor,

2165
02:04:47.761 --> 02:04:49.530
but the days of trust in your doctor these days,

2166
02:04:49.531 --> 02:04:52.410
unless you find really good ones is fucking dead man.
Yeah.
I mean,

2167
02:04:52.411 --> 02:04:56.340
I got parents that call me that are friends of mine and they're talking to me

2168
02:04:56.341 --> 02:04:59.340
about putting,
you know,
they're your kids on these drugs or this drug.

2169
02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:01.740
And he's like a six year old who's just an awesome fucking kid.

2170
02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:05.700
He's just running around like a bad ass,
you know,
doing kid shit.

2171
02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:08.040
Get the little boys in Redland maximum minutes.

2172
02:05:08.041 --> 02:05:12.200
I tried to convince this person nothing's wrong with their own child.
Yeah.
Oh,

2173
02:05:12.210 --> 02:05:15.390
something's wrong.
Oh Kay,
look.
So I'm like,
Oh yeah,
look,

2174
02:05:15.391 --> 02:05:17.610
he's five and he's awesome.
Well,

2175
02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:20.460
when they tell you that a kid can't pay attention school,

2176
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:21.630
so you've got to put them on Adderall.

2177
02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:23.940
I was talking to my friend Justin about this just yesterday.

2178
02:05:24.150 --> 02:05:26.610
Couldn't pay attention in school.
So they're putting them on Adderall.

2179
02:05:26.611 --> 02:05:29.820
I go to school is boring as fuck,
especially for a kid.

2180
02:05:29.821 --> 02:05:33.600
And he's a wild little kick,
wild,
energetic kids that tell you that she,

2181
02:05:33.610 --> 02:05:36.940
they put him on with you.
They put them on methamphetamine.
Methamphetamine.
Yeah.

2182
02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:40.380
Yeah.
I mean that's what it is,
right?
Yeah.
I mean it's like,
what is it a cloak,

2183
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:42.260
close cousin to mess that methamphetamine.

2184
02:05:42.261 --> 02:05:45.600
It was just one additional molecule that that changes the constant of makeup.

2185
02:05:45.601 --> 02:05:46.800
But it's basically the same thing.

2186
02:05:46.801 --> 02:05:49.650
So does it have the same effect on impulse control?

2187
02:05:49.651 --> 02:05:51.240
Cause isn't that like a big thing with meth?

2188
02:05:51.241 --> 02:05:53.460
Like they start doing like really dumb shit.

2189
02:05:53.970 --> 02:05:58.260
Well people that may have ADHD or whatever that is,
um,
they may have it if,

2190
02:05:58.261 --> 02:06:03.180
say they drink caffeine or they do something like,
um,
Adderall or a stimulant,

2191
02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:05.760
it causes focus.
And so you get focused.

2192
02:06:05.790 --> 02:06:08.940
And if somebody that doesn't have attention problems there Sedro drinks your

2193
02:06:08.941 --> 02:06:12.150
coffee,
you get hyped,
you get moving,
you can't stay still.
Right.

2194
02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:16.260
So it does the opposite.
Somebody who was good add,
if they drink caffeine,

2195
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:19.050
they tend to focus more.
That's right.
So that makes,

2196
02:06:19.051 --> 02:06:21.840
and I've heard that people that have add that drink coffee,

2197
02:06:21.841 --> 02:06:25.500
sometimes they'll go to sleepy.
That's right.
Yeah.
To me,
100 Brian,

2198
02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:27.660
I can drink coffee at two in the morning and fall asleep.

2199
02:06:27.690 --> 02:06:28.850
But isn't that also a tolerance?

2200
02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:32.450
You can drink a lot of coughing cause you'd drink a lot of caffeinated
beverages.

2201
02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:35.520
True.
And now that these cold press coffee everyone has,

2202
02:06:35.521 --> 02:06:39.090
these are days cold price,
third,
like 10 times the amount of caffeine.

2203
02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:43.590
Then like regular ice coffee does this 10 times more than the ice coffee from

2204
02:06:43.591 --> 02:06:47.700
Starbucks and ice coffee from Starbucks is 10 times more than like a hot coffee

2205
02:06:47.701 --> 02:06:52.380
from Starbucks or something.
Crazy amount.
So cold brew has more caffeine.
Oh yeah.

2206
02:06:52.381 --> 02:06:53.790
Tom Do you to try one of those,
uh,

2207
02:06:53.791 --> 02:06:57.120
open up that a fridgerator and get one of those caveman nitros.
Hey,

2208
02:06:57.121 --> 02:07:01.440
can't even keep them in stock.
I to give you a little too amped up.

2209
02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:04.620
We'd go to the gym with those I tear muscles.
Yeah,
I started taking it right.

2210
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:07.650
There's some things you may not know about your own Alpha brain and new moon.

2211
02:07:07.651 --> 02:07:10.110
Man.
I wanted to tell you,
but do you want to tell me one?

2212
02:07:10.111 --> 02:07:12.030
It's a fucking love it and it changed my life,

2213
02:07:12.031 --> 02:07:13.050
but I don't want to put it out there.

2214
02:07:13.051 --> 02:07:15.480
And people may think that it really does what I'm going to say it does,

2215
02:07:15.481 --> 02:07:19.380
but it's what it did for me.
Okay.
Uh,
literally,
well that's good to hear.

2216
02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:23.730
Quit smoking cigarettes because of that.
How's that?
I don't fucking know.

2217
02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:25.730
I don't think you could.

2218
02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:28.710
I think you can quit smoking cigarettes cause he didn't want to smoke
cigarettes.

2219
02:07:28.711 --> 02:07:32.940
I mean,
I think to a point,
what Alpha brain does is it helps your memory,
helps a,

2220
02:07:32.941 --> 02:07:36.220
what they call executive function even helps reaction time.
There's all

2221
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:39.640
<v 1>sorts of things that been proven that all the ingredients in that stuff do,</v>

2222
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:43.480
but you and new movie.
But you will,
those are good things.
They're both,
well,

2223
02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:46.240
I had a doctor,
Rhonda Patrick on the podcast yesterday and she was,

2224
02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:49.820
she's amazing.
And she was talking about addiction and she was talking about,
uh,

2225
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:54.550
people with impulse control issues and related that to serotonin deficiencies

2226
02:07:54.551 --> 02:07:56.390
and five HTP and l Tryptofan,

2227
02:07:56.500 --> 02:08:00.400
which is what new moods made out of which converts to Serotonin and your body.

2228
02:08:00.401 --> 02:08:02.440
And how important that is to maximize that,

2229
02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:06.400
to keep you like literally your impulse control and addictions and things like

2230
02:08:06.401 --> 02:08:10.180
that can be affected by those chemicals that are in your brain and you can

2231
02:08:10.181 --> 02:08:14.230
supplement those,
those chemicals and literally changed like the way you behave.

2232
02:08:14.290 --> 02:08:18.190
It's fucking bizarre stuff naturally without naturally without drugs.

2233
02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:20.530
That's right.
Yeah,
and no withdrawal symptoms.

2234
02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:22.950
If you don't take Alpha brain just didn't dig it.
It doesn't do anything to,

2235
02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:25.270
same thing with just regular five HTP.

2236
02:08:25.271 --> 02:08:28.570
Two you can get at any store for just regular five HTP that can get at any

2237
02:08:28.571 --> 02:08:31.990
vitamin store will absolutely enhance your brain's production of Serotonin.

2238
02:08:32.250 --> 02:08:36.040
That so much so that they tell people that are on Ssri is to not take it because

2239
02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.590
we'd taken that stuff.
You could get like Serotonin Syndrome.

2240
02:08:38.591 --> 02:08:39.700
We you have too much serotonin.

2241
02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:43.710
<v 3>Want that?
Please let me have that.</v>

2242
02:08:44.430 --> 02:08:48.630
I ate mushrooms twice in Toronto this last week and Shit Friday and Saturday

2243
02:08:48.631 --> 02:08:52.260
night,
but the second day I don't have mushrooms.
Takes your serotonin and all,

2244
02:08:52.261 --> 02:08:55.440
but Saturday I was so sad.
I was crying at everything.

2245
02:08:55.441 --> 02:08:58.300
I was just in my hotel room crying and I've never heard that before.
It does.

2246
02:08:58.330 --> 02:09:00.180
It sure wasn't the hotel don't do that.

2247
02:09:00.210 --> 02:09:03.290
But all you gotta do is pop to new mood after that and your grave.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2248
02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:07.530
So it's just the,
the,
the,
your levels get depleted from buy mushrooms.

2249
02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:10.140
I didn't never heard of mushrooms because that's what somebody else told me

2250
02:09:10.170 --> 02:09:12.570
cause I add the second night I was just a mess.

2251
02:09:12.630 --> 02:09:14.950
Maybe it's just the two nights in a row.
You just wrecked it.
Yeah.

2252
02:09:14.970 --> 02:09:18.480
Do you still off the cigarettes?
Uh,
I kind of cheated in Toronto,

2253
02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:20.550
so it was hard.

2254
02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:24.270
You're on mushrooms and everyone's smoking and I went to this bar.

2255
02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:27.570
This is how it is now.
I went to,
this bar is awesome.

2256
02:09:27.571 --> 02:09:31.080
It's called the bill Hicks Bar and this guy owns a bar called the bill Hicks

2257
02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:31.081
Bart.

2258
02:09:31.081 --> 02:09:34.620
And it's this really small bar and you walk in and it's the most amazing little

2259
02:09:34.650 --> 02:09:35.401
hole in the wall.

2260
02:09:35.401 --> 02:09:39.480
Bar Drinks are super cheap and he's just a huge hit span and he's like the

2261
02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:44.280
nicest owner ever.
What a great game.
I highly recommend his talk Bill Hicks.

2262
02:09:44.281 --> 02:09:44.720
Where is it?

2263
02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:49.720
It's right down the street from the comedy underground from the Louie Louie

2264
02:09:51.630 --> 02:09:52.920
Anderson.
Nick,
take care.

2265
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:55.230
You got to see him cause when he came through Boston done.
Yeah,

2266
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:58.950
I got to see Hicks when I went to move to New York.
Oh really?
Yeah.

2267
02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:02.760
He actually came up to me and said he'd like one of my bits girls having dirty

2268
02:10:02.761 --> 02:10:06.900
tits assault
dude.
Yeah,

2269
02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:09.720
I remember that Beth and I was like,
oh my God.

2270
02:10:09.721 --> 02:10:12.450
It was like Ted Williams just told me I could hit a baseball and I was like,

2271
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:15.990
yeah.
Even when he was like in his thirties he was just such a strange guy

2272
02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:21.270
<v 1>buddy.
He was like a mystical guy.
Like even before,
you know,
he died really young.</v>

2273
02:10:21.271 --> 02:10:22.290
He was only like 32

2274
02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:23.490
<v 3>you have 33 when he died,</v>

2275
02:10:24.370 --> 02:10:28.930
the bill Hicks bar drinks to walk in and he's watching like flashed on the team

2276
02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:32.970

Ha Ha hanging up.
Did it just start?

2277
02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:34.280

It's been open for awhile.
Um hmm.</v>

2279
02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:39.290
But yeah,

2280
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:42.590
he closed the bar just for us and everyone from the show came over and we just

2281
02:10:42.970 --> 02:10:45.880
drank all night.
God Damn Party in Toronto.

2282
02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:50.000
Like look at you hanging out with Dean del Rey Party and Rockstar style,

2283
02:10:50.170 --> 02:10:51.003
any height.

2284
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:54.740
And He's sitting there eating candy and just say it's bags of candies.

2285
02:10:54.741 --> 02:10:55.640
Like Brian,
check this out.

2286
02:10:55.641 --> 02:10:58.970
And like all these different Twizzlers where I'm showrooming idea he doesn't do

2287
02:10:58.971 --> 02:11:02.150
anything right.
He doesn't do anything.
He's been sober for 20 some years.

2288
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:04.540
Meanwhile he's wrecking his body by eating candy.
Oh I,

2289
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:07.730
that's what I was telling him.
He cause he,
he's like,
I quit caffeine.
I'm like,

2290
02:11:07.731 --> 02:11:07.881
yeah,

2291
02:11:07.881 --> 02:11:12.100
but you just ate seven snickers bars and you have 20 gummy bears in your hands.

2292
02:11:12.750 --> 02:11:17.210
Like horrible health habits.
And so talking about how they quit doing,

2293
02:11:17.211 --> 02:11:21.740
one of them quit caffeine.
He was telling me the other day that it,
oh yeah,

2294
02:11:21.741 --> 02:11:24.410
my memory's better.
Everything's better.
Quit that caffeine man.

2295
02:11:24.411 --> 02:11:26.270
I've done quit caffeine.
Yeah.

2296
02:11:26.670 --> 02:11:30.030
$8,000 worth of barbecue.
You know,

2297
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:33.860
the next day barbecue is not bad for those.

2298
02:11:33.861 --> 02:11:37.760
Bad for you is sugar.
Yeah.
Sugar is fucking bad,
man.

2299
02:11:37.761 --> 02:11:39.530
That was one thing that Rhonda was covering yesterday.

2300
02:11:39.531 --> 02:11:41.600
Like the effect of inflammation,

2301
02:11:41.670 --> 02:11:45.380
sugar when you eat and what it does to your gut health.
Poisoned.

2302
02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:49.180
Especially as we get the Brh nick the following it a little bit older lover

2303
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:53.720
sugar guy though.
No,
no.
I'm less of a shit show.
It's like get all the though.

2304
02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:54.770
I'm going the other way.

2305
02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:57.800
I'm starting to like ice cream and she and I never liked ice cream and cookies,

2306
02:11:57.801 --> 02:12:00.260
but they say that about old p.
That's right.
My,
it's my old man.

2307
02:12:00.261 --> 02:12:05.150
That's all each night
it's cause you got to taste it.
I know that's right.

2308
02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:09.600
That's right to self when I'm older.
So just the leave the sugar alone.
Yeah.

2309
02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:11.870
It's just if you can't help it,
it's all you can taste.

2310
02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:14.210
One of the big bit about it.

2311
02:12:14.211 --> 02:12:19.211
That's what I eat girls' butts now because I can taste what do they shit and

2312
02:12:19.521 --> 02:12:23.130
cotton candy anymore many years of seasoning.

2313
02:12:24.070 --> 02:12:28.240
That's what I'm eating.
And when I think of sugar treats,
that's a,

2314
02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:33.050
that's how Brian thinks he's got a very linear path.
He doesn't question it.

2315
02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:38.480
Not as good as proteins upfront.
What does that shirt you wearing?

2316
02:12:38.730 --> 02:12:43.560
A David show.
Oh,
it's one of his art pieces.
Oh Wow.

2317
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:46.610
David Cho wore my special shirt today to

2318
02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:53.140
[inaudible] with a gun.
That's a chapel.

2319
02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:56.870
That was his middle school picture.
Yeah,
that's right.
No,
it's a,

2320
02:12:56.871 --> 02:12:59.280
I stole it from a friend a d,
but um,

2321
02:12:59.510 --> 02:13:02.450
it's a shirt trying to get awareness that if you know the drug problem,

2322
02:13:02.451 --> 02:13:03.860
what they're doing,
the cartels are over there.

2323
02:13:03.861 --> 02:13:06.880
This is how the kids are coming up and it's just kind of doing awareness.
Do we?

2324
02:13:06.881 --> 02:13:09.920
Oh,
good.
Oh,
I don't know how they did it,
but they made it happen.

2325
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:14.810
He's got a big hand.
It's got a little chick fucking hog on them.

2326
02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:16.110
Yeah.
I see.

2327
02:13:16.230 --> 02:13:19.580
I got approached by three Mexicans in the parking lot when I was assured that I

2328
02:13:19.581 --> 02:13:22.180
thought they were going to,
and they liked it.
No,
no,
they,
they're mad at you.

2329
02:13:23.410 --> 02:13:27.800
Right.
Who said that?
Mexican explained it and they were like,
oh,

2330
02:13:27.801 --> 02:13:29.990
that's good it,
nevermind.
That's good.
Let's go to it.
You know?

2331
02:13:29.991 --> 02:13:32.130
But it's offensive at the first look.
Like most people

2332
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:36.930
<v 3>they look at and go,
Oh shit,
I'm offended right away.
Naturally for that.</v>

2333
02:13:36.931 --> 02:13:41.060
Would you please?
Yeah,
they do.
The drug thing is called Shane.

2334
02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:44.850
Make them less shame.
Shame.

2335
02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:49.620
Little game of Thrones action.
Do you watch game of Thrones?
Nicole?
How dare you.

2336
02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:52.740
Oh,
Tashi is Gerald's hilarious.
I brought it up to her.
She goes,

2337
02:13:52.741 --> 02:13:55.090
I don't like those shows that are just make them ups.
I can

2338
02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:00.210
suspend my disbelief.

2339
02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:04.050
I can't even watch real movies where a fucking I'm watching you Angelina Jolie

2340
02:14:04.051 --> 02:14:07.710
beat up six fucking mail may be seals.
I'm sorry I can't get this.
Listen,

2341
02:14:07.711 --> 02:14:11.610
if you know good moves and you know the heels are strong,
they could take your,

2342
02:14:11.611 --> 02:14:15.400
uh,
that's the best stilettos stilettos.

2343
02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:18.660
Ronda Rousey probably kick a lot of dude's ass going to say that to you.

2344
02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:19.530
I'm watching.

2345
02:14:19.530 --> 02:14:22.140
This is where political correct is always has to go one step too far.

2346
02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:26.610
I'm watching Bryant Gumbel and his stupid fucking real sports and he has to,

2347
02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:29.980
they have to make the comp.
The guy goes,
Ronda Rousey,
uh,

2348
02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:32.700
is the pound for pound,

2349
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:37.620
both male or female best mixed martial arts fighter on the,
well,
Gee,

2350
02:14:37.621 --> 02:14:39.780
let's find that out.
Is it an easy way to find that out?

2351
02:14:39.810 --> 02:14:42.330
There's no way to find that out.
The reality about that,

2352
02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:44.010
it's totally subjective in his opinion.

2353
02:14:44.011 --> 02:14:46.290
She can be the best pound for pound fighter in the world,

2354
02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:49.650
but you can never prove that.
That's all just completely speculation,
but,
well,

2355
02:14:49.651 --> 02:14:54.040
you put her against no guy.
No,
no,
no.
It wasn't her experience and her weight.

2356
02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:57.870
Mayweather and then you find out.
Yeah,

2357
02:14:58.310 --> 02:15:01.320
just like they did in the seventies remember wide world of Sports Guy,

2358
02:15:01.470 --> 02:15:04.440
I think you got do pound for pound.
You've got to separate the genders.

2359
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:08.730
This is why,
but they didn't in the premise gel.
It's my point.
See the premise.

2360
02:15:08.731 --> 02:15:11.820
It's a fake premise and that's what I'm saying,
but it's a politically correct.

2361
02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:15.060
You're right,
you're right.
It's a fake.
Nobody calls people on this bullshit.

2362
02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:19.530
I'm fucking sitting there yelling at the TV.
Well,
okay.
And both male,
female.

2363
02:15:19.531 --> 02:15:20.460
She's the best.
Well,

2364
02:15:20.461 --> 02:15:24.120
let's talk and find out who was calling somebody on some bull shit last night on

2365
02:15:24.121 --> 02:15:27.360
stage.
Man.
You were killing it last night and calling that shit out.

2366
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:29.970
I'm not giving away any bits or anything.
Thank you very much.

2367
02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:32.670
You're ripping somebody up Joe.
No,
it's just fun.
It was awesome.

2368
02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:37.200
Some people do it is all I'm saying.
Some people call out bullshit and yeah,
just,

2369
02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:40.430
Oh,
Joe goes,
um,
that's,
I did not know that.

2370
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:44.730
This is fucking weird man.
What a weird,
weird time we're in right now.

2371
02:15:45.290 --> 02:15:46.070
You know,

2372
02:15:46.070 --> 02:15:50.310
this just seems like there's more wackiness going on right now in the world and

2373
02:15:50.311 --> 02:15:55.110
anytime that I could ever remember does seem like more,
more hypocrisy,

2374
02:15:55.111 --> 02:15:58.320
more contradiction,
more chaos.
Oh fuck.
Oh yeah.

2375
02:15:58.740 --> 02:16:01.590
We've got to get through this shit right before it gets better.
I'm guessing.

2376
02:16:01.650 --> 02:16:06.000
I don't know.
Does it get worse before it gets better when the language starts,

2377
02:16:06.001 --> 02:16:08.130
when words don't mean anything by that,
that's when the,

2378
02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:11.700
that's a sign of the times when languages me anymore.
Like,
what do you mean?
Well,

2379
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:15.270
political correctness.
Oh Shit.
It just doesn't mean anything anymore.

2380
02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:19.800
I see people,
I saw people yesterday on the news out here somewhere protesting.

2381
02:16:20.190 --> 02:16:23.970
They were upset because their restrictions at too much on sex offenders.

2382
02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:30.130
Oh my God,
that's fucking finished.
Yeah,
real someone was before I made

2383
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:33.730
<v 6>a movie making fun of a fucking,
I couldn't believe what I was watching.</v>

2384
02:16:33.731 --> 02:16:38.731
It's like a parody of the sex offender one is a fucked up one because there's

2385
02:16:39.161 --> 02:16:44.050
evidence that shows that when you molest a child that child is more likely your

2386
02:16:44.051 --> 02:16:47.560
you could damage them so fucked up.
They're more likely to molest somebody else.

2387
02:16:47.890 --> 02:16:51.280
Like you can literally infect them with this sickness that you have.

2388
02:16:51.310 --> 02:16:53.650
Most people that are molesters have been molested hubs.

2389
02:16:53.651 --> 02:16:58.180
How fucking crazy as that.
I mean it's just the gift that keeps on giving.

2390
02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:02.290
Just the horrible,
horrible,
horrible disease.
I mean that's like a disease.

2391
02:17:02.410 --> 02:17:06.640
It's like a disease of the psyche,
like a herpes of the psyche.

2392
02:17:06.641 --> 02:17:11.150
Like more worse,
like an aids of the psyche,
you know,
dairy.

2393
02:17:12.810 --> 02:17:17.020
Can you imagine running that study?
Well,
it certainly,

2394
02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:21.250
it certainly is a choice to decide whether or not to do exactly the same thing

2395
02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:25.780
that happened to you.
But the desire to do it is what's fucked up.
Like the idea,

2396
02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:28.120
like to everyone in this room,
I just assume I like you guys.

2397
02:17:28.121 --> 02:17:31.090
I assume none of you wanna fuck kids,
right?
No,
but I've seen,

2398
02:17:31.091 --> 02:17:32.770
I've seen a girl at the rage and I'm like,

2399
02:17:32.771 --> 02:17:36.130
Holy Shit that these events and make made the decision not to fucking try to

2400
02:17:36.131 --> 02:17:39.010
move on.
But that's different.
That's what ain't 17 and 18.

2401
02:17:39.011 --> 02:17:41.660
And one of the reasons why it's different with an eyepatch

2402
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:46.600
dairy.
Do you think,

2403
02:17:46.601 --> 02:17:50.590
do you think there's less molesters now because since porn has become so,
uh,

2404
02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:53.660
available and more available to people that you think there's more,

2405
02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:56.320
less molesters?
That's a good argument.
You know,
there's arguments for that.

2406
02:17:56.430 --> 02:18:00.340
The one of the arguments is that if you give people a release like video games

2407
02:18:00.341 --> 02:18:03.940
or like watching even like really offensive or violent porn,

2408
02:18:04.210 --> 02:18:06.490
that you release that tension inside of them.

2409
02:18:06.490 --> 02:18:10.300
And the other argument is that it stimulates their fantasy and we want to go out

2410
02:18:10.301 --> 02:18:13.380
and make it reality.
I don't know which one's right.
I don't need,

2411
02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:15.610
I think the problem is it's both.

2412
02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:18.430
I think with some people it's going to stimulate their fantasies and they're

2413
02:18:18.431 --> 02:18:19.750
gonna want to go out and actually do that.

2414
02:18:19.751 --> 02:18:22.720
And with other people it's going to satiate their evil tendencies.

2415
02:18:23.310 --> 02:18:26.590
Some people that were molested,
they think that's what you're supposed to do.

2416
02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.880
Like,
do you know somebody,
you know,
like shit,
I was beat as a kid,
you know,

2417
02:18:30.881 --> 02:18:34.420
coming up a few,
it was violent enough and so early in my,

2418
02:18:34.421 --> 02:18:38.380
in my life I thought that that's what you do.
Somebody says,
no,
doesn't do shit.

2419
02:18:38.381 --> 02:18:40.730
You,
you heard him or you heard something,
you know,

2420
02:18:41.170 --> 02:18:44.650
and so you just kind of register that this is what happens and this is what you

2421
02:18:44.651 --> 02:18:49.120
do.
And so a lot of people,
they were,
you know,
I had a,
I don't know,

2422
02:18:49.121 --> 02:18:51.730
I want to tell us our client's stories.
That all right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
sure.

2423
02:18:51.731 --> 02:18:53.230
Just don't say any names.
Yeah.
She,

2424
02:18:53.350 --> 02:18:58.240
she was molested for eight years by her brother and underneath out in the barn

2425
02:18:58.241 --> 02:18:59.830
where the dad used to work on the car.

2426
02:18:59.831 --> 02:19:02.260
They had dug a hole and they would work underneath the car.

2427
02:19:02.261 --> 02:19:04.420
So the brother would take her in the middle of the night and do that.

2428
02:19:04.421 --> 02:19:09.060
Then dad finds out eight years and then he joins in for the next 10 she is,

2429
02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:13.750
yeah,
and counsel.
That shit.
Why Council?
Yeah.
Look at them and say,

2430
02:19:13.751 --> 02:19:17.720
it's not your fault.
You have a disease now.
You're fine.
Go home.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2431
02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:20.620
Get to that can't and you can never get a regular life back.

2432
02:19:20.621 --> 02:19:24.460
It's like that girl's life is so scarred with those images and memories.

2433
02:19:24.461 --> 02:19:27.230
I'm sure.
Yeah,
but that's what she has do.

2434
02:19:27.231 --> 02:19:31.940
So she goes and would begin to put herself in situations to be raped.
Oh God.

2435
02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:34.040
Because that's the comfort zone.
That's what they're,

2436
02:19:34.041 --> 02:19:35.310
that's where they're supposed to be there.

2437
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:36.500
<v 1>Oh my God.</v>

2438
02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:41.980
Now someone could possibly protest against stiff sentences to that.

2439
02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:47.750
That's insane.
That's insane that people were protesting,
that they're,

2440
02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:49.520
they're developing communities now.

2441
02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:54.310
<v 6>They're starting to move in one section of cities and gathering total cities</v>

2442
02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:56.660
like that through like websites or something like that.

2443
02:19:56.740 --> 02:19:59.640
Change moving to certain areas,
man.
And guess what?
It's in Florida.

2444
02:20:02.430 --> 02:20:07.260
Florida was weird when I was like 18 man first came out.
I go to,

2445
02:20:07.261 --> 02:20:09.150
is there any episodes?
Not from fucking floor.

2446
02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:15.220
It was asking that years ago and now like comics is a ton of comics who do that

2447
02:20:15.221 --> 02:20:15.851
premise now,

2448
02:20:15.851 --> 02:20:19.300
but I was like every episode's from what the Fuck's going on in Ocala?

2449
02:20:19.450 --> 02:20:23.130
I just left.
I've been living on Marco Island and Naples down or mark eyeline is,

2450
02:20:23.131 --> 02:20:24.160
yeah,
I left there.

2451
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:28.090
You could probably change the southwest Florida tag line to come be as racist as

2452
02:20:28.091 --> 02:20:31.000
you want to be.
You know what I mean?
You could.
It's crazy.

2453
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:35.290
I mean in gated communities there are hanging the old word open the front.

2454
02:20:35.291 --> 02:20:36.250
I mean they're doing shit

2455
02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:39.380
<v 1>word out in Florida that I'd never heard before.</v>

2456
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:44.750
He cheese the how's that you ever heard of Geechees last damn g cheese is a

2457
02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:51.630
derogatory term for African Americans.
That's the first for me.
Hmm.

2458
02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:55.370
No.
And I'm from Oak Coy.
So dude,

2459
02:20:55.530 --> 02:20:58.880
a dude lived in West Palm told me that they were all they were.

2460
02:20:58.881 --> 02:21:01.490
They were saying that when they grew up,
they were all,

2461
02:21:01.491 --> 02:21:06.440
I'm using the word Geechee like to describe a black people.
What does that mean?

2462
02:21:06.441 --> 02:21:08.010
What's a derivative?
I don't know.
It's,
it's,

2463
02:21:08.011 --> 02:21:12.470
it's like their version of the n word.
Wow.
That's a first for me.
Really?

2464
02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:17.120
They just use the n word Demec Hall at me.
Tom Sugrue and knows the story.

2465
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:20.740
Matter of fact,
I think Tom's a girl was the one.
Yep.

2466
02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.220
Thompson girl was the one who told me about it.

2467
02:21:22.730 --> 02:21:26.870
I think Thompson Gara grew up in Florida.
I got,
I got to yell back on the,

2468
02:21:26.930 --> 02:21:30.790
Hey Kane on sunset the other night,
yelling like a black guy.
Oh,

2469
02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:35.170
<v 6>did you go back to him?
Well,
it wasn't to him.
I just yelled at and I got it back,</v>

2470
02:21:35.171 --> 02:21:39.280
man.
Oh,
that's hilarious.
I Hate Jay back.
Whoever Jay is.
Hey Jay.

2471
02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:44.150
<v 1>What?
Tom Segura goes this thing explaining the thing that Tom Score does.</v>

2472
02:21:44.250 --> 02:21:47.900
Yells it out.
You gotta yell like a Black Guy.
It Shit.
I could try to do.

2473
02:21:47.901 --> 02:21:51.540
It was like,
oh,
hold on.
Oh,
okay.
Then I need to do it bikes.

2474
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:55.990
He has this thing where like if you go around a bunch of black people that yell

2475
02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:59.680
like a black guy,
like yell something out,
someone will like yell back to layer.

2476
02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:03.100
This.
I heard you took,
did you take the title?
No,

2477
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:06.610
I took the tile on Tom or black.
I'm,

2478
02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:09.710
I'm the new champion of Tom or black.
I don't know if you know what that is,

2479
02:22:09.711 --> 02:22:12.860
but Tom Seger on his podcast got fucking hilarious podcast with his wife.

2480
02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:17.570
His wife is a really funny comic.
And uh,
your mom's house,
there's their podcast.

2481
02:22:17.571 --> 02:22:21.560
They do this thing where it's Tom or black were Tom pretends to be black guys is

2482
02:22:21.570 --> 02:22:24.410
audio recordings.
It's either Tom or a black guy and you have to get,

2483
02:22:24.411 --> 02:22:26.180
he can really nail that.
It's pretty fun.

2484
02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:30.270
But I'm the chief a fucking caught them out.
Oh,
I seven out of 10.
I was correct.

2485
02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:33.720
Seven out of 10 that,
yeah.
Yeah.
I've got a good ear.

2486
02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:39.120
I've got a good ear for bullshit.
I don't know.
But he's pretty,
God damn good.

2487
02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:41.610
He's pretty good at it.
There was a couple that really tricked me,

2488
02:22:41.611 --> 02:22:42.960
but they're really hard.
It's not,

2489
02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:46.770
it's not the same audio quality like some of them recorded outside.

2490
02:22:46.771 --> 02:22:48.340
Some of them sound like an old movie,

2491
02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:51.050
you know him and I know him very well so it's kind of,

2492
02:22:51.051 --> 02:22:53.240
she was just yelling like it.
Now it's even,

2493
02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:57.860
it's even the yell something back at you.
Cause there was it,

2494
02:22:57.990 --> 02:23:01.090
there was a time when I could slang that like,

2495
02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:06.110
well you have that Florida accent,
which is a nice goal in summer.

2496
02:23:06.310 --> 02:23:09.670
You've got a little bit of urban and you're,
you're twain.
I did that.

2497
02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:12.040
I got an Alexa in my life.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2498
02:23:12.330 --> 02:23:15.240
Did you grow up around a lot of black people?
I did.
Did you?
There you go.

2499
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:19.650
Both red,
red,
no fan.
No.
No.

2500
02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:22.050
You're either redneck or ghetto.
That was it.

2501
02:23:22.110 --> 02:23:23.760
Where I'm from that you only get two options.

2502
02:23:23.761 --> 02:23:27.630
So it was it man liberal or it could be me in the middle and some days be called

2503
02:23:27.631 --> 02:23:31.270
wicker and then some days be called preppy.
Depends on what day it wasn't.

2504
02:23:31.290 --> 02:23:35.880
Who you were hanging out with.
Okay.
Florida is just so strange.
Strange,

2505
02:23:35.881 --> 02:23:38.850
strange fucking place.
It is man.
I went through immigration in Florida,

2506
02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:43.860
Atlanta from Costa Rica to Florida and the person at the counter in Costa Rica

2507
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:48.330
when they were writing the,
you know the,
what is the the doc,

2508
02:23:48.390 --> 02:23:51.240
whatever's it is when they have to take account of everybody who's in the

2509
02:23:51.570 --> 02:23:56.430
airplane,
was that called?
Oh a
question.
You,

2510
02:23:56.590 --> 02:24:01.200
they have a form everyone on the airplane.
The docket is that it is,
yeah.

2511
02:24:01.410 --> 02:24:04.320
Airline docket.
I think so.
I think that's it.
Anyway,
she,
everyone's name,

2512
02:24:04.650 --> 02:24:07.590
Brian Red Ban.
We will need to live in and they spelled my name wrong.

2513
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:09.480
So because my spelled my name wrong,

2514
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:14.040
my name did not match up with the name on my passport so I had to go through

2515
02:24:14.041 --> 02:24:18.720
this fucking giant line.
You go into this room and you can't believe it's real.

2516
02:24:18.810 --> 02:24:21.660
You can't believe it's real.
I mean it's fucking insane.

2517
02:24:21.661 --> 02:24:25.200
There are thousands of people and if they're all going through,

2518
02:24:25.201 --> 02:24:28.440
because there was some sort of an error and then once you get through that you

2519
02:24:28.441 --> 02:24:30.810
go into another room because they know that your baggage,

2520
02:24:30.811 --> 02:24:32.730
if you flew from somewhere else,
you have a connecting flight.

2521
02:24:32.731 --> 02:24:37.380
They know your baggage is never going to fucking make it.
You pick up your bag,

2522
02:24:37.410 --> 02:24:40.260
it's,
you have to go through the immigration,
then you pick up your baggage,

2523
02:24:40.261 --> 02:24:43.650
then you have to get on another plane.
But everyone misses their plane.

2524
02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:46.990
I mean everyone misses their connection because the wait time,

2525
02:24:47.610 --> 02:24:50.550
hours and hours and hours we gave ourselves two and a half hours,

2526
02:24:50.610 --> 02:24:54.300
we were fucked by over an hour,
over an hour.
We were fucked.
It was insane.

2527
02:24:54.330 --> 02:24:55.230
And they won't take your,

2528
02:24:55.260 --> 02:24:59.250
your baggage within 45 minutes of the scheduled departure time.

2529
02:24:59.430 --> 02:25:01.950
Forget about the actual departure time cause most of the flights are delayed.

2530
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:03.540
But the scheduled departure time,

2531
02:25:03.541 --> 02:25:08.100
they lock it down and if at 45 minutes till it gets delayed post that it doesn't

2532
02:25:08.101 --> 02:25:08.311
matter.

2533
02:25:08.311 --> 02:25:13.311
They don't open up the luggage folk you so you are stuck in this insane maze of

2534
02:25:15.181 --> 02:25:18.480
ropes and people are going crazy in any day of people who have to leave to take

2535
02:25:18.481 --> 02:25:22.590
a leak there holding it if they can.
I had my kids with me five and so on day.

2536
02:25:22.630 --> 02:25:24.190
They dealt with this for three

2537
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:29.020
<v 0>hours.
It's crazy and it's fun after awhile,
but everywhere you look,
Ebola signs,</v>

2538
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:33.670
the signs me bullet San Diego and it's hot and you're in Miami and he was

2539
02:25:33.671 --> 02:25:37.150
breathing and touching.
How's ins of people and I'm trying to tell my daughter,

2540
02:25:37.151 --> 02:25:39.370
don't put your mouth on the railing.
Don't put your mouth on this.

2541
02:25:39.810 --> 02:25:42.900
She's a fighter.
She's bored out of her fucking head.

2542
02:25:42.930 --> 02:25:45.130
They touch their face and you were trying to play games.

2543
02:25:45.131 --> 02:25:46.180
We're trying to joke around.

2544
02:25:46.181 --> 02:25:48.160
We're trying to have some fun trying to laugh about stuff,

2545
02:25:48.161 --> 02:25:50.530
but after a while it's five years old,

2546
02:25:50.531 --> 02:25:53.800
three hours and it's fucking stupid line only to get up to find out that

2547
02:25:53.801 --> 02:25:58.450
somebody just wrote my name down wrong.
That's what caused all that.

2548
02:25:58.850 --> 02:26:03.460
Yes.
It was so ridiculous.
It's so crazy.
It was like her Trent,
the card lea.

2549
02:26:03.850 --> 02:26:06.620
So trying to,
yeah,
there was no white people working there.
This one,

2550
02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:10.250
no managers like Apollo.
There was Cuban found that wasn't my,

2551
02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:14.930
there's Cuban people working there that literally didn't speak English like I'd

2552
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:19.150
go now,
once I go to this machine,
where do I go for us?
Cup.

2553
02:26:19.180 --> 02:26:22.170
You'll ask costs on your board for the kiosk as it was a Casco or,
I was like,

2554
02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:22.310
yeah,

2555
02:26:22.310 --> 02:26:27.310
one time this guy literally didn't speak English in America working at the

2556
02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:32.230
airport.
That's I to be a racist.
That's what I'm saying.
Different thing.

2557
02:26:32.930 --> 02:26:35.800
Not talking about Hertz rental car.
I know it's even worse.

2558
02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:37.840
Do they don't speak English and Hertz rental car.

2559
02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:41.800
I just couldn't tell what this guy was saying.
I'm serious.
He was mumbling.

2560
02:26:41.801 --> 02:26:43.540
He had an accent.
I had never fucking heard of him.

2561
02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:47.320
He wouldn't look me in the fucking eye.
That doesn't make you racist.

2562
02:26:48.250 --> 02:26:51.580
Fucking yeah,
I'm the white pray you got to go to Hollywood.

2563
02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:57.340
Fuck you.
You fucking loss all touch.
How it's supposed to be.

2564
02:26:57.370 --> 02:27:02.130
Not hard to troll Nick Depaulo.
It's very,
very easy to troll the Nigga Polo

2565
02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:08.800
nine cups that it fucking joke off.
That helps to get you a little on the edge.

2566
02:27:08.801 --> 02:27:12.160
I'm getting shown fuck with that caveman coffee.
Nitro fuel.

2567
02:27:12.310 --> 02:27:15.620
I'm half a red bull.
You've never had a red bull.

2568
02:27:16.210 --> 02:27:19.600
If you want some real coffee.
I get nuts on three cups of coffee.

2569
02:27:19.601 --> 02:27:22.180
I can't imagine now that just looks like you are not going to drink that.

2570
02:27:22.181 --> 02:27:25.660
After he talked about licking buttholes,
he's not going to taste like sugar.

2571
02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:29.440
You're going to get anybody to drink cleanest part of a woman.

2572
02:27:32.610 --> 02:27:37.240
Yeah.
She's bulimic.
Anorexic

2573
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:42.040
fingers to enter into their tumbler account.

2574
02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:45.860
People are very upset at you.
Right?
And that's being some breweries,

2575
02:27:45.870 --> 02:27:49.900
skinny chicks.
That's what Eddie Bravo.

2576
02:27:49.901 --> 02:27:52.910
He used to say the girls were on meth.
You know,
like it's,

2577
02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:55.960
it's better to have anal sex with girls that are on math because they don't eat.

2578
02:27:56.110 --> 02:28:00.850
So they never poop
that.

2579
02:28:00.851 --> 02:28:05.570
You know that.
It's good to say that about a constipate a girl.

2580
02:28:06.290 --> 02:28:09.880
Now when you're doing these,
uh,
counseling programs,

2581
02:28:09.881 --> 02:28:13.830
did they ever have people come in for weed?
Yes.
Actually.
What do you do?

2582
02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:18.820
Get them on heroin.
Yeah.
What do you,

2583
02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:22.310
what are you trying to do?
Said we need on the job,

2584
02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:24.770
<v 6>they've been tested.
Okay.
So they have to come and go through it.</v>

2585
02:28:24.771 --> 02:28:27.890
So I don't pay a lot attention to them anyway.
So what do you do when you,

2586
02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:31.010
when you say if a guy comes in and they say he's got a court,
same group,

2587
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:32.600
it's all group therapy,

2588
02:28:32.601 --> 02:28:35.990
which is the shitty part because a group therapy modality to treat drug

2589
02:28:35.991 --> 02:28:37.550
addiction is awful,
but it's cheap.

2590
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:42.850
I was wanting a job where I could say modality.
No,
actually sound like if I say,

2591
02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:46.430
you know,
I'm an asshole.
No reason ever say modality.

2592
02:28:47.980 --> 02:28:52.100
Clever word.
It's like the group tool or though no was perfect word.

2593
02:28:52.101 --> 02:28:55.250
It's just they make it fun to my own vocabulary.
But it's a bad one man.
I mean,

2594
02:28:55.700 --> 02:28:59.030
I mean Aa and in a,
I'm not going to front,
it has helped millions and I mean,

2595
02:28:59.031 --> 02:29:01.220
I'm a fan of whatever works for you.
I mean,
if some,

2596
02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:03.860
if someone saw us work for you,
fucking do that.
If it helps you,
you know?

2597
02:29:03.861 --> 02:29:06.380
So I couldn't bash anything that that helps people.

2598
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:09.890
But I will point out some flaws in systems.

2599
02:29:09.891 --> 02:29:14.390
I mean the cult like existence of it and then you tell them to change people,

2600
02:29:14.391 --> 02:29:15.260
places and things.

2601
02:29:15.261 --> 02:29:18.110
But I need you every day to meet with the same people at the same place.

2602
02:29:18.111 --> 02:29:20.210
It's talking about the same things.
Yeah,

2603
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:23.060
that does not do you change your life if every night I got to show up and go,

2604
02:29:23.061 --> 02:29:26.840
well I'm really missing that fucking needle.
I really,

2605
02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:30.440
and you'll see in the paint these stories and then people are around them like

2606
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:34.310
yeah,
we can see,
oh man,

2607
02:29:34.530 --> 02:29:38.380
you know when you wrap it and that whole ritual of going and I have the stock,

2608
02:29:38.510 --> 02:29:42.770
I have to be like,
dude,
stop two people leave the room.
Well you're right.

2609
02:29:42.830 --> 02:29:44.660
They don't do that.
Jenny Craig.
They don't get up and go,

2610
02:29:44.661 --> 02:29:47.180
I had this cheeseburger the other night when the fucking tremendous

2611
02:29:49.650 --> 02:29:54.380
blue cheese I choose.
I like blue cheese,
blue cheese,

2612
02:29:54.381 --> 02:29:59.080
exotic come.
My goodness.
Not an ego stroke in it.
That shit man.
So I'm good point.

2613
02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:03.530
They go there and they talk with romantic terms about how much they used to

2614
02:30:03.531 --> 02:30:06.200
shoot heroin and then you give him as a boxer.
Then at the end they go,

2615
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:11.420
but I'm three days clean and put the ticking the box.

2616
02:30:11.421 --> 02:30:13.330
That's right.
So you're not clean.

2617
02:30:13.970 --> 02:30:17.990
So it's a boxing like the same effect as heroin.
It's all the same.

2618
02:30:18.380 --> 02:30:22.250
All the same when it enters into the body.
Wow.
A lot of people,

2619
02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:24.350
they get that white chair right here.
The one shot.

2620
02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:27.170
I know a few people who took that shit wrestling.

2621
02:30:27.171 --> 02:30:28.580
I know that I was wanting to know this.

2622
02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:31.280
What is the difference between heroin and Methadone?

2623
02:30:31.460 --> 02:30:34.340
I know Methadone is really bad for you,
but we used to,

2624
02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:36.080
when I used to play pool in New York,

2625
02:30:36.081 --> 02:30:39.020
I used to play it an executive billiards in white plains that was down the

2626
02:30:39.021 --> 02:30:42.470
street from this Methadone clinic and so that we would call him the Methadone

2627
02:30:42.470 --> 02:30:42.471
Ian's,

2628
02:30:42.471 --> 02:30:45.620
they would come in and play pool and they were all like fucking completely zoned

2629
02:30:45.621 --> 02:30:49.220
out.
Slack charges,
play putting,
they were terrible.
There was no one,

2630
02:30:49.250 --> 02:30:53.420
no one ever really learned how to play.
But they would be there all the time.

2631
02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:56.450
They would come in there almost every day,
but they would never get good at pool.

2632
02:30:56.550 --> 02:30:59.600
They would just come in and zone out and bang balls around.
It's,

2633
02:30:59.630 --> 02:31:03.210
it's the longest treatment for heroin that's been around Methadone.
Um,

2634
02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:05.780
if I couldn't get into the molecules in the breakdown of it,

2635
02:31:05.781 --> 02:31:09.320
that's not my specialty.
But from the behavior of it,
of how people use it,

2636
02:31:09.321 --> 02:31:13.100
it's still daily.
I mean in a Methadone clinic will only give you up to so much.

2637
02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:16.460
So you go every day,
get your dose and go on about your fucking day.

2638
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:20.910
Then you go back,
get your dose,
go on about fucking Nice.
Is that a substitute?

2639
02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:24.630
It's not physically good for him cause they control how much they give you.

2640
02:31:24.631 --> 02:31:29.070
So that's the only difference rail that controlling the amount and it's an

2641
02:31:29.071 --> 02:31:31.250
actual tactic.
Synthetics.

2642
02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:35.610
It's crazy because it's actually worse for you.
Is that right?
Heroin.

2643
02:31:35.611 --> 02:31:39.070
Is Heroin Natural?
Well not really

2644
02:31:42.020 --> 02:31:46.530
excluding it's poppy.
No Gmo,
poppy,
organic era.

2645
02:31:47.130 --> 02:31:49.500
I always wondered why the fuck they can't grow in the United States.

2646
02:31:49.501 --> 02:31:51.120
I'm like with all the greenhouses that we have,

2647
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:53.730
how come they can't grow coke here?
Why didn't have to get it from Mexico?

2648
02:31:53.740 --> 02:31:56.760
I don't know.
I've been trying for years.
Nothing but weeds and tomatoes.

2649
02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:03.840
You can think about why invents a box and to begin with,
we all 80% right?
Well,

2650
02:32:03.841 --> 02:32:08.610
80% of the black tar heroin from Afghanistan.
Well,
if you want to fight an enemy,

2651
02:32:08.611 --> 02:32:11.430
where do you hurt him?
In the fucking pockets.
It's where you hit them,
right?

2652
02:32:11.550 --> 02:32:13.670
So when you poppy fields back in,
I dunno,

2653
02:32:13.710 --> 02:32:17.460
seventies eighties heroin was pretty expensive to a point and it would have its,

2654
02:32:17.490 --> 02:32:20.850
it would fluctuate and then suboxone is hitting all of a sudden heroin.

2655
02:32:20.851 --> 02:32:24.120
You can get a $10 bag of black tar heroin.
Easy.

2656
02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:28.080
And a lot of people go to the heroin because prescriptions are too expensive,

2657
02:32:28.081 --> 02:32:29.510
right?
That's what they substitutes.

2658
02:32:29.511 --> 02:32:32.840
So if they run out and their copay hasn't come up yet or there days having

2659
02:32:32.850 --> 02:32:34.710
flipped yet or they've sold all the pills,

2660
02:32:35.130 --> 02:32:37.380
then they just stopped by and they see the same guy.

2661
02:32:37.381 --> 02:32:39.300
It's the same dude on the corner.
Most of the time he's like,

2662
02:32:39.301 --> 02:32:44.030
what did the suboxone or the heroin and it's switch and they did a uh,

2663
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:45.840
what's the box and you just have to take as a pill,

2664
02:32:45.841 --> 02:32:50.070
whereas heroin you have to prepare it or smoke it or do something with it.

2665
02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:51.300
You like to cook late at night

2666
02:32:55.080 --> 02:33:00.080
grilling black tar blacked out in front of my steak facing the mashed potatoes.

2667
02:33:01.711 --> 02:33:04.980
You see that though?
It'd be facilities man.
That's why my friend George,

2668
02:33:04.981 --> 02:33:07.800
he died and uh,
that's one of the things that happened before he died.

2669
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:11.160
He was out playing pool with some friends of mine and he fucking pass out as

2670
02:33:11.161 --> 02:33:12.630
mashed potatoes.
He really did.

2671
02:33:12.631 --> 02:33:17.490
He fell asleep right into his food and he was,
he was a straight laced guy,

2672
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:21.060
straight edge guy.
I didn't smoke cigarettes,
who's a championship pool player.

2673
02:33:21.330 --> 02:33:24.360
And then as he got older he hurt his back somehow.

2674
02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:28.800
That's how I got him on some fucking pills and he was gone.
It was gone.

2675
02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:31.680
I'd say half of the people in the group start out that way.

2676
02:33:31.681 --> 02:33:35.460
So they make us manage a group of like 15 to 22 if it's Medicare and that's the

2677
02:33:35.461 --> 02:33:37.650
group therapy I'm running many times,

2678
02:33:37.651 --> 02:33:40.530
I'm in 28 30 which is also a violation completely.

2679
02:33:41.430 --> 02:33:44.550
But I'd say half the people in there,
we're just normal guys.
You know,

2680
02:33:44.551 --> 02:33:46.650
they've got an injury or girls,
you know,
they've got an injury,

2681
02:33:46.651 --> 02:33:48.990
something happened,
car wreck or something,
you know,

2682
02:33:48.991 --> 02:33:50.610
here's a pill before you know it,

2683
02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:53.530
you know the divorce lost everything you know there,

2684
02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:57.360
you know I had some epilepsy or some seizures and then they're sitting in there

2685
02:33:57.361 --> 02:34:01.200
going,
I don't know what happened.
So that amazing that fast.
Those pain pills,

2686
02:34:01.250 --> 02:34:04.740
you know,
can,
it can take it when fucking marijuana.
It does the same thing.

2687
02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:08.120
But does it though?
I don't know if it does matter.
I mean I've had a,

2688
02:34:08.260 --> 02:34:13.260
I had a morphine drip more feed one of those more.
I enjoy the morphine.

2689
02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:16.760
I had my shoulder.
Oh wait,
what do you have doing new shoulders?
Oh,

2690
02:34:16.770 --> 02:34:18.190
like him in high school.

2691
02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:22.330
<v 3>Did you ever get lucky?
I had reconstructive on both.
I'm trying to avoid one.</v>

2692
02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:23.890
I've got a labor him tear on this one,

2693
02:34:23.891 --> 02:34:27.370
but I got a stem shell shock the other day.
I don't know if it's going to work,

2694
02:34:27.371 --> 02:34:28.750
if it doesn't work,
I'm going under the knife.

2695
02:34:28.751 --> 02:34:32.470
But I woke up from one of the surgeries,
I'm morphine and I,
uh,
and I,
uh,

2696
02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:35.110
I got operated on a Christmas Eve,

2697
02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:38.080
this sounds like a senior in high school or whatever.
And it was a big,

2698
02:34:38.081 --> 02:34:40.210
a styrofoam candy cane like in the room.

2699
02:34:40.330 --> 02:34:44.980
And I hit the nurse over the head with it.
Fuck.
Did you know what you're doing?

2700
02:34:44.981 --> 02:34:48.910
No,
I was on fucking,
Murphy was drank in high school.

2701
02:34:48.911 --> 02:34:51.030
I didn't fucking do drugs.
I'll send them on ma.

2702
02:34:51.070 --> 02:34:53.230
I don't know if I can get out of my room.
Did it fix your shoulders?

2703
02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:57.510
Can you say football and college have to both operations.

2704
02:34:57.510 --> 02:35:01.590
I had a guy named Lyle,
I still remember his name.
Wow.
And uh,

2705
02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:04.330
I went to a doctor because they had a little bit of a tear or a few years ago.

2706
02:35:04.690 --> 02:35:08.560
And uh,
I mentioned my doctor's name,
this is back in the 80s.
And he goes,

2707
02:35:08.561 --> 02:35:13.300
I just went to a Harvard to listen to him speak.
You got to work on my shoulders.

2708
02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:15.730
She had a tear recently that was like,

2709
02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:19.420
I had a slight tear like five s five years ago.
And so that is,

2710
02:35:19.630 --> 02:35:21.360
they don't have to operate on a no,
it was nothing.

2711
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:26.050
But I messed him up when I was younger I would fog and I dislocated them each

2712
02:35:26.051 --> 02:35:31.030
about 30 times and I separated.
This guy did 30 of these operations,

2713
02:35:31.031 --> 02:35:34.750
30 to 40 a year.
He'd been doing it for 20 years that he's,
he did my first one,

2714
02:35:34.751 --> 02:35:36.980
he goes,
that's the worst shoulder of a scene than he did my second one.

2715
02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:41.190
Cause that was worse than your first one.
Wow.
We get back in the 80s were lifted.

2716
02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:44.660
We wouldn't stretch trying to bench 300 pounds,
you know what I mean?

2717
02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:46.090
Just stupid shit.

2718
02:35:46.091 --> 02:35:50.140
And then when I got hit and football was really the weights that fucked me up

2719
02:35:50.170 --> 02:35:51.640
and up and play ball for a little while.

2720
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:56.110
You helped me a lot when I was an open miker without even knowing it because I

2721
02:35:56.111 --> 02:35:59.920
saw you on stage and I said,
this guy does not look like a fucking comedian.

2722
02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:04.530
He looks like a big football player looking handsome bastard.
Funny.

2723
02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:05.920
But I was like,

2724
02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:10.120
people hate you for that because we live in this business is neuro Advil.

2725
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:12.170
They fucking,
this is their turf.
Well they,

2726
02:36:12.250 --> 02:36:15.610
it Mark Marin literally said like he was joking around about it but he said he

2727
02:36:15.611 --> 02:36:19.690
really felt like this is not for you guys.
Yeah.
Cool guys.

2728
02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:24.350
Well I thought I was,
I know and then I saw it because I was an open mic,

2729
02:36:24.351 --> 02:36:28.420
but I saw you.
I go,
oh,
okay.
He can do it.
If he can do it,

2730
02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:29.680
he's better looking than me.

2731
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:35.140
He's bigger and handsomer like I'm all right.
I'll sneak in.

2732
02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:36.640
Nick Dipaolo is working and phonies.

2733
02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:39.940
I have a clip for me like literally my second year in the business doing it like

2734
02:36:39.941 --> 02:36:40.730
an eight minutes set.

2735
02:36:40.730 --> 02:36:45.130
The comedy connection and I have a suit jacket on it and it fits me like Shannon

2736
02:36:45.130 --> 02:36:49.420
Sharpe was,
is like on CBS fit like a teacher and it looked so stupid.

2737
02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:52.020
I get that greasy Italian mullet.
I even hate it.

2738
02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:56.970
People hated me.
You were a big thick dude,

2739
02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:02.050
played up at Maine and it was a fucking lifting weights every day and you could

2740
02:37:02.051 --> 02:37:05.080
tell the nerves to fucking,
they want,
they just don't.

2741
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:07.810
That's what kills me about people like this in this business.

2742
02:37:07.811 --> 02:37:10.960
They hate people who are intolerant yet they've fucking lucky.
We go,
ugh.

2743
02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:11.720
You know this guy's,

2744
02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:16.100
it was automatically like to assume that you're one of those intolerant.
Beat

2745
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:20.900
<v 6>him up.
Yeah.
No,
I get along with everybody.</v>

2746
02:37:20.901 --> 02:37:24.420
Nerd's gotta fucking guys or did drugs and yeah,
so did I.

2747
02:37:24.450 --> 02:37:27.020
I knew a lot of guys that did drugs and I knew a lot of nerves.

2748
02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:30.380
I knew a lot of guys who did drugs and that's what kept me from doing drugs and

2749
02:37:30.381 --> 02:37:31.750
I was in high school.
That's right.

2750
02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:36.080
I had my friend Jimmy's got an older cousin and we had some mutual friends in

2751
02:37:36.081 --> 02:37:38.390
his mutual friends.
There were three or four years older than me,

2752
02:37:38.660 --> 02:37:42.380
so when I was like 14 and 15 these guys were fucking hitting the wall.

2753
02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:45.440
They were getting out of high school and just losing their fucking minds and

2754
02:37:45.441 --> 02:37:49.440
selling drugs and fallen apart and losing weight and getting addicted.

2755
02:37:49.470 --> 02:37:53.480
I was watching guys la spiral out of control and I was like,
fuck coke.

2756
02:37:53.481 --> 02:37:56.880
Sometimes that's the best way to show somebody that.
Yeah,

2757
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:59.640
it sucks is somebody has to be your sacrificial goat.

2758
02:38:00.050 --> 02:38:04.250
You have to watch somebody fall apart at the altar.
True.
Well,
that's like a,

2759
02:38:04.820 --> 02:38:06.140
it's a classic.

2760
02:38:06.141 --> 02:38:10.190
It's a classic way that people learn by watching other people fuck up and when

2761
02:38:10.191 --> 02:38:12.350
you take away the possibility people fucking up,

2762
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:17.240
then you get into some weird state that you've got in these clinics where it's

2763
02:38:17.241 --> 02:38:20.210
like you're not really fucking up so you're not really hitting rock bottom.

2764
02:38:20.211 --> 02:38:23.150
So the other people don't even see you as doing that bad.

2765
02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:27.900
No know there's Nikki stays in the house.
That's the new normal.
Yeah,

2766
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:31.370
they gave me the moccasins.
Good.
I got a good place with suboxone.

2767
02:38:31.700 --> 02:38:35.900
They have these Rehab Romances that happen all the time.
It's,
it's a thing they,

2768
02:38:35.901 --> 02:38:37.040
they're,
they're in there,
you know,

2769
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:39.500
cause I think people connect in fear more than they do love.

2770
02:38:39.501 --> 02:38:41.840
So two people will meet and they'll go like,
how dare you?

2771
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:45.980
Well what's your disability check?
What's my disability check?
And they go like,

2772
02:38:45.981 --> 02:38:48.950
you know what,
I love you.
We can do this together.
Fuck yeah.

2773
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:53.180
And then they go out and it doesn't mean that to nail Polish.

2774
02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:56.450
That's my girl.
Well you'd see him,
they all had the bands on,

2775
02:38:56.451 --> 02:38:58.370
cause they get bands from the meetings that they go to.

2776
02:38:58.790 --> 02:39:00.800
And so they were a certain everyone beads.

2777
02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:04.920
And so you'll see the 12 step beads all over,
tons of beating and there's,

2778
02:39:04.921 --> 02:39:06.650
it's arts and crafts at summer camp.

2779
02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:09.320
And then a week later they thought it might've got thrown up.
Some guys

2780
02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:14.550
fucked up,
which is weird cause I got it.
I got it.

2781
02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:19.010
I got notes to summer camp to where these people come back so much their hand,

2782
02:39:19.130 --> 02:39:22.880
things they draw and their art that they did the last hand rehab are all over

2783
02:39:22.881 --> 02:39:26.000
the wall and shit.
And so they're coming back like it was

2784
02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:31.860
serious.
They draw their hands and they're,
they're affirmations,
you know.

2785
02:39:32.730 --> 02:39:37.460
Oh five affirmations.
Oh it wasn't,
they have diseases.
It's a disease.

2786
02:39:37.461 --> 02:39:40.090
Nick Depaulo.
Oh Jesus.
Don't do a joke.

2787
02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:44.570
But it's kind of a disease right now being addicted.
No,
he says no.
Nope.

2788
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:48.230
No room for discretion.
Nope.
As well.
I loved the discussion.
A discussion.

2789
02:39:48.231 --> 02:39:51.600
I've fucking disgusted in a facility though.
Let me,

2790
02:39:51.890 --> 02:39:53.510
let me get rid of the word disease.

2791
02:39:53.511 --> 02:39:56.120
Cause I think disease like a lot of other words.

2792
02:39:56.121 --> 02:39:58.490
There's a lot of weight behind it.
Right?
General though.
So let's,

2793
02:39:58.540 --> 02:40:00.980
let's just say instead of let's set up instead of a disease,

2794
02:40:01.310 --> 02:40:05.360
when a person becomes addicted to something,
there's obviously a physical issue.

2795
02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:09.830
So we'll call it a disease,
call it an ailment,
cause it call it something.

2796
02:40:09.950 --> 02:40:14.520
When someone gets addictive behavior,
it's definitely behavior that locked it in.

2797
02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:19.470
But once you get addicted and you're just trapped in the clutches of a drug,

2798
02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:22.590
what is that?
If it's not a disease,
for me it's behavioral.

2799
02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:26.010
For me it's all behavioral to the idea that they're using is a symptom.

2800
02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:28.680
The drugs themselves,
it's a symptom of something else.

2801
02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:31.740
I would tell you that eight out of the 10 people that are sitting in my,

2802
02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:35.580
you know,
group therapy,
when I,
when I was doing it had been a child abused.

2803
02:40:35.581 --> 02:40:38.730
You know,
I've been through some serious shit,
you know,
and so most of it,

2804
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:42.450
it comes from that.
Now the drugs they put on top of it,
if it's,

2805
02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:46.230
if you only council,
hey,
you're so focused on this drug,

2806
02:40:46.231 --> 02:40:50.010
it becomes the drug is the problem and you ignore the shit that the person's

2807
02:40:50.011 --> 02:40:50.521
going through.

2808
02:40:50.521 --> 02:40:53.730
Been through the fact that I don't know whatever's happened to them.

2809
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:58.910
And so we'd rather beat them up about their inability to make a choice not to do

2810
02:40:59.071 --> 02:41:01.950
a drug.
Then really work out of what's the drug give you?

2811
02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:04.920
What are you getting by using the drug and you know,
can you,

2812
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:09.000
can you teach how to use the drug better?
Can you,
and you know,
swap drugs even,

2813
02:41:09.001 --> 02:41:13.290
I mean it just get pimped out by the system essentially.
100% man,

2814
02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:18.780
100% in bipolar.
This dike fucking diagnosis that drives me absolutely insane.

2815
02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:22.930
Now there's a DSM four,
you know,
the Dsm five is driving saying,

2816
02:41:24.210 --> 02:41:28.380
cause everybody thinks they have it and it's really,
really rare.

2817
02:41:28.530 --> 02:41:30.990
It's a rare diagnosis.
I think.
I got it.

2818
02:41:31.770 --> 02:41:34.800
That's what people do feel like I've got an ex girlfriend or some shit.

2819
02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:40.230
Maybe bipolar.
No,
no,
no.
When you're a kid,

2820
02:41:40.231 --> 02:41:42.000
five HTP.
When I first met you,

2821
02:41:42.001 --> 02:41:44.640
you said you had like a testosterone and over amount.

2822
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:46.470
When you said you were like,
when I first met you.

2823
02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:51.620
<v 1>Oh you only,
I was like fucking risk meant me.
Yeah,
no,</v>

2824
02:41:51.621 --> 02:41:53.620
I was still fighting.
Yeah,
I was at,

2825
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:55.220
I mean that was just out of my mind that a fear,

2826
02:41:55.221 --> 02:41:58.010
I'm sure there's no use buying set.
When you were younger as a kid,

2827
02:41:58.011 --> 02:42:01.670
you always had like hyper energy and shit when you grow up with violence.

2828
02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:04.550
I grew up with domestic violence.
When you grow up with that,

2829
02:42:04.551 --> 02:42:08.990
your program to respond and react quickly,
you know,
told me about this vigilance.

2830
02:42:09.410 --> 02:42:11.330
Hypervigilance.
Yeah.
Well there's,

2831
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:15.710
there's a lot of studies being done on kids who grew up in violent households

2832
02:42:15.770 --> 02:42:17.240
and um,
uh,

2833
02:42:17.241 --> 02:42:20.120
when they become football players or pro football players and involved in a

2834
02:42:20.121 --> 02:42:22.070
domestic violence or fighters as well,

2835
02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:25.280
they developed this hair trigger reaction to things overreact,

2836
02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:29.150
make like mistakes that they can't rebound from.

2837
02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:31.100
And a lot of it is because they think of the,

2838
02:42:31.130 --> 02:42:34.430
the actual programming that occurs when they're in the womb,

2839
02:42:34.431 --> 02:42:38.300
even when their mother is experiencing violence from your father,
right.

2840
02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:41.930
Literally changes their genes in the womb.
It does.

2841
02:42:41.931 --> 02:42:45.950
They actually come out and fearful of the father's voice.
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2842
02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:47.150
Michael Irvin told me this.

2843
02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:50.750
I was on a plane flight with him just randomly and luckily he's the nicest

2844
02:42:50.751 --> 02:42:54.280
fucking guy in the world.
He's such a nice guy.
And uh,

2845
02:42:54.290 --> 02:42:57.050
we were flying Australia together.
This is a long ass flights.

2846
02:42:57.051 --> 02:43:00.110
We had a long conversation because you know they have that little area in the

2847
02:43:00.111 --> 02:43:02.310
middle where the bathroom is,
you could stand up,
stretch your legs.
Yeah.

2848
02:43:02.540 --> 02:43:05.360
Him and I are just talking about football and about the work that he's been

2849
02:43:05.361 --> 02:43:09.710
doing with young kids that grow up around violence.
So that was,
you know,

2850
02:43:09.711 --> 02:43:10.940
I'd grown up around that.

2851
02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:15.370
Then I'd competed in martial arts tournaments from the time I was 15 to 21 zero

2852
02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:18.100
was when you met me.
I was very crazy.

2853
02:43:18.730 --> 02:43:22.990
I was like from 21 till I did,
it took me a long time to relax.

2854
02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:26.270
<v 6>You know,
I feel the same job.
I don't know what your,
you know,</v>

2855
02:43:26.271 --> 02:43:30.200
your family life was like,
but mine was violent every day.
Man,
day in and day out.

2856
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:34.160
And I played football myself.
I used to be two 45 is a lot bigger than this.

2857
02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:37.310
And um,
you know,
I had that hair trigger.

2858
02:43:37.311 --> 02:43:39.620
That was the reaction and that's why I went into football.

2859
02:43:39.621 --> 02:43:42.950
And what I like to talk to people about is,
I mean,
it's a war zone.

2860
02:43:42.951 --> 02:43:44.920
When your home is really like that in your a child,

2861
02:43:45.250 --> 02:43:47.780
there's no difference than going to Afghanistan.
It's horrible.

2862
02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:50.900
And a soldier going through was dramatic row,
right?
Post traumatic stress.

2863
02:43:50.901 --> 02:43:53.820
And then a three year old that every day is watching,
you know,

2864
02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:58.220
his father choke his mom to sleep right across the room or put guns in their own

2865
02:43:58.221 --> 02:44:02.630
mouths.
But I mine mine sounds a lot less than yours.

2866
02:44:02.630 --> 02:44:07.340
And I got out when I was five and then my mom remarried the nicest guys like a

2867
02:44:07.341 --> 02:44:10.880
hippie.
So changed as completely all violence,

2868
02:44:11.170 --> 02:44:12.470
but all violence was gone.

2869
02:44:12.770 --> 02:44:17.300
So then I had to reintroduce it into my life by fighting football was that

2870
02:44:17.301 --> 02:44:20.570
outlet for me.
I got an adopted 15 year old daughter.

2871
02:44:20.810 --> 02:44:24.080
So when you hear about the Stepdad,
you know,
when you say that you know her,

2872
02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:25.400
her dad's a piece of shit,

2873
02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:27.860
he's out of the picture and has been since she was five.

2874
02:44:27.861 --> 02:44:32.750
So for about 10 years she's mine.
And,
um,
we,
I think we came in just in time,

2875
02:44:32.751 --> 02:44:34.860
you know,
to where none of that's around,
you know,

2876
02:44:34.870 --> 02:44:38.650
but the violence does so much for the influencing what,

2877
02:44:38.660 --> 02:44:42.930
what children do and become and how they react.
I mean,
if you go back to those,

2878
02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:45.950
the primal error,
you know,
when we had to react,
it was life or death,

2879
02:44:45.951 --> 02:44:46.820
fight or flight.
You,

2880
02:44:46.821 --> 02:44:50.960
you implement that into a three year old who literally are seven or five,

2881
02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:54.500
who's literally worried about the big monster named daddy who's going to cut on

2882
02:44:54.501 --> 02:44:56.630
the hall light and come in the room.
Yeah.
I mean,

2883
02:44:56.631 --> 02:45:00.180
this is a fucking giant to these tiny,
right.
And you know,

2884
02:45:00.930 --> 02:45:02.120
it had that.

2885
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:05.310
And then think about that woman who was molested by her brother and her father.

2886
02:45:05.930 --> 02:45:08.870
Fuck,
that's right.
And you're going to say,
what?

2887
02:45:09.530 --> 02:45:13.490
Come here for 30 days and let's talk about it and good luck.

2888
02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.290
I mean that,
that's it.
That's what we fucking offer them.
Just here's more drugs.

2889
02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:21.770
God dammit.
You know,
I've had some clients where I wanted to be like,

2890
02:45:21.771 --> 02:45:23.690
you don't want to just keep doing fucking trucks,
man.

2891
02:45:23.691 --> 02:45:26.480
It's not going to get any better.
You're having more fun this way,
you know,

2892
02:45:26.481 --> 02:45:28.310
just control it.
Try not to kill yourself.

2893
02:45:28.370 --> 02:45:32.870
<v 1>Do you remember back then Nick were like 2122 years old.
Like,</v>

2894
02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:36.710
do you remember how like hair trigger you were as a young man?
Do you do,

2895
02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:40.220
do you really take into consideration the amount of mellowing you've done over

2896
02:45:40.221 --> 02:45:44.720
time,
especially you and you like football guys in particular,

2897
02:45:44.721 --> 02:45:48.680
that is a fucking explosive sport.
You are just,
you know,

2898
02:45:48.690 --> 02:45:51.950
we think about what a regular kid does during the day or regular kid does.

2899
02:45:51.951 --> 02:45:54.140
It doesn't play sport like that.
And then what you're doing,

2900
02:45:54.380 --> 02:45:57.880
you're involved at fucking collusions giant dudes.

2901
02:45:57.900 --> 02:45:59.150
Me Think about what you did to your shoulders,

2902
02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:03.620
all that kind of crazy chaos and violence becomes a part of your normal everyday

2903
02:46:03.621 --> 02:46:04.070
world

2904
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:08.150
<v 6>to mention your testosterone level was growing up and throw Bose on that at a</v>

2905
02:46:08.151 --> 02:46:12.440
party.
I,
my first girlfriend broke up with me because I get a couple of fights,

2906
02:46:12.441 --> 02:46:15.920
you know,
parties and um,
but what else do you do with it?

2907
02:46:15.921 --> 02:46:19.250
I mean your bread to be a fucking warrior from day one saying it's a healthy

2908
02:46:19.251 --> 02:46:22.640
outlet to play football and stuff.
At that point,

2909
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:25.060
you can get a lot of trouble if you don't know what I mean.

2910
02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:27.830
I know guys who didn't play that.
We're fucking pretty violent.

2911
02:46:28.030 --> 02:46:31.340
At least I was taking it out on people in practice.
Well,

2912
02:46:31.341 --> 02:46:34.730
I think there's definitely something to be said for finding an outlet for

2913
02:46:34.731 --> 02:46:35.564
violence,

2914
02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:40.690
like an aggressive lit for aggressive action and something that calms your body

2915
02:46:41.151 --> 02:46:42.950
down.
Especially for young men.

2916
02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:46.790
I don't you mean football's a tricky one because there's the fucking studies

2917
02:46:46.791 --> 02:46:50.070
that are coming back now on football fan anymore,
man,
I don't what the fuck.

2918
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:53.600
I was a huge football fan,
watched it all the time,
played it in.

2919
02:46:53.601 --> 02:46:55.370
The more research that I've been learning from,

2920
02:46:55.650 --> 02:46:59.150
was it amber Lyon or Rhonda Patrick that talks about the head injuries,

2921
02:46:59.151 --> 02:47:02.900
et cetera.
I'm like,
fuck.
The last 10 years of my life,

2922
02:47:02.901 --> 02:47:05.930
I'm thought there was,
he was relaying the story.

2923
02:47:05.931 --> 02:47:08.930
I don't remember the entire story,
but it was about a football player in college.

2924
02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:13.370
He gets knocked out,
he gets dinged like real bad just like,
but he's,
you know,

2925
02:47:13.371 --> 02:47:16.970
he's,
he's moving around,
they sit on the sidelines,
they send them back in,

2926
02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:22.060
he gets smashed again and now permanent damage and he's fucked at fast.

2927
02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:25.400
Still fucked like many,
many years later.
He's still a wreck.

2928
02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:27.380
I know full of four concussions,

2929
02:47:27.390 --> 02:47:31.100
I know of four but I also know plenty of times and I got dinged and went back

2930
02:47:31.101 --> 02:47:31.790
into the game.

2931
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:36.560
I'm so nervous myself and I get hit by a car when I was 11 years old when he was

2932
02:47:36.561 --> 02:47:38.810
in the hospital for a week.
Maybe that's what made you funny.

2933
02:47:38.811 --> 02:47:40.490
Did you ever think about that?
Absolutely.

2934
02:47:40.491 --> 02:47:43.400
I'm going to end up in some article that can't be true joke cause I've been in

2935
02:47:43.401 --> 02:47:47.250
four total car accidents and I played semi pro football and uh,

2936
02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:50.840
I have my whole office about it.
Forget that John Travolta movie.

2937
02:47:50.841 --> 02:47:53.990
We get hit by lightening and could read people's minds because it doesn't work

2938
02:47:53.991 --> 02:47:54.920
the same with everybody

2939
02:47:57.290 --> 02:48:01.040
but does for some people they have head injuries and all of a sudden they have

2940
02:48:01.041 --> 02:48:05.300
new skills.
They can do math,
they can play music and dance and it doesn't work.

2941
02:48:05.301 --> 02:48:09.320
It can do,
it can do therapy.
It doesn't always work,

2942
02:48:09.470 --> 02:48:11.840
but sometimes it does.
Yeah.
I wonder all the time.

2943
02:48:11.841 --> 02:48:14.030
I know the reason why I said it is cause that's what happened at Kennison.

2944
02:48:14.031 --> 02:48:15.530
He got hit by a car and we was a little kid.

2945
02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:19.250
They said that when Kennison was young,
he was one way.
He was like normal,

2946
02:48:19.251 --> 02:48:21.950
regular cit and then he got hit by a car and like real bad.

2947
02:48:22.250 --> 02:48:24.590
And then when he got out of whatever the fuck he was in it,

2948
02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:29.260
all of a sudden he was Kennison wild,
impulsive,
didn't get a fuck.
Oh.

2949
02:48:30.140 --> 02:48:31.250
He came that wild,

2950
02:48:31.251 --> 02:48:34.070
crazy preacher guy like literally became that from a car accident.

2951
02:48:34.510 --> 02:48:38.480
When you start talking tbis and traumatic brain injuries and that who is walking

2952
02:48:38.481 --> 02:48:40.250
into these facilities?
Oh yeah.

2953
02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:45.400
It's amazing how fucking arrogant the psychiatrist act because we literally know

2954
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:49.760
almost nothing about real tbis.
You know where the brain,
you get hit here.

2955
02:48:49.761 --> 02:48:51.620
It could do this.
It could be that rule.
No.

2956
02:48:51.980 --> 02:48:55.930
So what happens is a guy who walks in who has a traumatic brain injury,

2957
02:48:55.970 --> 02:48:57.260
definitely Tbi.

2958
02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:01.170
What they start doing is playing with psychotropic medication and they start

2959
02:49:01.171 --> 02:49:03.500
saying,
well,
if it's in this area and this is the behavior,

2960
02:49:03.501 --> 02:49:07.010
so they throw you a six,
seven cocktails of pills hoping yeah,

2961
02:49:07.180 --> 02:49:10.350
can sense the right way in any depressants or the same fucking way.

2962
02:49:10.770 --> 02:49:12.300
And I tell people,
man,

2963
02:49:12.301 --> 02:49:15.420
the last thing you want to do is go right to a fucking antidepressant before you

2964
02:49:15.421 --> 02:49:19.380
do any thing.
Don't do that yet.
And once,

2965
02:49:19.381 --> 02:49:22.140
because once you start to walk down that road,
it can,

2966
02:49:22.141 --> 02:49:24.300
it can be years before you baseline again.

2967
02:49:24.330 --> 02:49:26.430
So it's like a one flew over the cuckoo's nest,

2968
02:49:26.431 --> 02:49:28.230
but just a more sophisticated version,

2969
02:49:28.231 --> 02:49:31.020
but still just as chaotic fucking guessing.

2970
02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:34.920
That's why they'll tell you an Ssri won't work for you your whole life.

2971
02:49:35.020 --> 02:49:36.000
This will work for a while,

2972
02:49:36.001 --> 02:49:39.450
but we got to try these nine until we find the one that does this one to work

2973
02:49:39.451 --> 02:49:42.900
for a while.
Then when it doesn't,
we'll switch.
And this Gary,
as part,
I had a,

2974
02:49:43.570 --> 02:49:46.240
it's a want to be podcast,
but I was just having fun with it.
Uh,

2975
02:49:46.310 --> 02:49:47.640
it was called the cognitive rampage.

2976
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:52.230
I think all podcasts are want to be podcasts.
You don't know legitimate podcast.

2977
02:49:52.650 --> 02:49:56.070
This is totally a legitimate,
this is a real mad as fuck.
It's,
it's,
it's,

2978
02:49:56.071 --> 02:49:58.530
it's sort of,
but not really.
Trust me.

2979
02:49:58.590 --> 02:50:03.230
I'll show you [inaudible] podcast Ryan and I know the origins of it,
but I had a,

2980
02:50:03.330 --> 02:50:06.390
can I say a doctor's name here?
I had a bipolar list,

2981
02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:12.210
no name a Chicago.
Dr Brodsky.
Dr. Lewis Brodsky,
and he's,

2982
02:50:12.211 --> 02:50:14.460
all he's done is focused on,
on bipolar.

2983
02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.780
And so what his issue is is most people,

2984
02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:21.180
they'll walk into a facility,
right?
They'll get,
they'll,

2985
02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:23.880
75% of them are getting diagnosed with depression,
right?

2986
02:50:23.881 --> 02:50:25.350
Here's your antidepressant out the door.

2987
02:50:25.351 --> 02:50:27.600
The doc spent three minutes with your general practitioner,

2988
02:50:27.601 --> 02:50:29.870
asks you some sadness questions.
You fit the criteria,

2989
02:50:29.871 --> 02:50:32.670
tried to try and depressed and they don't tell you you're about to fuck your

2990
02:50:32.671 --> 02:50:35.160
whole chemical shit up.
You're about to screw your brain up.

2991
02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:39.690
But what happens though,
if you're bipolar truly,
and you take an antidepressant,

2992
02:50:40.260 --> 02:50:42.810
the first two or three days,
you're gonna feel like God,

2993
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:46.410
you're going to feel like everything has been fixed him in better in my life and

2994
02:50:46.411 --> 02:50:50.490
think you have the right pill.
Every doctor at that point should know,
oh shit,

2995
02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:54.720
we fucked up.
You give someone who's bipolar,
an antidepressant or SSR.

2996
02:50:54.721 --> 02:50:56.010
I's and they cycle faster,

2997
02:50:56.011 --> 02:50:59.370
almost twice to three times faster than they ever cycled before in their life.

2998
02:50:59.580 --> 02:51:02.970
Wow.
So how,
think about how many people are going to a doctor.

2999
02:51:03.090 --> 02:51:07.740
Talk about some typical sadness or depression.
Here's Zoloft or some shit.

3000
02:51:07.890 --> 02:51:12.330
You go home and they're like,
man,
this is great.
I left side field,

3001
02:51:12.350 --> 02:51:14.370
I'm getting a little tangential,
but had a guy,

3002
02:51:14.430 --> 02:51:17.640
both his sons killed themselves and I was counseling him.

3003
02:51:18.210 --> 02:51:21.110
Doc gave him thought he was depressed,
gave me any depressant.

3004
02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:25.650
The second day after it he said,
I'm over at all.
All of this was meant to happen.

3005
02:51:25.651 --> 02:51:29.820
You tell that's not natural and he was happy and ready to go,
ready to go.

3006
02:51:29.821 --> 02:51:34.590
And then two days later starts to cycle hard from manic to heavy manic to

3007
02:51:34.591 --> 02:51:39.170
suicidal manic.
That stuff works for like,
my dad's going to be 80 you know,

3008
02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:42.720
and I got an uncle who's 85 and that's when it works.

3009
02:51:42.780 --> 02:51:45.960
The antidepressant helped them both.
You know what I mean?

3010
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:48.090
But that's like you said,
he's for some people,

3011
02:51:48.091 --> 02:51:51.420
the people that I know that have worked for,
that has worked for out of them.

3012
02:51:51.421 --> 02:51:54.810
I know a few,
but two of them have cycled off of it.
It helped them,

3013
02:51:54.811 --> 02:51:55.650
they fixed their life,

3014
02:51:55.651 --> 02:51:57.820
they've got their life in order and then once her life was ordered than the

3015
02:51:57.821 --> 02:52:00.220
weaned himself off of it.
How you're supposed to do it.
Yeah.
Well they,

3016
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:01.620
they both did it that way.

3017
02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:04.590
One of my friends from Jujitsu when a comedian friend of mine,
yeah,
they,

3018
02:52:04.650 --> 02:52:07.000
they definitely work.
I don't want,
I wouldn't bash that at all.

3019
02:52:07.001 --> 02:52:11.350
But as your first go to,
there's a lot of the things you can try,
you know,

3020
02:52:11.351 --> 02:52:14.290
changing your routine,
trying to find different things to get involved with.

3021
02:52:14.291 --> 02:52:17.550
There's a lot of things to do before you start going the quick magic pill for.

3022
02:52:17.551 --> 02:52:21.190
Yes.
Yeah.
Well listen man,
thanks for doing this.
I'm glad I met you last night.

3023
02:52:21.220 --> 02:52:24.460
It was a fortuitous opportunity to have a conversation with you and I knew that

3024
02:52:24.461 --> 02:52:27.400
we would have a cool talk.
I mean this,
I've know,
I've very rarely do this,

3025
02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:30.550
so to have someone in like perfect symmetry,
right?
Fig did worked out.

3026
02:52:30.551 --> 02:52:33.940
The fucking universe is looking out for us.
