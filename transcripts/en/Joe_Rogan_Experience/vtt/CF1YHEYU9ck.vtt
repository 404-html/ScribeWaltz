1
00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>This is what I want to say.</v>

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I want to see Nick Diaz versus Conor Mcgregor.</v>

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to say.</v>

5
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that more than I want to see anything in life.</v>

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.531
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had,</v>

7
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>so I want to say it more than I want to see the Aurora borealis more than I want</v>

8
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>to go to the Keck observatory in Hawaii and revisit the Milky Way more than I</v>

9
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>want to see any of those things.</v>

10
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to see Nick Diaz versus Conor Mcgregor.</v>

11
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz Kinda regretted how to cool his little walk around and wearing as he</v>

13
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>got in.</v>

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.433
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

15
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.991
<v Speaker 1>He was awesome.</v>

16
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad mother fucker.</v>

17
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Did with the way he walked around it would he got in the ring?</v>

18
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think he was going to get punched in the face as much as he did and we</v>

19
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>still won,</v>

20
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>but that was a cocky interest.</v>

21
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

22
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.941
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

23
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>he bought the first round,</v>

24
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>knock out this mother fucker.</v>

25
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>The way he just came in here.</v>

26
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>what he's trying to do is just like shake it off,</v>

29
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>put an air out there.</v>

30
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day he's fighting Nate Diaz.</v>

31
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:53.650
<v Speaker 1>He's no one's getting know first round knock out.</v>

32
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>This is getting crazy war.</v>

33
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>He knew it and that he had to be conservative in that fight.</v>

34
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Energy was so crazy.</v>

35
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

36
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>

37
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.461
<v Speaker 1>It was so,</v>

38
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:02.920
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

39
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

40
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I was so nothing ever right.</v>

41
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>It was so,</v>

42
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad I went to see your lab.</v>

43
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

44
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

45
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

46
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a as,</v>

47
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.121
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>

48
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:16.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm a casual fan so he's a couple of times where a kind of knocked him to the</v>

49
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:18.834
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

50
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>kind of doesn't want to do ground game with him cause he was,</v>

51
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>he was not into the ground.</v>

52
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.151
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

53
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

54
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

55
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.051
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

56
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>he was telling me to come up where I would think normally for my lack net that</v>

57
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:29.851
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

58
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.901
<v Speaker 1>intimate knowledge,</v>

60
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I would think once you knock somebody to the ground,</v>

61
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you try to go in with those hammer fists.</v>

62
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

63
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>if you do that with a guy like Nate Diaz,</v>

64
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>he might not be hurt at all,</v>

65
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>especially when you consider the fact that,</v>

66
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>he Connor through a bunch of like really powerful left leg kicks and he had</v>

68
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>fucked up Nate's right leg cause because of the fact they're both south paw,</v>

69
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>what happens is like that back leg becomes the front leg,</v>

70
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>the right leg is in front,</v>

71
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>And he just getting chewed up.</v>

73
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>But this left power leg kicked up right from the beginning,</v>

74
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>like over and over and over and over again.</v>

75
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

76
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>when you get hit with a bunch of like really powerful leg kicks like that,</v>

77
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>it makes it super difficult for you to move.</v>

78
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

79
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

80
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>and then Conor just fought a smooth,</v>

81
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>smart game plan.</v>

82
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:16.861
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

84
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

85
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.801
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

86
00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 1>it engaged from the outside where he,</v>

87
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:24.721
<v Speaker 1>his speed was an advantage and did some damage but didn't unload himself like he</v>

88
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>did in the first fight.</v>

89
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.631
<v Speaker 1>In the first fight.</v>

90
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>He did that too,</v>

91
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>but any unloaded himself and Nate survived.</v>

92
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.371
<v Speaker 1>And when he survived,</v>

93
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Connor's gas tank was empty.</v>

94
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

95
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>So this time Connor was way more conservative.</v>

96
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

97
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 1>He would run away,</v>

98
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 1>but he would run away.</v>

99
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

100
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

101
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>You could say it.</v>

102
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.783
<v Speaker 1>He would run away.</v>

103
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>He ran away.</v>

104
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>But when he was on a cane,</v>

105
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.470
<v Speaker 1>when get close to the KT over,</v>

106
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:48.230
<v Speaker 1>run it and make it more into the center it,</v>

107
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.421
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

108
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

109
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.351
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

110
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>people are mad that he ran away</v>

111
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>because it sucks.</v>

112
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you take a break,</v>

113
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you take a break.</v>

114
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>He knows the three moments in the round he's got,</v>

115
00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.540
<v Speaker 1>he knows there's,</v>

116
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

117
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when it was.</v>

118
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.721
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

119
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>there was a couple moments in time where he totally turned away from him,</v>

120
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>but then he engaged.</v>

121
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

122
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:08.001
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

123
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like he was running the whole,</v>

124
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.323
<v Speaker 1>he was just,</v>

125
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>when he found himself in a compromising position,</v>

126
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>

127
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.913
<v Speaker 1>he would get out of it.</v>

128
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

129
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting thing to do it guys trying to kick your ass.</v>

130
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to go over here for a minute.</v>

131
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>It's something funny about it.</v>

133
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

134
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>seemed like a good move.</v>

135
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>It's the right move.</v>

136
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.811
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

137
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>when you don't feel like you can fight right now,</v>

138
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do?</v>

139
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Stand in New Logo,</v>

140
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:34.020
<v Speaker 1>moon and don't get on the gin.</v>

141
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.893
<v Speaker 1>Bush,</v>

142
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.261
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

143
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:36.094
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

144
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.543
<v Speaker 1>Jenny.</v>

145
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>If you don't feel like you can breathe,</v>

146
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should move away and breathe.</v>

147
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.091
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
