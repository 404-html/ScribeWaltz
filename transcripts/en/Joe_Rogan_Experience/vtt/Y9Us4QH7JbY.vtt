<v Speaker 1>I'll.</v>

11
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's called tr.</v>

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I talked about it last time I was here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to do it.</v>

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I did ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I got to say I cannot recommend.</v>

15
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I did three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

17
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>actually I did six sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>which was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it?</v>

19
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:47.601
<v Speaker 1>But the side effects long term where my </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes burned for straight up two to three</v>

20
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>months every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Houses like burn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I needed drops constantly.</v>

22
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.683
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stare at the Sun burnt when </v>

23
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

24
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>I got something in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.243
<v Speaker 1>More like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just felt like kind of groggy and </v>

26
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>out of it for a couple months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

27
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I did.</v>

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's explain.</v>

29
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>So Ketamine last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

30
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.383
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I talked about the last time I was </v>

31
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

32
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got a lot of talk about you </v>

33
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:17.304
<v Speaker 1>were going to do it or you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it maybe I was gonna do I think you had </v>

34
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:20.731
<v Speaker 1>done it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I had done it and it was still too early</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell,</v>

36
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.533
<v Speaker 1>but I remember running into in the hall </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the comedy store and you were super </v>

37
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing the first time I did it,</v>

38
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.234
<v Speaker 1>the first two sessions were great and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then after that I kind of hit a plateau </v>

39
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

40
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of felt like,</v>

41
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>just kinda like groggy for a not </v>
<v Speaker 1>kidding,</v>

42
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>like a couple months.</v>

43
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.023
<v Speaker 1>So the first session you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you get this positive benefit from </v>

44
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

45
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>they point in continuing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

47
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>the treatment is six sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the protocol,</v>

48
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>that's the protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

49
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.051
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

50
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:55.884
<v Speaker 1>I think I have video of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I have video switching and not </v>

51
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>even that if you're just in a basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>in like a hospital room.</v>

52
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the experience itself,</v>

53
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:07.614
<v Speaker 1>you said was full blown psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straight up fucking 100 percent </v>

54
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tripping balls.</v>

55
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>And this is all FDA approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

56
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.523
<v Speaker 1>it's FDA approved as an anesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not FDA approved at that actually </v>

57
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>know what and getting the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>

58
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>They're actually because otherwise I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be able to talk about it.</v>

59
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is approved as an off label a </v>

60
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>depression treatment off labels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tricky Shit,</v>

61
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

62
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

63
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

64
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's all of them in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with antidepressants.</v>

65
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:44.161
<v Speaker 1>It's all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

66
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>this might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might,</v>

67
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>could do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>

68
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.293
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's stuff that they can do to you </v>

69
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>that is definitely beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

70
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your insurance isn't gonna cover it.</v>

71
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>If you have the cash you can pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the situation I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like nobody</v>

73
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v Speaker 2>was going to pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to roll the dice and I </v>

74
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>rolled the dice and I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

75
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 2>do you think that if the initial </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatments that you had the first couple</v>

76
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 2>that you really had good responses from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just stop there,</v>

77
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 2>you'd have a different opinion of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

78
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had just done it once,</v>

79
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 2>it kind of felt like you ever do acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

80
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 2>You're not paying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like super clear feeling you get.</v>

81
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 2>That's how I felt the day I saw you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did ask him for the first time,</v>

82
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 2>like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say four months ago.</v>

83
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A months ago.</v>

84
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.000
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you think?</v>

85
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

86
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>You didn't find it too intense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

87
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it can be speedy as fuck.</v>

88
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm so used to edibles and float tanks.</v>

89
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I think it's,</v>

90
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very introspective.</v>

91
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 2>It was very clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

92
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind it,</v>

93
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

94
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feeling behind it,</v>

95
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:53.490
<v Speaker 2>the thought process behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

96
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like some mind clarifier.</v>

97
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:58.534
<v Speaker 2>Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to call it a squeegee and your </v>

99
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 2>third.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like mushrooms.</v>

100
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it felt,</v>

101
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.890
<v Speaker 2>it felt very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 2>clarifying if that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it makes total sense.</v>

103
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I felt great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt really good.</v>

104
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Felt really friendly during.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

105
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:17.314
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you must have had good stuff </v>

106
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.273
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of times it can be speedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it ends up feeling like mushrooms </v>

107
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 2>and I think my math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

108
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 2>combined?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

109
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.013
<v Speaker 2>And you end up with this just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>intense fucking is not the God damn </v>

110
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 2>problem is that it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting weird versions of it.</v>

111
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Here's your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the doctor put in the Ibmi arm.</v>

112
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>

113
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Just can I say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.553
<v Speaker 2>Oh Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you take this with the 19 eighties </v>

115
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:46.231
<v Speaker 2>phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

116
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way it's saved or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

117
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Why does it seem so little?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

118
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 2>This is blue bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's blown.</v>

119
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

120
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.540
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this doctor is,</v>

121
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.260
<v Speaker 2>it looked like in Ob Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ojs Council.</v>

122
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just lead counsel.</v>

123
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 2>You can corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

124
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just,</v>

125
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.340
<v Speaker 2>you just go into a regular doctor's </v>
<v Speaker 2>office and sticks this thing.</v>

126
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.980
<v Speaker 2>It's thing in your arm and off you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the doctor has,</v>

127
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 2>he tried it himself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

128
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:21.060
<v Speaker 2>he would not say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was said.</v>

129
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it with a wink that he had.</v>

130
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.553
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't comment either way on whether </v>

131
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:30.480
<v Speaker 2>I've done it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all those guys didn't want to keep it</v>

132
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:32.000
<v Speaker 2>on the sneak tip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

133
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.380
<v Speaker 2>But clearly he had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah.</v>

134
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:37.890
<v Speaker 2>So I would say for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first session was amazing.</v>

135
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:38.724
<v Speaker 2>That's when I saw you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after that it got a little </v>

136
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:41.694
<v Speaker 2>dicey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what does it feel like when you're </v>

137
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:45.450
<v Speaker 2>in it?</v>

138
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I was in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it felt like I was in a pod,</v>

139
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.530
<v Speaker 2>a pod in like a small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a small world after all,</v>

140
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:53.364
<v Speaker 2>like pod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going into the on now crossing arms </v>

141
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 2>and I would like a little boat just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going along through rooms and the rooms </v>

142
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.981
<v Speaker 2>I would say were designed like kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit like a,</v>

143
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a clockwork orange,</v>

144
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 2>but like the milk bar thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit like white walls,</v>

145
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.380
<v Speaker 2>white breathing walls and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing,</v>

146
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.953
<v Speaker 2>They were inhaling and exhaling and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was never freaked out and then </v>

148
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 2>there was like kind of digits on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Matrix.</v>

149
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 2>It had like a green hue to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

150
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 2>my biggest worry when I was in it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

151
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm so out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's an earthquake I'm fucked like</v>

152
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:42.394
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I would get like wide shots of </v>

153
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:44.744
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get wide shots of California and think </v>

154
00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:49.264
<v Speaker 2>about like the hospital crumbling and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then me trying to get out and going </v>

155
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go,</v>

156
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:54.944
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to have to go without </v>

157
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

158
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Give me 40 minutes and I'll catch up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys.</v>

159
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was my biggest worry,</v>

160
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part it was just like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly pleasant.</v>

161
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't get over the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this was happening in a doctor's office,</v>

162
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 2>just like a regular ass fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctorate,</v>

163
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 2>like literally waiting room with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>physicians and their patients,</v>

164
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:18.761
<v Speaker 2>old Weirdos met shitty magazines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you go in and you trip your fucking</v>

165
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 2>head off and so you're sitting in like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular chair.</v>

166
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

167
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a recliner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>double bed type thing.</v>

168
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:28.791
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real nice.</v>

169
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:29.624
<v Speaker 2>They spared no expense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're sitting in this craftmatic </v>

170
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 2>adjustable bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

171
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.923
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the needle in the arm and they </v>

172
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 2>leave it in there for how long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty,</v>

173
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 2>40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty minutes.</v>

174
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.173
<v Speaker 2>Now if an earthquake happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you just pull the needle out of </v>

175
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 2>your arm?</v>

176
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 2>And I was so out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could have.</v>

177
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I think once the drip happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's in you for awhile.</v>

178
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.330
<v Speaker 2>So what's the drift happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably have however long.</v>

179
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a 40 minute trip apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if it's based on one,</v>

180
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.793
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much is going in at </v>

181
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that stuff,</v>

182
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 2>ketamine is weird because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

183
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 2>it was a tranquilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

184
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:06.820
<v Speaker 2>For animals events also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

185
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.663
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

186
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 2>it's a horse tranquilizer and they use </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as an anesthesia for humans.</v>

187
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of that.</v>

188
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 2>The guy was an anesthesiologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

189
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't they use that in war time?</v>

190
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:18.674
<v Speaker 2>Because it's easy to carry around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe they have in war time because </v>

191
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 2>you can use very small amounts and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>puts people under,</v>

192
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 2>you know what that sounds like.</v>

193
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.400
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a Joe Rogan fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

194
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it sounds like.</v>

195
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

196
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:34.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that's the case.</v>

197
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I was listening to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

198
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:38.714
<v Speaker 2>whether you're talking about various </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of anesthesia and it sort of the </v>

199
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>evolution of using anesthesia and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketamine worked really good in the field</v>

200
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.773
<v Speaker 2>because you could have a very small </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount and you would put someone under </v>

201
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.570
<v Speaker 2>pretty deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what if it's local,</v>

202
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.291
<v Speaker 2>do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

203
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you could done surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like I couldn't feel myself.</v>

204
00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

205
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It was more like I had no interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

206
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 2>When you on here following FDA approval </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1970,</v>

207
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.153
<v Speaker 2>what did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Stesha was first given to American </v>

208
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 2>soldiers during the Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

209
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

210
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of shit on reddit about,</v>

211
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.250
<v Speaker 2>about it as an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an antidepressant treatment.</v>

212
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Frantic for depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for you,</v>

213
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you heard about this,</v>

214
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

215
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:25.494
<v Speaker 2>I want to say if you just google </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression treatments page two or </v>

216
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:32.830
<v Speaker 2>alternative depression treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably what I,</v>

217
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.010
<v Speaker 2>what I googled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've had these conversations before</v>

218
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.873
<v Speaker 2>you and I about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about depression and different </v>

219
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:40.920
<v Speaker 2>treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much exercise do you do?</v>

220
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Did we talk about this before amount?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've run probably three,</v>

221
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:46.080
<v Speaker 2>four days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty nice.</v>

222
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's supposed to be one of the best </v>

223
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:48.370
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

224
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.950
<v Speaker 2>depressions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio.</v>

225
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never gotten a runner's high.</v>

226
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

227
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.060
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a shortage of dopamine in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain.</v>

228
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.193
<v Speaker 2>Just naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just think I don't have a ton of </v>

229
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:00.654
<v Speaker 2>dough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't.</v>

230
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Joy is not a thing I think I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>

231
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.020
<v Speaker 2>What I repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joy is the thing that I don't think I've</v>

232
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:07.560
<v Speaker 2>ever experienced.</v>

233
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll experience adrenaline rushes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like ego,</v>

234
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.560
<v Speaker 2>but I'll never be truly like Julius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

235
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.010
<v Speaker 2>it stinks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>all the time when I'm not working or I'm</v>

292
00:12:29.501 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 2>not accomplishing anything or I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

293
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.540

<v Speaker 2>that a very,</v>

295
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:39.340
<v Speaker 2>very joyous guy told me when he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>injured,</v>

296

<v Speaker 2>he just takes it out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken,</v>

297
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 2>I've been injured a gang of times.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like if I'm not accomplishing things or </v>

302
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.890
<v Speaker 2>in the past I don't allow myself to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into those anymore because it's just not</v>

303
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 2>a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even,</v>

304
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even necessarily have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a career,</v>

305
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.693
<v Speaker 2>like oriented thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>doing yoga,</v>

308
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.230

311
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.370
<v Speaker 2>my brain for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs tasks,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this thing came out of which sky and out</v>

353
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:55.670
<v Speaker 2>of your shows you.</v>

354
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

355
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows you,</v>

356
00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

357
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that I,</v>

358
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 2>that I will say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

359
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.583
<v Speaker 2>that's a sense of euphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think in some ways I try to kind </v>

360
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 2>of contain it a little bit in that where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

361
00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

362
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:11.924
<v Speaker 2>Like with this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do with this </v>

363
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:14.144
<v Speaker 2>feeling because it's the kind of thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you just want to like go up and </v>

364
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:21.311
<v Speaker 2>kiss women and smack you on the ass and </v>
<v Speaker 2>would just fucking wrote a kid,</v>

365
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.070
<v Speaker 2>wrote a fucking closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

366
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

367
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.113
<v Speaker 2>like a musical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Hinchcliffe had this new joke and </v>

368
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:32.331
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did it.</v>

369
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:35.060
<v Speaker 2>He and he came off stage like right </v>
<v Speaker 2>after he didn't.</v>

370
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.150
<v Speaker 2>And he was literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fist pumping.</v>

371
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Like he was just so fired up because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed so fired up.</v>

372
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like he was charged with </v>
<v Speaker 2>electricity.</v>

373
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice when you can allow yourself </v>

374
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:50.220
<v Speaker 2>to just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

375
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.583
<v Speaker 2>And nobody gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it in a way that no one gets </v>

376
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:53.654
<v Speaker 2>jealous or feels like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your prenatal to hang out with better </v>

377
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:58.030
<v Speaker 2>people were hanging out with basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>

378
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the problem.</v>

379
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:00.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

380
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've all been there before too,</v>

381
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.283
<v Speaker 2>like the way things are going well and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hanging around with someone and </v>

382
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 2>they get super weird and creepy with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

383
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:08.920
<v Speaker 2>And they withdraw and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

384
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you get?</v>

385
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of like,</v>

386
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 2>what do you want me to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want me to fail?</v>

387
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.593
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that do definitely want </v>

388
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:16.694
<v Speaker 2>you to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they definitely don't want you </v>

389
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:19.760
<v Speaker 2>to do is highlight the fact that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not succeeding.</v>

390
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.571
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

391
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:25.400
<v Speaker 2>But that's what most people consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people consider your success.</v>

392
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.234
<v Speaker 2>They'll their failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a bizarre way of looking at </v>

393
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:28.850
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

394
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It's so common though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what evolutionary benefit does that</v>

395
00:16:33.081 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

396
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.590
<v Speaker 2>finite resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

397
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it just comes from there.</v>

398
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people go,</v>

399
00:16:41.071 --> 00:16:42.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's enough jobs for everyone.</v>

400
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.060
<v Speaker 2>You and I both know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

401
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 2>there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

402
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.963
<v Speaker 2>There's enough jobs for talented people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't feel like you're </v>

403
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:51.470
<v Speaker 2>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you are fucking.</v>

404
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Panicked all the time.</v>

405
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.793
<v Speaker 2>And then it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a self fulfilling prophecy because </v>

406
00:16:57.291 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 2>that sort of famine thinking is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad for progress.</v>

407
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.863
<v Speaker 2>If you are a person who's really worried</v>
<v Speaker 2>about other people getting things and </v>

408
00:17:05.811 --> 00:17:08.870
<v Speaker 2>you start thinking in a jealous man or </v>
<v Speaker 2>about other people's success,</v>

409
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.050
<v Speaker 2>that fucks up your own ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>express yourself.</v>

410
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that fucks up your ability to </v>

411
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 2>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how it hits you.</v>

412
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be a motivator,</v>

413
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:18.880
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

414
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.120
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you're like,</v>

415
00:17:20.121 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got it.</v>

416
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get whatever that is,</v>

417
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.633
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to kind of wrestle it into a </v>

418
00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 2>positive way because if you get upset at</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else got something,</v>

419
00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:36.740
<v Speaker 2>then usually it's a bitter motivator and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't lend itself to success,</v>

420
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.300
<v Speaker 2>but I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

421
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever had something </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was like,</v>

422
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 2>this should have been mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

423
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Like one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had that where it was like</v>

424
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.650
<v Speaker 2>a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

425
00:17:46.651 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely when I was younger for sure.</v>

426
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>What sorts of things were they?</v>

427
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure looking back to their absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absurd things that I didn't deserve.</v>

428
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.133
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone else getting a television </v>

429
00:17:56.461 --> 00:18:01.461
<v Speaker 3>show or someone else headlining a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain place and it's for comics.</v>

430
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 3>There really is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a finite situation.</v>

431
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's a limited amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of resources.</v>

432
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.233
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different clubs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different topics and </v>

433
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:13.380
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

434
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:14.214
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics are so ruthless when it comes to </v>

435
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:17.904
<v Speaker 3>plagiarism because like say if you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a really unique idea and this idea is </v>

436
00:18:22.261 --> 00:18:23.094
<v Speaker 3>come to you from the universe when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sketching it out and putting it </v>

437
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:29.340
<v Speaker 3>together and some fucker comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sees this and says,</v>

438
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:30.203
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

439
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.043
<v Speaker 3>I can</v>

440
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.030
<v Speaker 1>bad jokes as interventions and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

441
00:18:34.031 --> 00:18:38.080
<v Speaker 1>you stole my fucking invention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my invention dude.</v>

442
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:39.123
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't my inventions or word </v>
<v Speaker 1>inventions or premise inventions or </v>

443
00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:43.720
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

444
00:18:43.721 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 1>so it's intellectual property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.600
<v Speaker 1>like you know that that's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to steal it is,</v>

446
00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.500
<v Speaker 1>is worse than plagiarism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like copyright infringement.</v>

447
00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

448
00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:55.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

449
00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unforgivable.</v>

450
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 3>It also cuts in and creates that weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive finite resources mentality.</v>

451
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.400
<v Speaker 3>It creates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creates like a mind fuck because then</v>

452
00:19:09.401 --> 00:19:11.380
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you start thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

453
00:19:11.381 --> 00:19:12.214
<v Speaker 3>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not like a community of </v>

454
00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:17.350
<v Speaker 3>likeminded people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're supporting each other.</v>

455
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.410
<v Speaker 3>There's like some parasites in here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>

456
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.430
<v Speaker 3>some vampires</v>

457
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.470
<v Speaker 1>with different standards because we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less have,</v>

458
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's learned in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy community or,</v>

459
00:19:28.451 --> 00:19:30.530
<v Speaker 1>or we all come into it with certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>

460
00:19:30.531 --> 00:19:34.640
<v Speaker 1>but there is that thing of like there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an acceptable,</v>

461
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.700
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's almost like not closing with a</v>

462
00:19:37.701 --> 00:19:41.250
<v Speaker 1>super dirty joke if the person after you</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a dirty comic,</v>

463
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.340
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's just certain you care about</v>

464
00:19:43.341 --> 00:19:43.820
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

465
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.653
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

466
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.810
<v Speaker 1>There's certain unwritten rules that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>

467
00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

468
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.123
<v Speaker 1>That you don't want to fuck people over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when somebody else does some </v>

469
00:19:51.051 --> 00:19:53.480
<v Speaker 1>shit like that and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

470
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way I've thought of it,</v>

471
00:19:56.871 --> 00:19:58.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like one was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one.</v>

472
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously it's the worst and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unforgivable.</v>

473
00:20:00.591 --> 00:20:02.930
<v Speaker 1>But like I've had people steal shit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

474
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to happen,</v>

475
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.810
<v Speaker 3>but it fucks up the best part about </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup,</v>

476
00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.913
<v Speaker 3>like last night at the store was hanging</v>
<v Speaker 3>around with a stand hope and Michael </v>

477
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:15.910
<v Speaker 3>costs and all these guys and we're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing and hanging around.</v>

478
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a cool concept.</v>

479
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lately,</v>

480
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.103
<v Speaker 1>Michael Cost has been like hit his </v>
<v Speaker 1>stride that the kind of jokes he's </v>

481
00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:24.730
<v Speaker 1>writing are fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very Funny Guy and really nice guy too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

483
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.910
<v Speaker 1>But that place is filled with that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cool comradery.</v>

484
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the point to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

485
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's really like the fun of it.</v>

486
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

487

<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

490
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.040

<v Speaker 1>favorite part of it and it's,</v>

491
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.680
<v Speaker 2>there's no close second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not money.</v>

492
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:51.514

523
00:21:56.831 --> 00:21:59.750
<v Speaker 2>to the store and by validating it and </v>

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.810
<v Speaker 2>your fans go and then it's like a self </v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

530
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.840

<v Speaker 2>Montreal.</v>

531
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.873
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the part that was in the belly </v>

532
00:22:15.851 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 2>room or they feel they did a special </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't watch.</v>

534
00:22:20.931 --> 00:22:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Montreal and it hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really great.</v>

535
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.260
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the relative may get Ralphie.</v>

536
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I heard he took a beating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got.</v>

537
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he saw us.</v>

538
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.093
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an entire career flashed in front </v>

539
00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:37.921
<v Speaker 2>of his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what do you expect when you're doing</v>

540
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 2>a row?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

541
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:39.843
<v Speaker 2>I know if I do a roast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to fucking kill me on </v>

542
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle repeatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

543
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:46.330
<v Speaker 2>So on now I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

544
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:49.730
<v Speaker 2>let's judge this level of how hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to hit a.</v>

545
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 2>So Ravi got hit on a weight joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is weight in his divorce,</v>

546
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:55.630
<v Speaker 2>his family.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Family like left him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's fat.</v>

550
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depressed.</v>

551
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.940
<v Speaker 2>And then someone just kept teeing off on</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

552
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Who is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roasted A.</v>

553
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 2>wasn't Mike Lawrence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Lawrence.</v>

00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Who one is really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

555
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.270

<v Speaker 2>But apparently Ralph,</v>

556
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 2>he just didn't take it so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

557
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm happy to take a swing at him.</v>

558
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that close?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

559
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had that even on tv it was that </v>

560
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:26.860
<v Speaker 2>feeling of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

561
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:27.694
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see this going to go in a </v>

562
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:30.740
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

563
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say that to people.</v>

564
00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make money.</v>

565
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't want anybody saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me.</v>

566
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:38.014
<v Speaker 2>That's going to make me feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a zoom in on Ralphie's face and </v>

567
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:42.670
<v Speaker 2>you as you're watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

568
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:47.671
<v Speaker 2>did they zoom in or designs zoom in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>zoom in or did they do that?</v>

569
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 2>There is a god damn brutal show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

570
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 2>But good for comedy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good format.</v>

571
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.423
<v Speaker 2>It's a cool format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a new format and they </v>

572
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.183
<v Speaker 2>joke writer format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's fair and he's like </v>

573
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.660
<v Speaker 2>literally just like head to head and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewards good joke.</v>

574
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.513
<v Speaker 2>They laugh at the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like a Madison Square </v>

575
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say people know basketball.</v>

576
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:17.180
<v Speaker 2>They're like NBA players say people know</v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball.</v>

577
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Like they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it feels at the roast battle.</v>

578
00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Like people know comedy and they reward </v>
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>

579
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 2>high level of difficulty jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

580
00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

581
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.823
<v Speaker 2>And also I think one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rose pedals really good for comedy is </v>

582
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 2>it's pushing the boundaries of </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable jokes.</v>

583
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a weird time where people </v>

584
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Speaker 2>are fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

585
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:39.403
<v Speaker 2>this whole idea about punching up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much horseshit involved in </v>

586
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 2>like what is and is not acceptable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up today.</v>

587
00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

588
00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.093
<v Speaker 2>it's a bunch of people that are trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to control behavior and thinking and </v>

589
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.143
<v Speaker 2>that just doesn't fly in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the pushback like what Bros battle </v>

590
00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 2>is the pushback to this pc era that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in right now.</v>

591
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:05.170
<v Speaker 2>If they could prove to me that joking </v>
<v Speaker 2>leads to action,</v>

592
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.170
<v Speaker 2>I would pay more attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

593
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Like isn't right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they could say,</v>

594
00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:12.374
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler made a lot of jokes about </v>

595
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.923
<v Speaker 2>invading Australia before you used to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of bits about Austria and then </v>

596
00:25:19.161 --> 00:25:22.790
<v Speaker 2>eventually he brought the hammer down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you could prove some sort of,</v>

597
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.890
<v Speaker 2>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

598
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.040
<v Speaker 2>the A and B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plus b equals c,</v>

599
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:28.821
<v Speaker 2>then yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's like,</v>

600
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:29.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>

601
00:25:29.781 --> 00:25:34.340
<v Speaker 2>but you also know that that racism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit is like.</v>

602
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.400
<v Speaker 2>It ain't about joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about like a,</v>

603
00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 2>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times it's about poverty.</v>

604
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 2>It's class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so many other things that aren't,</v>

605
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.630
<v Speaker 2>that aren't necessarily comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

606
00:25:44.631 --> 00:25:46.730
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even poverty of ideas.</v>

607
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a thought process.</v>

608
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's poor thing.</v>

609
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:51.023
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

610
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what racism really is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what jokes are,</v>

611
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:55.370
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

612
00:25:55.371 --> 00:25:59.900
<v Speaker 2>that there's a certain amount of racism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you play on it and there's a,</v>

613
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:00.734
<v Speaker 2>there's a wink as you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a joke form and there's some </v>

614
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:06.284
<v Speaker 2>racist shit that people can say to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and that joke battle of the roast </v>

615
00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.690
<v Speaker 2>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is fucking hilarious.</v>

616
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

617
00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.493
<v Speaker 2>There were black people can't swim to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 off the fucking tons of </v>

618
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Perez and Sarah Tiana.</v>

619
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 2>We're roasting and Sarah Tiana was </v>
<v Speaker 2>roasting him about Sarah.</v>

620
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:23.174
<v Speaker 2>Tiana is insanely good at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like one of those things where </v>

621
00:26:26.511 --> 00:26:28.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like someone can talk real fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>summary.</v>

622
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.403
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know you could do this </v>

623
00:26:30.231 --> 00:26:31.064
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like double jointed or something </v>

624
00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:33.081
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

625
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:35.150
<v Speaker 2>what you can do there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do the splits.</v>

626
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:35.983
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes off even crazier because she's </v>

627
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:43.300
<v Speaker 2>so sweet and she's got this smiling face</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe yes.</v>

628
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.630
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there is no hatred in her.</v>

629
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.730
<v Speaker 2>In her roast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

630
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she knows.</v>

631
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 2>She knows where the soft spots are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where she sticks.</v>

632
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 2>The blade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did she came in second?</v>

633
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:57.300
<v Speaker 2>She almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just kind of ran out of steam.</v>

634
00:26:57.301 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Like she just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was later.</v>

635
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.043
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of jokes.</v>

636
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>

637
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:03.270
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she,</v>

638
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 2>she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah,</v>

639
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.943
<v Speaker 2>congrats to Sarah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Hinchcliffe did it with a suit of </v>

640
00:27:07.741 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 2>armor on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

641
00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:14.370
<v Speaker 2>And would have won but fucked up his </v>
<v Speaker 2>last joke.</v>

642
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was really close and his last </v>
<v Speaker 2>job was a clunker.</v>

643
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I think his first joke in his last joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hence is good at that shit too.</v>

644
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really good at it.</v>

645
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.190
<v Speaker 2>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cliff is mean.</v>

646
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.293
<v Speaker 2>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows that a certain guy that he </v>

647
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.790
<v Speaker 2>means what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's up there.</v>

648
00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:34.510
<v Speaker 2>He's doing a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>

649
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.950
<v Speaker 2>He's doing a documentary about his </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

650
00:27:37.951 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not a lot of like there's art to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

651
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:40.171
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

652
00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:42.150
<v Speaker 2>this is all based on a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

653
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm just happy that comedy central </v>
<v Speaker 2>is taken.</v>

654
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:45.923
<v Speaker 2>That's a big chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've taken quite a few big </v>

655
00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:51.420
<v Speaker 2>chances recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think with Ari Shadow Arusha fear</v>

656
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:52.680
<v Speaker 2>show this is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

657
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.040
<v Speaker 2>That was a big chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

658
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.750
<v Speaker 2>That show is really racy really out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

659
00:27:57.751 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Some of the stories are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely outrageous.</v>

660
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.040
<v Speaker 2>So they've got that and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking chances with this as well.</v>

661
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.941
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

662
00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:08.580
<v Speaker 2>it's off the beaten path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new thing.</v>

663
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.090
<v Speaker 2>This is not like another guy's doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk show.</v>

664
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.953
<v Speaker 2>Oh Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're following the sort of </v>

665
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.340
<v Speaker 2>what's working alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

666
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.650
<v Speaker 2>And smartly going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we televise it,</v>

667
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.443
<v Speaker 2>because the truth about comedy central </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the ratings are so bad at this point </v>

668
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.420
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relative to what they were,</v>

669
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.300
<v Speaker 2>that I think they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kent Alterman just going like,</v>

670
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that.</v>

671
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:32.843
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And leaving shows on that are not </v>

672
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 2>particularly highly rated because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>likes it.</v>

673
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.870
<v Speaker 2>If they do that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the right way to go.</v>

674
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 2>If they just find what people actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy that like,</v>

675
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.183
<v Speaker 2>like la right now has a comedy scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big comedy scenes and roast battle is </v>

676
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:49.430
<v Speaker 2>one of the highlights of the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>scene.</v>

677
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Everybody goes to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man last night.</v>

678
00:28:51.691 --> 00:28:54.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a fucking line like Rosebelle </v>
<v Speaker 2>start at midnight.</v>

679
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:55.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got there at 10 and the line was </v>

680
00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:59.280
<v Speaker 2>already around the fucking outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

681
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.233
<v Speaker 2>patio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the store all waiting to get in because </v>

682
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>I think people didn't know about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>until this week.</v>

683
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Literally the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>

684
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That definitely had an impact,</v>

685
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to see.</v>

686
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

687
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.050
<v Speaker 2>It's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

688
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.020
<v Speaker 2>it's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

689
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking,</v>

690
00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.350
<v Speaker 2>there's a little goddamn justice right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

691
00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:17.184
<v Speaker 2>Like a funny thing that people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing live and I think like famous </v>

692
00:29:20.971 --> 00:29:22.260
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>judges helps,</v>

693
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.960
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny to watch.</v>

694
00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to watch these people go head </v>
<v Speaker 2>to head.</v>

695
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.390
<v Speaker 2>I heard the Whoopi Goldberg was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

696
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 2>she was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you making that face?</v>

697
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would agree.</v>

698
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.780
<v Speaker 2>A wifi was never like a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

699
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will people was a comic.</v>

700
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.050
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't really real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not like a club comics.</v>

701
00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

702
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:51.280
<v Speaker 2>to me she did that one woman show which </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in a theater was not stand up.</v>

703
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:52.443
<v Speaker 2>And then she did comic relief where she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was doing a monologue with two other </v>

704
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:55.390
<v Speaker 2>dudes.</v>

705
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure she did comedy clubs to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

706
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well pretty sure I saw her.</v>

707
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes Joe things pass you by and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain certain shit.</v>

708
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.163
<v Speaker 2>It's like you kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she was going back and forth with </v>

709
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Jessalyn neck and she just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have Oscars.</v>

710
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

711
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:14.494
<v Speaker 2>all the shit I got and jasmine was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of shit from the eighties was </v>

712
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:20.500
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that doesn't make you funny either.</v>

713
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.251
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

714
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:21.911
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

715
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:22.630

717
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 2>because it not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite of being funny.</v>

718
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Like talking about your accomplishments </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the opposite of like a good comeback.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got muscly head</v>

825
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:46.060
<v Speaker 4>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My fucking head.</v>

826
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:50.070
<v Speaker 4>He things my head is power lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

827
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.160
<v Speaker 4>they did this cat scan on marvelous </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marvin Hagler,</v>

828
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:55.643
<v Speaker 4>Marvin Hagler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was one of the greatest boxers of </v>

829
00:34:56.881 --> 00:34:57.714
<v Speaker 4>all time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had very large muscles around his </v>

830
00:35:01.771 --> 00:35:05.190
<v Speaker 4>temples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like extraordinarily large,</v>

831
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.340
<v Speaker 4>like not just a little bit bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody else's,</v>

832
00:35:08.341 --> 00:35:11.730
<v Speaker 4>but like two or three times larger than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the average person.</v>

833
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.510
<v Speaker 4>Like essentially you get to see it</v>

834
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:14.441
<v Speaker 1>feigns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

835
00:35:14.441 --> 00:35:16.660
<v Speaker 1>He had like thick veins that I remember.</v>

836
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had headgear.</v>

837
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.710
<v Speaker 4>He essentially had muscle head gear </v>
<v Speaker 4>around his temples,</v>

838
00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 4>like in the side of his head and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>

839
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:25.064
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they didn't know if this was </v>

840
00:35:26.931 --> 00:35:31.700
<v Speaker 4>something that was developed from years </v>
<v Speaker 4>of biting down on a mouthpiece and there</v>

841
00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.490
<v Speaker 4>was a lot of guys that did a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different exercises.</v>

842
00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:38.400
<v Speaker 4>Further jaw itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember Gerry Cooney had a thing</v>

843
00:35:38.401 --> 00:35:40.130
<v Speaker 4>that he put in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a,</v>

844
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:45.710
<v Speaker 4>like a thick rubber cable that had like </v>
<v Speaker 4>electrical tape wrapped around it and he</v>

845
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 4>would bite down on it.</v>

846
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:49.483
<v Speaker 2>You know what's funny about 15 weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his jaw is that shit doesn't make you </v>

847
00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:55.700
<v Speaker 2>fear the guy a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll use fucking tape bro.</v>

848
00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.260
<v Speaker 2>He don't give a fuck bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen Bro.</v>

849
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.280
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me show you guys.</v>

850
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.270
<v Speaker 4>They were actually lifting weights with </v>
<v Speaker 4>their jaw,</v>

851
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.870
<v Speaker 4>which makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could power lift with your jaw.</v>

852
00:36:08.871 --> 00:36:11.150
<v Speaker 4>Some guys chewed gum too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing they would do.</v>

853
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.283
<v Speaker 4>They'd get like a stack of Bazooka </v>
<v Speaker 4>bubble gum and it turns into cement </v>

854
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:16.733
<v Speaker 4>after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chew it for a couple minutes and they </v>

855
00:36:17.451 --> 00:36:18.350
<v Speaker 4>just take that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

856
00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.453
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which totally makes sense because if </v>

857
00:36:23.991 --> 00:36:24.824
<v Speaker 4>your jaw is loose and weak and if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at guys with big jaws like a guy </v>

858
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:30.203
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

859
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.290
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ball on your jaw.</v>

860
00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna fucking,</v>

861
00:36:35.031 --> 00:36:37.970
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to believe how strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how like rough.</v>

862
00:36:37.971 --> 00:36:40.910
<v Speaker 2>And like I have a knot in my journal </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

863
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just not a ton but enough to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>by.</v>

864
00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Do what you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

865
00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.093
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spots whenever I get a massage and then </v>

866
00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:54.080
<v Speaker 2>they work your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get so excited.</v>

867
00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:57.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my head feels so good.</v>

868
00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Daughter was rubbing my head the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

869
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.530
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does this feel good?</v>

870
00:37:00.531 --> 00:37:02.090
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually that feels really good.</v>

871
00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.820
<v Speaker 2>And you immediately become an eight year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old boy.</v>

872
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.300
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feels?</v>

873
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels good.</v>

874
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.843
<v Speaker 4>It's an area like your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it feels good to get your feet </v>

875
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:18.750
<v Speaker 4>rubbed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels good to get your hands rub.</v>

876
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.130
<v Speaker 4>You ever get your hands massage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

877
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.650
<v Speaker 4>You would think that enhanced nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll feel good.</v>

878
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 4>Like you shake someone's hand and </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't feel anything,</v>

879
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 4>but if someone like rubs your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start pulling your fingers and make</v>

880
00:37:28.171 --> 00:37:29.004
<v Speaker 4>them pop and stuff and they massage your</v>
<v Speaker 4>palms and the tips of your fingers and </v>

881
00:37:33.571 --> 00:37:38.400
<v Speaker 4>all the little connective muscles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the tissue in between the fingers.</v>

882
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 4>It feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

883
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 4>I need to get a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't gotten a massage forever.</v>

884
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:44.143
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You strike me as a guy that would get a </v>

885
00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:46.530
<v Speaker 4>massage three days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We used to get them all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's been a month at least.</v>

887
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe more.</v>

888
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Maybe two months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got them all the time,</v>

889

892

<v Speaker 2>my muscle.</v>

<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

910
00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:32.604
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of my life I felt like I had </v>

911
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.733
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

912
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like a,</v>

913
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.740
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing like a,</v>

914
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.653
<v Speaker 1>it almost felt like a metal weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bit of like five pound weight on </v>

915
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:47.500
<v Speaker 1>my upper left forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My left.</v>

916
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:51.670
<v Speaker 1>And then so I went to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa dude,</v>

917
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.390
<v Speaker 1>that sound is like an Mri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds.</v>

918
00:38:55.391 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

919
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.341
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

920
00:38:57.341 --> 00:38:59.920
<v Speaker 1>It's basically the same exact magnet as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an MRI,</v>

921
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's just made your day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

922
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 1>they put it on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty simple.</v>

923
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.880
<v Speaker 1>The first time they measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to get to like the exact spot.</v>

924
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another video where my finger is</v>

925
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 1>pulsing that you'll enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is it doing to you?</v>

926
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the benefit?</v>

927
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.343
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically magnetizing and </v>

928
00:39:16.781 --> 00:39:17.614
<v Speaker 1>electrifying a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's waking up basically did a synopsis </v>

929
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 1>according to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

930
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

931
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.230
<v Speaker 1>it's waking up dead synapses and waking </v>
<v Speaker 1>up dead.</v>

932
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Waking them up so they're dormant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

933
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even look into it.</v>

934
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.510
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shoot me on.</v>

935
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it can I do?</v>

936
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.830
<v Speaker 5>And this where I don't have kid man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like,</v>

937
00:39:44.831 --> 00:39:45.700
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit.</v>

938
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.560
<v Speaker 5>Whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it's going to cost me.</v>

939
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:48.394
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you had kids you think you wouldn't </v>

940
00:39:49.661 --> 00:39:50.494
<v Speaker 5>do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

941
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.840
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

942
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of more,</v>

943
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.780
<v Speaker 1>more cautious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

944
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.820
<v Speaker 1>probably because I'm not like reckless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>

945
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do recently.</v>

946
00:40:03.621 --> 00:40:06.060
<v Speaker 1>It's also vague anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the research.</v>

947
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:06.900
<v Speaker 1>It's also like,</v>

948
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.140
<v Speaker 5>I think it does this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most antidepressants they know.</v>

949
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:13.620
<v Speaker 5>They think they know what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't actually know.</v>

950
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird one.</v>

951
00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you think about how many people are</v>

952
00:40:17.851 --> 00:40:22.851
<v Speaker 5>prescribed these things and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really a direct understanding of how</v>

953
00:40:23.371 --> 00:40:24.870
<v Speaker 5>it impacts each.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Each person.</v>

954
00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.070
<v Speaker 5>Like they'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

955
00:40:26.071 --> 00:40:28.890
<v Speaker 5>we'll try this medication and if it </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't work we'll try another one.</v>

956
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.823
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does this one work will just cycle </v>

957
00:40:30.631 --> 00:40:32.940
<v Speaker 5>through it and now how do you know if </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's working for you?</v>

958
00:40:32.941 --> 00:40:33.774
<v Speaker 5>Or if you're having a good time in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>life and so you're feeling better </v>

959
00:40:37.141 --> 00:40:37.974
<v Speaker 5>because maybe you started a new </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship and a new job and it's </v>

960
00:40:40.261 --> 00:40:42.230
<v Speaker 5>going well and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a.</v>

961
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.073
<v Speaker 5>everything seems pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was on medications that made me </v>

962
00:40:45.391 --> 00:40:47.940
<v Speaker 5>nauseous for a year and a half before I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

963
00:40:47.941 --> 00:40:48.774
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I literally thought I was nauseous </v>

964
00:40:50.761 --> 00:40:54.330
<v Speaker 5>because I was eating too many lifesavers</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not even fucking kidding.</v>

965
00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:55.231
<v Speaker 5>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

966
00:40:55.231 --> 00:40:56.064
<v Speaker 5>I gotta take it easy on these life </v>
<v Speaker 5>savers because every night I throw up </v>

967
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.610
<v Speaker 5>all the way to the laugh factory and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then I realized like,</v>

968
00:41:02.611 --> 00:41:03.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Neil,</v>

969
00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.270
<v Speaker 5>you're taking a pretty high dosage of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Zoloft.</v>

970
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.130
<v Speaker 5>You might want to just take it down a </v>
<v Speaker 5>notch.</v>

971
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:13.200
<v Speaker 5>That zoloft stuff is supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>really weird for your discerning of what</v>

972
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.020
<v Speaker 5>matters and what doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

973
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.373
<v Speaker 5>like it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never done it so it's hard for me </v>

974
00:41:19.741 --> 00:41:20.700
<v Speaker 5>to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

975
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.653
<v Speaker 5>the people that I've talked to that have</v>
<v Speaker 5>done it and said one of the issues that </v>

976
00:41:23.911 --> 00:41:28.911
<v Speaker 5>they had with it is nothing had the bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>things didn't feel bad anymore.</v>

977
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.190
<v Speaker 5>But the good things didn't feel good </v>
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>

978
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a lot</v>

979
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 1>of antidepressants is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they raised the,</v>

980
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.120
<v Speaker 1>the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

981
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.740
<v Speaker 1>and they also lowered the ceiling so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>

982
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:45.530
<v Speaker 1>it narrows your band of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a witch.</v>

983
00:41:45.531 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 1>But if you're severely depressed it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be very,</v>

984
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.883
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ketamine apparently is a lifesaver </v>

985
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:55.750
<v Speaker 1>truly for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may start administering it in a,</v>

986
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.090
<v Speaker 1>in emergency rooms for suicide cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

987
00:41:59.091 --> 00:42:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it does,</v>

988
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:01.790
<v Speaker 1>it's dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>

989
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a hallucinogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

990
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:07.700
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogens will make you like see </v>
<v Speaker 1>things differently.</v>

991
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:10.480
<v Speaker 1>So they're starting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

992
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.460
<v Speaker 1>there at least they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>administering it as a,</v>

993
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.383
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of almost like a whatever that </v>

994
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.910
<v Speaker 1>drug is that you can do almost like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Epi pen for,</v>

995
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.773
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

996
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:24.950
<v Speaker 1>for suicide or suicide thought thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers.</v>

997
00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to do it.</v>

998
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

999
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.963
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

1000
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.280
<v Speaker 1>so the tms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcranial magnetic stimulation,</v>

1001
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.560
<v Speaker 1>half an hour of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that debt,</v>

1002
00:42:33.561 --> 00:42:34.490
<v Speaker 1>that debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that debt,</v>

1003
00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:37.430
<v Speaker 1>the debt doesn't feel like much.</v>

1004
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Feels like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Shitty Woodpecker,</v>

1005
00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.020
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking sleepy woodpecker is sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of going at your head.</v>

1006
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:45.920
<v Speaker 1>But you're not like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1010
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:53.930
<v Speaker 1>and how many times are you supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it?</v>

1012
00:42:56.421 --> 00:42:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four zero times half an hour.</v>

1013
00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.100
<v Speaker 1>And how deep are you in right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

1014

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1015
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I did all 40 in the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1020
00:43:18.861 --> 00:43:22.870
<v Speaker 1>that has worked best for me better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketamine if way but better than them.</v>

1021
00:43:22.871 --> 00:43:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Zoloft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better than I was on a.</v>

<v Speaker 1>reuptake inhibitor.</v>

1024
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1025
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.110
<v Speaker 1>and went off at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this magnet shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're off everything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And you feel great.</v>

1029
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just no joy.</v>

1030
00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no joy,</v>

1031
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what never had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't lose nothing.</v>

1032
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I just look at you kids have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be over here.</v>

1033
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not.</v>

1034
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not miserable and I'm not also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no physical manifestation.</v>

1035
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:56.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1036
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head thing,</v>

1037
00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.380
<v Speaker 1>the feeling like there was a plate on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1038
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Getting rid of that was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1039
00:44:03.321 --> 00:44:04.154
<v Speaker 1>really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say like a plate on your </v>

1040
00:44:05.751 --> 00:44:07.860
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was a pressure or.</v>

1041
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a little weight,</v>

1042
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.430
<v Speaker 1>a little weight and a little pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever when I want that in there?</v>

1043
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.533
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there were times where I'd go </v>

1044
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:16.604
<v Speaker 1>off of antidepressants and I have my jaw</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles and muscles in my temple would </v>

1045
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:25.750
<v Speaker 1>be so tight that I need to use like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massager well on them.</v>

1046
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.090
<v Speaker 1>So I knew that there was all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all sort of connected.</v>

1047
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1048
00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Ding on his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty sure that my thing,</v>

1049
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 1>unless it's me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've been brown have been me bro.</v>

1050
00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It was your thing fuck up there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1051
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a big one.</v>

1052
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.430
<v Speaker 1>That was really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I did a,</v>

1053
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.280
<v Speaker 1>it was in New York for a couple months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that show three mix,</v>

1054
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 1>which I think I talked to the premise </v>
<v Speaker 1>the you told me,</v>

1055
00:44:56.611 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 1>but tell say it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the premise is onstage,</v>

1056
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:02.670
<v Speaker 1>I put three Mikes equidistant apart from</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

1057
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:04.103
<v Speaker 1>One is for stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is for one liners that I just </v>

1058
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:08.874
<v Speaker 1>couldn't fit anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one is for true sort of </v>

1059
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 1>emotional confession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any type shit,</v>

1060
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.070
<v Speaker 1>talking about depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about shit with my dad.</v>

1061
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.233
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't spoil the surprise but pretty </v>

1062
00:45:25.771 --> 00:45:29.400
<v Speaker 1>heavy shit between me and my dad when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>died or right before he died.</v>

1063
00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:30.723
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the second monologue is about </v>

1064
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of about like celebrity and,</v>

1065
00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dealing with,</v>

1066
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:39.043
<v Speaker 1>with the having a partner and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking up and become my own guy and </v>

1067
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:44.110
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1068
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.120
<v Speaker 1>so it's basically like it ends up being </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 40 minutes of stand up 45,</v>

1069
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:54.000
<v Speaker 1>stand up in a half hour of true stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then five minutes of one liners.</v>

1070
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.910
<v Speaker 1>And did you do it after you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>completed your treatment?</v>

1071
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1072
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I did it after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:01.284
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle of it I actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped taking everything and it in the </v>

1074
00:46:03.271 --> 00:46:05.800
<v Speaker 1>middle of recording or inactive in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of nowhere,</v>

1075
00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:06.643
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had had an eight week run I think in </v>

1076
00:46:08.971 --> 00:46:09.804
<v Speaker 1>New York and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I stopped everything in the middle </v>

1077
00:46:13.201 --> 00:46:14.910
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like suddenly just like,</v>

1078
00:46:14.911 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1079
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1080
00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:18.294
<v Speaker 1>what were the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference when you get off </v>

1081
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:21.144
<v Speaker 1>medication?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the difference in the way your </v>

1082
00:46:23.311 --> 00:46:24.144
<v Speaker 1>brain was functioning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can almost tell how well my brain's </v>

1083
00:46:28.231 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 1>functioning if I'm not depressed or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowed down by depression.</v>

1084
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:33.743
<v Speaker 1>My associations are much quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're just like the simplest </v>

1085
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:38.694
<v Speaker 1>thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy looks like so and so like a </v>

1086
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:43.230
<v Speaker 1>sort of a little rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little,</v>

1087
00:46:43.231 --> 00:46:45.550
<v Speaker 1>like what is that shirt fucking looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the kind of shirt.</v>

1088
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm not depressed I can think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those quickly.</v>

1089
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm depressed,</v>

1090
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.610
<v Speaker 1>there were times where I'd get </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression would affect my memory.</v>

1091
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't remember the,</v>

1092
00:46:55.841 --> 00:46:56.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1093
00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.433
<v Speaker 1>the test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would always do my head is there's a </v>

1094
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:00.024
<v Speaker 1>guy who directed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone with the wind and the wizard of Oz </v>

1095
00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 1>back to back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

1096
00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would try to remember his name.</v>

1097
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:08.963
<v Speaker 1>His name is Victor Fleming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I was depressed I couldn't </v>

1098
00:47:11.281 --> 00:47:12.114
<v Speaker 1>remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it affects your fucking a resource </v>

1099
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:16.584
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your brain is so concentrating on </v>

1100
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 1>the depression and feeling like shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't have the resources.</v>

1101
00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1102
00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I tend to think it's more a dead synapse</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and I think it's A.</v>

1103
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.123
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think depression is a lack of energy </v>

1104
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:34.720
<v Speaker 1>in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in maybe you're right,</v>

1105
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:36.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all going to one place,</v>

1106
00:47:36.851 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 1>but that's my own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of it.</v>

1107
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Well that makes sense in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that way,</v>

1108
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:42.243
<v Speaker 1>in that definition that a aerobic </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise would benefit people that have </v>

1109
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:45.994
<v Speaker 1>depression because they say that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly running and a long form or </v>

1110
00:47:50.481 --> 00:47:51.314
<v Speaker 1>will be exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does something to stimulate brain </v>

1111
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:57.590
<v Speaker 1>growth and brain function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also say like x,</v>

1112
00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.473
<v Speaker 1>if you want to remember something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a thing last week or two we </v>

1113
00:48:00.281 --> 00:48:01.114
<v Speaker 1>feel about memory where if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should study then exercise and </v>

1114
00:48:07.871 --> 00:48:09.340
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a better memory.</v>

1115
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll remember this shit.</v>

1116
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:14.470
<v Speaker 1>You had your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you studied for me,</v>

1117
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:17.500
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like physically writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something down with a pen.</v>

1118
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something to that too,</v>

1119
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:23.080
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where you see it because it is like</v>

1120
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:25.900
<v Speaker 1>two senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hearing it in your head.</v>

1121
00:48:25.901 --> 00:48:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It's three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hearing them in your head,</v>

1122
00:48:27.311 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing with your eyes and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually physically forming the thoughts</v>

1123
00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.373
<v Speaker 1>and I actually do say the words out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I write something down like a </v>

1124
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:38.230
<v Speaker 1>slave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it like write it down.</v>

1125
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.870
<v Speaker 1>You've got like and then like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>illiterate person you'll be like.</v>

1126
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:41.723
<v Speaker 1>And then we were allowed to ride a bike </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I went to the va that no </v>

1127
00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:52.083
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to keep them from getting </v>

1128
00:48:53.411 --> 00:48:54.760
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I had the thought yesterday.</v>

1129
00:48:54.761 --> 00:48:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Black people probably didn't wear </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeglasses until they didn't.</v>

1130
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:59.650
<v Speaker 1>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't.</v>

1131
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.090
<v Speaker 1>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1132
00:49:01.091 --> 00:49:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody intends to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not bifocals.</v>

1133
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't being tested for vision.</v>

1134
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1135
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 1>You think about it for a second and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can only.</v>

1136
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:12.820
<v Speaker 1>All you can do is do it loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exhale.</v>

1137
00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:14.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been talking about perspective </v>

1138
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.533
<v Speaker 1>recently a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's come up a few times about how </v>

1139
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:19.654
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yesterday we were talking about </v>

1140
00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:22.570
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the confederate war,</v>

1141
00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.030
<v Speaker 1>the civil war rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>confederate flag.</v>

1142
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And we were just talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane it is that slavery was 18,</v>

1143
00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:29.710
<v Speaker 1>65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was abolished.</v>

1144
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Like that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1145
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.630
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1146
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 1>a week ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1147
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:36.550
<v Speaker 1>And you also think it ended immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't fucking end immediately.</v>

1148
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.690
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ended like,</v>

1149
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see you eight guys.</v>

1150
00:49:39.551 --> 00:49:40.384
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like at the club where they turned </v>

1151
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:41.914
<v Speaker 1>the lights on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still people that are </v>

1152
00:49:43.361 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 1>stragglers.</v>

1153
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:47.470
<v Speaker 1>There's people that don't want to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was also then it just shifted over</v>

1154
00:49:47.471 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Speaker 1>to sharecropping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was like,</v>

1155
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:50.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's subsistence farming.</v>

1156
00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:52.360
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still going to live here.</v>

1157
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.630
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were sharecroppers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a book called,</v>

1158
00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my best friends are black.</v>

1159
00:49:57.401 --> 00:49:58.840
<v Speaker 1>What seems ironic that I would read that</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

1160
00:49:58.841 --> 00:50:00.220
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1161
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:03.960
<v Speaker 1>it's about integration arrived because </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of your best friends with black.</v>

1162
00:50:03.961 --> 00:50:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironic.</v>

1163
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's about integration I should say,</v>

1164
00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's written by a guy named tanner </v>
<v Speaker 1>colby who's going to.</v>

1165
00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:15.880
<v Speaker 1>It's insanely my name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally off the charts.</v>

1166
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were going to build a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

1167
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 1>it would be tanner colby and always </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing a golf shirt.</v>

1168
00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Might as well be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1169
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 1>but he really went deep into </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>

1170
00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:30.340
<v Speaker 1>What was interesting was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1171
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I highly recommend the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said You,</v>

1172
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:36.050
<v Speaker 1>when you think about integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your resistance,</v>

1173
00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:36.441
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1174
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:37.274
<v Speaker 1>white people didn't want it.</v>

1175
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Black people didn't want it either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were like,</v>

1176
00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:41.960
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to hang out with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

1177
00:50:41.961 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Like these black people didn't trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>white people any more than white people.</v>

1178
00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Trusted them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a mutual suspicion.</v>

1179
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.550
<v Speaker 1>At least black people had a case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White people had no case.</v>

1180
00:50:52.551 --> 00:50:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think white people,</v>

1181
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:58.721
<v Speaker 1>a lot of racism is basically a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people fearing karmic retribution.</v>

1182
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I think when I think fear of black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is like,</v>

1183
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.713
<v Speaker 1>there is a Karma coming at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's almost like too black and you </v>

1184
00:51:07.521 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 1>think like if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they did something to me,</v>

1185
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have it coming historically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me just kinda like these.</v>

1186
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't have it coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can make the argument and uh,</v>

1187
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a long argument and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good argument.</v>

1188
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1189
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 1>so that was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1190
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I think I've talked about and maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't talked about in here that one of</v>

1191
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:29.894
<v Speaker 1>the biggest proponents of integration </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ending red line and you know about </v>

1192
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.133
<v Speaker 1>redlining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>redlining was a thing where a banks </v>

1193
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:40.640
<v Speaker 1>would only give loans to people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived a,</v>

1194
00:51:40.641 --> 00:51:44.090
<v Speaker 1>they would circle lines on maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd circle neighborhoods and go,</v>

1195
00:51:44.091 --> 00:51:45.620
<v Speaker 1>if you live in that neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a loan.</v>

1196
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:49.080
<v Speaker 1>And guess who's neighborhoods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They circled back people.</v>

1197
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1198
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:55.550
<v Speaker 1>so black people couldn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the biggest,</v>

1199
00:51:55.551 --> 00:51:57.290
<v Speaker 1>the guy who ended it was Mitt Romney's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

1200
00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about.</v>

1201
00:51:58.330 --> 00:51:58.781
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1202
00:51:58.781 --> 00:51:59.614
<v Speaker 5>how about Baltimore or Baltimore?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had littoral areas of the town </v>

1203
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.020
<v Speaker 5>where they would not sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black people.</v>

1204
00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:06.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't.</v>

1205
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:08.890
<v Speaker 5>You can't unlearn what do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cash.</v>

1206
00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:11.530
<v Speaker 5>You can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They literally can't</v>

1207
00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.650
<v Speaker 1>fucking move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could buy within that neighborhood,</v>

1208
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:15.873
<v Speaker 1>but you just moved for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't get loans no matter what you </v>

1209
00:52:18.191 --> 00:52:18.650
<v Speaker 1>did</v>

1210
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:19.483
<v Speaker 5>and isn't it ironic that in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those neighborhoods the saving grace </v>

1211
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:23.803
<v Speaker 5>financially is white people gentrifying </v>
<v Speaker 5>the neighborhoods and making them like </v>

1212
00:52:28.221 --> 00:52:29.700
<v Speaker 5>super rich again?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:30.723
<v Speaker 5>My saving grace,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that saving grace for people that were </v>

1214
00:52:33.111 --> 00:52:35.630
<v Speaker 5>lucky enough to buy Roche has happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

1215
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.730
<v Speaker 5>That's happening at a fairly good amount</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1216
00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:42.731
<v Speaker 5>but in my neighborhood for the renters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pushed out so it's like,</v>

1217
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:43.724
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wanted the neighborhood to be worth </v>

1218
00:52:44.451 --> 00:52:45.191
<v Speaker 5>something again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1219
00:52:45.191 --> 00:52:46.370
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we can't afford it.</v>

1220
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:47.843
<v Speaker 5>People are buying up these houses and </v>
<v Speaker 5>redoing them and then selling them for </v>

1221
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:51.584
<v Speaker 5>shitloads of money will Benson Hurst,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was always like this horrible </v>

1222
00:52:54.741 --> 00:52:57.120
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bensonhurst is over.</v>

1223
00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:58.143
<v Speaker 5>That's going through this wave of </v>
<v Speaker 5>gentrification mountains going through </v>

1224
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:05.090
<v Speaker 5>like the entire burrows going through it</v>
<v Speaker 5>except for the poor.</v>

1225
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.460
<v Speaker 5>The poor Italian neighborhoods are </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty much the same,</v>

1226
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.171
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.820
<v Speaker 5>There's this a framed poster that I have</v>
<v Speaker 5>on my wall at home.</v>

1279
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.983
<v Speaker 5>It's an American girl in Italy and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the dudes are whistling in the </v>

1280
00:55:12.181 --> 00:55:13.014
<v Speaker 5>background and they're grabbing their </v>
<v Speaker 5>dicks and it's 1954 and I remember </v>

1281
00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:18.840
<v Speaker 5>looking at that when I was a kid </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>

1282
00:55:18.841 --> 00:55:21.570
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this lady in this photo is probably like</v>

1283
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.800
<v Speaker 5>100 years old now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1284
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 5>Or dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More likely dead.</v>

1285
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:26.003
<v Speaker 5>But like these guys like this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't like something they learned </v>

1286
00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:31.320
<v Speaker 5>from Washington Soprano's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here it is.</v>

1287
00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:32.630
<v Speaker 5>This is the photo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

1288
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.180
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1289
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:35.583
<v Speaker 5>Grabbing his Dick and look at the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>man who's got his arms inside the </v>

1290
00:55:39.091 --> 00:55:40.830
<v Speaker 5>jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The jacket just thrown over.</v>

1291
00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:45.540
<v Speaker 5>Shoulders guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sharing a,</v>

1292
00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:48.870
<v Speaker 5>a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy in the school?</v>

1293
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:51.133
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the finest broad we've ever seen </v>

1294
00:55:54.091 --> 00:55:54.870
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1295
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:56.790
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to tell because she's got this</v>
<v Speaker 5>look on their face.</v>

1296
00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:57.780
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God.</v>

1297
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess I guess it's all relative.</v>

1298
00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:02.143
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1299
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:03.023
<v Speaker 5>but it's just that it's a girl by </v>
<v Speaker 5>herself walking past this cafe and all </v>

1300
00:56:07.231 --> 00:56:08.064
<v Speaker 5>these pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is this weird thing in their </v>

1301
00:56:11.911 --> 00:56:14.400
<v Speaker 5>harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1302
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:19.460
<v Speaker 5>which is like a maternal respect to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're beautiful.</v>

1303
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:21.300
<v Speaker 5>Like a my mama</v>

1304
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.720
<v Speaker 4>that's like built into it,</v>

1305
00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.440
<v Speaker 1>whereas American harassment doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really have that.</v>

1306
00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:29.573
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Italian harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain little fucking little </v>

1307
00:56:32.701 --> 00:56:34.290
<v Speaker 1>maternal like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Mama,</v>

1308
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mama.</v>

1309
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Because those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a big thing a few years ago on</v>

1310
00:56:37.681 --> 00:56:38.514
<v Speaker 1>60 minutes were Italian guys don't move </v>
<v Speaker 1>out so it will be in their mid thirties </v>

1311
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.700
<v Speaker 1>and their moms don't want her to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1312
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to move out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1313
00:56:46.441 --> 00:56:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may not get married.</v>

1314
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.070
<v Speaker 1>No one can compare it to Mama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Italian guys in Italian.</v>

1315
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Guys in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:56.360
<v Speaker 4>That's always been an issue with tying </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys in the east coast too.</v>

1317

<v Speaker 4>enough time.</v>

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:14.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't learn.</v>

1328

<v Speaker 4>You're not really interested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Second,</v>

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.460
<v Speaker 4>if you liked the lifestyle though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess my question,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1331
00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to like live somewhere to </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience it for a week or so.</v>

1332

1336
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.560
<v Speaker 4>the Vatican is a life changing </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

1337
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.240
<v Speaker 4>Go on Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you say that?</v>

1338
00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:37.980
<v Speaker 4>It's immense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1339
00:57:37.981 --> 00:57:39.090
<v Speaker 4>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1340
00:57:39.091 --> 00:57:39.924
<v Speaker 4>they have a 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>year old obelisk in the center of the </v>

1341
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:45.330
<v Speaker 4>town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1342
00:57:45.331 --> 00:57:46.164
<v Speaker 4>I mean you look at some of the artifacts</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of the stuff that they've </v>

1343
00:57:49.591 --> 00:57:50.424
<v Speaker 4>collected there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much shit there that it's </v>

1344
00:57:52.801 --> 00:57:54.910
<v Speaker 4>just laying around stuff that would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>under two,</v>

1345
00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.290
<v Speaker 4>two inch thick glass and America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could walk up and touch it.</v>

1346
00:57:58.330 --> 00:57:59.163
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like new shit would be our </v>

1347
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:01.870
<v Speaker 1>oldest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1348
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:04.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Church in Rome.</v>

1349
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:05.254
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to go there pretty often because </v>

1350
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I was dating a girl that lived there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1351
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:12.210
<v Speaker 1>and a long distance relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that serious joe.</v>

1352
00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1353
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I remember she worked</v>

1354
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 4>dating in air quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thrust your girl.</v>

1355
00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:23.550
<v Speaker 4>I knew I knew a girl in the Oval Office</v>

1356
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.350
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1357
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.193
<v Speaker 1>she just telling me that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a piece of Jesus's cross and it </v>

1358
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:31.540
<v Speaker 1>was like believable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1359
00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't even think they made a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal out of it.</v>

1360
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Like there weren't a ton of signs about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1361
00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Like that would be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge attraction that would be like the</v>

1362
00:58:40.631 --> 00:58:42.000
<v Speaker 1>number one attraction in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1363
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:43.300
<v Speaker 1>in certain states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>

1364
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:44.223
<v Speaker 4>Well there's a church in Ethiopia that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is purported to contain the lost Ark of </v>

1365
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:51.694
<v Speaker 4>the covenant and they know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know where the tree and they have </v>

1366
00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:56.200
<v Speaker 4>the architect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what,</v>

1367
00:58:56.201 --> 00:58:59.470
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people that guard this church,</v>

1368
00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.500
<v Speaker 4>they all have like cataracts and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

1369
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:05.140
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very strange thing.</v>

1370
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:09.340
<v Speaker 4>This is all from Graham Hancock's book </v>
<v Speaker 4>where a,</v>

1371
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.373
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the first things that got </v>
<v Speaker 4>him into this idea of like lost </v>

1372
00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:18.690
<v Speaker 4>civilizations and that the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people had come up with like some pretty</v>

1373
00:59:19.841 --> 00:59:23.180
<v Speaker 4>high level of sophistication in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>societies.</v>

1374
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:24.133
<v Speaker 4>But then the societies would crumble </v>
<v Speaker 4>either due to natural disasters or war </v>

1375
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:29.024
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they would have to sort of </v>

1376
00:59:29.961 --> 00:59:34.961
<v Speaker 4>rebuild civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was investigating this one church</v>

1377
00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 4>in Ethiopia where the people that guard </v>
<v Speaker 4>this church in Ethiopia,</v>

1378
00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:40.213
<v Speaker 4>it's like a very specific sect and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>won't allow anyone to get into the </v>

1379
00:59:44.001 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 4>sacred secret areas of it.</v>

1380
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:47.203
<v Speaker 4>And the speculation was that somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside that church is the lost Ark of </v>

1381
00:59:50.841 --> 00:59:51.674
<v Speaker 4>the covenant and that the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people have cataracts and the </v>

1382
00:59:54.471 --> 00:59:56.930
<v Speaker 4>reason why these people have all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues like health issues,</v>

1383
00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:02.290
<v Speaker 4>it could possibly be that what's in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>last arc of the covenant is some sort of</v>

1384
01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:06.350
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a toxic element,</v>

1385
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.453
<v Speaker 4>whether it's nuclear or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical or whether it would stand to </v>

1386
01:00:10.821 --> 01:00:11.654
<v Speaker 4>reason if you watch the raiders of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lost Ark that makes those guys' faces </v>

1387
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:15.031
<v Speaker 4>melt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1388
01:00:15.031 --> 01:00:18.230
<v Speaker 4>It sure does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what could be substantiated</v>

1389
01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:19.064
<v Speaker 4>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your face melt unless you close your </v>

1390
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:22.400
<v Speaker 4>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1391
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:25.340
<v Speaker 4>like one of those things or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1392
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.233
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone came up with some sort of a </v>

1393
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:28.910
<v Speaker 4>nuclear reactor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1394
01:00:28.911 --> 01:00:29.744
<v Speaker 4>there was a kid that got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to close my eyes if there's a </v>

1395
01:00:32.481 --> 01:00:33.170
<v Speaker 4>nuclear blast.</v>

1396
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:34.900
<v Speaker 4>And just hope for the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a move.</v>

1397
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:35.893
<v Speaker 4>Like when bugs bunny would jump out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>an airplane right before it hit the </v>

1398
01:00:37.491 --> 01:00:40.090
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly right.</v>

1399
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.120
<v Speaker 4>But there was a kid that they found,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1400
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.260
<v Speaker 4>I forget where he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was building a nuclear reactor in</v>

1401
01:00:48.261 --> 01:00:49.094
<v Speaker 4>his fucking backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say he was 17 and someone </v>

1402
01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:54.530
<v Speaker 4>found it somehow or another they found </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1403
01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:56.780
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1404
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:58.063
<v Speaker 4>But if this kid can do that in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is if there was some sort of </v>

1405
01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:03.554
<v Speaker 4>super highly advanced law civilization </v>
<v Speaker 4>that had reached an incredible level of </v>

1406
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:09.950
<v Speaker 4>sophistication when it came to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1407
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.843
<v Speaker 4>the ability to manipulate matter and </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly even come up with some sort of </v>

1408
01:01:15.711 --> 01:01:16.544
<v Speaker 4>a reactor and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was what the Ark of the covenant </v>

1409
01:01:19.101 --> 01:01:19.934
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it was so sacred and </v>

1410
01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:23.120
<v Speaker 4>fascinating because they realized they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had an immense power,</v>

1411
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:24.283
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that power was probably like some sort </v>

1412
01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:27.380
<v Speaker 4>of a small reactor.</v>

1413
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 4>That would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope when.</v>

1414
01:01:30.141 --> 01:01:31.310
<v Speaker 4>That'd be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Crazy.</v>

1415
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:32.144
<v Speaker 4>It all ended up being true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then they know for sure that </v>

1416
01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:39.431
<v Speaker 4>they've found batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they found batteries in Baghdad and uh,</v>

1417
01:01:39.551 --> 01:01:40.384
<v Speaker 4>I believe in some of the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 4>Egyptians sites that what it is is a </v>

1418
01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:50.651
<v Speaker 4>very ancient sort of a method of </v>
<v Speaker 4>creating a battery like that.</v>

1419
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.360
<v Speaker 4>That's 100 percent confirmed that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe.</v>

1420
01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's confirmed.</v>

1421
01:01:54.441 --> 01:01:56.690
<v Speaker 4>They know that they did come up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>something and they,</v>

1422
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.553
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they figured out a way to use that </v>

1423
01:01:58.731 --> 01:01:59.930
<v Speaker 4>battery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There it is right there.</v>

1424
01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.640
<v Speaker 4>That's the Baghdad battery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1425
01:02:01.641 --> 01:02:02.420
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 4>How old?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's old as fuck.</v>

1427
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:05.703
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it's at least three or </v>

1428
01:02:08.001 --> 01:02:09.170
<v Speaker 4>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>

1429
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Find out how old that fucker is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

1430
01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.020
<v Speaker 4>let's guess I say it's 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>

1431
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:20.410
<v Speaker 4>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go to to 2000.</v>

1432
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see.</v>

1433
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:27.900
<v Speaker 4>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1434
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Well they must be able to carbon date </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1435
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen 38.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They found it in the 19 thirties.</v>

1436
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:40.180
<v Speaker 4>So to say how old it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all I want to know.</v>

1437
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:42.590
<v Speaker 4>Speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speculation.</v>

1438
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:47.800
<v Speaker 4>Some believe that it was [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't say age.</v>

1439
01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 4>40 elements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Battery hypothesis,</v>

1440
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:53.500
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Civic it,</v>

1441
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:54.480
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1442
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.670
<v Speaker 4>but see if you can find actually before </v>
<v Speaker 4>he can find out,</v>

1443
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:57.504
<v Speaker 4>see if he could find the thing about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys who guard the Ark of the Covenant </v>

1444
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 4>in Ethiopia because apparently these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these monks,</v>

1445
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:07.170
<v Speaker 4>that guard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all fucked up eyes.</v>

1446
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.273
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the things that Graham </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hancock thought was like super </v>

1447
01:03:09.811 --> 01:03:12.120
<v Speaker 4>disturbing when he started investigating</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and was like,</v>

1448
01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 4>why is he got why these guys have all </v>
<v Speaker 4>cataracts and shit.</v>

1449
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:16.050
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's happening?</v>

1450
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:18.360
<v Speaker 4>And if somebody can come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>battery,</v>

1451
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:21.750
<v Speaker 4>obviously there's a big step between a </v>
<v Speaker 4>battery and some sort of a reactor,</v>

1452
01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:25.620
<v Speaker 4>but if this kid in his fucking backyard </v>
<v Speaker 4>is building a reactor,</v>

1453
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had enough,</v>

1454
01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:33.590
<v Speaker 4>a high level of sophisticated should </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole.</v>

1455
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:34.703
<v Speaker 4>They had a high enough level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sophistication with the able to </v>

1456
01:03:36.031 --> 01:03:37.410
<v Speaker 4>construct the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1457
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:42.000
<v Speaker 4>Look at the Great Pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an incredible piece of engineering.</v>

1458
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:43.410
<v Speaker 4>Two million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300,000</v>

1459
01:03:43.411 --> 01:03:47.070
<v Speaker 4>stones all cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So precisely.</v>

1460
01:03:47.071 --> 01:03:49.110
<v Speaker 4>You can get a razor blade in between the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rocks.</v>

1461
01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean especially if you look in</v>

1462
01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:54.810
<v Speaker 5>tie up at the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you needed to be to get.</v>

1463
01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.580
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] like in like is there.</v>

1464
01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:02.040
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying in terms of,</v>

1465
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:03.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of like what you do,</v>

1466
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.520
<v Speaker 5>what your position was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's another pitch.</v>

1467
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.390
<v Speaker 5>I got an office on the eighth floor of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the pyramid.</v>

1468
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.540
<v Speaker 5>The point I want to hear this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my office is up at the point.</v>

1469
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:16.820
<v Speaker 5>If you worked on the builders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably didn't that probably.</v>

1470
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.590
<v Speaker 5>Although I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how what the.</v>

1471
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.150
<v Speaker 5>If if jobs were considered a big deal </v>
<v Speaker 5>back,</v>

1472
01:04:21.151 --> 01:04:23.880
<v Speaker 5>they used to think they were slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't think their slaves anymore.</v>

1473
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.280
<v Speaker 5>They stopped thinking they were slaves </v>
<v Speaker 5>about a decade ago.</v>

1474
01:04:26.281 --> 01:04:27.114
<v Speaker 5>I think when they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They uncovered some of the little camps </v>

1475
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:31.733
<v Speaker 5>that the people used to live in and buy </v>
<v Speaker 5>the food that they were eating and by </v>

1476
01:04:35.341 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 5>the quality of the clothes and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>plates,</v>

1477
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.240
<v Speaker 5>they think they were skilled workers.</v>

1478
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:42.610
<v Speaker 4>They don't think they were slaves in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which makes sense because you're.</v>

1479
01:04:42.611 --> 01:04:46.080
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about something that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you $2 million,</v>

1480
01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:47.100
<v Speaker 4>300,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>stones.</v>

1481
01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 4>I think the way they described it as if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you cut and placed 10 stones a day,</v>

1482
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:55.380
<v Speaker 4>it would take you 664 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how long did they think it took?</v>

1483
01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.740
<v Speaker 4>They weigh between two and 80 tons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know.</v>

1484
01:04:58.830 --> 01:04:59.663
<v Speaker 4>They don't know how long it took,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they know that it was constructed </v>

1485
01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:06.501
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 4>BC based on carbon dating.</v>

1486
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.800
<v Speaker 4>So they don't even know who exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>which pharaoh built it like this.</v>

1487
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 4>They get real weird with like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they go on in</v>

1488
01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.013
<v Speaker 3>terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the evidence that someone made </v>

1489
01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 3>this or like one of them is this finks </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they,</v>

1490
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:24.634
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to attribute the Sphinx to one </v>

1491
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:31.750
<v Speaker 3>guy where there's a passage that it says</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>

1492
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:34.960
<v Speaker 3>it came to him in a dream that if he </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncovered this,</v>

1493
01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:35.794
<v Speaker 3>thinks that he would be the pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would become the Pharaoh of Egypt if </v>

1494
01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:40.873
<v Speaker 3>he uncovered it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the speculation by the people </v>

1495
01:05:42.881 --> 01:05:47.050
<v Speaker 3>that are sort of back dating history is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Sphinx could have entirely been</v>

1496
01:05:47.051 --> 01:05:47.884
<v Speaker 3>covered in sand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be incredibly ancient because </v>

1497
01:05:50.141 --> 01:05:53.860
<v Speaker 3>when Napoleon found it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was covered in sand when,</v>

1498
01:05:53.861 --> 01:05:54.694
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people found in the 18 hundreds is </v>

1499
01:05:56.261 --> 01:06:00.550
<v Speaker 3>actually photographs of it before they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had dug it out and excavate it.</v>

1500
01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.713
<v Speaker 3>Actually</v>

1501
01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.530
<v Speaker 2>shooting the nose off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a fake thing?</v>

1502
01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody fuck the nose up.</v>

1503
01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Whether it was Napoleon or one of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>crew.</v>

1504
01:06:09.501 --> 01:06:11.930
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they know that for sure.</v>

1505
01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.553
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do know that the nose and the face </v>

1506
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:17.820
<v Speaker 3>are different from the original nose and</v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

1507
01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.550
<v Speaker 3>The original face they think was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>alliance.</v>

1508
01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

1509
01:06:22.231 --> 01:06:27.231
<v Speaker 2>Like just people's love of faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a human you've ever heard.</v>

1510
01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've talked about it weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was a,</v>

1511
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.910
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put a monkey's.</v>

1512
01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:33.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1513
01:06:33.841 --> 01:06:36.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a defensive like star power and </v>
<v Speaker 2>charisma.</v>

1514
01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.373
<v Speaker 2>They put a monkeys in a lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave them the option of unlimited </v>

1515
01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:42.683
<v Speaker 2>cherry flavored juicy juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or they could watch video of the leader </v>

1516
01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:52.290
<v Speaker 2>of their pack and they chose watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>video of the leader of the pack.</v>

1517
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing in human beings like needing,</v>

1518
01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:02.150
<v Speaker 2>needing kind of God's needing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of pillar or needing something</v>

1519
01:07:05.341 --> 01:07:07.980
<v Speaker 2>to like it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it speaks to this charisma,</v>

1520
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:08.790
<v Speaker 2>isn't it</v>

1521
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.130
<v Speaker 3>possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also though that what they really needed</v>

1522
01:07:11.131 --> 01:07:15.750
<v Speaker 3>is to get the fuck out of that cage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the leader of their pack on a video</v>

1523
01:07:15.751 --> 01:07:18.400
<v Speaker 3>maybe like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them know your message.</v>

1524
01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Maybe someone's going to let me out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1525
01:07:19.891 --> 01:07:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

1526
01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's also something to like.</v>

1527
01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:27.970
<v Speaker 2>There's something about certain people </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just like watching,</v>

1528
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:31.420
<v Speaker 2>like there's a certain element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>charisma,</v>

1529
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:32.680
<v Speaker 2>charm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to say.</v>

1530
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Like certain people that you see them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

1531
01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:36.064
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the definition of charisma is you </v>

1532
01:07:38.051 --> 01:07:38.884
<v Speaker 2>want to say yes before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what the question is </v>

1533
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.830
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1534
01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and monkeys,</v>

1535
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:44.170
<v Speaker 2>monkeys got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1536
01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:47.710
<v Speaker 2>they got this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got the effect on the Italian thing</v>

1537
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.100
<v Speaker 2>and got that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got this thing.</v>

1538
01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:51.963
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of makes sense if you think </v>

1539
01:07:53.201 --> 01:07:56.030
<v Speaker 2>about kings and pharaohs and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1540
01:07:56.031 --> 01:07:58.960
<v Speaker 2>that there's always been this Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

1541
01:07:58.970 --> 01:08:02.810
<v Speaker 2>There's always been this one ruler for </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every</v>

1542
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.150
<v Speaker 3>realization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single city,</v>

1543
01:08:05.151 --> 01:08:09.560
<v Speaker 3>every single state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single country always has that one</v>

1544
01:08:09.561 --> 01:08:13.220
<v Speaker 3>charismatic leader that stands in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the people and lifts his hands up and</v>

1545
01:08:13.221 --> 01:08:13.720
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1546
01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>underestimate.</v>

1547
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we should talk about trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>

1548
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:19.750
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's.</v>

1549
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot of charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say what you want to love the guy.</v>

1550
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:24.840
<v Speaker 2>He's got a ton of charisma and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

1551
01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Kind of charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1552
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:30.140
<v Speaker 2>He's got like this mean guy charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want him to like you.</v>

1553
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.870
<v Speaker 2>So you say things like you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

1554
01:08:32.871 --> 01:08:33.704
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you want him to think that </v>

1555
01:08:34.851 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 2>you're on his side so he won't come </v>
<v Speaker 2>after you.</v>

1556
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bully charisma.</v>

1557
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:41.580
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's charisma nonetheless.</v>

1558
01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:42.663
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing about stars and </v>

1559
01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 2>movie stars and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're watching this guy.</v>

1560
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.610
<v Speaker 2>You Watch Denzel Washington waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him to snap.</v>

1561
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:56.150
<v Speaker 2>He never does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your weight,</v>

1562
01:08:56.151 --> 01:08:59.000
<v Speaker 2>you can tell he's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't.</v>

1563
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like Robert Downey Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like with robert downey jr,</v>

1564
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 2>you're watching a guy not do cocaine.</v>

1565
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to do everythIng in him,</v>

1566
01:09:08.271 --> 01:09:12.830
<v Speaker 2>wants to do cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're watching a guy not actively,</v>

1567
01:09:12.831 --> 01:09:17.831
<v Speaker 2>not do cocaine from second to second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a good analysis.</v>

1568
01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just watching this guy,</v>

1569
01:09:21.561 --> 01:09:22.850
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this car accident.</v>

1570
01:09:22.851 --> 01:09:24.440
<v Speaker 2>That never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:28.510
<v Speaker 2>You're watching a guy struggle slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1572
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're struck.</v>

1573
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.860
<v Speaker 2>You're wondering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost want you to see it on him.</v>

1574
01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:34.694
<v Speaker 2>It's kinetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just got a little bit and that </v>

1575
01:09:36.501 --> 01:09:40.550
<v Speaker 2>little bit allows him to be like snaRky </v>
<v Speaker 2>and weird and get away with that.</v>

1576
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:44.510
<v Speaker 2>He didn't get his medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could almost do that with,</v>

1577
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.510
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of dramatics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's comedy stores less so,</v>

1578
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.720
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about tom cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>

1579
01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1580
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're just watching.</v>

1581
01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I Don't know if he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to snap.</v>

1582
01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:57.440
<v Speaker 2>He's almost going to like fly away or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1583
01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll snap.</v>

1584
01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:03.251
<v Speaker 2>If you talk about like psych psychiatric</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs like matt lauer,</v>

1585
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you're glip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt was amazing.</v>

1586
01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:11.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>

1587
01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.193
<v Speaker 2>That was a perfect example of why really</v>
<v Speaker 2>big time movie stars should not have </v>

1588
01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:18.380
<v Speaker 2>podcasts 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1589
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.843
<v Speaker 2>You're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also a testament to his </v>

1590
01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:25.730
<v Speaker 2>charisma that he said that and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>still like,</v>

1591
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.593
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

1592
01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:27.843
<v Speaker 2>I need to be a movie star more than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>need him to agree with me about </v>

1593
01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:32.840
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:36.050
<v Speaker 2>He bounced back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's really interesting is what he</v>

1595
01:10:36.051 --> 01:10:36.884
<v Speaker 2>bounces back on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like is most successful is these </v>

1596
01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:40.933
<v Speaker 2>wackadoo fucking science fiction movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where he's done the best since </v>

1597
01:10:44.331 --> 01:10:45.260
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1598
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:45.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the day after tomorrow thing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1600
01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:51.350
<v Speaker 2>that edge of tomorrow beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1601
01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 2>There's two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did two of them.</v>

1602
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:57.690
<v Speaker 2>He did two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did like one the mission impossible</v>

1603
01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.610
<v Speaker 2>for the ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>

1621
01:11:31.331 --> 01:11:33.880
<v Speaker 1>very pleased with that movie because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had no expectations.</v>

1622
01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:36.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And at the end he still gets to bang the</v>

1623
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:37.620
<v Speaker 5>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there you go.</v>

1624
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:40.650
<v Speaker 5>The way they bang that banging montage </v>
<v Speaker 5>was great.</v>

1625
01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:46.000
<v Speaker 5>And then him putting up a picture of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's his name and his face Just like,</v>

1626
01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:47.290
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's really fun.</v>

1627
01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like where they let writers write </v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1628
01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:51.091
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1629
01:11:51.091 --> 01:11:52.230
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a funny idea.</v>

1630
01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.880
<v Speaker 5>So we'll just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1631
01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.280
<v Speaker 5>I saw ghostbusters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see it and I liked,</v>

1632
01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:01.770
<v Speaker 5>which I feel awful about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some funny shit in ghostbusters.</v>

1633
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:05.220
<v Speaker 5>Like overall it's not a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not a good movie.</v>

1634
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.850
<v Speaker 5>But they did some funny shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1635
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.680
<v Speaker 5>they came up with some fun and I almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to know like,</v>

1636
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:11.543
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what could this have been if you let </v>

1637
01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:16.680
<v Speaker 5>whoever came up with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Funny shit just make,</v>

1638
01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:19.200
<v Speaker 5>make a movie out of it where they scenes</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they died.</v>

1639
01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:21.450
<v Speaker 5>It was a dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>scenes and dialogue.</v>

1640
01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:24.330
<v Speaker 5>There were scenes in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was such a combination of things.</v>

1641
01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:25.164
<v Speaker 5>That movie and it's so had the feeling </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the hands of the producers and the </v>

1642
01:12:29.281 --> 01:12:31.540
<v Speaker 5>executives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so handled that what</v>

1643
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.050
<v Speaker 1>you you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways.</v>

1644
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.540
<v Speaker 1>the thing I liked about deadpool was I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was watching it going.</v>

1645
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:40.380
<v Speaker 1>The producers of this movie did a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>job where they were like,</v>

1646
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:44.210
<v Speaker 1>this moment doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it work everYday.</v>

1647
01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.073
<v Speaker 1>Like micromanage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I worked on chris rock's going to </v>

1648
01:12:46.691 --> 01:12:51.000
<v Speaker 1>be top five a little bit for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>consulting for a couple of weeks and the</v>

1649
01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:51.834
<v Speaker 1>producers is guy named scott rudin who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a famous producer and what I </v>

1650
01:12:54.961 --> 01:12:59.160
<v Speaker 1>couldn't believe was the level of detail</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy was worried about.</v>

1651
01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 1>It was He busted christmas balls for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

1652
01:13:01.351 --> 01:13:02.184
<v Speaker 1>but the script literally made them </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and </v>

1653
01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:05.334
<v Speaker 1>rewrite and rewrite and then onset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was worried about shirts and </v>

1654
01:13:08.701 --> 01:13:11.760
<v Speaker 1>buttons and that's what I realized like </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1655
01:13:11.761 --> 01:13:12.594
<v Speaker 1>these deadpool producers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas it feels like maybe on </v>

1656
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:16.590
<v Speaker 1>ghostbusters that got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get,</v>

1657
01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:19.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to get lucky too with studio </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they they,</v>

1658
01:13:19.831 --> 01:13:24.831
<v Speaker 1>you all haven't agreed to set of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's good and then you build them over</v>

1659
01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.193
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was also this a problem that the </v>

1660
01:13:27.441 --> 01:13:31.600
<v Speaker 5>movie had a very clear agenda to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>pro woman move,</v>

1661
01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.470
<v Speaker 5>which gets means nothing wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 5>being pro woman,</v>

1662
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.140
<v Speaker 5>but if that's.</v>

1663
01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a goofy.</v>

1664
01:13:41.051 --> 01:13:44.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not a theme for a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A comedy movie.</v>

1665
01:13:44.221 --> 01:13:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1666
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:47.710
<v Speaker 5>All the men are buffoons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not just buffoons there.</v>

1667
01:13:47.711 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 5>There cartoonishly retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1668
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:52.260
<v Speaker 5>Like chris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck stands for.</v>

1669
01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:55.970
<v Speaker 5>thor is so retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

1670
01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:56.953
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

1671
01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.820
<v Speaker 5>he's so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make sense.</v>

1672
01:13:58.821 --> 01:14:01.490
<v Speaker 5>But they keep them around because he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful and it's like the joke.</v>

1673
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.730
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1674
01:14:02.731 --> 01:14:05.030
<v Speaker 5>I liked these revenge jokes where it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1675
01:14:05.031 --> 01:14:08.960
<v Speaker 5>so you're just going to do what men did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long is this gonna last?</v>

1676
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:12.000
<v Speaker 5>Like what's the next?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's easy a man to say like,</v>

1677
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.240
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something else honey.</v>

1678
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.640
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just feels like there's got to be</v>

1679
01:14:15.641 --> 01:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>like a next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1680
01:14:17.471 --> 01:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1681
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of like rep retribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1682
01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is it blood just wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believable.</v>

1683
01:14:23.381 --> 01:14:24.980
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what twitter is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is it,</v>

1684
01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:25.853
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like digital lynch mobs of people </v>

1685
01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:30.453
<v Speaker 1>that are rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go after people for saying </v>

1686
01:14:32.111 --> 01:14:35.950
<v Speaker 1>something fucked up about race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they went up to juStin timberlake a</v>

1687
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:36.783
<v Speaker 1>few weeks ago because he said some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them were all the same and then it's </v>

1688
01:14:39.101 --> 01:14:39.934
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say that and it just </v>

1689
01:14:41.471 --> 01:14:45.760
<v Speaker 1>becomes this mob of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's purely about racial revenge</v>

1690
01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.480
<v Speaker 4>as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's definitely about people having</v>

1691
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:53.010
<v Speaker 4>the opportunity to shit on</v>

1692
01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.720
<v Speaker 1>people that didn't have the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to before and now they have it via.</v>

1693
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:58.583
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have social cache and they have </v>

1694
01:15:00.091 --> 01:15:00.924
<v Speaker 1>social power and they use it for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same bullshit of white people use it </v>

1695
01:15:05.191 --> 01:15:06.024
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not even just black people </v>

1696
01:15:07.681 --> 01:15:08.970
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of white people,</v>

1697
01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:09.991
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

1698
01:15:09.991 --> 01:15:10.824
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

1699
01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.270
<v Speaker 1>any sort of marginalized group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's poor,</v>

1700
01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.700
<v Speaker 1>any like literally any group.</v>

1701
01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:16.163
<v Speaker 4>this movie like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of problems with the </v>

1702
01:15:19.861 --> 01:15:21.060
<v Speaker 4>moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this,</v>

1703
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.140
<v Speaker 4>the fact that all the men in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>were ridiculous.</v>

1704
01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:28.770
<v Speaker 4>All the men this mover buffoons all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>men in the movie,</v>

1705
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:29.663
<v Speaker 4>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like bill murray gets fucking killed in </v>

1706
01:15:31.981 --> 01:15:32.820
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spoiler alert.</v>

1707
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:36.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>

1708
01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:37.283
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's an agenda driven movie </v>

1709
01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:41.550
<v Speaker 4>more than they'd wrote something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They figured,</v>

1710
01:15:41.551 --> 01:15:42.384
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll work if you do this or if it'll </v>

1711
01:15:43.651 --> 01:15:44.484
<v Speaker 4>work if you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they didn't even have romantic </v>

1712
01:15:46.651 --> 01:15:51.240
<v Speaker 4>interests in the movie because men were </v>
<v Speaker 4>just so retarded.</v>

1713
01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:55.480
<v Speaker 4>Like the women didn't have boyfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have husbands.</v>

1714
01:15:55.481 --> 01:15:57.870
<v Speaker 4>It didn't have like they had chris </v>
<v Speaker 4>hemsworth.</v>

1715
01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's it.</v>

1716
01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.630
<v Speaker 4>And he was just eye candy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1717
01:16:00.631 --> 01:16:01.280
<v Speaker 4>the thing we</v>

1718
01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 1>tell people is when you're writing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a specific gen,</v>

1719
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:06.640
<v Speaker 1>like for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in comedy,</v>

1720
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:12.010
<v Speaker 1>women in comedy movies were a props or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1721
01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.280
<v Speaker 1>andie macdowell always used to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the love interest in,</v>

1722
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:18.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was always just like this warm,</v>

1723
01:16:18.761 --> 01:16:19.594
<v Speaker 1>sort of like vaguely disapproving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either like you're disapproving of </v>

1724
01:16:22.901 --> 01:16:26.560
<v Speaker 1>the guy or you're approving to a fault </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's,</v>

1725
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:29.200
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a movie about a certain,</v>

1726
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

1727
01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:34.600
<v Speaker 1>which was usually men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women in their lives for the plot to</v>

1728
01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:35.434
<v Speaker 1>advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to be for the plot or </v>

1729
01:16:37.241 --> 01:16:38.530
<v Speaker 1>against the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1730
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:39.423
<v Speaker 1>So then women started complaining like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you see us as these binary goofy </v>

1731
01:16:43.481 --> 01:16:44.314
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously women in life are more </v>

1732
01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:47.050
<v Speaker 1>complex than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1733
01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:48.363
<v Speaker 1>so now that women are starting to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own movies and it's about groups </v>

1734
01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:52.510
<v Speaker 1>of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it's,</v>

1735
01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:54.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a writing problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1736
01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you're in a trap where the men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridesmaids were goofy as fuck.</v>

1737
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:02.590
<v Speaker 1>It was an irish cop in milwaukee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me more,</v>

1738
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:05.950
<v Speaker 1>because I've never seen that my whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1739
01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 1>A guy who's just like in bridesmaids is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking masterpiece for the most part.</v>

1740
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Just that part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of like,</v>

1741
01:17:11.421 --> 01:17:14.360
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's a cop and he's got an endless</v>

1742
01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:15.990
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1743
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:20.000
<v Speaker 2>appetite for wig even though she's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in was it?</v>

1744
01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:21.910
<v Speaker 2>It was dicky to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he still,</v>

1745
01:17:21.911 --> 01:17:22.990
<v Speaker 2>he'll take her back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1746
01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.620
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's basicallY the only man in the movie</v>

1747
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:31.150
<v Speaker 2>and it's kind of a goofy part and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>once because it's about a group of women</v>

1748
01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.470
<v Speaker 2>and that's just the purpose that men </v>
<v Speaker 2>have in that plot,</v>

1749
01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:36.873
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>

1750
01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:41.470
<v Speaker 2>but they always say people take it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this a sexism thing and I just take</v>

1751
01:17:41.471 --> 01:17:43.090
<v Speaker 2>it as like a screenwriting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1752
01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:46.210
<v Speaker 2>it is that definitelY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the problems that people have</v>

1753
01:17:46.211 --> 01:17:47.044
<v Speaker 2>found when they're talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie is that you can't criticize it </v>

1754
01:17:50.411 --> 01:17:52.390
<v Speaker 2>because if you criticize that your sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1755
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:53.890
<v Speaker 2>And no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1756
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:56.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good piece of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1757
01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.030
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really well done.</v>

1758
01:17:58.190 --> 01:17:59.023
<v Speaker 2>But who did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who did bridesmaids that I'm talking </v>

1759
01:18:01.931 --> 01:18:04.150
<v Speaker 2>about the same guy who did it.</v>

1760
01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.070
<v Speaker 2>He's done whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done it twice now,</v>

1761
01:18:06.071 --> 01:18:09.280
<v Speaker 2>but like I think he knows he's a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good writer.</v>

1762
01:18:09.281 --> 01:18:10.114
<v Speaker 2>Like he knows you can use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to write because it's never </v>

1763
01:18:13.811 --> 01:18:14.950
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always tell people,</v>

1764
01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:17.770
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go show me a good example of a,</v>

1765
01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.880
<v Speaker 2>a movie about a group of guys where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman isn't just even in deadpool,</v>

1766
01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:27.180
<v Speaker 2>she's a prop to the in love with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconditionally.</v>

1767
01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Even though his face turns into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster,</v>

1768
01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:33.310
<v Speaker 2>she still wants him to eat her pussy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make fun of it.</v>

1769
01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make fun of it in a funny way.</v>

1770
01:18:35.171 --> 01:18:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Like their meetup there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet cute and then they think about like</v>

1771
01:18:38.051 --> 01:18:38.884
<v Speaker 2>the damage they both are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like perfect to me because it </v>

1772
01:18:40.991 --> 01:18:41.824
<v Speaker 2>was brief and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the thing they always </v>

1773
01:18:43.961 --> 01:18:45.690
<v Speaker 2>complained about when you're developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

1774
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.550
<v Speaker 2>like I don't buy this couple and I can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking mouthing.</v>

1775
01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy a lot of real couples.</v>

1776
01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

1777
01:18:52.601 --> 01:18:54.310
<v Speaker 2>they have to spell it all out in two </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

1778
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:55.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have to meet and fall in love </v>

1779
01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:57.370
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five minutes.</v>

1780
01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.493
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more to a relationship in </v>

1781
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.791
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:18:59.791 --> 01:19:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't show you all that other shit.</v>

1783
01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that takes hours,</v>

1784
01:19:03.130 --> 01:19:06.520
<v Speaker 2>days and weeks and months and you fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is correct.</v>

1785
01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:07.413
<v Speaker 2>The sad thing about the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ghostbusters movie is there's some </v>

1786
01:19:10.091 --> 01:19:13.730
<v Speaker 2>stuff in it that was really clever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was funny stuff and I,</v>

1787
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:16.000
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning I was enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1788
01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:16.834
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet people are not given this thing a </v>

1789
01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:21.730
<v Speaker 2>fair shake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as it got on and I was like,</v>

1790
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:22.623
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just.</v>

1791
01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:24.700
<v Speaker 2>This is just so clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:25.603
<v Speaker 2>There's parts of it that were just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>clumsy and poorly because every single </v>

1793
01:19:30.581 --> 01:19:33.070
<v Speaker 2>one of those women are fucking home run </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitters.</v>

1794
01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1798
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:42.880

<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1800
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the auburn haired woman.</v>

1801
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leslie's a fucking monster.</v>

1802
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:51.833
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's handicapped in and they give her </v>

1803
01:19:54.091 --> 01:19:57.090
<v Speaker 2>some clunky lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1804
01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1805
01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.100
<v Speaker 2>the girl from snl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kate mckinnon is really,</v>

1806
01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:02.310
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was really funny in it.</v>

1807
01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was very funny in it,</v>

1808
01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:06.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1809
01:20:06.691 --> 01:20:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I didn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what my kids.</v>

1810
01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:10.470
<v Speaker 5>They enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

1811
01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 5>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were some moments I laughed pretty</v>

1812
01:20:13.321 --> 01:20:14.160
<v Speaker 5>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

1813
01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:17.100
<v Speaker 5>But most of it not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1814
01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.600
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to make funny movies,</v>

1815
01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end,</v>

1816
01:20:20.311 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 5>they way they wrap it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1817
01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:22.830
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1820
01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:28.533
<v Speaker 5>that's just so awkward because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 5>told me there were no stakes in the </v>

1821
01:20:30.901 --> 01:20:32.040
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's hot fucking mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's making a funny good movies.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Really hard budget budget movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A big budget with a legacy and a star in</v>

1828
01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:50.760
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a release date.</v>

1829
01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:51.923
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if they just see if there was no </v>

1830
01:20:52.621 --> 01:20:55.800
<v Speaker 5>ghostbusters before it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'd never been a ghostbuster movie.</v>

1831
01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:57.630
<v Speaker 5>And this was the first ever ghost buster</v>
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>

1835
01:21:04.171 --> 01:21:05.004
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't be so handicapped because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they had to sort of connect with the </v>

1836
01:21:08.041 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 5>legacy and tie all these loose ends in </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they could kind of do it anyway they</v>

1837

<v Speaker 5>want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's really a car.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1861
01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.670

<v Speaker 5>week.</v>

1862
01:22:23.671 --> 01:22:27.090
<v Speaker 5>It's not like today.</v>

1869
01:22:47.491 --> 01:22:48.810

1870
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.060
<v Speaker 5>but really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a revenge movie,</v>

<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a bad movie.</v>

1900
01:23:58.231 --> 01:23:59.064
<v Speaker 4>mindless action movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're redoing a fucking charles </v>

01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:03.810
<v Speaker 4>bronson movie man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as,</v>

1902
01:24:03.930 --> 01:24:07.410
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you try to redo a charles </v>
<v Speaker 4>bronson movie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the actual movie and then the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to evolve in order to be able to </v>

2081
01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:32.560
<v Speaker 2>withstand car accidents and know how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck they figured this out though.</v>

2082
01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.090
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the weird things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>

2083
01:31:34.091 --> 01:31:38.350
<v Speaker 2>why their arms so skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like damn one inch or one image of it.</v>

2084
01:31:38.351 --> 01:31:42.200
<v Speaker 2>There's some cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing important in the arms to</v>

2085
01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:45.640
<v Speaker 2>protect your brain and your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

2086
01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does it have nipples?</v>

2087
01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Like what are all those nipples over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rib cage?</v>

2088
01:31:50.530 --> 01:31:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those are like panning.</v>

2089
01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe those are nipples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

2090
01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Those are like when you first get </v>
<v Speaker 2>nipples,</v>

2091
01:31:57.131 --> 01:32:02.110
<v Speaker 2>when you're of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are those things?</v>

2092
01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:03.003
<v Speaker 2>Ridges.</v>

2093
01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny that what we look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

2094
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:10.840
<v Speaker 2>when we see a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think it's normal,</v>

2095
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's just what we're used to is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2096
01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:16.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2097
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:18.540
<v Speaker 2>people are fucking weird looking by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2098
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:22.120
<v Speaker 2>They didn't do any favors with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the facial hair and the haircut.</v>

2099
01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird goatee.</v>

2100
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:26.650
<v Speaker 2>LIke why I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look extra monkey ish.</v>

2101
01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:30.160
<v Speaker 2>It looks very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really disgusting.</v>

2102
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:31.143
<v Speaker 2>He has a weird choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also the like the line to heaven </v>

2103
01:32:33.611 --> 01:32:36.670
<v Speaker 2>down to his pecker hairline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2104
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird hair trail.</v>

2105
01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Like what is going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a constellation space.</v>

2106
01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like a tesla coil.</v>

2107
01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Radiating air.</v>

2108
01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:51.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

2109
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

2110
01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a tesla?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know?</v>

2111
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2112
01:32:55.751 --> 01:32:58.240
<v Speaker 2>you made the observation or maybe it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>you or bird maybe.</v>

2113
01:32:58.241 --> 01:32:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if there's a power outage?</v>

2114
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:01.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well tHat's,</v>

2115
01:33:01.481 --> 01:33:02.520
<v Speaker 3>there's that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But all.</v>

2116
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I drove one for a day and I was shocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>at how quick the battery went down.</v>

2117
01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2118
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:11.200
<v Speaker 3>I drove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drove from here to my house,</v>

2119
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:15.730
<v Speaker 3>to the improv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a to my house to here again.</v>

2120
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:16.980
<v Speaker 3>And it was more than half</v>

2121
01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:20.040
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many miles was it?</v>

2122
01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.770
<v Speaker 2>100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even 60.</v>

2123
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:24.743
<v Speaker 2>That's too bad.</v>

2124
01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:27.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe maybe 70,</v>

2125
01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.830
<v Speaker 3>80,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maximum.</v>

2126
01:33:28.890 --> 01:33:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Maximum 80.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was more than half dead.</v>

2127
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:33.743
<v Speaker 3>so like when they say you can go 300 </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles without a charge or what are they </v>

2128
01:33:36.541 --> 01:33:38.550
<v Speaker 3>saying to 5,250</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles.</v>

2129
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:41.880
<v Speaker 3>That's under ideal conditions on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highway.</v>

2130
01:33:41.881 --> 01:33:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Sixty five miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drafting behind a fucking semi.</v>

2131
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:49.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not like stop and go traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2132
01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:54.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not speeding up,</v>

2133
01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:57.060
<v Speaker 3>slowing down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not ligHts.</v>

2134
01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.250
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not ready.</v>

2135
01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:00.930
<v Speaker 3>It's not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's ready.</v>

2136
01:34:00.931 --> 01:34:01.764
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean depending on how far you need to </v>

2137
01:34:02.641 --> 01:34:03.570
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's half full.</v>

2138
01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:05.370
<v Speaker 3>It's still pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well sure.</v>

2139
01:34:05.371 --> 01:34:07.830
<v Speaker 3>You could use the average person only </v>
<v Speaker 3>drives 35 miles a day.</v>

2140
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could for sure you could use </v>

2141
01:34:09.751 --> 01:34:12.210
<v Speaker 3>it as a daily driver if you could plug </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in every night,</v>

2142
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:14.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's not ready for me to adopt.</v>

2143
01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:15.593
<v Speaker 3>it's just so limited that the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes so long to recharge like you </v>

2144
01:34:19.891 --> 01:34:20.724
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can charge in for a certain amount </v>

2145
01:34:22.111 --> 01:34:22.944
<v Speaker 3>of time and I'll give you like 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent or the idea that maybe they </v>

2146
01:34:25.141 --> 01:34:28.170
<v Speaker 3>could swap batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pull into a place and they take your</v>

2147
01:34:28.171 --> 01:34:29.670
<v Speaker 3>batteries out and give you new </v>
<v Speaker 3>batteries.</v>

2148
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.070
<v Speaker 3>But then you've got to trust that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're connecting the batteries.</v>

2149
01:34:32.071 --> 01:34:32.904
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to trust that the batteries </v>

2150
01:34:33.571 --> 01:34:36.050
<v Speaker 3>are good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to trust who,</v>

2151
01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.620
<v Speaker 3>who had the batteries before anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped muckrack.</v>

2152
01:34:38.630 --> 01:34:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they going to like my fucking car on</v>

2153
01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:40.974
<v Speaker 3>fire now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that was one of the issues that </v>

2154
01:34:41.751 --> 01:34:43.860
<v Speaker 3>they were having with people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chevy volt.</v>

2155
01:34:43.861 --> 01:34:44.720
<v Speaker 3>I have not.</v>

2156
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:45.570
<v Speaker 2>There's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2157
01:34:45.570 --> 01:34:47.700
<v Speaker 2>I get 300 miles a gallon.</v>

2158
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:49.770
<v Speaker 3>That's a hybrid though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2159
01:34:49.771 --> 01:34:50.604
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:34:50.610 --> 01:34:51.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the teslas,</v>

2161
01:34:51.831 --> 01:34:52.664
<v Speaker 3>when they first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're developing issues where the </v>

2162
01:34:54.651 --> 01:34:56.990
<v Speaker 3>underbody would get hit by rocks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>would start.</v>

2163
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:59.030
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2164
01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:01.530
<v Speaker 4>do you remember the fisker fiscal karma?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2165
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.230
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how that would killed that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing?</v>

2166
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.273
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

2167
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Remember that big storm that hit the </v>
<v Speaker 4>east coast?</v>

2168
01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.760
<v Speaker 4>There was a big storm that hit the east </v>
<v Speaker 4>coast.</v>

2169
01:35:08.761 --> 01:35:09.800
<v Speaker 4>Sandy one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2170
01:35:09.801 --> 01:35:12.550
<v Speaker 4>I think that was a couple of years back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2171
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:14.270
<v Speaker 4>destroyed a lot of houses in long </v>
<v Speaker 4>island.</v>

2172
01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:17.210
<v Speaker 4>that was hurricane sandy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They hit a port,</v>

2173
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:18.343
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the storm hit a port where these things </v>

2174
01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:24.941
<v Speaker 4>were parked and apparently when they get</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to the door height and water,</v>

2175
01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:28.370
<v Speaker 4>they explode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

2176
01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:29.870
<v Speaker 4>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2177
01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:33.230
<v Speaker 4>see that sales,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those fires going on over there.</v>

2178
01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:33.560
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

2179
01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.930
<v Speaker 1>since the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the trigger of former.</v>

2180
01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.820
<v Speaker 1>That's not the cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the transformer.</v>

2181
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:39.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the transformer on the east </v>
<v Speaker 1>village.</v>

2182
01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Is this a different video that says con </v>
<v Speaker 4>ed explosion?</v>

2183
01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:45.730
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got the wrong.</v>

2184
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:48.580
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's one that's like this.</v>

2185
01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.810
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty similar to find the video of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hurricane sandy fires.</v>

2186
01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they don't have a video of it.</v>

2187
01:35:59.050 --> 01:36:00.820
<v Speaker 4>See if he can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2188
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:02.800
<v Speaker 4>point being those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get them wet,</v>

2189
01:36:02.801 --> 01:36:03.550
<v Speaker 4>they blow up.</v>

2190
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:04.830
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2191
01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not great and people don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2192
01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:08.320
<v Speaker 1>So that company went under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2193
01:36:08.321 --> 01:36:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I have a volt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been great.</v>

2194
01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a hybrid is a really good move.</v>

2195
01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like gas and electricity </v>

2196
01:36:15.490 --> 01:36:20.440
<v Speaker 1>and kind of run on both 40 electricity </v>
<v Speaker 1>every charge and I can charge it in four</v>

2197
01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:23.920
<v Speaker 1>hours for a full chart and pickups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good drives.</v>

2198
01:36:23.921 --> 01:36:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like,</v>

2199
01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I never really need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2200
01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.340
<v Speaker 1>the only time I'm using pickup is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm driving like a dickhead,</v>

2201
01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:31.870
<v Speaker 1>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2202
01:36:31.871 --> 01:36:33.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you're trying not to drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2203
01:36:33.701 --> 01:36:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm cutting people off and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like that,</v>

2204
01:36:35.711 --> 01:36:38.230
<v Speaker 1>then you need the I need to pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm an asshole.</v>

2205
01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:39.083
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2206
01:36:39.170 --> 01:36:42.190
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part I don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickup like day to day.</v>

2207
01:36:42.191 --> 01:36:43.960
<v Speaker 1>You can only go so fast.</v>

2208
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.153
<v Speaker 1>Well one of the cool things about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tesla is the idea of driverless driving </v>

2209
01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:52.660
<v Speaker 1>that is fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Name tesla at all for that.</v>

2210
01:36:52.690 --> 01:36:57.490
<v Speaker 1>For the guy dying recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that autopilot one,</v>

2211
01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:58.413
<v Speaker 1>I think they've deterMined that </v>
<v Speaker 1>autopiLot didn't have anything to do </v>

2212
01:37:00.341 --> 01:37:02.560
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was watching Harry Potter.</v>

2213
01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:03.693
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2214

2215
01:37:05.250 --> 01:37:06.083
<v Speaker 1>it was still playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like greg giraldo's joke about </v>

2216
01:37:08.530 --> 01:37:13.330
<v Speaker 1>about rappers show him watching porn and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get into an accident and they're on</v>

2217
01:37:13.331 --> 01:37:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the side of the road and the porn is </v>
<v Speaker 1>still playing.</v>

2218
01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Rappers watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was rappers want,</v>

2219
01:37:18.150 --> 01:37:18.983
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was people having everyone on cribs </v>

<v Speaker 1>an accident and you're dying and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still playing fucking dumb shit on your </v>

<v Speaker 1>monitor is still playing porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2224
01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:33.213
<v Speaker 1>I think it was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy who got killed in </v>

2225
01:37:35.351 --> 01:37:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was jerking off while I was driving.</v>

<v Speaker 1>His car flipped is jerking off to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2227
01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't wait.</v>

2228
01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.980
<v Speaker 4>His car flipped and he died and he died </v>
<v Speaker 4>with his pants down.</v>

2229
01:37:45.010 --> 01:37:48.830
<v Speaker 4>His phone was still playing the porn </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they pulled his life</v>

2230
01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:51.660
<v Speaker 1>body from the wreckage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a long clip,</v>

2231
01:37:51.661 --> 01:37:53.640
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than a dozen fisker karma.</v>

2232
01:37:53.641 --> 01:37:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Hybrids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caught fire and exploded.</v>

2233
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>No video.</v>

2234
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.910
<v Speaker 4>Just pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

2235
01:37:56.911 --> 01:37:59.310
<v Speaker 4>So we're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have false memories.</v>

2236
01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:00.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn.</v>

2237
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.010
<v Speaker 4>That's what happened with trump on nine </v>
<v Speaker 4>slash 11.</v>

2238
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:03.110
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>

2239
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:05.700
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't eat celebrators oh yeah,</v>

2240
01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:07.670
<v Speaker 4>in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm all the way across the.</v>

2241
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:09.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2242
01:38:09.721 --> 01:38:11.460
<v Speaker 4>some people musT have celebrated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what?</v>

2243
01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody was so.</v>

2244
01:38:14.311 --> 01:38:15.144
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think to,</v>

2245
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.070
<v Speaker 4>in jersey I'm sure people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2246
01:38:17.071 --> 01:38:20.160
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think people were going </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside and fucking who knows,</v>

2247
01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:23.640
<v Speaker 4>because then we'll get you popped maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>back then they didn't know.</v>

2248
01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:24.480
<v Speaker 4>Well no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When.</v>

2249
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.313
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a fucking chaotic moment </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to predict what's gonna </v>

2250
01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:28.280
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2251
01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:29.320
<v Speaker 4>And how did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2252
01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.140
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what was going on.</v>

2253
01:38:31.141 --> 01:38:34.200
<v Speaker 4>Then they didn't know when that first </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

2254
01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:35.293
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they could have been instead of </v>

2255
01:38:36.061 --> 01:38:37.950
<v Speaker 4>celebrate and they could have been just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>

2256
01:38:37.951 --> 01:38:39.720
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy</v>

2257
01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:41.960
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I think when I.</v>

2258
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:42.883
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was in paris and I saw like </v>

2259
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:48.163
<v Speaker 1>someone said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am very sorry what happened to your </v>

2260
01:38:50.001 --> 01:38:50.691
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2261
01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:51.524
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the world trade center and I'm </v>

2262
01:38:52.791 --> 01:38:53.624
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2263
01:38:53.770 --> 01:38:58.220
<v Speaker 1>And then I ran to a monitor and saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>psalm and butting my head.</v>

2264
01:38:58.610 --> 01:39:01.430
<v Speaker 1>I saw it live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just didn't.</v>

2265
01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:02.533
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the faulty of faultiness </v>

2266
01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:07.310
<v Speaker 1>memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is creepy that you can't.</v>

2267
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like you say ship with absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>no certainty this point</v>

2268
01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.650
<v Speaker 4>memories are very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:15.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm and I have some super clear memories</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2270
01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:16.153
<v Speaker 4>that I can verify,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've also got a lot of fuzzy ones </v>

2271
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:20.833
<v Speaker 4>and the problem is when people start </v>
<v Speaker 4>attaching all sorts of emotions and all </v>

2272
01:39:25.131 --> 01:39:25.964
<v Speaker 4>sorts of different things to memories </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they start distorting them and </v>

2273
01:39:29.661 --> 01:39:34.160
<v Speaker 4>then repeating the distortion of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>memory until that becomes the memory.</v>

2274
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:35.263
<v Speaker 4>And then in their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's people that have been </v>

2275
01:39:37.131 --> 01:39:40.290
<v Speaker 4>involved in business deals and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that they were so wrong.</v>

2276
01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Then everything went so terrible and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this piece of shit and then my wife left</v>

2277
01:39:44.301 --> 01:39:46.310
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when you break it down to them,</v>

2278
01:39:46.311 --> 01:39:46.590
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2279
01:39:46.590 --> 01:39:47.120
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2280
01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.250
<v Speaker 4>that didn't happen at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what happened.</v>

2281
01:39:49.251 --> 01:39:51.070
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't want to hear the </v>
<v Speaker 4>results.</v>

2282
01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.250
<v Speaker 1>People I think that are a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

2283
01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about you ever be arguing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your wife and you're like,</v>

2284
01:39:56.371 --> 01:39:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

2285
01:39:58.480 --> 01:39:59.313
<v Speaker 4>did I say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're barely paying </v>

2286
01:40:01.691 --> 01:40:02.524
<v Speaker 4>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the key longterm relationship </v>

2287
01:40:05.261 --> 01:40:06.094
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just got to be able to hit the fade </v>

2288
01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:08.373
<v Speaker 4>button that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that you think that's helpful to </v>

2289
01:40:10.881 --> 01:40:13.060
<v Speaker 4>round out and do you think she realizes </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

2290
01:40:13.450 --> 01:40:14.283
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She knows that I don't know what you're </v>

2291
01:40:15.281 --> 01:40:16.200
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you say?</v>

2292
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:18.270
<v Speaker 4>What were you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2293
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:19.123
<v Speaker 4>you just fade out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's exactly the kind of </v>

2294
01:40:20.561 --> 01:40:21.930
<v Speaker 4>conversations you start having.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2295
01:40:21.931 --> 01:40:22.960
<v Speaker 4>What'd you just say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2296
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:24.580
<v Speaker 4>I just lost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you say?</v>

2297
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:27.550
<v Speaker 4>Some will say so then we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>light it on fire.</v>

2298
01:40:27.551 --> 01:40:28.610
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2299
01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:29.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I have to pay attention.</v>

2300
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:33.070
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to light on fire?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to light one on fire?</v>

2301
01:40:33.230 --> 01:40:34.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing about </v>

2302
01:40:34.071 --> 01:40:36.050
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all kind of important,</v>

2303
01:40:36.051 --> 01:40:39.080
<v Speaker 1>but none of it's that important in </v>
<v Speaker 1>retrospect.</v>

2304
01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Hindsight in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the second of it</v>

2305
01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:43.880
<v Speaker 4>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:46.790
<v Speaker 4>The most nonsensical thing could be so </v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

2307
01:40:46.791 --> 01:40:48.890
<v Speaker 4>Neil brennan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so important.</v>

<v Speaker 4>easy manage,</v>

2310
01:40:53.681 --> 01:40:54.514
<v Speaker 4>but I have some friends that have some </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad relationships with their wives and </v>

2311
01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.013
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's basically when they get togetheR </v>

2312
01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:03.400
<v Speaker 4>it's just who's going to win today's </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling match?</v>

2313
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.560
<v Speaker 4>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people do you know with,</v>

2314
01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:09.250
<v Speaker 4>with marriages that you envy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you weren't married.</v>

2315
01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.540
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not manY because that's the thing.</v>

2316
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:16.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like not many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's you know,</v>

2317
01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:19.000
<v Speaker 4>most of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks especially from the outside,</v>

2318
01:41:19.001 --> 01:41:20.840
<v Speaker 4>it looks like way too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2319
01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:25.240
<v Speaker 4>and it looks like disastrous happenings </v>
<v Speaker 4>once it breaks off,</v>

2320
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:28.300
<v Speaker 4>which is different than a a boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend.</v>

2321
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:29.870
<v Speaker 4>If a guy and a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2322
01:41:29.871 --> 01:41:32.710
<v Speaker 4>dating and they just decided to call it </v>
<v Speaker 4>off like,</v>

2323
01:41:32.711 --> 01:41:34.420
<v Speaker 4>this isn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2324
01:41:34.590 --> 01:41:35.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2325
01:41:35.230 --> 01:41:37.240
<v Speaker 4>there's very little cleanup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2326
01:41:37.241 --> 01:41:38.074
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's it.</v>

2327
01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:42.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you are some man or some woman,</v>

2328
01:41:42.581 --> 01:41:46.840
<v Speaker 4>even like a woman who makes a shitload </v>
<v Speaker 4>of money and she has a husband's kind of</v>

2329
01:41:46.841 --> 01:41:49.420
<v Speaker 4>a lay about and then that starting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

2330
01:41:49.421 --> 01:41:50.620
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

2331
01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:51.610
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is.</v>

2332
01:41:51.670 --> 01:41:54.340
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden this dude wants</v>
<v Speaker 4>a ton of alimony.</v>

2333
01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.473
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2334
01:41:56.650 --> 01:41:57.483
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like jesus christ and this woman who </v>

2335
01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:00.993
<v Speaker 4>doesn't even like this guy anymore has </v>
<v Speaker 4>to pay him 10 percent or 15 percent of </v>

2336
01:42:05.021 --> 01:42:07.290
<v Speaker 4>her salary every week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's just like,</v>

2337
01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:08.133
<v Speaker 4>I can't even Believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that is always been the case with </v>

2338
01:42:11.891 --> 01:42:14.500
<v Speaker 4>men and women with a man having to pay </v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman.</v>

2339
01:42:14.530 --> 01:42:17.110
<v Speaker 4>It's always been alimony has been around</v>
<v Speaker 4>forever,</v>

2340
01:42:17.111 --> 01:42:18.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Child support,</v>

2341
01:42:18.101 --> 01:42:21.220
<v Speaker 4>alimony.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now that it's in more and more cases</v>

2342
01:42:21.221 --> 01:42:22.054
<v Speaker 4>becoming the woman playing the man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like talk to roseanne barr about how </v>

2343
01:42:24.431 --> 01:42:25.780
<v Speaker 4>much he had to pay tom arnold.</v>

2344
01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:27.430
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2345
01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.553
<v Speaker 4>This is it's league.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's legalized stealing mixed in with </v>

2346
01:42:33.791 --> 01:42:35.740
<v Speaker 4>prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's long,</v>

2347
01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:36.603
<v Speaker 4>it's a long con.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Prostitution in in many ways and it's </v>

2348
01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:40.773
<v Speaker 4>involving the legal system and the banks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as soon as there's a system that's </v>

2349
01:42:44.351 --> 01:42:46.870
<v Speaker 4>set up where people are profiting off </v>
<v Speaker 4>that system,</v>

2350
01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:50.080
<v Speaker 4>good luck buying it from their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands.</v>

2351
01:42:50.110 --> 01:42:50.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the political system that we </v>

2352
01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:54.460
<v Speaker 4>have right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the marriage system,</v>

2353
01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:55.773
<v Speaker 4>like if you've talked to someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>gone through horrific divorces and had </v>

2354
01:42:58.781 --> 01:43:02.530
<v Speaker 4>to deal with the financial implications </v>
<v Speaker 4>are or complications,</v>

2355
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:04.480
<v Speaker 4>it gets insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2356
01:43:04.481 --> 01:43:09.481
<v Speaker 4>that's what buddy mine was like my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sad thing is the deal she's going to</v>

2357
01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:11.440
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I offered her two years ago,</v>

2358
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.903
<v Speaker 4>but she says dragging it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to drag it out because it </v>

2359
01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:16.240
<v Speaker 4>costs you money in legal fees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2360
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:17.370
<v Speaker 4>And it there.</v>

2361
01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:20.050
<v Speaker 4>You're still connected to them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're punishing you.</v>

2362
01:43:20.051 --> 01:43:22.690
<v Speaker 4>If you want to get the divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you don't want to divorce,</v>

2363
01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:24.093
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason why they want to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>divorced or they're mad at you for some </v>

2364
01:43:26.351 --> 01:43:27.430
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fucking.</v>

2365
01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:28.773
<v Speaker 4>My friend has to pay his ex wife for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of her life and he has a new wife </v>

2366
01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:35.080
<v Speaker 4>and he has a family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got kids.</v>

2367
01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:35.943
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't have a new husband though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No know if she has a new husband than </v>

2368
01:43:38.931 --> 01:43:39.764
<v Speaker 4>the money that cuts off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so hE has to pay her hundreds of </v>

2369
01:43:42.881 --> 01:43:46.510
<v Speaker 4>thousands of dollars every single year </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the rest of her life.</v>

2370
01:43:46.810 --> 01:43:50.020
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like he fucked her so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She can't work anymore.</v>

2371
01:43:50.610 --> 01:43:52.150
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what the court says.</v>

2372
01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:53.820
<v Speaker 1>This guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what it is.</v>

2373
01:43:53.821 --> 01:43:58.821
<v Speaker 1>It's like how feeble were I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's societaly like women had it</v>

2374
01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:02.150
<v Speaker 1>so much worse in the seventies when </v>
<v Speaker 1>these laws were made,</v>

2375
01:44:03.710 --> 01:44:06.230
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like there needs to be some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of correction.</v>

2376
01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Can't have it so that if a guy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>married to a woman,</v>

2377
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:15.380
<v Speaker 3>he has been not married to her more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has been married to her.</v>

2378
01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:20.000
<v Speaker 3>He was married to her for like 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been divorced for like 14,</v>

2379
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:24.620
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stIll owes all that money.</v>

2380
01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:27.170
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] like because he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they broke up,</v>

2381
01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:28.513
<v Speaker 3>he has to pay her because they went past</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 years being married or whatever the </v>

2382
01:44:31.701 --> 01:44:35.900
<v Speaker 3>number was his two pair for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>her time on earth.</v>

2383
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might not have any relationship to or</v>

2384
01:44:39.621 --> 01:44:44.621
<v Speaker 3>he is responsible for her survival </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever and not just survival but living</v>

2385
01:44:44.721 --> 01:44:46.940
<v Speaker 3>really well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's.</v>

2386
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.650
<v Speaker 3>I guess the question is how</v>

2387
01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.450
<v Speaker 1>important were the women who've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>these laws passed?</v>

2388
01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Meaning what do you think you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is entitling you to this money,</v>

2389
01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.190
<v Speaker 1>and this goes for men now too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2390
01:45:00.191 --> 01:45:01.024
<v Speaker 1>well how good of a husband are you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you deserve half of her income for ever </v>

2391
01:45:06.370 --> 01:45:07.203
<v Speaker 1>clearly your that good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she dIdn't work so there should </v>

2392
01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:11.080
<v Speaker 1>be a penalty right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>

2393
01:45:11.110 --> 01:45:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they easily get half </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever or whatever,</v>

2394
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:18.160
<v Speaker 1>but they get a giant chunk chunk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then a stipend.</v>

2395
01:45:18.230 --> 01:45:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get a monthly payment.</v>

2396
01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.793
<v Speaker 3>It's just strange that someone could </v>
<v Speaker 3>like people meet each other and then it </v>

2397
01:45:25.641 --> 01:45:27.650
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work out anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like each other.</v>

2398
01:45:27.651 --> 01:45:28.484
<v Speaker 3>They spend time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they don't want to spend time and </v>

2399
01:45:29.751 --> 01:45:30.584
<v Speaker 3>when they don't want to spend time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the sudden legally obligate them </v>

2400
01:45:32.901 --> 01:45:33.734
<v Speaker 3>to send money like this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about someone who by </v>

2401
01:45:37.701 --> 01:45:41.450
<v Speaker 3>virtue of their relationship could no </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer move her body,</v>

2402
01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:42.793
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with a man and a woman gets </v>

2403
01:45:43.431 --> 01:45:44.264
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the man has to pay because once a man </v>

2404
01:45:44.991 --> 01:45:46.850
<v Speaker 3>starts fucking a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eventually go paralyzed.</v>

2405
01:45:46.851 --> 01:45:48.350
<v Speaker 3>It's just how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2406
01:45:48.351 --> 01:45:49.910
<v Speaker 3>if that was the nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2407
01:45:49.911 --> 01:45:51.050
<v Speaker 3>that was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2408
01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:51.913
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to take responsibility for </v>

2409
01:45:52.671 --> 01:45:54.580
<v Speaker 3>having sex because the man does </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2410
01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2411
01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:57.140
<v Speaker 1>guys would still claim like I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>

2412
01:45:57.170 --> 01:45:58.650
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't even me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2413
01:45:59.010 --> 01:45:59.843
<v Speaker 1>I fuck her harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think I'm the only what you think I </v>

2414
01:46:01.791 --> 01:46:05.420
<v Speaker 1>could even fuck a woman in the book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a vegetable.</v>

2415
01:46:06.970 --> 01:46:08.770
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stealing,</v>

2416
01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:09.993
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like you're cornering a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and forcing tHem to just get </v>

2417
01:46:15.010 --> 01:46:19.270
<v Speaker 3>thrust into this weird legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this weird legal system,</v>

2418
01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:23.560
<v Speaker 3>it's pulling as this thing is spiraling </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2419
01:46:23.770 --> 01:46:26.470
<v Speaker 3>The legal system is pulling money out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2420
01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:27.663
<v Speaker 3>So there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this guy who's earning all this </v>

2421
01:46:30.551 --> 01:46:31.384
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he works 12 hours every day is </v>

2422
01:46:33.791 --> 01:46:37.000
<v Speaker 3>constantly hustling and doing deals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and that,</v>

2423
01:46:37.001 --> 01:46:40.480
<v Speaker 3>and he's putting it all together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>while he's getting divorced,</v>

2424
01:46:40.481 --> 01:46:41.314
<v Speaker 3>this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going through the court system </v>

2425
01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:44.793
<v Speaker 3>and the court system and this two year </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight is spinning this whole thing back </v>

2426
01:46:49.651 --> 01:46:50.484
<v Speaker 3>and forth and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to get more man because you </v>

2427
01:46:52.291 --> 01:46:53.124
<v Speaker 3>have to consider his earning potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is gonna increase over the next few </v>

2428
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:57.960
<v Speaker 3>years and it wouldn't have happened if </v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't your in around.</v>

2429
01:46:58.150 --> 01:46:58.983
<v Speaker 3>I mean your stability in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship is part of the reason why </v>

2430
01:47:00.961 --> 01:47:01.794
<v Speaker 3>he had the confidence to pursue these </v>
<v Speaker 3>business deals and you should be </v>

2431
01:47:03.571 --> 01:47:04.140
<v Speaker 3>compensated.</v>

2432
01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:04.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I wonder who were these </v>

2433
01:47:05.371 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 1>wonderful people that this lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2434
01:47:07.471 --> 01:47:08.304
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who was the woman that they could </v>

2435
01:47:09.001 --> 01:47:11.010
<v Speaker 1>hold up as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did this,</v>

2436
01:47:11.011 --> 01:47:12.310
<v Speaker 1>therefore blahbity blah blah.</v>

2437
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2438
01:47:15.291 --> 01:47:17.900
<v Speaker 3>first of all lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them get a percentage.</v>

2439
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's that.</v>

2440
01:47:19.970 --> 01:47:20.700
<v Speaker 3>I think there is</v>

2441
01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:21.880
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they make the laws.</v>

2442
01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they definitely argue the law.</v>

2443
01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:24.763
<v Speaker 3>If there's a strong Benefit to there </v>
<v Speaker 3>being an extreme financial consequence </v>

2444
01:47:29.311 --> 01:47:30.144
<v Speaker 3>for getting divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a strong benefit to the people that </v>

2445
01:47:32.581 --> 01:47:35.580
<v Speaker 3>profit from taking people to divorce </v>
<v Speaker 3>court.</v>

2446
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:40.910
<v Speaker 3>So and by the way that benefit doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist like the other way,</v>

2447
01:47:41.130 --> 01:47:41.963
<v Speaker 3>like if if your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your lawyer saves you a fuck load of </v>

2448
01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:45.834
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't get a percentage of what he </v>

2449
01:47:46.891 --> 01:47:48.270
<v Speaker 3>saves you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2450
01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:49.403
<v Speaker 3>but if the lawyer on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they can figure out a way to get the </v>

2451
01:47:53.221 --> 01:47:56.820
<v Speaker 3>court to rob you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again you got to give your wife $50,</v>

2452
01:47:56.821 --> 01:48:00.960
<v Speaker 3>million dollars or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that lawyer gets a chunk of that.</v>

2453
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Like he gets paid if he successfully </v>
<v Speaker 3>incentivized for the.</v>

2454
01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:05.933
<v Speaker 3>A lot of roommates to attack the rich </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy through attack the man or the rich </v>

2455
01:48:08.941 --> 01:48:10.980
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sound bar situation.</v>

2456
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.353
<v Speaker 3>But that's the way they get the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get the money if you don't </v>

2457
01:48:15.211 --> 01:48:16.044
<v Speaker 3>get penalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go into the case scott free and </v>

2458
01:48:20.011 --> 01:48:22.410
<v Speaker 3>you know and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not paying that bitch shit.</v>

2459
01:48:23.190 --> 01:48:26.900
<v Speaker 3>This relationship is over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the jury says we agree mr.</v>

2460
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brennan,</v>

2461
01:48:27.630 --> 01:48:30.120
<v Speaker 3>you could walk and so you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right bitch.</v>

2462
01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:34.170
<v Speaker 3>all you're doing is going to pay your </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers hourly rates and they have no.</v>

2463
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:38.370
<v Speaker 3>There's no financial benefit to getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>this done quickly.</v>

2464
01:48:38.730 --> 01:48:39.563
<v Speaker 3>The financial benefit is to drag this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing on for two years and then </v>

2465
01:48:42.361 --> 01:48:43.051
<v Speaker 3>let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2466
01:48:43.051 --> 01:48:44.030
<v Speaker 3>we got out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2467
01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:44.880
<v Speaker 3>and then you realize</v>

2468
01:48:44.970 --> 01:48:48.150
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like mandatory minimum sentencing.</v>

2469
01:48:48.190 --> 01:48:49.023
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing they can really do unless you </v>

2470
01:48:50.581 --> 01:48:54.980
<v Speaker 1>have a prenup or you can do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good,</v>

2471
01:48:54.981 --> 01:48:57.720
<v Speaker 1>a litigator to a or like a whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2472
01:48:57.810 --> 01:48:58.643
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the where they sort of a mediator I </v>

2473
01:49:01.831 --> 01:49:05.190
<v Speaker 1>think you can get paid less than normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the mediator.</v>

2474
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:06.223
<v Speaker 3>This also here's another situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone was talking to me about </v>

2475
01:49:09.711 --> 01:49:10.544
<v Speaker 3>like the donald sterling type sugar </v>
<v Speaker 3>daddy situation like and they were </v>

2476
01:49:13.821 --> 01:49:18.170
<v Speaker 3>saying that it's awful that these men </v>
<v Speaker 3>get preyed upon by these vicious women.</v>

2477
01:49:18.171 --> 01:49:22.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know that,</v>

2478
01:49:22.041 --> 01:49:25.190
<v Speaker 3>that girl is fucking you because your </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich.</v>

2479
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:26.083
<v Speaker 3>If you have a $100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars and you're 90 years old </v>

2480
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:32.780
<v Speaker 3>and this girl tells you she loves you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's with you all the time,</v>

2481
01:49:32.781 --> 01:49:36.590
<v Speaker 3>she's acting perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know that she wants that money</v>

2482
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:39.020
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she's fucking you,</v>

2483
01:49:39.021 --> 01:49:42.810
<v Speaker 3>she deserves a lot of money at least as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much as you're going to at least half.</v>

2484
01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:44.293
<v Speaker 3>If you're a donald sterling type </v>
<v Speaker 3>character and you've got some tWenty </v>

<v Speaker 5>you got to pay her.</v>

2487
01:49:51.630 --> 01:49:55.570
<v Speaker 5>I'll lot because what she's doing is </v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

2488
01:49:55.630 --> 01:49:56.463
<v Speaker 5>very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's pretending to be attracted to you </v>

2489
01:49:58.451 --> 01:50:03.100
<v Speaker 5>and you're disgusting and it's acting </v>
<v Speaker 5>and basically surgery.</v>

2490
01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:08.860
<v Speaker 5>It's the worst parts of acting and and </v>
<v Speaker 5>and surgery.</v>

2491
01:50:09.170 --> 01:50:13.780
<v Speaker 5>It's and it's super valuable to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're that old rich guy and you</v>

<v Speaker 5>You can get anything you want.</v>

2494
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:24.850

<v Speaker 5>They're more accessible to use it.</v>

2495
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:25.703
<v Speaker 5>That a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that a young girl that's actually tried </v>

2496
01:50:26.921 --> 01:50:28.660
<v Speaker 5>to do a young girl that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to do,</v>

2497
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.790
<v Speaker 5>doesn't exists there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unicorns.</v>

2499
01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.230

<v Speaker 5>Mythical creatures.</v>

2500
01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:40.090
<v Speaker 5>They do not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only in your imagination do exist if you</v>

<v Speaker 5>diamonds and furs and whatever the fuck </v>

2505
01:50:56.951 --> 01:50:57.784
<v Speaker 5>attracted to a donald sterling time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that I think there are women </v>

2506
01:51:01.330 --> 01:51:03.550
<v Speaker 5>with big enough father issues that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2507
01:51:03.551 --> 01:51:06.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm legitimately attracted to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I would be a 20 year old.</v>

2508
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.903
<v Speaker 5>I would never say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any like anything when it comes to </v>

2509
01:51:09.791 --> 01:51:11.440
<v Speaker 5>attraction is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2510
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:13.270
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there's chubby chasers,</v>

2511
01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:14.493
<v Speaker 5>people that are into weird shit on </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are in a weird shit and </v>

<v Speaker 5>older men hot.</v>

2513
01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:25.260
<v Speaker 5>They liked the idea of like some white </v>
<v Speaker 5>haired old dude laying dick num.</v>

2514
01:51:25.630 --> 01:51:28.090

<v Speaker 5>into being a furry.</v>

<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

2519
01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:39.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with prostitution on its face.</v>

<v Speaker 5>why do I care?</v>

2521
01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.650
<v Speaker 5>Why is it okay to get a massage?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not okay to get a hand job.</v>

2522

<v Speaker 5>RighT.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Too good.</v>

2524
01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:49.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it's weird.</v>

2525
01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:51.250
<v Speaker 5>We're regulating sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like were puritans.</v>

2526
01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:51.731
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2527
01:51:51.731 --> 01:51:53.560
<v Speaker 5>it's preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also,</v>

2528
01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:55.953
<v Speaker 5>you have to think if it was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would it encourage or would it </v>

2529
01:51:58.481 --> 01:51:59.314
<v Speaker 5>discourage the sex trade?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in terms of like you have to worry </v>

2530
01:52:02.741 --> 01:52:05.480
<v Speaker 5>about like sex slaves and some are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2531
01:52:05.490 --> 01:52:06.323
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are real issues and it's an issue </v>

2532
01:52:08.141 --> 01:52:08.974
<v Speaker 5>that's completely unresolved because </v>
<v Speaker 5>people on both sides of it claim their </v>

2533
01:52:12.311 --> 01:52:14.020
<v Speaker 5>right and they both seem to have a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument.</v>

2534
01:52:14.110 --> 01:52:14.943
<v Speaker 5>And then also the argument is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it possible that there's a big </v>

2535
01:52:18.191 --> 01:52:21.400
<v Speaker 5>fucking difference between a sex slave </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a woman who like,</v>

2536
01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:23.530
<v Speaker 5>maybe she's like a young girl living in </v>
<v Speaker 5>New York city,</v>

2537
01:52:23.531 --> 01:52:24.364
<v Speaker 5>the rents are really high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She decides to fuck some rich guys for </v>

2538
01:52:25.871 --> 01:52:26.704
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why is that worse than working at </v>

2539
01:52:29.411 --> 01:52:30.610
<v Speaker 5>denny's?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2540
01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:31.580
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2541
01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:34.240
<v Speaker 5>why is it worse?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would go a step further,</v>

2542
01:52:34.241 --> 01:52:37.060
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say it is an emotional problem.</v>

2543
01:52:37.061 --> 01:52:39.260
<v Speaker 5>She was molested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She wants to overbid,</v>

2544
01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.990
<v Speaker 5>she has.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She gets whatever.</v>

2545
01:52:41.770 --> 01:52:45.620
<v Speaker 5>That's no different than the reason most</v>
<v Speaker 5>people I know are showbiz</v>

2546
01:52:47.770 --> 01:52:50.390
<v Speaker 1>and I don't see anyone picketing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2547
01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:53.300
<v Speaker 1>It's based on an emotional stunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2548
01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:55.750
<v Speaker 3>And why is it sex?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why sex?</v>

2549
01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:00.190
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that you can't take money</v>
<v Speaker 3>for because jesus.</v>

2550
01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:03.340

2553
01:53:06.341 --> 01:53:08.710
<v Speaker 3>can't take money for ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't take money for it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Surely you must research.</v>

2583
01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she must've done something </v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile.</v>

2584
01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

2585
01:54:13.090 --> 01:54:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least something.</v>

2586
01:54:16.170 --> 01:54:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Some of write up a memo or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2587
01:54:18.710 --> 01:54:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Is that a business partner or is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing of like this thing of sex?</v>

2588
01:54:24.081 --> 01:54:26.690
<v Speaker 1>If you look at sex as this holy </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrament,</v>

2589
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:28.183
<v Speaker 1>than it is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at every ejaculation as the </v>

2590
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:33.680
<v Speaker 1>holy sacrament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which the church would have you believe?</v>

2591
01:54:33.681 --> 01:54:35.300
<v Speaker 1>And then they get into government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make laws,</v>

2592
01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:36.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2593
01:54:36.441 --> 01:54:37.274
<v Speaker 1>then then it's not legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at it like a milking or </v>

2594
01:54:42.171 --> 01:54:47.171
<v Speaker 1>even a teeth cleaning or a haircut or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that you need,</v>

2595
01:54:47.631 --> 01:54:50.210
<v Speaker 1>any service that you need fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly,</v>

2596
01:54:51.330 --> 01:54:52.670
<v Speaker 1>then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all,</v>

2597
01:54:52.671 --> 01:54:55.160
<v Speaker 1>all laws are like nonsense for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>part</v>

2598
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:57.750
<v Speaker 3>is part of the problem too is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2599
01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:02.860
<v Speaker 3>immediately accessible nature of the sex</v>
<v Speaker 3>is troublesome to some people because if</v>

2600
01:55:03.141 --> 01:55:03.974
<v Speaker 3>you have a relationship with someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's basically fucking you for your </v>

2601
01:55:06.261 --> 01:55:09.830
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at least you have this relationship</v>

2602
01:55:09.831 --> 01:55:11.330
<v Speaker 3>with them and you hang out with them for</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

2603
01:55:11.331 --> 01:55:12.164
<v Speaker 3>you have the time with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of time that's not having </v>

2604
01:55:14.631 --> 01:55:15.464
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you actually have to be like friends </v>

<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

2631
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:19.183
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be able to tell people </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they can or can't do with their </v>

2632
01:56:22.701 --> 01:56:24.140
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2634
01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:28.100

2639
01:56:40.221 --> 01:56:44.210
<v Speaker 3>of people that have some serious fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain damage from playing football.</v>

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:08.673
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a late onset tHing for a lot of </v>

2650
01:57:10.001 --> 01:57:11.140
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2651
01:57:11.170 --> 01:57:12.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2652
01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:13.053
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a guy who who plays and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying like I said to them about </v>

2653
01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:18.250
<v Speaker 1>he plays whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I in him,</v>

2654
01:57:18.251 --> 01:57:18.910
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2655
01:57:18.910 --> 01:57:20.710
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that hard.</v>

2656
01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:23.830
<v Speaker 1>He goes on on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's authentic.</v>

2657
01:57:23.831 --> 01:57:25.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to remember more shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2658
01:57:25.841 --> 01:57:30.841
<v Speaker 1>but there are times on defense where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll black out and not know what's going</v>

2659
01:57:31.151 --> 01:57:33.520
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just keep playing,</v>

2660
01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.090
<v Speaker 1>which just like jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2661
01:57:37.091 --> 01:57:38.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2662
01:57:38.650 --> 01:57:43.210
<v Speaker 1>so is the blackout from memory or from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from penn's impact sHe had.</v>

2663
01:57:43.211 --> 01:57:44.160
<v Speaker 1>it's christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2664
01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Cranial impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2665
01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like that's all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say it like he said it.</v>

2666
01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:51.870
<v Speaker 1>It completely like conversational </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2667
01:57:51.970 --> 01:57:52.890
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say it like</v>

2668
01:57:54.090 --> 01:57:55.330
<v Speaker 3>not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>

2669
01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:56.433
<v Speaker 3>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I think they're used to so much </v>

2670
01:57:58.511 --> 01:57:59.800
<v Speaker 3>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2671
01:57:59.850 --> 01:58:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Well They used to running at each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>full clip.</v>

2672
01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:03.663
<v Speaker 3>We don't think of it as being the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent sport because the thing of mma </v>

2673
01:58:06.911 --> 01:58:09.700
<v Speaker 3>is being more violent because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually trying to hit the person.</v>

2674
01:58:09.730 --> 01:58:12.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the goal is try to hurt them with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hands or your feet,</v>

2675
01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:16.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's not nearly as powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone running into you,</v>

2676
01:58:16.630 --> 01:58:20.320
<v Speaker 3>like someone running in us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy amount of force into your</v>

2677
01:58:20.321 --> 01:58:21.154
<v Speaker 3>head with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where the league may be </v>

2678
01:58:23.171 --> 01:58:24.004
<v Speaker 3>headed is no helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they go flying through the </v>

2679
01:58:26.141 --> 01:58:26.974
<v Speaker 3>air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you see guys get clipped and spin </v>

2680
01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:31.570
<v Speaker 3>and they spin or they disguise </v>
<v Speaker 3>gravitate.</v>

2681
01:58:31.590 --> 01:58:36.190
<v Speaker 3>They like take you like somebody just </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked a 200 plus pound man through the</v>

2682
01:58:36.191 --> 01:58:37.420
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a pillow?</v>

2683
01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like data.</v>

2684
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:41.740
<v Speaker 3>That's a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet that guy just hit by a truck.</v>

2685
01:58:41.741 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>He got hit</v>

2686
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 2>by a 300 pound truck every play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think someone died.</v>

2687
01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Not even beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I watch,</v>

2688
01:58:49.330 --> 01:58:50.230
<v Speaker 2>when you watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

2689
01:58:50.231 --> 01:58:51.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's dead.</v>

2690
01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:52.413
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'd be dead if that happened to </v>

2691
01:58:54.101 --> 01:58:54.934
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it goes to that weird thing where </v>

2692
01:58:56.351 --> 01:58:57.184
<v Speaker 2>they have powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more powerful fucking mandibles and </v>

2693
01:59:00.551 --> 01:59:04.420
<v Speaker 2>weird muscles and like I think they </v>
<v Speaker 2>build up a tolerance.</v>

2694
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:05.343
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think after awhile they all just go </v>

2695
01:59:08.231 --> 01:59:09.310
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

2696
01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2697
01:59:13.450 --> 01:59:14.283
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Currently they're running at each other </v>

2698
01:59:15.791 --> 01:59:17.140
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here comes another guy.</v>

2699
01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Lookout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

2700
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:20.200
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2701
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:21.160
<v Speaker 2>that was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>

2702
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:22.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>excellent.</v>

2703
01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2704
01:59:23.111 --> 01:59:24.190
<v Speaker 2>that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

2705
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:26.440
<v Speaker 2>there's something dope about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2706
01:59:26.441 --> 01:59:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Like with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

2707
01:59:28.570 --> 01:59:30.280
<v Speaker 2>He took a hard hit there and he kept </v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

2708
01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:31.473
<v Speaker 2>It's completely elemental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most basic instincts in the </v>

2709
01:59:36.131 --> 01:59:38.590
<v Speaker 2>world is like running from a scary </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2710
01:59:38.650 --> 01:59:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's fruit.</v>

2711
01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:42.370
<v Speaker 2>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that element of it that works.</v>

2712
01:59:42.371 --> 01:59:44.080
<v Speaker 2>It's so primal that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

2713
01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:45.160
<v Speaker 2>it's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2714
01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:49.840
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy got lambasted.</v>

2715
01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about your running </v>

2716
01:59:52.151 --> 01:59:54.880
<v Speaker 2>from someone who's trying to harm you as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2717
01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the most basic primal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monster,</v>

2718
01:59:59.171 --> 02:00:01.120
<v Speaker 2>the lion that whatever's coming to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2719
02:00:01.450 --> 02:00:02.283
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the warfare element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the ground warfare of like </v>

2720
02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:08.220
<v Speaker 2>capturing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the taking the,</v>

2721
02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:11.140
<v Speaker 2>the hill or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get why it works.</v>

2722
02:00:11.141 --> 02:00:13.000
<v Speaker 2>I think they just got to get rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>helmets.</v>

2723
02:00:13.330 --> 02:00:18.330
<v Speaker 2>It's amazingly difficult to move your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body the way these guys are doing.</v>

2724
02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch the oj documentary?</v>

2725
02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:23.070
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

2726
02:00:23.150 --> 02:00:23.983
<v Speaker 2>the big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big takeawaYs is how good oj was a </v>

2727
02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:32.080
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you forget I'm,</v>

2728
02:00:32.210 --> 02:00:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not old enough to remember playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>

2729
02:00:34.510 --> 02:00:38.200
<v Speaker 2>so I heard he ran for 2000 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

2730
02:00:38.410 --> 02:00:39.930
<v Speaker 2>one of the episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

2731
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.780
<v Speaker 2>five parts.</v>

2732
02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:43.150
<v Speaker 2>One of the parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically just about that,</v>

2733
02:00:43.570 --> 02:00:45.070
<v Speaker 2>about how nice he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Football.</v>

2734
02:00:45.130 --> 02:00:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did it in 14 games and,</v>

2735
02:00:47.941 --> 02:00:50.350
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

2736
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:52.510
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2737
02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:55.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his doctor said that if he had to</v>

2738
02:00:55.481 --> 02:00:59.080
<v Speaker 2>rerun the trial today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would bring up ct.</v>

2739
02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

2740
02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:02.593
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's weird thing to do Because then </v>

2741
02:01:03.761 --> 02:01:06.310
<v Speaker 2>they would have to admit that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually did it because the trial.</v>

2742
02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But can you let.</v>

2743
02:01:08.630 --> 02:01:09.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it would have to make a law about </v>

2744
02:01:10.751 --> 02:01:11.920
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's weird too,</v>

2745
02:01:11.921 --> 02:01:14.260
<v Speaker 2>because we all know he's in jail for </v>
<v Speaker 2>those murders.</v>

2746
02:01:14.330 --> 02:01:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

2747
02:01:16.730 --> 02:01:17.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2748
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:19.690
<v Speaker 2>They found a loophole and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2749
02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any reason souvenirs.</v>

2750
02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:27.400
<v Speaker 2>He's in jail for really the fifth part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you gotta watch it by the way,</v>

2751
02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:31.740
<v Speaker 2>like I demand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They demand it because it's,</v>

2752
02:01:31.770 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 2>it recontextualized something that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you know,</v>

2753
02:01:33.911 --> 02:01:35.010
<v Speaker 2>everything about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2754
02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it talks to mark,</v>

2755
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 2>mark furman's justification for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>being racist</v>

2756
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.110
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not racist.</v>

2757
02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:45.380
<v Speaker 1>when I was out on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody wanted to go with me,</v>

2758
02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd fight them straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's his reasoning.</v>

2759
02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:50.333
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so therefore is therefore I'm not </v>

2760
02:01:53.421 --> 02:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you just like,</v>

2761
02:01:54.441 --> 02:01:55.670
<v Speaker 1>whew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

2762
02:01:55.671 --> 02:01:57.950
<v Speaker 1>you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like mark from it after watching</v>

2763
02:01:57.951 --> 02:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>the movie really kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like meaning it,</v>

2764
02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I understood his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes sense to himself,</v>

2765
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see his lodging guard.</v>

2766
02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I know why he thinks the way he thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2767
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like I'm a Fan of the guy,</v>

2768
02:02:13.281 --> 02:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>

2769
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2770
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2771
02:02:18.591 --> 02:02:21.440
<v Speaker 1>like it's an amazing movie and say could</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

2772
02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they did say with cta then we've kind</v>

2773
02:02:24.501 --> 02:02:26.270
<v Speaker 1>of lost the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like temporary insanity,</v>

2774
02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:27.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2775
02:02:27.281 --> 02:02:29.560
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to,</v>

2776
02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:33.370
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to really quantify what kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of effects he t hat on him.</v>

2777
02:02:33.690 --> 02:02:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd have to be able to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2778
02:02:35.441 --> 02:02:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it responsible for you?</v>

2779
02:02:37.061 --> 02:02:37.691
<v Speaker 3>Go on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2780
02:02:37.691 --> 02:02:41.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should I take that from math thing?</v>

2781
02:02:41.530 --> 02:02:43.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about doing this too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is it,</v>

2782
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.823
<v Speaker 3>is it completelY responsible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how much of the cte is responsible </v>

2783
02:02:47.741 --> 02:02:48.574
<v Speaker 3>for your decision making?</v>

2784
02:02:49.010 --> 02:02:49.843
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are guys that save a blackout </v>

2785
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:52.833
<v Speaker 1>behaviorally</v>

2786
02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:55.740
<v Speaker 3>blackout and you have to believe him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2787
02:02:55.741 --> 02:02:58.760
<v Speaker 3>you have to think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's for sure are going to be some,</v>

2788
02:02:58.761 --> 02:02:59.594
<v Speaker 3>some severe neurological implications of</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting smashed in the head over and </v>

2789
02:03:04.351 --> 02:03:06.660
<v Speaker 3>over again by the big gigantic dudes </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2790
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:10.740
<v Speaker 3>You've got an cte for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>concussions.</v>

2791
02:03:10.741 --> 02:03:11.580
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

2792
02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:15.050
<v Speaker 1>What were the vomiting and grogginess </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit?</v>

2793
02:03:15.070 --> 02:03:15.903
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2794
02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:16.913
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2795
02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:17.853
<v Speaker 3>I do remember a sparring sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sparring sessions where I got mY </v>

2796
02:03:21.331 --> 02:03:22.164
<v Speaker 3>bell rang and I'd go home and lay in bed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then my fucking head would be </v>

2797
02:03:25.261 --> 02:03:28.200
<v Speaker 3>throbbing and aching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just ball ball.</v>

2798
02:03:28.230 --> 02:03:29.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just sitting with every heartbeat </v>

2799
02:03:30.330 --> 02:03:31.163
<v Speaker 3>and you think I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing with my parrain if </v>

2800
02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:34.940
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2801
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:37.230
<v Speaker 3>I come to sun even any money in this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2802
02:03:37.231 --> 02:03:38.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting punched in the head all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2803
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I was doing a lot of sparring and </v>

2804
02:03:43.291 --> 02:03:44.850
<v Speaker 3>wearing headgear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2805
02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2806
02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Why gear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't see kicks coming.</v>

2807
02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:50.640
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like headgear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Headgears weird.</v>

2808
02:03:50.641 --> 02:03:53.180
<v Speaker 3>When you throw in kicks with other guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys wearing them,</v>

2809
02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:55.800
<v Speaker 3>a lot of ufc fighters were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't.</v>

2810
02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a problem with them.</v>

2811
02:03:57.961 --> 02:03:59.460
<v Speaker 3>I tried to were the ones that were the.</v>

2812
02:03:59.670 --> 02:04:02.370
<v Speaker 3>There's a bar that goes across your face</v>
<v Speaker 3>to protect your nose.</v>

2813
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:04.230
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't see shit.</v>

2814
02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:06.270
<v Speaker 3>I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

2815
02:04:06.271 --> 02:04:07.104
<v Speaker 3>I had to go like the Mike Tyson style,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one that Mike Tyson used to </v>

2816
02:04:10.051 --> 02:04:12.810
<v Speaker 3>where where he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of his face was exposed.</v>

2817
02:04:12.811 --> 02:04:13.644
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people kind of criticized it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they said that he was more open </v>

2818
02:04:15.181 --> 02:04:17.670
<v Speaker 3>to cuts and there's a reason why they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had those big cheek,</v>

2819
02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:20.640
<v Speaker 3>but you can't see left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like peripherals,</v>

2820
02:04:20.910 --> 02:04:21.743
<v Speaker 3>like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're sparring a guy and he throws </v>

2821
02:04:22.801 --> 02:04:23.634
<v Speaker 3>like real wide stuff on you especially </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks guys who sneak kicks around your </v>

2822
02:04:27.901 --> 02:04:28.734
<v Speaker 3>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you literally don't see them until </v>

2823
02:04:30.001 --> 02:04:32.940
<v Speaker 3>they're on your neck and it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like it.</v>

2824
02:04:32.941 --> 02:04:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather get hit with no head gear on.</v>

2825
02:04:36.150 --> 02:04:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Well then you have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2826
02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I feel</v>

2827
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.620
<v Speaker 4>like I can move with it better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can still,</v>

2828
02:04:40.621 --> 02:04:45.300
<v Speaker 4>you're still in a bad spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the real Issue is cuts because a lot</v>

2829
02:04:45.301 --> 02:04:48.270
<v Speaker 4>of guys get cut and sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might collide heads,</v>

2830
02:04:48.271 --> 02:04:50.880
<v Speaker 4>you might an elbow or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and when that does happen,</v>

2831
02:04:50.881 --> 02:04:51.714
<v Speaker 4>the problem is then it could delay a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight and if you're an mma fighter and </v>

2832
02:04:55.021 --> 02:04:55.854
<v Speaker 4>you're training for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably pretty smart to wear </v>

2833
02:04:57.340 --> 02:04:58.173
<v Speaker 4>headgear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't really protect your head </v>

2834
02:04:59.911 --> 02:05:01.320
<v Speaker 4>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

2835
02:05:01.321 --> 02:05:02.154
<v Speaker 4>there's an argument that it acts as more</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a fulcrum point because the headgear </v>

2836
02:05:05.670 --> 02:05:08.220
<v Speaker 4>makes your head larger so you can like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2837
02:05:08.221 --> 02:05:09.690
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait and everything.</v>

2838
02:05:09.691 --> 02:05:11.790
<v Speaker 4>It actually can make your head move </v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

2839
02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:14.130
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny what happens to your brain,</v>

2840
02:05:14.370 --> 02:05:17.280
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just goes flying against your skull.</v>

2841
02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:21.930
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing technical about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just goes like bullies.</v>

2842
02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2843
02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:26.940
<v Speaker 4>And it can't maintain signal while </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going on.</v>

2844
02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:32.190
<v Speaker 4>He can't maintain order and especially </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get hit in the base of your head,</v>

2845
02:05:32.490 --> 02:05:35.660
<v Speaker 4>like one of the scariest kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the can get hit with it.</v>

2846
02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:37.770
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys get hit with his neck </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks,</v>

2847
02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:41.070
<v Speaker 4>you get necked and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get neck kicked,</v>

2848
02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:44.310
<v Speaker 4>guys go down like they got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a,</v>

2849
02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:46.210
<v Speaker 4>there's a because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of what,</v>

2850
02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:47.040
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2851
02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:49.620
<v Speaker 4>what gets hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just shut your brain off.</v>

2852
02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:51.300
<v Speaker 4>Uh oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this thing.</v>

2853
02:05:51.301 --> 02:05:52.680
<v Speaker 4>That's the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2854
02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:57.300
<v Speaker 4>it's the shin slams basically against </v>
<v Speaker 4>the base of your skull.</v>

2855
02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:58.433
<v Speaker 4>It's like really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The back of the sheet is basically a </v>

2856
02:05:59.830 --> 02:06:00.880
<v Speaker 4>switchblade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2857
02:06:01.050 --> 02:06:06.050
<v Speaker 4>it's under here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Google this ernesto hoost kaos.</v>

2858
02:06:06.571 --> 02:06:07.404
<v Speaker 4>Maury smith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maurice with smith is a good friend of </v>

2859
02:06:09.931 --> 02:06:12.960
<v Speaker 4>mine and he's a former ufc heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 4>champion.</v>

2860
02:06:12.961 --> 02:06:14.700
<v Speaker 4>Former world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more thaI fighter,</v>

2861
02:06:14.890 --> 02:06:16.260
<v Speaker 4>more more time champion.</v>

2862
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:20.370
<v Speaker 4>He's a bad motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he fought this guy who's just one of</v>

2863
02:06:20.371 --> 02:06:22.170
<v Speaker 4>the greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ernesto hoost.</v>

2864
02:06:22.171 --> 02:06:26.040
<v Speaker 4>And he got caught with a kick to his </v>
<v Speaker 4>neck and I knew how tough more.</v>

2865
02:06:26.041 --> 02:06:27.900
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew how good of a fighter he is.</v>

2866
02:06:28.170 --> 02:06:32.850
<v Speaker 4>So when you see a guy who's at the level</v>
<v Speaker 4>that maurice's watch this boat,</v>

2867
02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:38.300
<v Speaker 4>see how he threw that over the top of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his head and it just shut maurice off.</v>

2868
02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:39.413
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He slides on the outside and he lifts </v>

2869
02:06:42.361 --> 02:06:46.080
<v Speaker 4>his head up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ellipses a foot up brother and goes over</v>

2870
02:06:46.081 --> 02:06:50.130
<v Speaker 4>the shoulder or maurice doesn't even see</v>
<v Speaker 4>it coming until it's already too late.</v>

2871
02:06:50.210 --> 02:06:53.460
<v Speaker 4>It hits the back of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy and that's his foot,</v>

2872
02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:55.470
<v Speaker 4>which hasn't even been hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2873
02:06:55.471 --> 02:06:57.510
<v Speaker 4>it's still hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ernesto hoost foot,</v>

2874
02:06:57.511 --> 02:07:00.240
<v Speaker 4>but it could be way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

2875
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:03.950
<v Speaker 4>If it was a little bit further back then</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have been over,</v>

2876
02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:05.093
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of guys knock guys out dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>coal that's in a punch to the back of </v>

2877
02:07:08.371 --> 02:07:09.360
<v Speaker 4>the head and boxing.</v>

2878
02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:10.193
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you can kick guys and when you've </v>

2879
02:07:11.841 --> 02:07:12.674
<v Speaker 4>landed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oftentimes lands in the back of the </v>

2880
02:07:13.771 --> 02:07:14.604
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one ever thinks is anything wrong </v>

2881
02:07:15.301 --> 02:07:16.710
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real weird.</v>

2882
02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:19.300
<v Speaker 4>It's a super gray so you can't punch In </v>
<v Speaker 4>mma.</v>

2883
02:07:19.301 --> 02:07:21.480
<v Speaker 4>You cannot punch the back of the neck </v>
<v Speaker 4>and head,</v>

2884
02:07:21.481 --> 02:07:23.010
<v Speaker 4>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2885
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:25.110
<v Speaker 4>That's very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so odd.</v>

2886
02:07:25.111 --> 02:07:25.561
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

2887
02:07:25.561 --> 02:07:30.420
<v Speaker 4>It's an issue with kickboxing as well </v>
<v Speaker 4>because some of the best techniques land</v>

2888
02:07:30.450 --> 02:07:31.283
<v Speaker 4>on the back of the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like here's another one that does all </v>

2889
02:07:32.791 --> 02:07:35.250
<v Speaker 4>the time too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll kicks like someone will throw,</v>

2890
02:07:35.251 --> 02:07:36.370
<v Speaker 4>we'll kick like a spinning</v>

2891
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:40.030
<v Speaker 3>heel kick and they'll catch a guy boom </v>
<v Speaker 3>right on the back of the hat.</v>

2892
02:07:40.031 --> 02:07:44.980
<v Speaker 3>It happens all the time and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>technically it's an illegal place to hit</v>

2893
02:07:44.981 --> 02:07:48.460
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because head kicks are like,</v>

2894
02:07:49.090 --> 02:07:53.020
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of like the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>striking weapon I give you knock someone</v>

2895
02:07:53.021 --> 02:07:53.854
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like knocking someone out with a head </v>

2896
02:07:54.281 --> 02:07:55.114
<v Speaker 3>kick because like the ultimate striking </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain because it's everything we </v>

2897
02:07:57.821 --> 02:08:00.040
<v Speaker 3>always wanted to see in karate movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2898
02:08:00.041 --> 02:08:00.874
<v Speaker 3>so because of that is so encouraged to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like push the guy just because it's so </v>

2899
02:08:07.271 --> 02:08:09.310
<v Speaker 3>encouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't think about the implications of</v>

2900
02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:10.173
<v Speaker 3>kicking someone in the back of the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is probably way worse than </v>

2901
02:08:12.371 --> 02:08:14.290
<v Speaker 3>punching someone in the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

2902
02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:17.950
<v Speaker 3>But it happenS all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing and all the time in mma.</v>

2903
02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:20.770
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those weird things where </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to talk about it and,</v>

2904
02:08:20.910 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 3>but everybody knows that's the case.</v>

2905
02:08:22.510 --> 02:08:23.343
<v Speaker 3>You're kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kicking a guy on a totally </v>

2906
02:08:24.731 --> 02:08:25.564
<v Speaker 3>illegal spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not trying how double the </v>

2907
02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:29.680
<v Speaker 3>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all know it.</v>

2908
02:08:29.710 --> 02:08:31.450
<v Speaker 3>They all know it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows that,</v>

2909
02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:32.313
<v Speaker 3>especially everybody's been hit by one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those are hinton's hit somebody with </v>

2910
02:08:34.721 --> 02:08:36.130
<v Speaker 3>one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know where you're hitting them.</v>

2911
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:38.110
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times you're hitting the back </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the head.</v>

2912
02:08:38.170 --> 02:08:39.003
<v Speaker 3>If you're aware of can you punch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone you can punch the all the </v>

2913
02:08:41.531 --> 02:08:43.960
<v Speaker 3>back all over the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can punch the legs,</v>

2914
02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:47.530
<v Speaker 3>you can punch the groin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can punch somebody in the ass.</v>

2915
02:08:48.190 --> 02:08:50.470
<v Speaker 3>You can punch in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can punch him in the back.</v>

2916
02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:53.560
<v Speaker 3>You can't punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>punch above the elbow.</v>

2917
02:08:53.561 --> 02:08:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Strike the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some weird rules there.</v>

2918
02:08:55.781 --> 02:08:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about this yesterday.</v>

2919
02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:58.953
<v Speaker 3>Jamie and I looked up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie said they came up with some new </v>

2920
02:09:01.211 --> 02:09:05.140
<v Speaker 3>rules and one of them involves knees to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the head to a downed opponent.</v>

2921
02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:06.273
<v Speaker 3>Now a downed opponent means you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have both hands down on the mat and </v>

2922
02:09:10.031 --> 02:09:11.740
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your palm has to be flat.</v>

2923
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:16.450
<v Speaker 3>You can't have just one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have one hand up,</v>

2924
02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:17.433
<v Speaker 3>they can see you in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's not a downed opponent because </v>

2925
02:09:20.741 --> 02:09:21.574
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticizing this down to potent thing </v>

2926
02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:25.053
<v Speaker 3>because people were sort of what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would call gaming the system where you </v>

2927
02:09:27.761 --> 02:09:31.060
<v Speaker 3>would lean down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just touch your hand on the ground,</v>

2928
02:09:31.061 --> 02:09:33.190
<v Speaker 3>like as if it's safe and then the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't hit you,</v>

2929
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:35.470
<v Speaker 3>so that's how you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting out of exchanging.</v>

2930
02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:36.573
<v Speaker 3>Got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of you're totally capable of </v>

2931
02:09:37.961 --> 02:09:40.600
<v Speaker 3>standing up or totally capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>covering up a.</v>

2932
02:09:40.601 --> 02:09:41.434
<v Speaker 3>You can make your choice like you got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this position or he got you to this </v>

2933
02:09:44.051 --> 02:09:46.300
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's advantageous to feeLs like a fairly</v>

2934
02:09:46.301 --> 02:09:47.410
<v Speaker 3>standard position.</v>

2935
02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens all the time,</v>

2936
02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:53.760
<v Speaker 3>but the issue becomes if you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>incapable of getting out of the way,</v>

2937
02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:57.070
<v Speaker 3>should you be able to nea guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head because some guys like when they're</v>

2938
02:09:57.071 --> 02:09:58.360
<v Speaker 3>down like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2939
02:09:58.361 --> 02:09:59.194
<v Speaker 3>well that's a devastating maneuver to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nea guy and ahead when they're in that </v>

2940
02:10:01.481 --> 02:10:04.210
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they for for good reason,</v>

2941
02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:05.253
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to decide when it should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>legal because there's other </v>

2942
02:10:07.781 --> 02:10:08.614
<v Speaker 3>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could do crazy stuff like stomping </v>

2943
02:10:10.061 --> 02:10:10.894
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can stomp people like stomped their </v>

2944
02:10:13.031 --> 02:10:16.120
<v Speaker 3>head in certain organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was a big one in pride.</v>

2945
02:10:16.121 --> 02:10:18.250
<v Speaker 3>You could soccer kick guys and stomp </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2946
02:10:19.450 --> 02:10:22.300
<v Speaker 3>but oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't allow elbows on the ground.</v>

2947
02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:24.243
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They felt elbows on the ground were </v>

2948
02:10:25.001 --> 02:10:28.360
<v Speaker 3>barbaric or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a line.</v>

2949
02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:33.010
<v Speaker 3>That's everybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are so crazy with their lines.</v>

2950
02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 3>They draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I pee</v>

2951
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:35.000
<v Speaker 4>real quick?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>

2952
02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:37.120
<v Speaker 4>That's the part where I have to go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bathroom.</v>

2953
02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:40.340
<v Speaker 4>You drinking that delicious pellgrino I </v>
<v Speaker 4>got into bubbly water lately.</v>

2954
02:10:40.341 --> 02:10:42.350
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate to admit it.</v>

2955
02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:44.480
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like sparkling water now.</v>

2956
02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:47.120
<v Speaker 4>I used to think there's no nutritional </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits.</v>

2957
02:10:47.121 --> 02:10:49.730
<v Speaker 4>I had it in my head that like regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>water was better for you.</v>

2958
02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:53.790
<v Speaker 9>Was that your thing?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2959
02:10:54.190 --> 02:10:55.200
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the uh,</v>

2960
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:57.560
<v Speaker 9>keepers of the ark of the covenant.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I found it.</v>

2961
02:10:57.570 --> 02:10:58.403
<v Speaker 9>I looked up,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I found something where it said that </v>

2962
02:10:59.731 --> 02:11:03.360
<v Speaker 9>there was a report of one of them having</v>
<v Speaker 9>milky cataracts and a description,</v>

2963
02:11:03.361 --> 02:11:05.880
<v Speaker 9>but it's not all of them from what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 9>reading.</v>

2964
02:11:06.130 --> 02:11:11.130
<v Speaker 4>Goddammit graham hancock christians in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ethiopia have long claim to have the ark</v>

2965
02:11:13.661 --> 02:11:15.490
<v Speaker 4>of the covenant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A reporter investigated.</v>

2966
02:11:15.850 --> 02:11:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Go down to the very last chapter or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>very last paragraph rather.</v>

2967
02:11:21.730 --> 02:11:24.700
<v Speaker 4>See what the fuck they said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2968
02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:26.380
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing about these things.</v>

2969
02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:29.890
<v Speaker 4>The final moments of any search,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could not judge whether the ark of the</v>

2970
02:11:29.891 --> 02:11:32.740
<v Speaker 4>covenant truly rested inside the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nondescript chapel.</v>

2971
02:11:32.741 --> 02:11:37.741
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps ma menelIk manilex traveling </v>
<v Speaker 4>companions did take it and spirited home</v>

2972
02:11:40.421 --> 02:11:42.720
<v Speaker 4>to Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps its origins here.</v>

2973
02:11:42.730 --> 02:11:44.710
<v Speaker 4>Stem from the tail spun by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So nothing.</v>

2974
02:11:44.770 --> 02:11:45.610
<v Speaker 4>He's got no evidence.</v>

2975
02:11:46.750 --> 02:11:47.583
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's apparently also a storm and </v>

2976
02:11:48.910 --> 02:11:51.490
<v Speaker 9>leaky roof that was going to make a move</v>
<v Speaker 9>it in 2012.</v>

2977
02:11:51.491 --> 02:11:53.110
<v Speaker 9>But I didn't find anything that said </v>
<v Speaker 9>that,</v>

2978
02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:55.690
<v Speaker 9>whether it was seen or not.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that,</v>

2979
02:11:55.691 --> 02:11:56.830
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the battery,</v>

2980
02:11:56.831 --> 02:12:01.660
<v Speaker 9>the baghdad battery was supposedly also </v>
<v Speaker 9>not a battery that think it was used for</v>

2981
02:12:01.710 --> 02:12:04.630
<v Speaker 9>electroplating statues with gold and </v>
<v Speaker 9>silver.</v>

2982
02:12:04.690 --> 02:12:05.291
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that makes sense.</v>

2983
02:12:05.291 --> 02:12:06.520
<v Speaker 9>There was a little bit of a charge in </v>
<v Speaker 9>there,</v>

2984
02:12:06.521 --> 02:12:09.400
<v Speaker 9>but not enough to be considered a </v>
<v Speaker 9>battery thing.</v>

2985
02:12:09.401 --> 02:12:10.031
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh.</v>

2986
02:12:10.031 --> 02:12:11.800
<v Speaker 9>So it was just a way they kind of made </v>
<v Speaker 9>paint.</v>

2987
02:12:13.210 --> 02:12:14.650
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>sorta started cover stuff,</v>

2988
02:12:14.651 --> 02:12:15.484
<v Speaker 9>so I think they had a hypothesIs that it</v>
<v Speaker 9>would spin it in there and it would </v>

2989
02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:19.570
<v Speaker 9>create a bond</v>

2990
02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:22.970
<v Speaker 4>to the stone or whatever they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense too.</v>

2991
02:12:23.130 --> 02:12:25.800
<v Speaker 4>So that's the way they would use it on </v>
<v Speaker 4>statues and stuff.</v>

2992
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:30.850
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn it was so cool.</v>

2993
02:12:30.851 --> 02:12:31.684
<v Speaker 4>When you think of how these people had </v>
<v Speaker 4>to use a little monkey brains to invent </v>

2994
02:12:36.791 --> 02:12:41.230
<v Speaker 4>the first wheel or did vent pottery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the people that.</v>

2995
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:43.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when did theY figure out pottery?</v>

2996
02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:48.450
<v Speaker 4>So if you had a guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's guess,</v>

2997
02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:50.880
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>5,000</v>

2998
02:12:50.881 --> 02:12:52.890
<v Speaker 4>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Four after a fire,</v>

2999
02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:55.410
<v Speaker 4>not fire after fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just figured out what he get.</v>

3000
02:12:55.411 --> 02:12:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Hardened stuff stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably just accidentally.</v>

3001
02:12:57.450 --> 02:13:00.060
<v Speaker 4>Let's google it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say a 5,000</v>

3002
02:13:00.061 --> 02:13:02.330
<v Speaker 4>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3003
02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:06.740
<v Speaker 4>because that doesn't make any sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's like qumran or not qumran.</v>

3004
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:10.640
<v Speaker 4>Samira samira was before that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>$6,000.</v>

3005
02:13:10.641 --> 02:13:12.290
<v Speaker 4>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>potter's wheel though.</v>

3006
02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:13.251
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3007
02:13:13.251 --> 02:13:14.084
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This potter's wheel was invented in </v>

3008
02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:19.610
<v Speaker 4>mesopotamia sometime in between 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>and 4,000.</v>

3009
02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:22.280
<v Speaker 4>Does that say 4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>4,000</v>

3010
02:13:22.281 --> 02:13:26.510
<v Speaker 4>bc period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys going over ancient inventions?</v>

3011
02:13:26.511 --> 02:13:27.344
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to figure out when they </v>

3012
02:13:28.701 --> 02:13:30.620
<v Speaker 4>invented pottery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3013
02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:31.473
<v Speaker 4>that has to</v>

3014
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:35.100
<v Speaker 3>baghdad battery that we were looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>

3015
02:13:35.101 --> 02:13:35.934
<v Speaker 3>Apparently jamie found out that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>might've been used to electroplate gold </v>

3016
02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:40.650
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It created a small charge,</v>

3017
02:13:40.651 --> 02:13:41.484
<v Speaker 3>but really wasn't a battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just used to make like almost </v>

3018
02:13:43.741 --> 02:13:47.560
<v Speaker 3>like electric paint and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out.</v>

3019
02:13:47.561 --> 02:13:48.001
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3020
02:13:48.001 --> 02:13:49.530
<v Speaker 3>how fucking cool is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>

3021
02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:50.993
<v Speaker 3>how crazy were the first people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first monkey people from like a </v>

3022
02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:58.200
<v Speaker 3>million years ago at wherever I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured out how to make a flint knife.</v>

3023
02:13:58.650 --> 02:13:59.483
<v Speaker 3>You know the first people that figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out pottery if figured out how to roll </v>

3024
02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:04.830
<v Speaker 3>dirt and light it on fire.</v>

3025
02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:07.820
<v Speaker 9>There's a duncan brought up as last </v>
<v Speaker 9>appearance.</v>

3026
02:14:07.821 --> 02:14:10.100
<v Speaker 9>Not as most recent one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's a whole Youtube channel.</v>

3027
02:14:10.101 --> 02:14:10.934
<v Speaker 9>have a guy that does this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He makes tons of different experiments </v>

3028
02:14:14.450 --> 02:14:17.390
<v Speaker 9>and trying out primitive technologies </v>
<v Speaker 9>and processes.</v>

3029
02:14:17.391 --> 02:14:18.224
<v Speaker 9>He doesn't talk at all.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to look it up so I can find </v>

3030
02:14:19.461 --> 02:14:21.530
<v Speaker 9>out what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but It just made a really cool one where</v>

3031
02:14:21.531 --> 02:14:26.000
<v Speaker 9>he pulled little pieces of metal out of </v>
<v Speaker 9>iron ore and he had to.</v>

3032
02:14:26.540 --> 02:14:31.070
<v Speaker 9>He invented this way to get his flame </v>
<v Speaker 9>hotter using some sort of thing.</v>

3033
02:14:31.071 --> 02:14:33.770
<v Speaker 9>He and he shows you make he makes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The whole thing was really,</v>

3034
02:14:33.771 --> 02:14:34.604
<v Speaker 9>really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Shit.</v>

3035
02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:36.253
<v Speaker 3>Just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When You think of how long ago was it </v>

3036
02:14:38.861 --> 02:14:39.281
<v Speaker 3>felt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3037
02:14:39.281 --> 02:14:42.130
<v Speaker 3>we don't even know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's someone first invented pottery.</v>

3038
02:14:42.370 --> 02:14:45.940
<v Speaker 3>That potter's wheel was at least 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least 4,000</v>

3039
02:14:45.941 --> 02:14:46.500
<v Speaker 3>bc.</v>

3040
02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:47.333
<v Speaker 1>There's also the idea that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented it and it just never got out </v>

3041
02:14:50.190 --> 02:14:51.960
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3042
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:53.303
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand years earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe somebody invents it and then he </v>

3043
02:14:54.631 --> 02:14:57.270
<v Speaker 1>just never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one ever leaves that village.</v>

3044
02:14:57.370 --> 02:14:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3045
02:14:58.801 --> 02:15:00.030
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that definitely could be it.</v>

3046
02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:01.593
<v Speaker 9>So what does this gentleman doing?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Primitive technologies that youtube </v>

3047
02:15:03.671 --> 02:15:05.020
<v Speaker 9>channels.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So it shows them make.</v>

3048
02:15:05.021 --> 02:15:06.730
<v Speaker 9>He's making a forge blower.</v>

3049
02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:11.680
<v Speaker 1>What's funny is he has cave hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like the original.</v>

3050
02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:14.060
<v Speaker 3>This dude is one of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3051
02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:15.053
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of people now that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>experts in ancient ways of living like </v>

3052
02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:24.450
<v Speaker 3>ancient archery in ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like house building and shit.</v>

3053
02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:26.633
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will there's something cool that I was </v>

02:15:37.050 --> 02:15:42.050
<v Speaker 1>so I went on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a seven day silent meditation retreat.</v>

3059
02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we talked a for three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting day three,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No reading,</v>

3070
02:16:13.230 --> 02:16:14.063
<v Speaker 1>no writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just meditating and eating and whatever </v>

3071
02:16:18.001 --> 02:16:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in this village thing.</v>

3072
02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3073

<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3074
02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:23.820
<v Speaker 1>this video is fucking really cool.</v>

3075
02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:26.510
<v Speaker 3>This video is dope as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy made these,</v>

3076
02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:30.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like made like a little furnace blower</v>

3077
02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:31.683
<v Speaker 4>out of this pottery thing with a wheel </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside of it that he would spin and it </v>

3078
02:16:35.591 --> 02:16:38.670
<v Speaker 4>would blow air with fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so yeah,</v>

3079
02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:39.513
<v Speaker 4>it's like you got like a handmade fan </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he does it by moving it around with </v>

3080
02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:44.194
<v Speaker 4>his fingers and now he's making a rope </v>
<v Speaker 4>and twine so he could pull it probably </v>

3081
02:16:48.161 --> 02:16:48.910
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

3082
02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:52.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what he's been able to do with it as</v>

3083
02:16:52.330 --> 02:16:55.270
<v Speaker 4>stoked as fire up in this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

3084
02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:56.553
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just blazing and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the wind that is blowing into it </v>

3085
02:17:01.241 --> 02:17:02.074
<v Speaker 4>with this crazy invention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is some shit that people did </v>

3086
02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:06.170
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years ago or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3087
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:09.860
<v Speaker 1>they were quoted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watson,</v>

3088
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:10.703
<v Speaker 1>we problem solve all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just keeps happening is first early </v>

3089
02:17:13.341 --> 02:17:14.174
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes us hut that's behind them and </v>

3090
02:17:15.291 --> 02:17:16.124
<v Speaker 1>it's just out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just in the middle of the forest </v>

3091
02:17:17.331 --> 02:17:21.110
<v Speaker 1>and he goes and he makes his little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bricks and he hates him up in a killing.</v>

3092
02:17:21.111 --> 02:17:25.220
<v Speaker 1>He made and he started wIth no fire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3093
02:17:25.350 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 1>he's built all this stuff.</v>

02:17:37.710 --> 02:17:40.900
<v Speaker 4>Getting the carbon and putting it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the iron ore and he puts it in the,</v>

3099
02:17:40.901 --> 02:17:41.970
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can't talk to anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3128
02:18:51.961 --> 02:18:52.794
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because all you're doing is meditating </v>

3129
02:18:54.431 --> 02:18:56.000
<v Speaker 1>and meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3130
02:18:56.170 --> 02:18:58.380
<v Speaker 1>brings on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to stimulate your brain,</v>

3131
02:18:58.400 --> 02:18:59.230
<v Speaker 1>makes you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3132
02:18:59.230 --> 02:19:03.240
<v Speaker 1>proven like monks take mris and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just look like they,</v>

3133
02:19:03.250 --> 02:19:05.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have high,</v>

3134
02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:06.173
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly low levels of cortisol and </v>

3135
02:19:07.530 --> 02:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high levels of,</v>

3136
02:19:08.770 --> 02:19:09.603
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3137
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:12.970
<v Speaker 1>of positive chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3138
02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:16.030
<v Speaker 1>so you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would meditate nine hours a day</v>

3139
02:19:17.090 --> 02:19:18.360
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3140
02:19:18.361 --> 02:19:21.860
<v Speaker 1>and you just end up like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing I would do because I</v>

3141
02:19:21.861 --> 02:19:23.790
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3142
02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:26.540
<v Speaker 1>no one could talk and I didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to talk to anybody.</v>

3143
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:31.820
<v Speaker 1>I would smile all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you smile all day,</v>

3144
02:19:32.390 --> 02:19:33.223
<v Speaker 1>it tricks your brain into thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're happy because your brain doesn't </v>

3145
02:19:35.631 --> 02:19:37.100
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if your muscles are just,</v>

3146
02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:38.390
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're happy.</v>

3147
02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:41.000
<v Speaker 1>So everybody act happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3148
02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:43.760
<v Speaker 1>it can work backward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gun and paul ekman rid of book.</v>

3149
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an amazing experience.</v>

3151
02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

3152
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:50.240
<v Speaker 1>What I realized is I came away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3153
02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm so overstimulated at home with </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

3154
02:19:55.521 --> 02:19:57.050
<v Speaker 1>television shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:57.913
<v Speaker 1>fucking phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>texting constantly that it's made me a </v>

3156
02:20:01.490 --> 02:20:04.370
<v Speaker 1>really cut back on everything in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>

3157
02:20:04.371 --> 02:20:06.200
<v Speaker 1>very positive I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3158
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>most people wake up and you immediately </v>

3160
02:20:10.701 --> 02:20:14.650
<v Speaker 1>like mainline information or technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3161
02:20:15.070 --> 02:20:16.490
<v Speaker 1>like I used to do when I smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes,</v>

3162
02:20:16.491 --> 02:20:17.324
<v Speaker 1>I'd wake up and have for cigarettes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink coffee and just like shocked my </v>

<v Speaker 1>body and I feel like it was awful and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like that's what I do now.</v>

3164
02:20:24.650 --> 02:20:26.390
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I used to do with technology,</v>

3165
02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:29.070
<v Speaker 1>just like constantly turn my phone on to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tax,</v>

3166
02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:31.310
<v Speaker 1>going New York times going this thing </v>

3168
02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just stressing me out.</v>

3169
02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you feel good.</v>

3170
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's hard in that weird thing that</v>

3171
02:20:42.171 --> 02:20:44.450
<v Speaker 1>we all do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constantly were acknowledged.</v>

3172
02:20:44.451 --> 02:20:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't make me feel good.</v>

3173
02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:48.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need discipline.</v>

3174
02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:49.363
<v Speaker 4>That's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big factor in managing the electronic </v>

3175
02:20:52.581 --> 02:20:55.940
<v Speaker 4>world is discipline the discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll watch too much television.</v>

3176
02:20:55.970 --> 02:20:57.990
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Discipline and not fuck around you.</v>

3177
02:20:57.991 --> 02:20:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Phone two months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It did discipline.</v>

3178
02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:02.030
<v Speaker 4>Did not play games too much [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

3179
02:21:02.690 --> 02:21:06.980
<v Speaker 4>you can get lurched in the word lurched </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure minutes.</v>

3180
02:21:07.420 --> 02:21:09.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not really the right word.</v>

3181
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:15.050
<v Speaker 4>It's probably not ultimately beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3182
02:21:15.051 --> 02:21:17.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean like certain amount of balance to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is really good,</v>

3183
02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:18.913
<v Speaker 4>but it's so addicting.</v>

3184
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:22.540
<v Speaker 1>We should have like one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a responsible guy.</v>

3185
02:21:22.541 --> 02:21:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Like will you look up like The world </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have that where it's like,</v>

3186
02:21:26.401 --> 02:21:27.550
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up when,</v>

3187
02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:28.473
<v Speaker 1>when so and so was invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part we can just </v>

3188
02:21:30.551 --> 02:21:34.930
<v Speaker 1>communicate because that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another one of those things where</v>

3189
02:21:34.931 --> 02:21:35.764
<v Speaker 1>you talk about what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I look up what actually makes </v>

3190
02:21:38.261 --> 02:21:40.510
<v Speaker 1>people happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communication,</v>

3191
02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:42.033
<v Speaker 1>a real connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A community volunteering makes people </v>

3192
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:48.900
<v Speaker 1>happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3193
02:21:49.150 --> 02:21:51.660
<v Speaker 1>which I like in the big brothers program</v>

02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:00.700
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:55.410
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not organized.</v>

3221
02:22:55.530 --> 02:22:57.980
<v Speaker 3>And I liked listening to people talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3222
02:22:58.430 --> 02:22:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like ideas?</v>

3223
02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you like to hear like,</v>

3224
02:23:01.761 --> 02:23:06.410
<v Speaker 1>what's your idea that's not a good idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>or that is a good idea.</v>

3225
02:23:06.411 --> 02:23:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3226
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:07.623
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to be super flexible with your </v>

3227
02:23:08.671 --> 02:23:09.504
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten way better at that since I </v>

3228
02:23:12.001 --> 02:23:12.834
<v Speaker 3>started doing a podcast way better at </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out like what is it </v>

3229
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:21.830
<v Speaker 3>about an idea that I disagree with and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is that I had a different</v>

3230
02:23:22.711 --> 02:23:26.370
<v Speaker 3>idea then that idea in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that preconceived notion,</v>

3231
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:31.550
<v Speaker 3>how much of that is how I'm affected by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the disagreement or the called motivated</v>

3232
02:23:32.641 --> 02:23:33.490
<v Speaker 3>reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3233
02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:35.760
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a perfect way of describing it.</v>

3234
02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:36.900
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3235
02:23:37.290 --> 02:23:42.120
<v Speaker 3>That's super common man for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that having conversations on</v>

3236
02:23:42.121 --> 02:23:42.954
<v Speaker 3>a podcast with a variety of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have a variety of different </v>

3237
02:23:45.571 --> 02:23:46.404
<v Speaker 3>opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been really interesting because I </v>

3238
02:23:47.761 --> 02:23:49.740
<v Speaker 3>get to challenge my own opinions like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3239
02:23:49.741 --> 02:23:53.530
<v Speaker 3>where are my opinions coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been really vetted out yet.</v>

3240
02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Or are they just some like convenience </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that I've held held onto because.</v>

3241
02:23:57.970 --> 02:23:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3242
02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the shelving built,</v>

3243
02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:01.790
<v Speaker 1>you have all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will have like,</v>

3244
02:24:01.810 --> 02:24:02.980
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the t shirt,</v>

3245
02:24:02.981 --> 02:24:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I got the old thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the right adapter.</v>

3246
02:24:06.690 --> 02:24:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3247
02:24:08.330 --> 02:24:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet,</v>

3248
02:24:09.671 --> 02:24:11.230
<v Speaker 1>so it is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3249
02:24:11.310 --> 02:24:13.410
<v Speaker 1>that was what I learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

3250
02:24:13.690 --> 02:24:16.300
<v Speaker 1>the walking around not having to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3251
02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was cool in it.</v>

3252
02:24:18.461 --> 02:24:19.294
<v Speaker 1>There was no pressure and it was also </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the least sexual environment I've </v>

3253
02:24:23.290 --> 02:24:27.220
<v Speaker 1>ever been on because everyone just looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have the flu.</v>

3254
02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are struggling.</v>

3255
02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Did they have rules?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could people hook up?</v>

3256
02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was discouraged.</v>

3257
02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:35.620
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also would say like everyone,</v>

3258
02:24:35.621 --> 02:24:36.454
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a roommate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you're in like olympic style </v>

3259
02:24:38.951 --> 02:24:39.784
<v Speaker 1>dorms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like were you have a roommate and it's </v>

3260
02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:42.273
<v Speaker 1>like eight rooms and each floor it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a summer camp basically where you </v>

3261
02:24:46.391 --> 02:24:47.224
<v Speaker 1>did nothing.</v>

3262
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:50.130
<v Speaker 3>It's seriously would be kind of hot </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

3263
02:24:50.610 --> 02:24:54.120
<v Speaker 3>It was having been there gal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both sIngle.</v>

3264
02:24:54.330 --> 02:24:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Both can't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3265
02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:57.053
<v Speaker 1>Having been there though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really runs counter to what you're </v>

3266
02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:00.900
<v Speaker 1>going for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3267
02:25:00.901 --> 02:25:02.970
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking interesting where you go,</v>

3268
02:25:02.971 --> 02:25:07.260
<v Speaker 1>like you really see what's inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was trying to think of what it</v>

3269
02:25:07.261 --> 02:25:08.190
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was like,</v>

3270
02:25:08.191 --> 02:25:10.110
<v Speaker 1>basketball camp was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no basketball camp.</v>

3271
02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:13.860
<v Speaker 1>We had tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vcrs and talk the entire time.</v>

3272
02:25:14.470 --> 02:25:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was like nothing.</v>

3273
02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:20.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like nothing you've ever done a </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3274
02:25:20.570 --> 02:25:22.920
<v Speaker 1>And then we would talk and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do it talk every night,</v>

3275
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:25.150
<v Speaker 1>some theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some buddhist theme,</v>

3276
02:25:25.151 --> 02:25:28.540
<v Speaker 1>and then the next day you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would talk in a group about that.</v>

3277
02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:30.970
<v Speaker 1>And what I found was I didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to talk.</v>

3278
02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:33.161
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

3279
02:25:33.161 --> 02:25:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I've come this far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see how long I can.</v>

3280
02:25:35.831 --> 02:25:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just see what a.</v>

3281
02:25:39.010 --> 02:25:42.490
<v Speaker 1>But you see what's in there and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what your brain does.</v>

3282
02:25:42.490 --> 02:25:45.040
<v Speaker 1>You see what you're interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see what you remember.</v>

3283
02:25:45.730 --> 02:25:46.563
<v Speaker 1>Any recall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My recall was really good because your </v>

3284
02:25:48.551 --> 02:25:51.670
<v Speaker 1>brain's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I realized with the,</v>

3285
02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:56.700
<v Speaker 1>with the all the technology is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would create chaos in my head,</v>

3286
02:25:57.740 --> 02:25:58.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with somebody voices and sounds and </v>

3287
02:26:00.431 --> 02:26:03.430
<v Speaker 1>noises and did a that I couldn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't remember because it was like,</v>

3288
02:26:03.431 --> 02:26:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't even get back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get through all this garbage too,</v>

3289
02:26:08.231 --> 02:26:09.064
<v Speaker 1>like the file that I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I couldn't remember something I'd </v>

3290
02:26:12.791 --> 02:26:13.960
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hang out.</v>

3291
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:16.840
<v Speaker 1>It'll come and it would always come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3292
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:18.940
<v Speaker 1>but that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing of like,</v>

3293
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen to the radio when I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my car now,</v>

3294
02:26:21.101 --> 02:26:23.830
<v Speaker 1>which is on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just drive like a fucking old man.</v>

3295
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.903
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just literally just me and fucking me </v>

3296
02:26:27.331 --> 02:26:29.950
<v Speaker 1>and silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to limit the amount of signals.</v>

3297
02:26:30.730 --> 02:26:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not easy,</v>

3298
02:26:32.651 --> 02:26:33.260
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3299
02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:34.720
<v Speaker 3>I got a buddy of mine lives in our law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3300
02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Australia rather want to say Alaska </v>
<v Speaker 3>summer.</v>

3301
02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:38.293
<v Speaker 3>He lives in Australia and he takes these</v>
<v Speaker 3>trips out into the bush where he goes </v>

3302
02:26:42.351 --> 02:26:44.990
<v Speaker 3>out camping and he'll be gone for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

3303
02:26:44.991 --> 02:26:48.110
<v Speaker 3>nine days or he won't see people for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like nine days.</v>

3304
02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:53.420
<v Speaker 3>And he said that when he comes back </v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes it feels really weird to talk</v>

3305
02:26:53.421 --> 02:26:54.254
<v Speaker 3>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can almost like forgot how to talk to </v>

3306
02:26:56.121 --> 02:27:00.080
<v Speaker 3>people where that has been nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 3>him alone with his thoughts,</v>

3307
02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:02.810
<v Speaker 3>with no cell phone service for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight or nine days.</v>

3308
02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:03.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really worthwhile because what I </v>

3309
02:27:05.971 --> 02:27:10.380
<v Speaker 1>also realized is that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the signal and all the,</v>

3310
02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:14.490
<v Speaker 1>all the noise and everything is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I was upsetting myself.</v>

3311
02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it'S like,</v>

3312
02:27:16.591 --> 02:27:18.180
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need this much,</v>

3313
02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:19.890
<v Speaker 1>and I would just overload myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3314
02:27:19.891 --> 02:27:20.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3315
02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:21.433
<v Speaker 1>we're in the golden age of information </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can access any fucking video and </v>

3316
02:27:23.671 --> 02:27:27.540
<v Speaker 1>look around the godfather and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>scarface and all this shit.</v>

3317
02:27:27.541 --> 02:27:29.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3318
02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you need to slow down man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not,</v>

3319
02:27:32.370 --> 02:27:35.970
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of my temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time my,</v>

3320
02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:41.060
<v Speaker 1>my nervous system was like screaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you gotta chill out.</v>

3321
02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3322
02:27:44.310 --> 02:27:45.780
<v Speaker 1>But I don't smoke weed or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3323
02:27:45.781 --> 02:27:49.920
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have any way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to separate.</v>

3324
02:27:50.430 --> 02:27:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or to like to quiet my nervous system.</v>

3325
02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've answered a stuff like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

3326
02:27:55.470 --> 02:27:56.303
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but meditation really helps and since </v>

3327
02:27:57.661 --> 02:27:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I've been back I've meditated pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much every day since,</v>

3328
02:27:59.941 --> 02:28:02.040
<v Speaker 1>which is really for like three months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really.</v>

3329
02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:03.383
<v Speaker 1>I've missed a few days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely like an entrenched </v>

3330
02:28:06.031 --> 02:28:08.280
<v Speaker 1>part of my life now that I miss if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

3331
02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:10.033
<v Speaker 3>Time for reflection is very important </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to avoid getting stuck with </v>

3332
02:28:13.131 --> 02:28:15.410
<v Speaker 3>momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right when when you have the momentum of</v>

3333
02:28:15.411 --> 02:28:16.244
<v Speaker 3>your life like and you just cannot let </v>
<v Speaker 3>things keep playing out and just </v>

3334
02:28:20.361 --> 02:28:24.800
<v Speaker 3>adjusting long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fly that separation to step back and</v>

3335
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:28.360
<v Speaker 3>look at it so it's so critical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so important.</v>

3336
02:28:28.390 --> 02:28:33.020
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to do because I think once </v>
<v Speaker 3>once things start going in your life,</v>

3337
02:28:33.021 --> 02:28:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Whether its obligations or financial </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities or whatever things that</v>

3338
02:28:37.731 --> 02:28:40.820
<v Speaker 3>you're working on that are occupying all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your time,</v>

3339
02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:42.093
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They become so much a part of your </v>

3340
02:28:44.601 --> 02:28:45.434
<v Speaker 3>thought process and you consIder them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like a primary importance because </v>

3341
02:28:49.311 --> 02:28:50.960
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to pay these bills.</v>

3342
02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Hey this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to deal with this shit.</v>

3343
02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's going on that they.</v>

3344
02:28:55.430 --> 02:28:59.330
<v Speaker 3>They sort of overwhelm cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasoning.</v>

3345
02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:00.433
<v Speaker 3>they overwhelm perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have the opportunity to sit </v>

3346
02:29:03.681 --> 02:29:04.514
<v Speaker 3>back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3347
02:29:04.610 --> 02:29:08.510
<v Speaker 3>you're not here for that long amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time here.</v>

3348
02:29:08.590 --> 02:29:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was like.</v>

3349
02:29:09.641 --> 02:29:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I died like,</v>

3350
02:29:12.491 --> 02:29:15.850
<v Speaker 2>what was this like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a bit like the mark twain thing,</v>

3351
02:29:15.851 --> 02:29:17.830
<v Speaker 2>like of like seeing your own funeral of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3352
02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:21.430
<v Speaker 2>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was away for a week.</v>

3353
02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:22.893
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the automatic email thing and I </v>

3354
02:29:25.121 --> 02:29:27.910
<v Speaker 2>knew so people knew I wasn't around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I only got like 50 emails.</v>

3355
02:29:27.911 --> 02:29:31.060
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like an ungodly amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emails.</v>

3356
02:29:32.230 --> 02:29:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I got maybe 10 texts which all </v>
<v Speaker 2>manageable,</v>

3357
02:29:36.490 --> 02:29:37.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's not like,</v>

3358
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:40.150
<v Speaker 2>oh I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so missed,</v>

3359
02:29:40.151 --> 02:29:40.970
<v Speaker 2>the world needs me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3360
02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:42.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can all duck out.</v>

3361
02:29:42.491 --> 02:29:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Obama could duck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was in martha's vineyard right now.</v>

3362
02:29:46.181 --> 02:29:49.090
<v Speaker 2>He's reachable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not like working,</v>

3363
02:29:49.140 --> 02:29:49.973
<v Speaker 2>working when he does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how much do you thInk he works </v>

3364
02:29:52.871 --> 02:29:54.940
<v Speaker 2>while he's doing one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those trips?</v>

3365
02:29:54.941 --> 02:29:58.900
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to bet three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three hours.</v>

3366
02:29:58.960 --> 02:29:59.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet in the morning and then again in </v>

3367
02:30:00.611 --> 02:30:01.444
<v Speaker 2>the afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a random gift that's a </v>

3368
02:30:02.650 --> 02:30:05.560
<v Speaker 2>completely uneducated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's based on fucking nothing.</v>

3369
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I think people are gonna miss that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

3370
02:30:08.760 --> 02:30:12.130
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make it even so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even quantify how much they're</v>

3371
02:30:12.131 --> 02:30:12.964
<v Speaker 2>going to miss him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept it together in the face of </v>

3372
02:30:15.130 --> 02:30:17.950
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really interesting.</v>

3373
02:30:17.951 --> 02:30:22.951
<v Speaker 2>Like the way he handled it without a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hint of bitterness or anger.</v>

3374
02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:28.970
<v Speaker 3>He's a fascinating guy in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very,</v>

3375
02:30:28.971 --> 02:30:30.350
<v Speaker 3>very measured guy.</v>

3376
02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's nothing if not measured like that's</v>

3377
02:30:32.910 --> 02:30:34.380
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's half everything.</v>

3378
02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the.</v>

3379
02:30:35.611 --> 02:30:38.160
<v Speaker 3>One of the good things about having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like that,</v>

3380
02:30:38.490 --> 02:30:41.160
<v Speaker 3>one of the most important thing is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can criticize him,</v>

3381
02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:42.930
<v Speaker 3>you could with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not with them,</v>

3382
02:30:42.931 --> 02:30:47.931
<v Speaker 3>but having a guy like that sets the tone</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the way we think about ourselves and</v>

3383
02:30:48.811 --> 02:30:52.590
<v Speaker 3>he was a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an arTiculate guy.</v>

3384
02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:55.890
<v Speaker 3>he was warm and friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believed him.</v>

3385
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the tone.</v>

3386
02:30:57.511 --> 02:30:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not he was really like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>24 slash seven,</v>

3387
02:30:59.721 --> 02:31:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3388
02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:01.980
<v Speaker 2>It seems like he was,</v>

3389
02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:06.810
<v Speaker 3>but he's setting the tone with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior like,</v>

3390
02:31:06.890 --> 02:31:07.723
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what what people are most </v>

3391
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:12.440
<v Speaker 3>terrified of by something like trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming president.</v>

3392
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:13.783
<v Speaker 3>They're worried that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are like super aggressive </v>

3393
02:31:17.090 --> 02:31:21.870
<v Speaker 3>and that like having like an insulting </v>
<v Speaker 3>president</v>

3394
02:31:22.020 --> 02:31:22.580
<v Speaker 1>who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3395
02:31:22.580 --> 02:31:23.413
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about whether I agree with </v>

3396
02:31:24.831 --> 02:31:25.664
<v Speaker 1>you about whether obama raised the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse because it got courser and he </v>

3397
02:31:29.871 --> 02:31:32.150
<v Speaker 1>got yelled at and you lie and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3398
02:31:32.151 --> 02:31:35.300
<v Speaker 1>He made peopLe worse in some ways toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3399
02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much can you talk radio and internet</v>

3400
02:31:38.601 --> 02:31:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and talk radio got worse in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years,</v>

3401
02:31:40.430 --> 02:31:43.190
<v Speaker 1>which could just be natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It have been worse without them.</v>

3402
02:31:45.050 --> 02:31:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3403
02:31:48.110 --> 02:31:50.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not a simple because it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did get worse,</v>

3404
02:31:50.991 --> 02:31:53.210
<v Speaker 1>but I think the thing that you said it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really worthwhile.</v>

3405
02:31:53.211 --> 02:31:56.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like the level headedness event </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3406
02:31:56.750 --> 02:32:01.490
<v Speaker 1>and like a really measured kind hearted </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

3407
02:32:02.590 --> 02:32:03.423
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me to discern how much of </v>

3408
02:32:05.531 --> 02:32:10.531
<v Speaker 3>the hate he gets his from his policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>from where the just the current state of</v>

3409
02:32:12.941 --> 02:32:16.240
<v Speaker 3>the United States is in the eyes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves,</v>

3410
02:32:16.241 --> 02:32:18.850
<v Speaker 3>the world financially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>

3411
02:32:18.851 --> 02:32:19.750
<v Speaker 3>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

3412
02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:24.190
<v Speaker 3>And then how much of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is racism?</v>

3413
02:32:24.350 --> 02:32:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of it is,</v>

3414
02:32:25.511 --> 02:32:26.344
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is legitimate criticism </v>

3415
02:32:27.671 --> 02:32:29.140
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of it is,</v>

3416
02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:30.423
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this a criticism that he's always had </v>

3417
02:32:32.261 --> 02:32:35.290
<v Speaker 3>that by trying to be accommodating to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

3418
02:32:35.291 --> 02:32:37.240
<v Speaker 3>he really gets nothing done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3419
02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:39.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don'T understand it.</v>

3420
02:32:39.011 --> 02:32:39.371
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3421
02:32:39.371 --> 02:32:40.204
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way too complicated for me to dive </v>

3422
02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:42.030
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

3423
02:32:42.030 --> 02:32:44.060
<v Speaker 1>The hatred thing that I point out always</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3424
02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:45.013
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably half 50 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism and february percent republicans </v>

3425
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:52.820
<v Speaker 1>fucking hate democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucking hate them.</v>

3426
02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:53.993
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's two presidents in a row that </v>

3427
02:32:56.271 --> 02:32:57.104
<v Speaker 1>they've said we're not legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so because they did the same thing </v>

3428
02:32:59.091 --> 02:32:59.924
<v Speaker 1>with clinton where they tried to indict </v>
<v Speaker 1>them pretty much from day one and </v>

3429
02:33:02.571 --> 02:33:04.670
<v Speaker 1>investigate the fuck out of him and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>

3430
02:33:04.730 --> 02:33:05.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you rememBer that republicans versus </v>

3431
02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:09.380
<v Speaker 1>I should say republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3432
02:33:09.410 --> 02:33:11.790
<v Speaker 1>politicians because they can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3433
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I can't speak for all people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

3434
02:33:14.660 --> 02:33:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump was a birther.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3435
02:33:16.641 --> 02:33:19.410
<v Speaker 1>right now I know he was the big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the big proponent of it.</v>

3436
02:33:19.411 --> 02:33:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying he's kenyan.</v>

3437
02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3438
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:24.310
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's only down by three.</v>

3439
02:33:26.420 --> 02:33:28.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he kept saying it too.</v>

3440
02:33:28.011 --> 02:33:28.844
<v Speaker 3>He kept going all in member.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They released the birth certificate and </v>

3441
02:33:31.401 --> 02:33:32.960
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a forgery.</v>

3442
02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:33.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3443
02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:34.680
<v Speaker 3>God damn forgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3444
02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:36.830
<v Speaker 3>It all these reasons to believe it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>forgery.</v>

3445
02:33:36.850 --> 02:33:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has people in Hawaii investigating.</v>

3446
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.823
<v Speaker 3>How hilarious is it though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people would be worried if he </v>

3447
02:33:44.211 --> 02:33:45.560
<v Speaker 3>wasn't born in the right spot?</v>

3448
02:33:47.020 --> 02:33:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that speaks to people's,</v>

3449
02:33:49.770 --> 02:33:50.603
<v Speaker 1>a suspicion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to believe that there's a </v>

3450
02:33:53.371 --> 02:33:56.880
<v Speaker 1>manchurian candidate and it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a pod and there's a sale here.</v>

3451
02:33:58.890 --> 02:34:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Neil brandon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as jesus is my witness,</v>

3452
02:34:02.761 --> 02:34:03.594
<v Speaker 1>he hates America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the second amendment to peak a </v>

3453
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:09.360
<v Speaker 1>ball and it feels good to play the </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim.</v>

3454
02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:10.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing people also forget is </v>

3455
02:34:11.191 --> 02:34:11.611
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3456
02:34:11.611 --> 02:34:15.000
<v Speaker 1>it feels fucking really good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's out to get us.</v>

3457
02:34:15.001 --> 02:34:16.650
<v Speaker 1>And he doesn't believe what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

3458
02:34:16.651 --> 02:34:18.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking boring ass.</v>

3459
02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:20.110
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he may be an atheist,</v>

3460
02:34:20.111 --> 02:34:21.730
<v Speaker 1>but I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a boy.</v>

3461
02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the worst thing you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him religiously.</v>

3462
02:34:24.070 --> 02:34:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise he's a piece christian at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>

3463
02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:28.533
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that if he's a muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an awful muslim and he knows </v>

3464
02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:34.450
<v Speaker 1>another vacancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

3465
02:34:34.451 --> 02:34:35.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3466
02:34:35.081 --> 02:34:35.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3467
02:34:35.681 --> 02:34:36.230
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3468
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:39.310
<v Speaker 3>So I bring garlic to the vampire house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3469
02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:41.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3470
02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody's ever going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do that job.</v>

3471
02:34:44.100 --> 02:34:44.933
<v Speaker 3>I think that job is a ridiculous job and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that at the very least he moved </v>

3472
02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:50.733
<v Speaker 3>some social issues in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like during his time I feel like people </v>

3473
02:34:55.621 --> 02:34:59.040
<v Speaker 3>were more tolerant in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it,</v>

3474
02:34:59.041 --> 02:35:02.430
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it opened up a lot of social issues that</v>

3475
02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:04.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think would have been addressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>wIth a,</v>

3476
02:35:04.381 --> 02:35:08.970
<v Speaker 3>a less measured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more easily accessible</v>

<v Speaker 2>and you can shoot for the bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3563
02:39:12.251 --> 02:39:13.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3564
02:39:13.131 --> 02:39:14.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3565
02:39:14.810 --> 02:39:19.280
<v Speaker 2>it also allows men and women to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>their hunt and shows together.</v>

3566
02:39:20.010 --> 02:39:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I like when the girl when's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's always right.</v>

3567
02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:24.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says the same thing for motorsports </v>

3568
02:39:26.330 --> 02:39:30.980
<v Speaker 2>says everyday agree that women racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring fans out to the game.</v>

3569
02:39:30.981 --> 02:39:31.814
<v Speaker 2>Seventy four percent of males in 62 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of females agree that women </v>

3570
02:39:35.511 --> 02:39:37.910
<v Speaker 2>racers bring fans out to the games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3571
02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's some underdog shit.</v>

3572
02:39:41.091 --> 02:39:44.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the woman among the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3573
02:39:44.301 --> 02:39:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like the girls who race in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nascar,</v>

3574
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:48.023
<v Speaker 2>they go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>danica patrick is so hot and you're </v>

3575
02:39:49.461 --> 02:39:50.294
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

3576
02:39:50.690 --> 02:39:54.870
<v Speaker 2>she's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

3577
02:39:55.390 --> 02:39:58.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll give her a six and a half,</v>

3578
02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:00.590
<v Speaker 2>seven out of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

3579
02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3580
02:40:02.691 --> 02:40:05.720
<v Speaker 2>like I can't say that she is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3581
02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:06.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3582
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:10.070
<v Speaker 2>but it is definitely like more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that you notice.</v>

3583
02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iT's super odd,</v>

3584
02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:13.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super odd for a woman to want to do</v>

3585
02:40:13.921 --> 02:40:14.754
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3586
02:40:14.910 --> 02:40:16.470
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but normal.</v>

3587
02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:18.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing wrong with it.</v>

3588
02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:21.390
<v Speaker 4>But for a woman to want to race like </v>
<v Speaker 4>formula one or something like that.</v>

3589
02:40:22.010 --> 02:40:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3590
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:24.230
<v Speaker 2>ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's created looking.</v>

3591
02:40:24.450 --> 02:40:28.820
<v Speaker 2>It's primary fo allow you say that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right way.</v>

3592
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:32.150
<v Speaker 2>she's misalign tropic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh see,</v>

3593
02:40:32.151 --> 02:40:34.580
<v Speaker 2>these are all race car drIvers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>these women.</v>

3594
02:40:34.581 --> 02:40:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

3595
02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:39.630
<v Speaker 2>that's gangster courtney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For us.</v>

3596
02:40:39.631 --> 02:40:44.631
<v Speaker 2>It's good name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hope that sounds so porn daily,</v>

3597
02:40:47.570 --> 02:40:51.980
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be like a wild person to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a race car driver.</v>

3598
02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Like a one new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a characterological thing.</v>

3599
02:40:55.610 --> 02:40:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>

3600
02:40:57.020 --> 02:40:57.853
<v Speaker 4>It's so risky and it's so rewarding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would guess in a sense of like a </v>

3601
02:41:02.380 --> 02:41:04.550
<v Speaker 4>sensory perception sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3602
02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3603
02:41:06.530 --> 02:41:08.310
<v Speaker 2>You want to talk about upsetting your </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous system?</v>

3604
02:41:08.330 --> 02:41:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3605
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:13.650
<v Speaker 2>And the consequences are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fuck up,</v>

3606
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:14.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>car accidents at 150 miles an hour and </v>

3607
02:41:16.371 --> 02:41:17.730
<v Speaker 2>not cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3608
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Instant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrific too.</v>

3609
02:41:19.711 --> 02:41:20.544
<v Speaker 2>When you see people get spun around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could fucking crashed and firing </v>

3610
02:41:23.460 --> 02:41:24.560
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like The,</v>

3611
02:41:24.650 --> 02:41:27.510
<v Speaker 2>it explodes like flex and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that a foot?</v>

3612
02:41:27.690 --> 02:41:31.170
<v Speaker 2>I just saw dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having said that,</v>

3613
02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:34.800
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high a rate of mortality,</v>

3614
02:41:34.801 --> 02:41:36.540
<v Speaker 2>like the or I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low rate of mortality.</v>

3615
02:41:36.541 --> 02:41:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Like they actually survive way more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think where you go,</v>

3616
02:41:39.571 --> 02:41:41.130
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another one that was like dead,</v>

3617
02:41:42.750 --> 02:41:43.740
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dead.</v>

3618
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Those people are dead and they're fine.</v>

3619
02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:47.873
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you been seeing these people that </v>

3620
02:41:49.001 --> 02:41:51.910
<v Speaker 4>put these balloons around their bodies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and get hit by bowls?</v>

3621
02:41:52.540 --> 02:41:54.460
<v Speaker 4>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to show you this.</v>

3622
02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:58.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking forward to it very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a recurring theme on this show.</v>

3623
02:41:58.631 --> 02:41:59.464
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like one of those top 40 a </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning radio zoo shows where they have </v>

3624
02:42:03.851 --> 02:42:04.684
<v Speaker 4>those weekly gags on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of our weekly gags is show one of </v>

3625
02:42:07.241 --> 02:42:10.720
<v Speaker 4>the guests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people with the balloons on that get</v>

3626
02:42:10.721 --> 02:42:15.160
<v Speaker 4>hit by the bowls and this is my take on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3627
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:17.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people realize how </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable they are.</v>

3628
02:42:18.460 --> 02:42:19.241
<v Speaker 4>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3629
02:42:19.241 --> 02:42:20.760
<v Speaker 4>this is a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3630
02:42:20.770 --> 02:42:21.603
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

3631
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:22.990
<v Speaker 4>This is a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And look,</v>

3632
02:42:22.991 --> 02:42:25.780
<v Speaker 4>they got a rodeo clown and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to rope.</v>

3633
02:42:25.810 --> 02:42:27.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this got the bull is going after it.</v>

3634
02:42:27.300 --> 02:42:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Guy get out of that suit on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3635
02:42:30.071 --> 02:42:31.980
<v Speaker 2>he got flipped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3636
02:42:31.981 --> 02:42:34.800
<v Speaker 2>he got jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

3637
02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:37.380
<v Speaker 2>This is even more horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was.</v>

3638
02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:42.130
<v Speaker 2>This is obviously something went wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the bulls,</v>

3639
02:42:42.131 --> 02:42:44.070
<v Speaker 2>they still seem pretty happy to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3640
02:42:44.071 --> 02:42:47.130
<v Speaker 2>They're not leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

3641
02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:48.800
<v Speaker 2>The guy was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked.</v>

3642
02:42:48.820 --> 02:42:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting metaphor about bowls</v>

3643
02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:56.400
<v Speaker 2>and a temper tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go after the guy,</v>

3644
02:42:57.420 --> 02:43:00.030
<v Speaker 2>even though they're just mad that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls are tied up,</v>

3645
02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:02.520
<v Speaker 2>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3646
02:43:02.521 --> 02:43:06.000
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a bad mood anyway.</v>

3647
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:08.343
<v Speaker 4>This is the better one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the one that we were talking </v>

3648
02:43:09.821 --> 02:43:12.070
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one looks like</v>

3649
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:14.560
<v Speaker 3>it's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely taking place in Mexico,</v>

3650
02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:15.453
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second of all these cushions these guys </v>

3651
02:43:18.401 --> 02:43:19.630
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just not big enough.</v>

3652
02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:23.410
<v Speaker 3>They only go from the waist up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you want to cover your dick?</v>

3653
02:43:23.411 --> 02:43:25.720
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3654
02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:27.920
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna carnage.</v>

3655
02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Watch this because the bull gets loose </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when the bowl gets loose,</v>

3656
02:43:32.290 --> 02:43:34.990
<v Speaker 3>these fuckers in this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they just have this,</v>

3657
02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:37.870
<v Speaker 3>this stupid plan that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be fine.</v>

3658
02:43:38.020 --> 02:43:40.840
<v Speaker 3>You've got to back it up a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the guy who already got jacked.</v>

3659
02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:44.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he got jacked before that.</v>

3660
02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

3661
02:43:49.020 --> 02:43:52.610
<v Speaker 3>So they let the bull out the bowl sees </v>
<v Speaker 3>these assholes walking around with these</v>

3662
02:43:53.420 --> 02:43:55.250
<v Speaker 3>giant jelly fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fish balloons.</v>

3663
02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:58.300
<v Speaker 3>I'll get a boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he goes flying,</v>

3664
02:43:58.580 --> 02:44:00.770
<v Speaker 3>he gets gored on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets run over.</v>

3665
02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:03.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean this guy gets fucking jacked</v>

3666
02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:06.410
<v Speaker 1>and looking at the horses though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

3667
02:44:06.470 --> 02:44:07.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horses.</v>

3668
02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Even the bowls know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3669
02:44:09.921 --> 02:44:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't.</v>

3670
02:44:11.710 --> 02:44:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I think they don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't recognize him as the is doing</v>

3671
02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:16.020
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

3672
02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't like people.</v>

3673
02:44:18.381 --> 02:44:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3674
02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I think because of the ball stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on cow.</v>

3675
02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I think cows have always realized that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people want to eat them.</v>

3676
02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:27.860
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

3677
02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:32.490
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if a cow sees a person,</v>

3678
02:44:32.850 --> 02:44:35.700
<v Speaker 3>what are the odds that that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a bad thing?</v>

3679
02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:37.260
<v Speaker 3>The odds are pretty god damn strong.</v>

3680
02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing good's going to happen like,</v>

3681
02:44:39.111 --> 02:44:39.944
<v Speaker 1>oh good.</v>

3682
02:44:40.380 --> 02:44:41.213
<v Speaker 3>They might squeeze your tests for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years and then shoot you in </v>

3683
02:44:43.411 --> 02:44:44.244
<v Speaker 3>the head for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day they're going to shoot you in </v>

3684
02:44:46.111 --> 02:44:46.944
<v Speaker 3>the head.</v>

3685
02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's naturally ingrained </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

3686
02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think [inaudible] is like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy then you can't pass that on june.</v>

3687
02:44:55.490 --> 02:44:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Genetically I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what a scrub bull as a.</v>

3688
02:44:58.610 --> 02:44:59.240
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me</v>

3689
02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:03.410
<v Speaker 3>scrubble or animals that until like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>

3690
02:45:03.430 --> 02:45:04.263
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>x amount of years used to be domestic </v>

3691
02:45:05.871 --> 02:45:09.110
<v Speaker 3>cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they get loose and they live in</v>

3692
02:45:09.111 --> 02:45:09.944
<v Speaker 3>the countryside and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something that happens often in </v>

3693
02:45:12.411 --> 02:45:13.244
<v Speaker 3>Australia where they are not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the same strain anymore as like a </v>

3694
02:45:19.341 --> 02:45:23.420
<v Speaker 3>strain of cattle that you would use for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like beef or you know,</v>

3695
02:45:23.421 --> 02:45:26.270
<v Speaker 3>like that you would bring to market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have dIfferent,</v>

3696
02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:27.433
<v Speaker 3>they have different genetics now because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been wild for so long and </v>

3697
02:45:30.681 --> 02:45:34.250
<v Speaker 3>they're not like an angus cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have angus cows and this thing</v>

3698
02:45:34.251 --> 02:45:36.110
<v Speaker 3>shows up and starts fucking your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3699
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.671
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3700
02:45:37.671 --> 02:45:38.930
<v Speaker 3>your cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a problem,</v>

3701
02:45:38.931 --> 02:45:39.764
<v Speaker 3>you get some weird cross breed of a cow </v>
<v Speaker 3>that might not be like the best for </v>

3702
02:45:43.671 --> 02:45:46.100
<v Speaker 3>eating right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these things,</v>

3703
02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:50.660
<v Speaker 3>they live wild in the bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Australia and in Australia there's no</v>

3704
02:45:50.661 --> 02:45:52.090
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have like,</v>

3705
02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:54.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small things like dingoes and stuff like</v>

3706
02:45:54.561 --> 02:45:57.250
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've never taken out a bull.</v>

3707
02:45:57.450 --> 02:46:00.170
<v Speaker 3>There's the you would need a lIon or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that to kill one of these</v>

3708
02:46:00.171 --> 02:46:03.680
<v Speaker 3>things and they get cool looking like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they look different.</v>

3709
02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:04.693
<v Speaker 3>They don't look like a cow anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start looking more and more </v>

3710
02:46:07.971 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 3>primitive in some weird</v>

3711
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:10.843
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They start looking more like like a </v>

3712
02:46:12.650 --> 02:46:14.930
<v Speaker 4>animal that you would see in africa or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

3713
02:46:14.931 --> 02:46:16.880
<v Speaker 4>It's really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3714
02:46:17.620 --> 02:46:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Like here's some of the photos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like look at that.</v>

3715
02:46:19.810 --> 02:46:22.460
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3716
02:46:22.461 --> 02:46:26.060
<v Speaker 4>that was a different animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you just google scrub bull,</v>

3717
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:27.580
<v Speaker 4>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3718
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:29.930
<v Speaker 4>Like that one in the upper left hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>corner is a perfect example.</v>

3719
02:46:30.110 --> 02:46:32.810
<v Speaker 4>Like that is not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously that's a cow,</v>

3720
02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:33.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a bull,</v>

3721
02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:34.693
<v Speaker 4>but that looks way different than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>average bold that you see either at the </v>

3722
02:46:38.421 --> 02:46:40.970
<v Speaker 4>rodeo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at his balls back there.</v>

3723
02:46:40.971 --> 02:46:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at john jay.</v>

3724
02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:47.750
<v Speaker 4>That's up package son for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge balls,</v>

3725
02:46:47.780 --> 02:46:48.613
<v Speaker 4>giant antlers or horns rather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his his face and just the way his </v>

3726
02:46:53.511 --> 02:46:55.160
<v Speaker 4>body's buIlt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's different.</v>

3727
02:46:55.190 --> 02:46:56.023
<v Speaker 4>He's a wild animal and he's living the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way they're supposed to be and that's </v>

3728
02:46:59.241 --> 02:47:02.180
<v Speaker 4>why he looks like a wild animal and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know what else?</v>

3729
02:47:02.181 --> 02:47:04.820
<v Speaker 4>He's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's doing great.</v>

3730
02:47:04.821 --> 02:47:05.654
<v Speaker 4>They're super aggressive though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some of the most dangerous </v>

3731
02:47:07.551 --> 02:47:11.090
<v Speaker 4>things to run across if you're out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bush as it were.</v>

3732
02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:14.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't see what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another one of the most dangerous</v>

3733
02:47:14.721 --> 02:47:15.740
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

3734
02:47:16.110 --> 02:47:18.500
<v Speaker 4>That's a buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3735
02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they rammed earth.</v>

3736
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yay.</v>

3737
02:47:20.650 --> 02:47:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Is there been like a lot of animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing?</v>

3738
02:47:24.310 --> 02:47:26.770
<v Speaker 2>You saw the tiger eats the lady last </v>
<v Speaker 2>week in beijing.</v>

3739
02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:27.633
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of like giraffes chasing cars </v>

3740
02:47:31.211 --> 02:47:33.250
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen some of these videos now?</v>

3741
02:47:33.580 --> 02:47:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drab lookup.</v>

3742
02:47:35.111 --> 02:47:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Draft chases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chases.</v>

3743
02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Listened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That only makes sense.</v>

3744
02:47:40.060 --> 02:47:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Hauling ass by the way only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3745
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:45.250
<v Speaker 2>They're tired of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you go.</v>

3746
02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:47.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this.</v>

3747
02:47:47.351 --> 02:47:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>

3748
02:47:49.150 --> 02:47:52.390
<v Speaker 2>The strides on this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this shit in their pants.</v>

3749
02:47:52.420 --> 02:47:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Running behind them.</v>

3750
02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:56.650
<v Speaker 2>You know if they would hit you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their head,</v>

3751
02:47:57.360 --> 02:47:58.193
<v Speaker 2>we're right behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you were saying about the </v>

3752
02:47:59.810 --> 02:48:00.643
<v Speaker 2>equip thing.</v>

3753
02:48:09.970 --> 02:48:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is terrifying.</v>

3754
02:48:11.770 --> 02:48:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I think he comes around a corner again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he does.</v>

3755
02:48:18.130 --> 02:48:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is the right one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

3756
02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:21.640
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it would do to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

3757
02:48:21.641 --> 02:48:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Just start smacking them with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tender.</v>

3758
02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whip whip his neck at them.</v>

3759
02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:26.393
<v Speaker 2>It's really dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you got to think of how big his </v>

3760
02:48:28.751 --> 02:48:29.584
<v Speaker 2>head is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3761
02:48:31.150 --> 02:48:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen them fight so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3762
02:48:34.930 --> 02:48:37.170
<v Speaker 2>It's really painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like in,</v>

3763
02:48:37.270 --> 02:48:38.103
<v Speaker 2>in terms of animal shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's one of those things where </v>

3764
02:48:39.911 --> 02:48:41.590
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know guys.</v>

3765
02:48:41.860 --> 02:48:43.320
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I fighting?</v>

3766
02:48:43.390 --> 02:48:47.770
<v Speaker 2>But that's like really fucking odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the weirdest.</v>

3767
02:48:48.220 --> 02:48:50.470
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the weirdest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you want to talk about a concussion?</v>

3768
02:48:50.500 --> 02:48:51.333
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they must just be evolved or have </v>

3769
02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:54.580
<v Speaker 2>really small brains are very tightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>packed.</v>

3770
02:48:54.581 --> 02:48:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Brian's</v>

3771
02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:55.451
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3772
02:48:55.451 --> 02:48:58.780
<v Speaker 4>sheep can slam into each other like </v>
<v Speaker 4>super hard,</v>

3773
02:48:59.110 --> 02:49:03.190
<v Speaker 4>but their brains are literally connected</v>
<v Speaker 4>to their head different than ours are.</v>

3774
02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:06.190
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've evolved to absorb impact.</v>

3775
02:49:06.340 --> 02:49:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rad would assume rams are too.</v>

3776
02:49:09.450 --> 02:49:10.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3777
02:49:10.530 --> 02:49:12.420
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's insane.</v>

3778
02:49:12.810 --> 02:49:15.000
<v Speaker 4>Those wild desert bighorn sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3779
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:18.420
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>

3780
02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:24.260
<v Speaker 4>Like what a strange trait to develop to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have neck fighting.</v>

3781
02:49:24.361 --> 02:49:28.530
<v Speaker 4>They're fighting like two snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>

3782
02:49:28.531 --> 02:49:30.060
<v Speaker 4>I beat the fuck out of each other too.</v>

3783
02:49:31.470 --> 02:49:32.303
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good video of a big horn sheep head </v>

3784
02:49:36.001 --> 02:49:36.330
<v Speaker 3>button</v>

3785
02:49:36.330 --> 02:49:37.163
<v Speaker 4>each other because these fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have these giant like battering </v>

3786
02:49:43.081 --> 02:49:43.914
<v Speaker 4>rams that grow out of their heads and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they like raise up and crash into each </v>

3787
02:49:49.771 --> 02:49:53.220
<v Speaker 4>other and the sound sounds like a rifle </v>
<v Speaker 4>going off.</v>

3788
02:49:53.330 --> 02:49:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they do it in the mountains.</v>

3789
02:49:56.390 --> 02:49:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things,</v>

3790
02:49:57.270 --> 02:50:02.270
<v Speaker 4>these fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Living with jesus and decided to drink.</v>

3791

<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3792
02:50:19.471 --> 02:50:21.060
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to listen to what that guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

3793
02:50:21.061 --> 02:50:26.061
<v Speaker 4>He just talking about snow on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the sheep are a going after it.</v>

3794
02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:29.430
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy how hard they had head butt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each other.</v>

3795
02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the audio is from or was it from </v>

3797
02:50:33.331 --> 02:50:35.970
<v Speaker 4>something else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird audio,</v>

3798

<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3799
02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:40.920
<v Speaker 4>they evolve to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just such a strange trait.</v>

3800
02:50:40.921 --> 02:50:43.260
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>

3801
02:50:43.261 --> 02:50:44.640
<v Speaker 4>Play that back hoe.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're getting rid of the fuck.</v>

3803
02:50:52.531 --> 02:50:55.200
<v Speaker 4>I think troy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so weird.</v>

3804
02:50:55.410 --> 02:50:57.330
<v Speaker 4>These things are straight out of star </v>
<v Speaker 4>wars.</v>

3805
02:50:58.170 --> 02:50:59.460
<v Speaker 4>They really are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3806
02:50:59.730 --> 02:51:01.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this fucking animal.</v>

3807
02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Any kind of natural defense is always </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

3808
02:51:04.471 --> 02:51:07.500
<v Speaker 4>A shell or a horn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3809
02:51:08.030 --> 02:51:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3810
02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:10.020
<v Speaker 4>these things are dope as fuck man.</v>

3811
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they uh,</v>

3812
02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:14.480
<v Speaker 3>have brought them back to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments now.</v>

3813
02:51:14.510 --> 02:51:14.980
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3814
02:51:14.980 --> 02:51:17.630
<v Speaker 3>they've transplanted them all throughout</v>
<v Speaker 3>the west.</v>

3815
02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:19.460
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did it.</v>

3816
02:51:19.461 --> 02:51:21.560
<v Speaker 3>They brought them to a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different states.</v>

3817
02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:26.090
<v Speaker 3>They took like a viable males and </v>
<v Speaker 3>females and they installed them in these</v>

3818
02:51:26.300 --> 02:51:29.480
<v Speaker 3>areas and monitored their growth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they indigenous to,</v>

3819
02:51:29.990 --> 02:51:32.210
<v Speaker 3>are they indigenous states?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to be.</v>

3820
02:51:32.211 --> 02:51:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Yes they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they used to be in More areas.</v>

3821
02:51:35.091 --> 02:51:37.910
<v Speaker 3>They used to have a wider territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what happened was,</v>

3822
02:51:37.911 --> 02:51:42.320
<v Speaker 3>I guess after world war or after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>civil war,</v>

3823
02:51:42.321 --> 02:51:44.870
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were a bunch of people that,</v>

3824
02:51:44.871 --> 02:51:47.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were market hunters and you know,</v>

3825
02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:48.333
<v Speaker 3>the same type of people that shot all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the buffalo for the hides and all that </v>

3826
02:51:50.541 --> 02:51:51.374
<v Speaker 3>jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did that with a lot of animals all </v>

3827
02:51:53.331 --> 02:51:56.360
<v Speaker 3>throughout the entire west and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3828
02:51:56.420 --> 02:51:57.253
<v Speaker 3>potentially wiped out or got close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>having them wiped out like a bunch of </v>

3829
02:52:02.061 --> 02:52:02.894
<v Speaker 3>different big game species like elk and </v>
<v Speaker 3>deer and it took while to bring all </v>

3830
02:52:05.831 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 3>those</v>

3831
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:08.530
<v Speaker 4>things back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what a lot of these,</v>

3832
02:52:08.531 --> 02:52:09.364
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation organizations are doing is </v>

3833
02:52:10.780 --> 02:52:11.613
<v Speaker 4>taking these things and dropping them </v>
<v Speaker 4>off into the mountain someplaces then </v>

3834
02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:17.110
<v Speaker 4>monitoring them and making sure their </v>
<v Speaker 4>population survive.</v>

3835
02:52:17.650 --> 02:52:18.483
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3836
02:52:18.610 --> 02:52:23.010
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking way to cool it vanana </v>
<v Speaker 4>mall to not figure out how to bring it</v>

3837
02:52:23.070 --> 02:52:25.160
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got to bring it back to.</v>

3838
02:52:25.350 --> 02:52:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are fucking cool.</v>

3839
02:52:29.070 --> 02:52:29.903
<v Speaker 2>They're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they seem Like they're nature's </v>

3840
02:52:31.261 --> 02:52:32.760
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite the headbutting.</v>

3841
02:52:33.210 --> 02:52:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just chilling.</v>

3842
02:52:35.190 --> 02:52:37.440
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want that dude to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>their girls.</v>

3843
02:52:37.450 --> 02:52:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like tomorrow.</v>

3844
02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:40.450
<v Speaker 2>So that we understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3845
02:52:40.500 --> 02:52:41.333
<v Speaker 2>As far as violence goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like probably like the nicest </v>

3846
02:52:43.441 --> 02:52:46.500
<v Speaker 2>violence to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would suck if they head butted us,</v>

3847
02:52:46.830 --> 02:52:47.663
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem to bother them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also would promise you that nfl </v>

3848
02:52:51.001 --> 02:52:53.010
<v Speaker 2>players watch that and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3849
02:52:53.540 --> 02:52:54.910
<v Speaker 2>we get enough today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3850
02:52:54.990 --> 02:52:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Like before games and shIt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe have nfl players have to evolve to</v>

3851
02:52:59.191 --> 02:53:02.210
<v Speaker 2>develop now a connection to their brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a ram's.</v>

3852
02:53:02.270 --> 02:53:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to heart.</v>

3853
02:53:04.260 --> 02:53:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's gonna be awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take a few deCades.</v>

3854
02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:08.340
<v Speaker 2>You hear the helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

3855
02:53:09.300 --> 02:53:10.500
<v Speaker 2>still still going on.</v>

3856
02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:13.650
<v Speaker 4>TheRe was some sort of a gas leak a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles away.</v>

3857
02:53:14.910 --> 02:53:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Some shit went down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Still going down.</v>

3858
02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Still going down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3859
02:53:20.190 --> 02:53:21.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching those things.</v>

3860
02:53:21.601 --> 02:53:22.434
<v Speaker 4>Head butt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each other make just makes you weirded </v>

3861
02:53:24.391 --> 02:53:27.030
<v Speaker 4>out as to how the different ways that </v>
<v Speaker 4>things evolve.</v>

3862
02:53:27.031 --> 02:53:27.864
<v Speaker 4>But they're all kind of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how strong the differences between </v>

3863
02:53:30.991 --> 02:53:31.824
<v Speaker 4>an octopus that can get out of the hole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the size of a quarter squeezes whole </v>

3864
02:53:35.161 --> 02:53:40.161
<v Speaker 4>body through and that thing that slammed</v>
<v Speaker 4>his head into one of the other competing</v>

3865
02:53:41.210 --> 02:53:45.540
<v Speaker 4>man's raises up on his back legs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>come crashing for it.</v>

3866
02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:47.640
<v Speaker 4>And if they don't even budge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3867
02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:49.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they collide with each other.</v>

3868
02:53:49.951 --> 02:53:52.470
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a gun went off and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>just stare at each other.</v>

3869
02:53:52.520 --> 02:53:56.220
<v Speaker 4>They're like such a cool animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have giant nuts.</v>

3870
02:53:56.340 --> 02:53:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Huge that this is based on firsthand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3871
02:53:59.700 --> 02:54:00.533
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was pointed out to being by this guy </v>

3872
02:54:02.191 --> 02:54:03.024
<v Speaker 4>steve rinella.</v>

3873
02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:04.250
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3874
02:54:04.260 --> 02:54:04.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

3875
02:54:04.881 --> 02:54:07.060
<v Speaker 2>you think I don't see a lot of dick's </v>
<v Speaker 2>day to day.</v>

3876
02:54:07.570 --> 02:54:11.290
<v Speaker 2>You see so many dicks like on animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dogs.</v>

3877
02:54:11.320 --> 02:54:12.610
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3878
02:54:12.730 --> 02:54:15.580
<v Speaker 2>And we are fine with animal dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

3879
02:54:15.640 --> 02:54:16.810
<v Speaker 2>But human dx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are.</v>

3880
02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:20.740
<v Speaker 2>We have laws about hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we are living in a,</v>

3881
02:54:20.830 --> 02:54:24.070
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a playground of fucking animal cock.</v>

3882
02:54:24.330 --> 02:54:25.230
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I think,</v>

3883
02:54:25.290 --> 02:54:28.860
<v Speaker 4>I think people are supposed to live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3884
02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:32.190
<v Speaker 4>I think like naturally like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we're inclined to live.</v>

3885
02:54:32.220 --> 02:54:33.053
<v Speaker 4>We're inclined to live in a place where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need to do anything as far as </v>

3886
02:54:34.981 --> 02:54:35.814
<v Speaker 4>clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go back to like the people that </v>

3887
02:54:37.501 --> 02:54:38.334
<v Speaker 4>are the indigenous people in the amazon </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are chilling and drinking iowasca </v>

3888
02:54:41.671 --> 02:54:44.100
<v Speaker 4>and going fishing and growing their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables,</v>

3889
02:54:44.340 --> 02:54:46.430
<v Speaker 4>they're basically naked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3890
02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:48.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably been like that forever.</v>

3891
02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:52.560
<v Speaker 4>They're walking around barefoot when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think as soon as you put on clothes,</v>

3892
02:54:53.340 --> 02:54:56.880
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you can manipulate your </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment and live in a spot where you</v>

3893
02:54:56.881 --> 02:54:58.460
<v Speaker 4>normally wouldn't be able to live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you figure</v>

3894
02:54:59.260 --> 02:55:01.040
<v Speaker 2>say phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3895
02:55:01.041 --> 02:55:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

3896
02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:04.160
<v Speaker 2>My friend</v>

3897
02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:07.340
<v Speaker 4>mike goldberg lives out there and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>likes it.</v>

3898
02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:09.490
<v Speaker 4>He just goes from one air conditioned </v>
<v Speaker 4>room,</v>

3899
02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:13.670
<v Speaker 4>another air conditioner room workout in </v>
<v Speaker 4>an air conditioned gym.</v>

3900
02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:17.510
<v Speaker 4>Go home to an air conditioner in America</v>
<v Speaker 4>are either way too,</v>

3901
02:55:17.540 --> 02:55:20.930
<v Speaker 4>like how did you put up with this cold </v>
<v Speaker 4>or how do you put up with this heat?</v>

3902
02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:22.273
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that could adversely affect </v>
<v Speaker 4>your health if you're only breathing in </v>

3903
02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:26.230
<v Speaker 4>air conditioned air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3904
02:55:26.330 --> 02:55:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3905
02:55:28.251 --> 02:55:29.450
<v Speaker 1>like mortality rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3906
02:55:29.451 --> 02:55:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not though,</v>

3907
02:55:31.190 --> 02:55:36.190
<v Speaker 1>because the old people go to Florida and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go to it.</v>

3908
02:55:36.591 --> 02:55:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thrive.</v>

3909
02:55:37.700 --> 02:55:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It seems to put a couple of years on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3910
02:55:39.470 --> 02:55:40.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think struggling with your </v>

3911
02:55:41.721 --> 02:55:42.554
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3912
02:55:43.260 --> 02:55:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3913
02:55:44.391 --> 02:55:48.560
<v Speaker 1>People are less likely to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can fuck with heat.</v>

3914
02:55:48.561 --> 02:55:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I could take phoenix way over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Minnesota.</v>

3915
02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people feel that way.</v>

3916
02:55:52.601 --> 02:55:53.790
<v Speaker 4>The like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3917
02:55:54.090 --> 02:55:56.980
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the negative aspects of heat is you just</v>

3918
02:55:56.981 --> 02:55:57.814
<v Speaker 4>have to turn the air conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The negative aspects of that cold is </v>

3919
02:56:00.451 --> 02:56:01.660
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing's happening.</v>

3920
02:56:01.661 --> 02:56:04.410
<v Speaker 4>You might get shut down the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>power michael out.</v>

3921
02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:06.270
<v Speaker 4>You might have to light your couch on </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>

3922
02:56:06.290 --> 02:56:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3923
02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:10.440
<v Speaker 4>Whereas I feel like I could withstand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3924
02:56:10.780 --> 02:56:14.660
<v Speaker 4>130 degrees if I had water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3925
02:56:14.980 --> 02:56:16.170
<v Speaker 4>Like here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's all the.</v>

3926
02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:17.013
<v Speaker 4>You would have to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to have two things happen at </v>

3927
02:56:18.071 --> 02:56:18.904
<v Speaker 4>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A pandemic epidemic as far as like a </v>

3928
02:56:21.071 --> 02:56:21.904
<v Speaker 4>disease and power going out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to have those two things </v>

3929
02:56:24.611 --> 02:56:28.330
<v Speaker 4>happen in the winter and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that are supposed to turn the</v>

3930
02:56:28.331 --> 02:56:29.980
<v Speaker 4>power back on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to go to work.</v>

3931
02:56:30.060 --> 02:56:30.893
<v Speaker 4>There's just some kind of an evil flu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get near people and they Sneeze </v>

3932
02:56:34.180 --> 02:56:35.770
<v Speaker 4>on you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be dead within 24 hours.</v>

3933
02:56:35.771 --> 02:56:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Like that's all possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can happen.</v>

3934
02:56:38.830 --> 02:56:39.663
<v Speaker 4>And if that does happen and the power </v>
<v Speaker 4>grid stays down duRing the winter in </v>

3935
02:56:43.301 --> 02:56:44.134
<v Speaker 4>someplace and they can't figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get people to go out there and fix </v>

3936
02:56:46.601 --> 02:56:47.434
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

3937
02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:49.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas what's the,</v>

3938
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.943
<v Speaker 1>you look up the stats on heat hot when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air conditioning doesn't work after </v>

3939
02:56:55.350 --> 02:56:57.970
<v Speaker 1>it's $500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

3940
02:56:58.670 --> 02:57:00.260
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're 100 percent right.</v>

3941
02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:04.160
<v Speaker 4>But you can take your shirt off his </v>
<v Speaker 4>shade.</v>

3942
02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:08.000
<v Speaker 4>You can lay in the pool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweat,</v>

3943
02:57:08.250 --> 02:57:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural thing.</v>

3944
02:57:10.380 --> 02:57:13.770
<v Speaker 1>There's negative known natural defenses </v>
<v Speaker 1>against cold selling.</v>

3945
02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:14.663
<v Speaker 1>Pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

3946
02:57:15.290 --> 02:57:16.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sound like jamie.</v>

3947
02:57:16.650 --> 02:57:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Sound like a no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through a week with a no power in</v>

3948
02:57:20.701 --> 02:57:23.490
<v Speaker 1>the middle of an ice storm and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>survived it.</v>

3949
02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:25.890
<v Speaker 1>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put on layers and get warm.</v>

3950
02:57:26.220 --> 02:57:27.053
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can start a fire if you want to get </v>

3951
02:57:28.801 --> 02:57:32.230
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get cold when it's 100.</v>

3952
02:57:32.550 --> 02:57:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My buddy has an argument.</v>

3953
02:57:34.620 --> 02:57:36.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense,</v>

3954
02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:39.110
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind super duper hotness though.</v>

3955
02:57:39.390 --> 02:57:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I just don't mind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

3956
02:57:40.530 --> 02:57:42.740
<v Speaker 1>my body likes it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3957
02:57:43.340 --> 02:57:45.620
<v Speaker 4>Well I think everybody's body is </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly different.</v>

3958
02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:46.541
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3959
02:57:46.541 --> 02:57:48.080
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3960
02:57:48.081 --> 02:57:51.270
<v Speaker 4>if they believe that there's certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that have diets that um,</v>

3961
02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:55.040
<v Speaker 4>would better suit them because their </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestors came from certain parts of the</v>

3962
02:57:55.041 --> 02:57:56.450
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's the theory.</v>

3963
02:57:56.930 --> 02:57:57.763
<v Speaker 4>I think that that kind of makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people would have a different </v>

3964
02:58:01.140 --> 02:58:02.970
<v Speaker 4>temperature requirements as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3965
02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.850
<v Speaker 4>what makes them feel like it works?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3966
02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:10.050
<v Speaker 4>I think it stands to reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I don't have good circulation.</v>

3967
02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:14.040
<v Speaker 4>I just think that people in being able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to manipulate the environment the way we</v>

3968
02:58:14.041 --> 02:58:15.620
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will.</v>

3969
02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:18.990
<v Speaker 4>There's too many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We couldn't stay in all the good spots.</v>

3970
02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:21.450
<v Speaker 4>We can't all just live in which I live </v>
<v Speaker 4>in san diego.</v>

3971
02:58:21.451 --> 02:58:22.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3972
02:58:22.530 --> 02:58:24.120
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't even really want to live in</v>

3973
02:58:24.121 --> 02:58:27.480
<v Speaker 4>san diego and it's there now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sandra was here.</v>

3974
02:58:27.750 --> 02:58:29.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But san diego is amazing.</v>

3975
02:58:29.310 --> 02:58:30.090
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that's.</v>

3976
02:58:30.090 --> 02:58:30.923
<v Speaker 4>But they still are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's perfect climate and people are </v>

3977
02:58:32.521 --> 02:58:33.354
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3978
02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:35.610
<v Speaker 4>I would even say san diego's not warm </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough for me.</v>

3979
02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like la heat.</v>

02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:39.113
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3981

<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of cool people in san </v>

3982
02:58:41.461 --> 02:58:42.294

3983
02:58:43.711 --> 02:58:45.300
<v Speaker 4>people in san diego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a.</v>

3984
02:58:45.810 --> 02:58:50.430
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting combination between </v>
<v Speaker 4>like military and like surfers.</v>

3985
02:58:50.431 --> 02:58:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They always have this like weird </v>

4022
03:00:13.621 --> 03:00:15.690
<v Speaker 4>adversarial relationship with club </v>
<v Speaker 4>owners.</v>

4023
03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:17.100
<v Speaker 4>But I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

4024
03:00:17.610 --> 03:00:18.443
<v Speaker 4>nobody's perfect here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if it wasn't for these people that </v>

4025
03:00:20.521 --> 03:00:23.350
<v Speaker 4>are willing to open a comedy club,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy assholes,</v>

4026
03:00:23.370 --> 03:00:25.260
<v Speaker 4>like you and me wouldn't have any place </v>
<v Speaker 4>to work,</v>

4027
03:00:25.530 --> 03:00:27.600
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to make our own club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4028
03:00:27.870 --> 03:00:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Like gods like that are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like bob fisher was the ice house.</v>

4029
03:00:31.330 --> 03:00:34.740
<v Speaker 4>like he's such a sweetheart of a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it it,</v>

4030
03:00:34.910 --> 03:00:39.910
<v Speaker 4>like it doesn't just benefit you to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it because it's a good thing financially</v>

4031
03:00:40.231 --> 03:00:42.480
<v Speaker 4>to help him and help that club,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

4032
03:00:42.570 --> 03:00:44.850
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need people like that,</v>

4033
03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:46.800
<v Speaker 4>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way we ever get to work.</v>

4034
03:00:47.370 --> 03:00:52.230
<v Speaker 4>Same with comedy and magic club.</v>

4036
03:00:54.970 --> 03:00:58.200
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the nicest people that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever walked the face of this planet.</v>

4037
03:00:58.250 --> 03:00:59.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

4043
03:01:09.100 --> 03:01:09.933
<v Speaker 3>He really has and he continues to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of underprivileged children </v>

4044

<v Speaker 3>like it's.</v>

4049
03:01:26.410 --> 03:01:27.243
<v Speaker 3>But there's something that happens when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people I think definitely happens when </v>

4050
03:01:31.241 --> 03:01:35.440
<v Speaker 3>you don't get the respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that you deserve early on</v>

4051
03:01:36.370 --> 03:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>comics club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4052
03:01:38.091 --> 03:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>But that was the offers are pretty like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4053
03:01:40.910 --> 03:01:41.743
<v Speaker 1>1500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really shitty sometimes and then </v>

4054
03:01:44.481 --> 03:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>they go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you haven't done anything.</v>

4055
03:01:46.540 --> 03:01:49.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like the negotiation thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to forget that shit.</v>

4056
03:01:49.730 --> 03:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it does become this thing of like it</v>

4057
03:01:52.311 --> 03:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>forces you as a comic to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4058
03:01:54.981 --> 03:01:58.700
<v Speaker 1>when I get the chance to fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get fucked.</v>

4059
03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking me now.</v>

4060
03:02:00.831 --> 03:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And they do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they fucked pretty much everyone</v>

4061
03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:04.513
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the developed this connection in their </v>

4062
03:02:06.711 --> 03:02:09.290
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The club owners that all the club owners</v>

4063
03:02:09.291 --> 03:02:11.560
<v Speaker 3>are adversarial with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4064
03:02:11.570 --> 03:02:12.420
<v Speaker 3>With you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4065
03:02:12.430 --> 03:02:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all your advocacy.</v>

4066
03:02:14.410 --> 03:02:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This year,</v>

4067
03:02:15.890 --> 03:02:16.830
<v Speaker 3>the comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

4068
03:02:16.850 --> 03:02:18.220
<v Speaker 3>the club owners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to fuck you.</v>

4069
03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:19.820
<v Speaker 3>They're all pieces of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4070
03:02:19.821 --> 03:02:22.270
<v Speaker 3>You should give you your fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be happier there.</v>

4071
03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:24.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opposite sides of the aisle.</v>

4072
03:02:24.620 --> 03:02:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

4073
03:02:26.300 --> 03:02:29.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like the weirdest relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if,</v>

4074
03:02:29.230 --> 03:02:31.400
<v Speaker 3>if there was no comedy clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude we do,</v>

4075
03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:35.090
<v Speaker 3>we will be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so lucky that those goddamn things</v>

4076
03:02:35.091 --> 03:02:37.040
<v Speaker 3>exploded in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4077
03:02:37.810 --> 03:02:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Like when I think about like the lenny </v>
<v Speaker 3>bruce days,</v>

4078
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:42.720
<v Speaker 3>when he first started out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to have to mc.</v>

4079
03:02:42.721 --> 03:02:43.554
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

4080
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:45.830
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still have to go on,</v>

4081
03:02:45.831 --> 03:02:50.270
<v Speaker 3>you do standup inbetween strippers or </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking or something along those lines.</v>

4082
03:02:50.510 --> 03:02:52.420
<v Speaker 3>Like there was no comedy clubs like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4083
03:02:52.730 --> 03:02:55.940
<v Speaker 3>that's a really recent thing in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the last hundred years.</v>

4084
03:02:56.110 --> 03:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Well I was explaining to a buddy of mine</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

4085
03:03:01.150 --> 03:03:06.150
<v Speaker 1>how comedy has become so necessary and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's partially because of the news</v>

4086
03:03:07.490 --> 03:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>in that when the news started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every news division like lost money and,</v>

4087
03:03:12.941 --> 03:03:13.774
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to get a license you had to </v>

4088
03:03:15.191 --> 03:03:16.024
<v Speaker 1>have a good news division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the eighties they </v>

4089
03:03:17.771 --> 03:03:22.771
<v Speaker 1>deregulated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then news became a profit center for</v>

4090
03:03:23.141 --> 03:03:23.974
<v Speaker 1>networks and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good journalism basically went out </v>

4091
03:03:26.831 --> 03:03:27.664
<v Speaker 1>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So guys like John Stewart and guys like </v>

4092
03:03:31.330 --> 03:03:32.163
<v Speaker 1>Michael Moore and guys like chris rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>and guys that were like political and </v>

4093
03:03:34.391 --> 03:03:39.391
<v Speaker 1>had tv shows became almost like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>function of um,</v>

4094
03:03:40.060 --> 03:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>of news programs before this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was explaining to him,</v>

4095
03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4096
03:03:45.011 --> 03:03:45.844
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was finding someone like how </v>

4097
03:03:47.321 --> 03:03:48.154
<v Speaker 1>john came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how his rise to power and cole bear and </v>

4098
03:03:50.621 --> 03:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>all these people because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative.</v>

4099
03:03:53.410 --> 03:03:54.243
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now the internet you can get at </v>

4100
03:03:55.511 --> 03:03:59.210
<v Speaker 1>least lIke reddit or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like there's a lot of shitty websites</v>

4101
03:03:59.211 --> 03:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>with quote unquote news on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

4102
03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:04.760
<v Speaker 1>but for a long time you couldn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

4103
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>there was a vacuum of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no big objective opinion or John</v>

4104
03:04:10.010 --> 03:04:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Oliver on hbo where he'll do these deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>dives into,</v>

4105
03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:16.580
<v Speaker 1>cause no one else is going to do them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no money in them.</v>

4106
03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd rather do some sensational,</v>

4107
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:20.983
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the dumbest thing that the most </v>

4108
03:04:22.461 --> 03:04:24.300
<v Speaker 1>recent dumping trumps that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4109
03:04:24.470 --> 03:04:28.760
<v Speaker 1>and there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a premium on,</v>

4110
03:04:28.830 --> 03:04:32.420
<v Speaker 1>on objective truth or at least subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>funnily subjective truth.</v>

4111
03:04:35.470 --> 03:04:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Joe rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your thoughts.</v>

4112
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:39.640
<v Speaker 3>This is a weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So weird time when it comes to,</v>

4113
03:04:39.641 --> 03:04:44.641
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to dis disassemble the way we've,</v>

4114
03:04:46.390 --> 03:04:50.080
<v Speaker 3>we've got this bizarre system set up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way we've got it structured.</v>

4115
03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:52.160
<v Speaker 3>like we're getting older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4116
03:04:52.540 --> 03:04:53.850
<v Speaker 3>and as we get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we realized,</v>

4117
03:04:53.851 --> 03:04:54.684
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to pass on this stupid </v>

4118
03:04:56.021 --> 03:04:58.600
<v Speaker 3>system to the people that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>next.</v>

4119
03:04:58.630 --> 03:05:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't fixed anything.</v>

4120
03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:01.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the</v>

4121
03:05:01.440 --> 03:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I almost don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to fix the shit.</v>

4122
03:05:04.690 --> 03:05:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's looking real good question.</v>

4123
03:05:07.930 --> 03:05:08.763
<v Speaker 3>But there's an entanglement problem like</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about earlier when we </v>

4124
03:05:11.881 --> 03:05:14.230
<v Speaker 3>were talking about different ways that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are making money,</v>

4125
03:05:14.920 --> 03:05:18.430
<v Speaker 3>like there's so much money to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we were talking about it in divorce</v>

4126
03:05:18.431 --> 03:05:19.264
<v Speaker 3>courts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but think about how much money there is </v>

4127
03:05:21.161 --> 03:05:21.994
<v Speaker 3>to be made in keeping this system of </v>
<v Speaker 3>government exactly the same way it is </v>

4128
03:05:24.761 --> 03:05:25.594
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4129
03:05:25.780 --> 03:05:27.820
<v Speaker 3>There's so many jobs that are dependent </v>
<v Speaker 3>upon it.</v>

4130
03:05:28.090 --> 03:05:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Like even if we think that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous idea,</v>

4131
03:05:30.641 --> 03:05:32.770
<v Speaker 3>we need to abolish the whole thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>start from scratch.</v>

4132
03:05:32.950 --> 03:05:35.020
<v Speaker 3>What do we do with all those people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are working for it?</v>

4133
03:05:35.220 --> 03:05:36.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I was thinking is </v>

4134
03:05:36.500 --> 03:05:37.333
<v Speaker 1>there's people like the thing that I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>like about the trump movement is people </v>

4135
03:05:39.971 --> 03:05:44.971
<v Speaker 1>could just go and like know the system's</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken and it doesn't work for it.</v>

4136
03:05:45.151 --> 03:05:45.984
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't Work for people anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is bought and paid for </v>

4137
03:05:48.570 --> 03:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>everybody in congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lobbying is,</v>

4138
03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:52.890
<v Speaker 1>pays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally lobbyists,</v>

4139
03:05:52.891 --> 03:05:54.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laws,</v>

4140
03:05:54.270 --> 03:05:57.180
<v Speaker 1>so people and people don't like it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how to stop it.</v>

4141
03:05:57.230 --> 03:05:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got people.</v>

4142
03:05:59.400 --> 03:06:00.750
<v Speaker 1>I've got a system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>

4143
03:06:00.990 --> 03:06:01.823
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know anyone that you think would </v>

4144
03:06:03.571 --> 03:06:05.160
<v Speaker 1>run for office?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4145
03:06:05.250 --> 03:06:06.083
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as much as it's like because it's a </v>

4146
03:06:08.041 --> 03:06:10.980
<v Speaker 1>weird job into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anyone who's just like that</v>

4147
03:06:10.981 --> 03:06:15.030
<v Speaker 1>ideologically driven and could navigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it is now.</v>

4148
03:06:15.031 --> 03:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>So as much as I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're going to change.</v>

4149
03:06:16.800 --> 03:06:18.990
<v Speaker 1>We're going to shake the system up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4150
03:06:19.270 --> 03:06:22.060
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just that stop and think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what it is.</v>

4151
03:06:22.061 --> 03:06:27.061
<v Speaker 3>It's like to elect a leader for someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>to campaign and tell you that they would</v>

4152
03:06:28.691 --> 03:06:31.840
<v Speaker 3>make the best leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all throughout history,</v>

4153
03:06:31.841 --> 03:06:32.674
<v Speaker 3>the people that are proclaiming </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves to be the ones that you </v>

4154
03:06:35.981 --> 03:06:38.790
<v Speaker 3>should follow are almost always the ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should never fall.</v>

4155
03:06:38.800 --> 03:06:39.633
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when someone is proclaiming </v>

4156
03:06:41.231 --> 03:06:42.064
<v Speaker 3>themselves to be capable of leading this</v>
<v Speaker 3>land and I am going to be your king and </v>

4157
03:06:45.671 --> 03:06:48.100
<v Speaker 3>I will take you to the highest heights.</v>

4158
03:06:49.230 --> 03:06:50.063
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't even think I needed to do </v>

4159
03:06:51.231 --> 03:06:51.900
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4160
03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chance to do that,</v>

4161
03:06:53.481 --> 03:06:54.860
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to kill the king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be the.</v>

4162
03:06:55.640 --> 03:06:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4163
03:06:56.340 --> 03:06:59.520
<v Speaker 3>But this is essentially the same model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4164
03:06:59.550 --> 03:07:01.080
<v Speaker 3>That they're doing when they're running </v>
<v Speaker 3>for president,</v>

4165
03:07:01.081 --> 03:07:04.890
<v Speaker 3>even though we know that that's not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of personality trait that you would</v>

4166
03:07:04.891 --> 03:07:05.724
<v Speaker 3>want from a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would want someone who's who's not </v>

4167
03:07:10.291 --> 03:07:13.050
<v Speaker 3>in any way promoting of themselves.</v>

4168
03:07:13.650 --> 03:07:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A selfless,</v>

4169
03:07:15.490 --> 03:07:20.490
<v Speaker 2>selfless person who does this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's incredibly a self interested</v>

4170
03:07:20.730 --> 03:07:25.530
<v Speaker 3>and they would have to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have fairly monitor this.</v>

4171
03:07:25.660 --> 03:07:29.250
<v Speaker 3>The society that we live in had a fairly</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

4172
03:07:29.300 --> 03:07:31.140
<v Speaker 3>When do you decide when you put people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in jail,</v>

4173
03:07:31.320 --> 03:07:32.153
<v Speaker 3>when do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we throw all the old rules out and </v>

4174
03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:37.350
<v Speaker 3>completely look at them all with new </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts and new ideas?</v>

4175
03:07:37.610 --> 03:07:38.443
<v Speaker 3>Did we just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it like there's a lot of weird drug </v>

4176
03:07:40.411 --> 03:07:41.244
<v Speaker 3>arguments where there's certain drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are illegal that are way more </v>

4177
03:07:43.471 --> 03:07:44.304
<v Speaker 3>dangerous in certain drugs that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal and then you look at this money </v>

4178
03:07:46.891 --> 03:07:48.450
<v Speaker 3>trail behind all that and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4179
03:07:48.451 --> 03:07:51.450
<v Speaker 3>how can you guys still do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how can you still do this?</v>

4180
03:07:51.570 --> 03:07:52.403
<v Speaker 3>Like let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should make things legal that the </v>

4181
03:07:55.021 --> 03:07:58.770
<v Speaker 3>scientists agree should be legal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then everything else is dangerous.</v>

4182
03:07:58.771 --> 03:08:03.771
<v Speaker 3>we should figure out how to regulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't decide like why?</v>

4183
03:08:03.840 --> 03:08:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Why is everybody deciding based on like </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient information?</v>

4184
03:08:07.640 --> 03:08:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

4185
03:08:08.691 --> 03:08:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Socratically elected government and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the p again,</v>

4186
03:08:11.631 --> 03:08:14.370
<v Speaker 2>it attracts the wrong kinds of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

4187
03:08:14.430 --> 03:08:16.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like churchill or somebody said </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

4188
03:08:17.420 --> 03:08:21.050
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the best of all the bad systems.</v>

4189
03:08:21.170 --> 03:08:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

4190
03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Obama released a or exonerated a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of drug war victims today,</v>

4191
03:08:30.020 --> 03:08:32.930
<v Speaker 2>which I thought it was fascinating thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a few hundred.</v>

4192
03:08:33.020 --> 03:08:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like 300,</v>

4193
03:08:34.641 --> 03:08:35.550
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4194
03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Which is what I hope he said don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fuck up,</v>

4195
03:08:40.970 --> 03:08:41.803
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the poets who knows what kind </v>

4196
03:08:45.351 --> 03:08:49.640
<v Speaker 2>of damage is done for time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy can't vote,</v>

4197
03:08:50.320 --> 03:08:52.610
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get most jobs.</v>

4198
03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:53.760
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4199
03:08:54.680 --> 03:08:55.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a very,</v>

4200
03:08:55.731 --> 03:08:58.550
<v Speaker 2>very fucked up system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>

4201
03:08:58.710 --> 03:08:59.543
<v Speaker 2>Are you an ex felon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the president you have to clean out </v>

4202
03:09:03.710 --> 03:09:05.450
<v Speaker 2>of you're exonerated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4203
03:09:05.570 --> 03:09:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Does that make you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You've been touched by magic.</v>

4206
03:09:11.300 --> 03:09:12.133
<v Speaker 2>The president has magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can tell the court that they have to </v>

4207
03:09:15.501 --> 03:09:17.220
<v Speaker 2>let people out of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
