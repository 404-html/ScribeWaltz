<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whiskey or vodka on his show on that show.</v>

36
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to hide it.</v>

37
00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Or $1 million per show.</v>

45
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how other people reacting to them.</v>

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>No one actually ever in Charlie's.</v>

49
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>She ain't got in a Twitter war and it was like,</v>

50
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.941
<v Speaker 1>I wish I,</v>

51
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I could live like Charlie Sheen,</v>

53
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>but then my wife would leave me and I don't want to be alone and miserable like</v>

<v Speaker 1>Roger Ebert to loan.</v>

59
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:25.904
<v Speaker 1>You've got all this.</v>

60
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Why is Roger Ebert even talking like that about Charlie Sheen that I could live</v>

61
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

62
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.041
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

63
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

64
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.031
<v Speaker 1>no you couldn't.</v>

65
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:33.811
<v Speaker 1>You can't even talk.</v>

66
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a tongue anymore.</v>

67
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

68
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.521
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

69
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:36.061
<v Speaker 1>Roger Ebert,</v>

70
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:36.894
<v Speaker 1>Hud's mouth cancers.</v>

71
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.480
<v Speaker 1>John isn't working where you would think that would be the,</v>

72
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>the least of his worries would be what Charlie Sheen is doing.</v>

73
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

74
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>That's so bizarre.</v>

75
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>That would even comment on that.</v>

76
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And then Charlie Sheen responded back and was something about,</v>

77
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you've never had five girls at a time winning,</v>

79
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>winning,</v>

80
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.033
<v Speaker 1>earn it.</v>

81
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Five girls at a time plan better.</v>

82
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not 11 is it?</v>

83
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.931
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

84
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a lot.</v>

85
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Mostly</v>

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 2>he must be like really lazy because if you are having sex with that many people</v>

87
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of stay still and let it like come around.</v>

88
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.480
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine told me about when he first started making money and uh,</v>

89
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.090

00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>same time and he laid in bed and just see her man.</v>

91
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.301
<v Speaker 1>Oops.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I almost did his voice.</v>

93
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.213
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

94
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>you haven't lived until you've had all these women like tongs just licking your</v>

95
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:26.184
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

104
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine like the middle part also that seems awesome.</v>

105
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.060

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Greg,</v>

149
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.403
<v Speaker 1>Geraldo,</v>

150
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>your immune system goes down.</v>

152
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.351
<v Speaker 1>He went into a coma,</v>

153
00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:07.730
<v Speaker 1>then he got pneumonia and die.</v>

154
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Really pneumonia is because a lot of fucking people,</v>

155
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.710
<v Speaker 1>people get aids.</v>

156
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It's an acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</v>

157
00:04:15.561 --> 00:04:18.320
<v Speaker 1>It's your immune system goes away and they usually die from pneumonia.</v>

158
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.251
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

159
00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

160
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.960
<v Speaker 1>you're not dying from AIDS.</v>

161
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.500
<v Speaker 1>You get aids and then you die from the mode.</v>

162
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just telling you I'm not,</v>

163
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't plan on drinking again.</v>

164
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Well you say quite a while,</v>

165
00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>you leave the door open though.</v>

166
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.270
<v Speaker 1>You know you were,</v>

167
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

168
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.560
<v Speaker 1>you're leaving the door open.</v>

169
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.840
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

170
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.600
<v Speaker 1>this is what I just don't want to lie to myself.</v>

171
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

172
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.771
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

173
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:37.521
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to,</v>

174
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:39.440
<v Speaker 1>you can promise yourself and then keep a promise.</v>

175
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.160

183
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>she was sober for a long time.</v>

229
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.270
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be,</v>

230
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.690
<v Speaker 4>it's already packed inside and uh,</v>

231
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.420
<v Speaker 4>it's incredible when you get to go out in front of Joe's audience because it's</v>

232
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 4>real comedy fans and uh,</v>

233
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.163
<v Speaker 4>it's exciting.</v>

234
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.723
<v Speaker 1>You got a gun.</v>

235
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.350
<v Speaker 1>We almost lost everything their folks.</v>

236
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

237
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>it fell but only a small camera light.</v>

238
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is that you're sitting here?</v>

239
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like 10 to 10 buck on stage.</v>

240
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll mash bills onstage right now.</v>

241
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.080
<v Speaker 1>This is the world famous comedy and Magic Club,</v>

242
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.861
<v Speaker 1>the most of the beach,</v>

243
00:06:41.861 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

244
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.910
<v Speaker 1>So one of the most historic comedy clubs in the country.</v>

245
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.990
<v Speaker 1>There's this writing on this wall from 1978 and look at that.</v>

246
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.220
<v Speaker 1>That's like the earliest,</v>

247
00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:52.900
<v Speaker 1>I think people have found a 78.</v>

248
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Speaker 1>This is like a real classic,</v>

249
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Classic Comedy Club.</v>

250
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno comes here every Sunday and works is monologues ash.</v>

251
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.410
<v Speaker 1>And we're just sitting here freaking out at about how crazy it is that,</v>

252
00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:11.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

253
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.260
<v Speaker 1>we've done almost a hundred fucking podcast.</v>

254
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.970
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bizarre.</v>

255
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.013
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it mean,</v>

256
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.460
<v Speaker 1>is that crazy?</v>

257
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

258
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.143
<v Speaker 5>that's a lot of,</v>

259
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 5>if you think about that's times two hours mostly.</v>

260
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

261
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 5>How many hours?</v>

262
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.890
<v Speaker 6>I think what we try to do on the podcast is we all,</v>

263
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.910
<v Speaker 6>we're all trying to have fun.</v>

264
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.690
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

265
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 6>we're all hanging out together.</v>

266
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.190
<v Speaker 6>We're all talking about cool and interesting shit and we're trying to have fun.</v>

267
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.310
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's what a lot of fucking people are missing in their life.</v>

268
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.760
<v Speaker 6>They're missing fun and they're missing cool people to hang out with.</v>

269
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.241
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

270
00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:46.800
<v Speaker 6>where everybody is enjoying each other's company,</v>

271
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

272
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.181
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

273
00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:48.570
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

274
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.670
<v Speaker 6>that's not present in everybody's life.</v>

275
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.770
<v Speaker 6>And with the podcast it's sorta allows them to be on it there,</v>

276
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

277
00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.200
<v Speaker 6>they can hang out and have these cool two hour conversations with us.</v>

278
00:08:01.201 --> 00:08:02.340
<v Speaker 6>They can't talk back,</v>

279
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.890
<v Speaker 6>but they can be there for like a real conversation.</v>

280
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.930
<v Speaker 6>Not just wow,</v>

281
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:06.870
<v Speaker 6>just a show.</v>

282
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.030
<v Speaker 6>But really how you'd think about things.</v>

283
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:09.301
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

284
00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:10.320
<v Speaker 6>How I think about things.</v>

285
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.741
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>

286
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:11.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

287
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it's weird like when me and Pete Johansen,</v>

288
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.920
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

289
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.850
<v Speaker 6>we don't agree at all and sometimes it's weird like Andy Dick,</v>

290
00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:19.830
<v Speaker 6>he's trying to fuck me or you know,</v>

291
00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:23.020
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it's weird where like when we're talking to Adana Delmont Dana,</v>

292
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.060
<v Speaker 6>Dana Hermanns stories,</v>

293
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.680
<v Speaker 6>strangest fuck man.</v>

294
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.870
<v Speaker 6>She seems like this really cool normal check,</v>

295
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.471
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

296
00:08:28.471 --> 00:08:30.390
<v Speaker 6>And she's this crazy porn star,</v>

297
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.010
<v Speaker 6>but she's like really funny too.</v>

298
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.881
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

299
00:08:32.881 --> 00:08:34.410
<v Speaker 6>it's a fascinating gig.</v>

300
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

301
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.080
<v Speaker 6>I'm so glad that we started doing this.</v>

302
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:37.681
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

303
00:08:37.681 --> 00:08:39.210
<v Speaker 6>we've been doing it over a year now,</v>

304
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.140
<v Speaker 6>just over a year.</v>

305
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.363
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

306
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.110
<v Speaker 6>it just started off as a goof,</v>

307
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

308
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.383
<v Speaker 6>Remember?</v>

309
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

310
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 5>we did.</v>

311
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

312
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.370
<v Speaker 5>the idea I think was when I,</v>

313
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.350
<v Speaker 5>we were always trying to do the Justin TV thing.</v>

314
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 5>I like doing like a weekly video,</v>

315
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 5>like live from the green while we're on the road and stuff.</v>

316
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.743
<v Speaker 5>And then we've,</v>

317
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 5>I was always trying to like push for that video thing.</v>

318
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 5>So I think it started off when we've,</v>

319
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 5>we didn't even think podcasts at first.</v>

320
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 5>We were thinking of doing like a,</v>

321
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 5>like a video show once a week and Kumina inspired me.</v>

322
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

323
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 5>Does that live at the compound?</v>

324
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.333
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

325
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 6>There's so many fun guys that are smart.</v>

326
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.400
<v Speaker 6>I know when you get guys like Dunkin and Brian Cowen and Eddie,</v>

327
00:09:16.401 --> 00:09:17.470
<v Speaker 6>aft and Ari,</v>

328
00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 6>and there's so many dudes that would have interesting opinions on so many</v>

329
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 6>different subjects.</v>

330
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 6>I sent the luckiest thing about the podcast is that we get to have regular</v>

331
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:30.530
<v Speaker 6>conversations with all these cool motherfuckers.</v>

332
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.373

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 5>and like three other comics and the bikini girls don't show up.</v>

438
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.500
<v Speaker 5>So all these Latino dudes and oversized white tee shirts with video cameras are</v>

439
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 5>standing there waiting for this bikini contest.</v>

440
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.951
<v Speaker 5>It never happens.</v>

441
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:18.371
<v Speaker 5>And they say,</v>

442
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:18.521
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

443
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 5>now instead of the Bikini contest,</v>

444
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:21.080
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna have the Comedians,</v>

445
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 5>every moon walk away.</v>

446
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:26.290
<v Speaker 5>And then the crowd does for us to go.</v>

447
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:26.831
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

448
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

449
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 5>I look out in the middle of the audience as I'm starting up,</v>

450
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.050
<v Speaker 5>and there's a little boy holding his parents' hands,</v>

451
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

452
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.291
<v Speaker 5>just going like this,</v>

453
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:35.891
<v Speaker 5>looking at me,</v>

454
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:36.760
<v Speaker 5>flipping me off.</v>

455
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 5>You just holding it,</v>

456
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 5>not even moving.</v>

457
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.110
<v Speaker 5>He didn't flinch it off.</v>

458
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 5>You just held it my entire sec.</v>

459
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.730
<v Speaker 5>I just looked at me and that's all I could think about is this kid.</v>

460
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 5>And so as I was doing,</v>

461
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:48.911
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

462
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:49.210
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

463
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 5>this is horrible.</v>

464
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 5>So anytime I go up and I don't see anybody paying attention,</v>

465
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:54.931
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

466
00:12:54.931 --> 00:12:56.550

467
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

468
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.260
<v Speaker 5>I just think of that little kid blew me off.</v>

469
00:12:59.290 --> 00:12:59.561
